We will deal first with category A correspondence.  No. 449A is briefing documents dated 28 April from Bord na gCon in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 450A (i) to (iv) is briefing documents dated 28 April from the Garda Commissioner's office in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 452A is opening statements dated 2 May from Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, interim chief executive officer, Bord na gCon, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Correspondence, No. 457A, which is the opening statement from the Garda Commissioner, was only received late yesterday afternoon.  I hope everybody has had an opportunity to review it.</p> <p>  We will now move to category B correspondence, which is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow ups to previous meetings.  No. 431B (i) and (ii) and 437B are correspondence dated 18 April and 20 April from Professor Don Barry, president of the University of Limerick, providing follow up information subsequent to UL's appearance before the committee regarding sabbaticals and money paid to Revenue, a breakdown of non-Irish students, a note on the number of facilitators employed and on complaints giving rise to reports and-or settlements.  Also included are details on gender breakdown among staff.  Is it agreed to note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed.  There are a number of follow-up items in the correspondence today on our engagement with the third level sector.  It may be appropriate to set aside some time, possibly on 18 May, to discuss further how the committee might wish to proceed.  Given the volume of correspondence, it would take up a good proportion of this meeting if we were to go through it today.  Is it agreed to set aside time on 18 May to deal with that correspondence?</p></speech>

Is that agreed?</p></speech>

There is a great deal of correspondence to be dealt with but there were key themes that we all had agreed on that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

As I said, the volume of correspondence we have received will require a significant amount of time to deal with.  We should not try to deal piecemeal with it now.</p> <p>  No. 435B (i) to (vii) is correspondence dated 13 April from Professor Patrick O Shea, president of University College Cork providing follow-up information subsequent to UCC&rsquo;s appearance before the committee.  Topics covered include intellectual property policy, acquisition of Irish Management Institute, staff travel costs, student financial supports and legal costs, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 436B (i) to (ii) is correspondence dated 21 April from Ms Ann Campbell, president of Dundalk Institute of Technology, providing follow-up information subsequent to DKIT&rsquo;s appearance before the committee on gender breakdown among staff, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  No. 437B (i) to (ii) is correspondence dated 20 April from Professor Don Barry, president of University of Limerick, providing follow-up Information subsequent to UL&rsquo;s appearance before the committee on gender breakdown across different parts of the college to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 438B (i) to (ii) is correspondence dated 24 AprIl 2017 from Mr. Alan Doyle of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, providing follow-up information to our meeting with the HSE and Department of Health on 9 March 2017.  A note is included on the role of the fund, how rates are determined, the appeals process and the dispute resolution process, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>   No. 444B is correspondence dated 26 April from Professor Brian Norton, president of Dublin Institute of Technology, providing follow-up information subsequent to DIT&rsquo;s appearance before the committee on the breakdown between full and part-time staff, losses incurred by DIT on library subscription service, the &euro;3 million paid to BIMM to deliver BA in commercial modern music, a note on gender breakdown and a note on the implications of a two-year delay to the Grangegorman project, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 445B (i) to (xxiii) is correspondence dated 26 April from Professor Willie Donnelly, president of Waterford Institute of Technology, providing follow-up information subsequent to WIT's appearance before the committee on gender breakdown, Company Registration Office files and a report on FeedHenry, to be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We now move to category C correspondence from or in relation to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 426C (i) to (ii) is correspondence dated 18 March 2017 from an individual regarding the best use of public money on social housing and South Dublin County Council.  Matters in relation to local authority policy decisions do not fall within the remit of the committee.  I propose we write to the individual informing her of this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Members can take note of this and raise it in another forum if they so wish.</p> <p>    No. 428C (i) to (iii) is correspondence from a firm of solicitors dated 12 April about a client who is seeking to address the committee on the Grace commission of inquiry and the standard of her care by the Health Service Executive.  While the client maintains that the issues she raises are not covered by the commission of investigation, the terms of reference state that the commission shall exercise discretion in the scope and intensity of the investigation it considers necessary and appropriate.  I think, therefore, that the best way of dealing with this, with the correspondent&rsquo;s permission, is to forward this letter with a note from the committee requesting that commission give consideration to the matters raised.  Is that agreed or do members have an alternative proposal?</p></speech>

However, as the commission can broaden its investigations, the secretariat believes this matter can be covered by it.</p><p>Is that what is being said?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00200"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

The whistleblowers in this case have been very brave by coming forward.  They have done the State and the victims of abuse a service.  If they feel they have something to offer the committee, we should show them courtesy of inviting them.  All witnesses, in terms of their appearance here, have to be treated the same as anybody else.  Whistleblowers have done so much to give us information in the first place that partly led to the commission of investigation.  We should afford them the opportunity to come before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00400"><p>My understanding is that the whistleblower disputes some of what has been put on record, which could make it easier for us to get the position.  One could cross-reference with the HSE.  There are leftovers from the previous meeting with the HSE.  We would have to make sure to narrow the focus of the meeting but I strongly favour inviting the whistleblower in in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00500"><p>One of the issues was the funding for the service providers and strong disagreement as to the level of interaction between the HSE at a local or national level and the service providers.  There is strong disagreement between the director general of the HSE and the service providers.  That is a money issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00600"><p>Absolutely.  I share the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00700"><p>We have to be careful.  I am positive about this but we have to be careful because we have received many letters asking for witnesses to appear before us disputing various issues, particularly about the universities.  That should not be the focus of the committee and, therefore, we need to look at a principle in this regard.  There are exceptions to every principle and this is a particularly savage case, which would not be captured.  We need to examine this specifically.  We should wait until we discuss this with Mr. O'Brien because he has to come back to us in respect of the issues that have been mentioned.  I raised three issues that have nothing to do with the commission of investigation, including public procurement and freedom of information.  We cannot have a situation where a witness comes in and then Mr. O'Brien-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C00800"><p>I share the Deputy's concerns.  This is delicate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C01000"><p>There are a few issues.  First, if we agree to this person coming in, given the parallel investigation by the commission, the meeting would have to be held in private session.  Second, there is a chronology.  As Deputy Connolly said, are we better to wait for Mr. O'Brien to come in and then make a decision on whether we bring in this individual afterwards?  This is also probably a need for the committee to liaise with the commission on this issue before we make a decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#C01100"><p>That is in some ways the opposite of what we need.  I have no difficulty with a meeting being held in private session.  I understand the crossover but if we are going to have the whistleblower in, the information should be provided in advance of Mr. O'Brien coming back in rather than after he has been in.</p></speech>

There is a precedent of a whistleblower coming to the committee but it was held in private.  It was in respect of Sergeant McCabe.</p></speech>

That is what this person is requesting and that is a matter for us to decide.  There are issues that will not be covered by the commission of investigation.  The services provider issues, for example, relate to finance and funding and they can, and should be, dealt with by this committee.  That is our function and for that reason, if we agree that the whistleblower should come in, it should not be a private meeting.  That would be problematic for us and the witness if we agree this.</p></speech>

Will we come back to this issue next week?  Perhaps by then we will have correspondence from Mr. O'Brien.  That would be helpful.  I will ask the clerk to the committee and his staff to liaise with Mr. O'Brien and say that we need it before next week.  In that scenario, we would be able to make a more complete decision.</p></speech>

There is other correspondence but not in respect of this issue.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 429C, dated 15 April 2017, from an individual entitled "Treason and Betrayal by Public Servants" raising matters in regard to NAMA and the Angela Kerins High Court case.  Is it agreed to note the correspondence?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 430C, 433C, 442C(i) and (ii) and 443C(i) and (ii)], dated 11 April, 19 April, 25 April and 26 April, respectively, from Shannon Protection Alliance referring to the Kennedy report on the proposed pipeline from the Shannon to Dublin.  This is a proposed project by Irish Water, which I know well, and the matter has been looked at by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  As it is not within our remit, I propose that the clerk to the committee forward the items to that committee for consideration.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 432C, dated 19 April 2017, is from an individual raising issues relating to flood defence in Cork city and the need for a cost-benefit analysis.  I propose we forward a copy of the letter with appropriate redaction to the OPW for a response.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 434C(i) and (ii) are correspondence received from the chairman of NAMA regarding the committee's report on Project Eagle.  We need to give this some consideration but as we have a busy agenda today, I propose we hold it over for a week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No.  439C is correspondence form the Courts Service dated 24 April 2017 requesting a change in our proposed meeting with it which we had scheduled for 15 June.  Is it agreed to note this and return to it when we discuss our work programme?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 440C is correspondence from an individual dated 24 April 2017 in respect of issues at Howth Harbour.  We had correspondence on this matter some months ago from the same individual.  Though not entirely clear, the matter appears to be under investigation by the Ombudsman and we should probably await the outcome of that.  I suggest we note the correspondence and ask the clerk to the committee to make contact with the individual to see if he can get the correspondent to clarify the matter raised.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 441C(i) to (iii) are correspondence dated 25 April from an individual raising concerns regarding testimony given to the committee when it met Caranua on 13 April.  The correspondent raises questions about the powers of Caranua to breach confidentiality by writing to suppliers for receipts in respect of applicants who had received services.  The person has written to the committee and made direct contact with Caranua on the matter.  It appears Caranua is suspending the practice until independent legal advice is received.  I propose that we write to Caranua and ask to be updated on the matter.  I also propose we write to the individual who has acted as a concerned citizen in this matter and brought it to our attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed </p> <p>  No. 446C is correspondence dated 26 April regarding the use of taxpayers money and the Air Corps.  This is noted.</p><p>Correspondence items 447C(i) to (ix) dated 6 March from an individual are in respect of an allegation of fraud at Teagasc.  This individual has been in contact with the committee before on this matter.  The last committee wrote to Teagasc.  The clerk is in the process of reviewing the documentation to see if there is anything further that the Committee of Public Accounts might consider, and will revert to the committee next week.  We will note the item for the moment.</p></speech>

I think the clerk has spoken to the correspondent on the phone.  If there is new evidence based on this correspondence, the clerk will make a decision and come back to us next week.  I am sorry - the clerk will make a recommendation.  The use of language here is very important.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 448C dated 28 April from the chairman of the company Flow East is in respect of NAMA and the sale of the Savarin portfolio in the Czech Republic.  The correspondent has raised a number of further items subsequent to NAMA's response to his initial letter, which we had forwarded to NAMA.  I propose that we forward this item to NAMA also for further response to the specific issues raised.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The individual also wants to meet the committee but given the work programme, I do not think that will be feasible.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 451C dated 27 April from Deputy David Cullinane, who has just stepped out, is in respect of the practice by boards to refer matters to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, rather than to make formal complaints.  We will note it as the Deputy is not here and we might return to it next week.</p> <p>  Correspondence items 453C and 454C dated 29 April and 2 May from Deputies Alan Kelly and David Cullinane are in respect of witnesses to be invited to our meeting with the Garda Commissioner this afternoon.  We will note these.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 455C dated 28 April from Deputy Cullinane is in respect of further questions for the HSE about evidence given to this committee pertaining to the Grace case.  Is it agreed to forward these questions to the HSE and to first ask the clerk to look at their phrasing in consultation with the Deputy, who is not here?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 456C dated 28 April is from Deputy Cullinane in respect of further questions for NUIG following its appearance before the committee.  Is it agreed to forward the questions to NUIG?  Agreed.</p> <p>   We will move on to statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  I am bringing them up on the screen.</p></speech>

On financial statements and accounts received, there are only four this week.  The Gathering Project 2013 is a clear audit opinion; the Dublin Regional Tourism Organisation is a clear audit opinion; and Dublin Institute of Technology is a clear audit opinion, although the audit noted that the institute made payments totalling &euro;3.4 million to 36 suppliers in the year in respect of goods and services that were not subject to competitive public procurement.  The National Gallery of Ireland was a clear audit opinion except for non-compliance with financial reporting standard No. 102 in respect of heritage assets.  The statement of financial position does not include the cost or value of heritage assets acquired since 1 January 2011.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General want to comment?</p></speech>

There is an expectation that value is put on the balance sheet in respect of any heritage assets that are acquired since 2011.  It was a change made in 2011.  The National Gallery has not gone along with that on the basis that the bulk of its stock of heritage items is not included on the balance sheet and that, effectively, it is not material relative to the stock.  I am just drawing attention to it as it is a technical non-compliance with the accounting standard.</p></speech>

We will move on to the work programme, which is coming up on the screen.  With regard to the HSE's appearance, the Chairman has suggested that we delay this meeting slightly if possible to deal with 2016 accounts, which are due for publication shortly.  We have scheduled 15 June for them and can deal with that matter on the same day.  Given the discussion we are going to have next week on the topic we discussed earlier, there are two dates free.  We also have to be cognisant that today's meeting is going to be quite comprehensive and long.  We may have to come back to one of today's items on one of those dates for an hour or two.</p></speech>

These two items are greatly important and difficult.  There is a possibility that one or both sessions could overrun.  We have votes at 12.45 p.m.  It is now 9.40 a.m.  We have to keep those other dates free so that we will be able to bring them back in for an hour or two to conclude should we run over time today.</p></speech>

There is a high possibility that we may not conclude one or both of the items and may have to return to them on one of the two dates that are available.  If we do, we do, and that is just it.

There were outstanding items relating to Caranua.  I do not know why the responses have not come in.  It is very difficult to keep up with what we asked.  There was the question of the five reports that it commissioned and the cost of the five reports.  That was the first one.  There is also a huge issue about rent.  They were about to sign an agreement in May with the money coming out of the pool, but I read with absolute horror that it amounts to &euro;0.75 million.  The Secretary General of the Department of Education assured us he was going to look at that.  Have we heard anything back?  Have they gone ahead and signed it?  The third issue is the review of Caranua.  Where are we at with that?  I am overwhelmed with correspondence - I am sure other Deputies are too - from people dissatisfied with the service.  I am not happy at all with this and I was certainly not happy with what was said on the day, but that is another day's work.  The main issue at the moment is the rent.  If they sign a lease for rent, there are huge implications for the fund.  The review and the outstanding five - I do not know why the follow-up information was not in the post the next day.</p></speech>

The difficulty outlined in respect of Caranua is one example of where an issue is raised and it appears to be the end of the matter.  Should the committee not do a report, even a short one, which provides a synopsis of the issues raised and circulate it to the relevant Accounting Officers and Ministers?  It appears that many of the Accounting Officers appear before us for a couple of hours, may or may not be chastised and then go out the door.

Thereafter, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would be required to respond to the committee's report.

It operates racing activities through 11 subsidiary companies and licenses greyhound racing at other privately owned tracks.  With effect from 2015, it has also operated catering and beverage services at its tracks.  Those services were previously outsourced.  At a previous meeting, the Chairman asked for a diagram explaining the group.  It is on screen now.  I have tried to indicate what comprises the group and the extent of my audit, which includes the head organisation and a company called Abargrove, which provides the catering services and operates the Newbridge track.  The ten other subsidiary companies operate greyhound tracks that are run by Bord na gCon.  A number of other tracks are privately owned but have received grant assistance from Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  Overall, the Bord na gCon group achieved a surplus for 2015 of &euro;438,000.  Its accumulated revenue reserves amounted to just &euro;46,000 as at the end of that year.  Bord na gCon received State funding of &euro;13.6 million in 2015, which was sourced from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  The 2015 surplus from racing activities was &euro;617,000.  This included a net profit of &euro;1.9 million from tote betting on turnover of &euro;19.6 million.  Excluding betting, track activities resulted in a net loss of &euro;1.3 million in the year.  Bord na gCon paid out &euro;6.5 million in prize money in 2015, towards which dog owners and sponsors contributed &euro;1.9 million.  General administration costs in the year amounted to &euro;9.2 million.</p> <p>  The audit report on the 2015 financial statements drew attention to note No. 24, which disclosed the basis on which the board was satisfied that it was able to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.  Some members will recall that I reported on the acquisition of land and the development of a racetrack and new corporate headquarters at Greenpark in Limerick, which was completed in 2010.  Since then, Bord na gCon has been carrying a high level of borrowing related to that development, as shown in the diagram that is now on screen.  The lighter coloured bar is the borrowing level.  In the same period, there has been a significant erosion of the group's operating surplus.  Hence, the need for the note on the going concern basis.</p></speech>

The Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, is reporting an operating profit before interest, depreciation and taxation of &euro;2.3 million for the 12 months to 31 December 2015.  The comparable figure in 2014 was &euro;700,000.  The IGB also reduced its long-standing debt by &euro;1.35 million in 2015 and has since reduced it by a further &euro;700,000.</p><p>The generation of surplus allowed the board to increase race grants by 20% since the start of 2016.  Average attendance per meeting in 2015 was up 4% on the prior period, average gate income increased by 3% and average tote spend per customer was up 2% on the previous year.  The 2015 accounts show improvements under some metrics, but these do not disguise the difficulties the greyhound industry faces.  That said, the industry in Ireland is worth defending.  The economist, Jim Power, estimated the direct and indirect employment in the industry at approximately 10,000 staff in 2011.  The IGB employs almost 800 full-time and part-time staff.  The industry supplies the raw materials in the form of greyhounds to greyhound racing internationally.  A total of 83% of greyhounds racing in the UK in 2016 were bred in Ireland.<br/><br/>The IGB's difficulties are not unique.  The industry globally is facing many challenges, notably as a result of the migration of wagering from track to technology platforms which has impacted on live attendances at race meetings.  With the closure of Wimbledon stadium recently, London, for example, now has no greyhound track, from a high of 33.  In the United States, there are only ten tracks operating full time.  In Australia, the industry is under huge pressure and, therefore, the notion that Ireland would somehow be unaffected by the reasons which have contributed to the nationwide decline is a nonsense.  Ireland, <i>per capita</i>, still has the highest number of stadia in the world, which is a reflection of the strength of the industry.  The number of stadia in the Republic, IGB and private, is 16.  There are 24 stadia run by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, GBGB, in the entire UK.  The IGB's remit is to manage the industry against the background of current market realities and, critically, to deal with a crippling, systemic overhang of debt.  That debt stood at &euro;20.3 million at the end of 2016, compared with a turnover of &euro;31 million, excluding Exchequer funding.  It may also be of interest that the current board has reduced the debt by &euro;2 million and is the first board to pay down debt.<br/><br/>All these difficulties to which I have referred were known to lndecon consultants when they were commissioned by the then Minister in 2014 to carry out what is regarded as the most comprehensive review of the industry ever undertaken.  It is important to state that everyone in the industry - ourselves and critics of the board included - were extremely pleased that such a review would be undertaken.  The difference between us at this point is that the board has accepted the Indecon conclusions and recommendations, which were also accepted by then Minister, and has sought to implement them.  It is important to state also that lndecon also felt strongly that if the appropriate actions were taken, as laid out in its review, then the industry had a viable future.  One of the key recommendations was that an asset disposal programme would be adopted to include the sale of Harold's Cross, which was then, and still is, the asset most likely to yield significant value.  Notwithstanding the lndecon report and the support of Government for the recommendation, the decision to close Harold's Cross was something the board of the IGB agonised long and hard about.  Harold's Cross was an iconic stadium of great importance to our Dublin colleagues who have a huge emotional attachment to it.  We acknowledge that the closure is a blow to the greyhound fraternity in Dublin.<br/><br/>I assure the committee that we will bend over backwards to ensure that Harold's Cross racing finds a welcoming, respectful home in Shelbourne Park stadium.  The decision to sell Harold's Cross is not solely predicated on its potential value to the IGB or its contribution to the resolution of the debt issue but is also based on the fact that it is two miles from Shelbourne Park, which is twice its size and operates for a limited period every week, as indeed does Harold's Cross.  It does not make commercial sense.  The effective closure of the IGB's national arena for the past ten weeks by those opposed to the closure of Harold's Cross Stadium is clearly not sustainable.  In addition to the loss of &euro;300,000 that has been incurred by the IGB, the disruption of racing has cost owners and trainers &euro;250,000 in prize money.  The IGB cannot haemorrhage money in this way and unless there is a resolution, and I have to make this clear, the end game is the cessation of all racing nationally.  The easy option for the board is to kick the issue of debt further down the road and to pretend that it does not exist or that it can be magicked away.  We were appointed to do a job and we will face up to our responsibilities, even if our decision to do so is unpopular.  It is important also to understand that the debt issue is not some abstract problem or an accountancy issue.  It is an issue that grievously inhibits the capacity of the board to invest in the industry, protect its national footprint, encourage new ownership and breeding, address issues around the industry demographic, reach out to the leisure market and exploit the opportunities of online wagering.<br/><br/>We want a vibrant and rejuvenated greyhound industry with the highest standards in animal welfare and integrity, that is celebrated as uniquely Irish, embraced by all, thereby securing its place as a major national sport, and has a place for all participants, including breeders, owners, professional trainers and those involved full-time and part-time.  We want an industry that delivers a world-class racing product in a rejuvenated stadium network delivering that best visitor experience for leisure customers and racing fans while distributing racing across all technology platforms.  We want to make Shelbourne Park a state-of-the-art stadium to rival others in the capital, such as the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park, and to allow it to operate as many nights as possible and attract new corporate and leisure audiences as well as having premium facilities for our owners, trainers and greyhounds.  There is also a requirement to upgrade other stadia if we are serious about expecting those other than the diehard greyhound racing constituency to attend our events.  We need to invest further in information technology to ensure we continue to exploit the opportunities the migration to online wagering and the constantly evolving technology<br/><br/>platforms in all their forms present.<br/><br/>Prize money needs to be increased, as does ownership, especially through syndication.  On welfare, we need to build on what we have been doing in recent years and ensure full traceability for dogs.  By any objective yardstick, the IGB has made huge strides in the area of regulation and integrity in recent years and we wish to keep that momentum going.  We want to develop a clear pathway into the industry for those who wish to participate, with a range of support options, including training and professional development.  All these areas require capital for investment.  We do not have access to it and are trading at the maximum of our banking limits.  We can have access to capital by sticking with the decision to close Harold's Cross and to realise the value of the asset, pay down debt and reinvest in the industry.<br/><br/>As an organisation, are we doing as well as we possibly can?  No.  There are still operational and structural weaknesses we need to sort out, but we have made progress, and I am happy that we have considerable skills represented at board and executive level across finance and business, veterinary, regulation and law to ensure we continue the progress that has been made and perform better in future.  The members of this delegation are more conscious than anyone of the backdrop to this appearance before the committee.  There is no doubt we are at a critical stage in the life of the greyhound industry.  Our ambition is to deliver a commercial, well-regulated greyhound racing and breeding industry, enabling the delivery of a customer-centred, highly exciting and value-led entertainment experience.  That requires difficult decisions to be made now.</p></speech>

He will be followed by Deputy Bobby Aylward.  As is custom, the lead speaker will have at least 20 minutes and the second speaker will have 15 minutes to question the witnesses while all other members will have ten minutes.  This will ensure everybody will have an opportunity to contribute and ask questions in order that we can have the best meeting possible.  We will go around on this issue as many times as we have to in order that we can get the answers we feel are necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#G00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses from Bord na gCon, including the acting chief executive officer.  I thank Mr. Meaney for his opening statement.  With regard to the management of the greyhound industry, it is clear the sector is at a crossroads.</p><p>In the context of the current board, the committee must assess the results presented in the 2015 annual report and how the board has driven matters in respect those results.  My concern is that the board's judgment has been called into question on a number of occasions in recent years.  First, on a question I posed to Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials, the 2015 accounts did not appear on the IGB website until February 2017, which, I suggest, is not in the interests of transparency and fairness.  Second, with regard to the reduction in prize money, while it is said the IGB has a cash surplus, at what cost is this to the industry in terms of shrinkage?  We are talking about reduced prize money and increased tote retention, which essentially means less value for the punter attending the track.  While this may be a short-term gain for the IGB, it will have significant consequences in the future.</p><p> On Enterprise Targeting Solutions, it was openly admitted by the board at a previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that it had not done its homework in checking out the company before the sponsorship contract was signed.  Legal fees rose substantially in 2015 to &euro;1.443 million, having been &euro;587,000 in 2014, and there have been a number of high-profile incidents surrounding that.  It is very important that greyhound racing is marketed correctly.  We have seen the issues surrounding the logistics of the closure of Harold's Cross and how that was carried out.  I am aware that a number of families had aimed to attend on St. Valentine's night and had booked out the restaurant.  If we are spending money on marketing, that gives a terrible view of the industry and how we go about our business in terms of the capacity to make decisions.</p><p> The first point I want to focus on in the 2015 annual report is wages.  Prize money and the overall turnover of the sector are decreasing but the one thing that is definitely not decreasing is wages.  I know the catering section was taken over.  It is stated on page 39 of the report that &euro;867,791 is the direct and operational cost and that food and beverage staff-related costs were &euro;2.778 million.  Is that &euro;2.778 million exclusively in respect of the 57 employees who were taken on?</p></speech>

On behalf of the organisation, we apologise to the committee, the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General for the lateness last year.  Processes have been put in place this year by our CFO, Mr. Michael Murnane, and additional resources have been put into that area.

That full-time equivalent staff figure would represent 268 part-time staff and 15 full-time staff.  Therefore, in total, there are 283 members of staff, not 57.</p></speech>

To take the proposals in the departmental circular, whereby one has to disclose all salaries in excess of &euro;60,000, a concern for me is that, in 2015, 11 board members of Bord na gCon received not far off &euro;1.2 million.  That is 11 members of staff.  Is that sustainable in an industry which, from the figures, seems to be almost collapsing?  Has it increased?</p></speech>

The remuneration committee of the board decides the salaries of people but, based on my knowledge of working in other industries, I would not see this number of people as unusual in light of the amount of business transacted by the organisation.  We have fantastic staff in the business who work very hard but, in a business of this nature, we need good leadership.  I think the success of the business is built around having good management.</p></speech>

I want to know if that increased in 2016 or 2017.</p></speech>

We are selling our assets, as has been highlighted in the past 48 hours.  To be fair, the defined benefit current service costs at note 8 in the annual report can be taken out because those are not full-time equivalents who are carrying out their duties at present.  However, in 2015, &euro;10.3 million was paid for 240 full-time equivalents.  Given that many of these are casual staff, such as those on the gate, and not in highly-skilled jobs, why is the wage cost so high?  I have to make a judgment on the 2014 report as to whether the board members are managing this industry correctly.  I would like that explained better.</p></speech>

To offer some comparison, EHS, the food service, brought 283 jobs to the IGB.  Excluding those jobs, we can compare like for like.  At the end of 2015 and into 2016 we had, on average, 476 posts in the IGB between full-time and part-time posts.  That has fallen from 607 posts in 2008.  It is a wide industry that covers 16 different tracks - it used to be 17 - and there is a huge geographic spread.  There are many jobs that can only be supplied by a certain person at a particular point in time.</p><p>The Deputy must keep in mind that we operate racing in Lifford, Cork and Waterford.</p></speech>

We understand the requirement for us to be open and transparent and we endeavour to be so as much as possible, but we are working with an independent company that sets requirements about what it is willing to disclose.

There are fewer restrictions on disclosures in such arrangements, but for the initial arrangement, we had to discuss the matter with our customers and ensure they were satisfied.</p></speech>

I am keen to go back and cover several points.  I will cover that particular point at the end, if that is okay.  I am a new board member.  This board has been in operation for 16 months.  In the past 16 months we have had to resolve the three high court cases.  They have been resolved.  We have resolved the defined benefit scheme.  We reduced the balance sheet liability by &euro;5 million in 2016.  We have introduced several statutory instruments relating to regulation of drugs and remedies.  We have purchased a new laboratory machine in Limerick.  Considerable work has been done in the 16 months, despite what others might say.  The bank debt is the big thing we need to resolve.  The bank debt will be resolved in the coming months.  It will reduce the debt substantially.  I do not want to go any further than that.</p> <p>  It is important to say that the State got into trouble.  The first thing the State had to do was to sort out its finances.  One cannot build a house on a poor surface.  Many businesses throughout the country go into trouble.  Had they not attained financial stability, they would not be trading today.  The IGB is no different.  It has an overhanging debt that it cannot repay.  It is generating circa &euro;3 million per annum on the basis of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.  We cannot build a future business if we do not have a stable business to build from.  At the end of this process, it will be a stable business.  It will be able to reinvest in some of the capital issues necessary.  We will be able to refurbish our national stadium in Shelbourne Park.  More important, we will be able to give money back to breeders, owners and trainers.  That is not a bad achievement for 16 months given the legacy debt that we inherited in December 2015.</p></speech>

I do not see the board putting any incentives into ground racing.  I see the board cutting prize money.  I see the board taking a larger share of the tote retention.  In other words, what I see happening is that the board is saying that it is returning a profit, but it is at a massive cost to the industry.  That is where I have a major concern.  Is the board going in too deep here?</p></speech>

The prize money was increased in 2013 by 20%.  In 2014 the results did not show any commercial increase in spite of the increase in prize money.  It was obvious during 2014 that Bord na gCon would face a substantial loss.  The board took the reluctant decision mid-year to reduce prize money.  In addition, one of the recommendations from Indecon was to recalibrate the number of races and reduce the number of loss-making race nights.  That was completed in 2015.  Since we had fewer race meetings and fewer races, there was a reduction in prize money.  The business stabilised in 2015.  The board was in a position to offer a 25% increase in ordinary race nights.  These are graded races and there is a wider spread.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses comment on why they might be so angry and why there is so much disquiet?  Will the witnesses, as a board or executive, give a reason that feeling exists and why there is so much noise and disquiet about what is happening and unhappiness about the direction in which the greyhound board is going and the future of the greyhound industry?

In my opening statement, I highlighted that as a board, we have had to make tough decisions.  People find it very hard to accept tough decisions.  It is often hard to make tough decisions but we had a job to do.  When I came on board we had a &euro;2.5 million IOU there from 2005 that had to be paid to Dundalk Stadium, which is a private stadium.</p><p>We had to pay that in 2012.  It was a legally binding agreement.  We had to put a small investment in Clonmel and the Youghal track.  Three High Court cases that were there before my time had to be dealt with.  We had a serious deficit in our defined benefit pension scheme, as had everybody who had a defined benefit pension scheme.  They were the kind of issues that had to be dealt with.  We did not have the kind of money we wanted to invest in marketing, IT and prize money.  That plus the tough decision to sell Harold's Cross brought the board adverse publicity.  I would love to be starting off as chairman of the board now compared with when I started off six years ago.  It is a clean business now.  It will effectively have no debts and will be in a very good position going forward.  It has taken a lot of hard decisions to get there.</p></speech>

The first thing we would like to do in conjunction with the executive is give out prize money and give our stadia, which have been starved of investment over the past five or six years, a bit of a face lift.  We need to invest in IT, marketing and promotion.  We believe we will build the business back up again quite quickly.</p></speech>

As we were coming in today, we saw a group protesting outside.  A presentation was arranged by the Chairman a couple of weeks ago in the D&aacute;il which was attended by many of us.  It was said at that meeting that there was no problem.  People who were at the meeting said that if they were in control, they would handle it a certain way and keep Harold's Cross going.  Is Bord na gCon happy with the sale of Harold's Cross?  I presume the deal is done.  I know Deputy Burke asked about that.  The deal is done so Bord na gCon has made a deal with the Department of Education and Skills on the sale of Harold's Cross.  It cannot disclose how much money is involved.  Will it reduce Bord na gCon's debt?  If so, will it reduce by a lot or a percentage?  Will Bord na gCon be viable after this?</p></speech>

Having received that, there are a number of steps to take to bring the matter to a conclusion.  Over the coming two months, we hope that we will get there and be able to bring that to finality.</p></speech>

Harold's Cross was Bord na gCon's third biggest income generator.  According to figures I have, it was a profitable stadium that was making money.  It is like selling the silver to pay for gold.</p></speech>

My role as defined by the board was to act in the best long-term interests of the industry.  Debt was a massive burden.  It was like a dark shadow over the organisation.  I know Deputy Burke spoke about farmers selling bits of land.  I come from the country and am familiar with that but the reality was that apart from Shelbourne Park, the only asset that Bord na gCon could turn into significant money to alleviate its banking problem was the sale of Harold's Cross.</p></speech>

It has to operate with financial stability because if it does not have that, it will have no future.  As the chairman outlined in his earlier statement, there are many people who are very dependent on this industry for a livelihood and entertainment.  A total of 800 people work in this business.</p></speech>

I am told that the board of Harold's Cross was not even notified.  I was told that a week before, some of the witnesses met the director of the stadium and guaranteed that Bord na gCon would keep it open for another 12 months.  The following Monday, there were padlocks on the gates and a lot of stuff was removed that Monday morning so that it could not be viable or workable.  Is that the way to treat people or a board?  Is it right to do so without consultation?  It seems to be a dictatorship rather than consultation.</p></speech>

The sale is the future for the greyhound industry because it means that this legacy debt, which has killed the industry, will be resolved once and for all.  The second thing I would say is that from a commercial point of view, I know of no business that has two properties a couple of miles apart - Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross - that are closed four or five nights a week.  They are two premises that are closed four or five nights a week when they are right beside each other.  If this was a commercial organisation, they would be merged and that is what the plan for Dublin is.  I will let Dr. Brady take the question about Harold's Cross.</p></speech>

As Deputy Aylward outlined, we met the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association in Naas.  We laid out the picture to the association with absolute clarity that Harold's Cross would be sold and that the sale was needed to solve the debt problem.  That was made very clear to the people at the meeting on that day.</p> <p>  Subsequently, having discussed it with the chairman, an offer was made to allow racing to continue at Harold's Cross until the end of the year.  The Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association wanted that commitment in writing and would not take my word for it.  We said that because of the bank, we could not issue a letter to anyone about the future.  We communicated to the association that this was the case.  The board met.  There was the threat of a picket at Shelbourne Park the next Saturday night.  The board discussed the matter and we then made a final offer to the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association that if it would accept our word, we would guarantee it racing to the end of the year.  The association did not accept our offer.  It was made clear to the association that non-acceptance of this offer and continuing picketing of Shelbourne Park would lead to the closure of Harold's Cross.

Racing at Shelbourne Park did not stop that night.</p><p>When that information was presented to the board, a decision was made by the board to cease racing in Harold's Cross.  The executive did risk analysis on this and, as part of it, we were advised by the property people that vacant possession was very important in realising value.  There have been protests in other areas in this country so, based on a risk analysis, we decided to close Harold's Cross immediately.  We did that job immediately after the board decision.  The board made its decision at 9.45 and we proceeded to do it then.</p><p> I and the IGB regret absolutely the inconvenience to many genuine greyhound people in Dublin.

I understand that the IGB funding allocation increased significantly, by approximately &euro;2.75 million, from 2014 to 2015.  However, the allocation of prize money to greyhound owners was reduced by &euro;800,000.  It seems that total prize money paid in 2015 was &euro;6.67 million, which is down almost 50% on what was paid in 2007.  That is a 50% reduction in the funding that was keeping the greyhound industry going.  It is prize money which allowed people to remain viable.  Could the IGB explain the steady reduction in prize money paid to owners, particularly from the period between 2014 and 2015?  Has the money paid to owners increased in 2016, which I mentioned already?  Is it expected that the prize money allocation will increase this year and in the future?  Prize money is the bread for the industry and the ordinary Joe Soap on the ground.</p></speech>

Should the IGB not have looked elsewhere to cut costs without affecting the prize money?  I was in contact with people who depend on the prize money.  One breeder who is a genuine man and who has been involved in the industry all his life has approximately 15 bitches and runs a few dogs.  He was getting a few bob and was able to survive but in five or six years, that changed and he is now hardly able to keep going.  I am only talking about one individual.</p></speech>

I am a country boy myself so I know exactly where he is coming from but one can only pay out what one makes.  In the timeframe in question, the horse and greyhound fund was reduced to &euro;4.4 million.  In 2014 the horse and greyhound fund stood at &euro;10.8 million.  In 2007 it was close to &euro;14.5 million.  The number of races has fallen as well.  There was a cumulative fall of 7,700 races and nearly 5,000 of those date to the years 2009 to 2011.  I mentioned previously that Indecon recommended that we should reduce race meetings where nights were loss making.</p> <p>  Another contributor to prize money is sponsorship and that has fallen by &euro;1.3 million in that timeframe.  A total of &euro;1.2 million of the drop was between 2008 and 2010.  We have been there and we do not want to go back to those times.  Another part of it is that &euro;4.2 million of operating surpluses of the IGB had to be retained to pay bank interest of &euro;3.5 million and &euro;750,000 in bank repayments.  That is a massive figure.  A total of &euro;4.2 million had to be set aside to pay interest on a loan.</p></speech>

My experience in recent years is that there was a problem and we resolved it.  We are trying to ensure it will not recur again.  We are a self-regulatory body so there will always be an undercurrent of legal fees in respect of the IGB but not of the value that was there in 2015 when there was a total of &euro;1.4 million in legal and professional fees.  That is just not sustainable.</p></speech>

There is a business plan from 2012 to 2017.  The landscape has changed utterly since then.  We did receive alternative figures in 2015, a kind of update in light of proposals to sell Harold's Cross.  As a condition of the provision of funding this year, we have asked for a comprehensive business plan to be prepared in 2017.  The original one was to expire anyway in 2017.  The reality is that between 2014 and now, there has been a roadmap outlined for the development of the sector and its preservation, to be frank, and that has been the Indecon report.  The board has an action plan for the implementation of Indecon.  In terms of what the agriculture committee asked for, I am not sure what Deputy Aylward is reading from but the convention is that a committee would request somebody to come in and present to it on business proposals.</p></speech>

It was a different board and a different Department.  That is just factually correct.  There is no doubt that some of those decisions laid the seeds for great financial difficulties which were exacerbated by a recession from 2008 on.  An investment was made at the wrong time - I suppose that is the reality of what happened.</p> <p>  The board has inherited a difficult situation and is trying to navigate its way through it.  I do not believe there are any easy solutions here.  They are doing a very difficult job in difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

That is our job here and all we are trying to do is clarify that money is being spent right and going in the right direction.  As part of the oversight, the Department should be making sure of that.</p></speech>

The fact is that there is a very significant debt which is costing a lot to service.  As far as I am aware, between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million was involved in covering the interest and bank debt over the last two years.  That is money that could otherwise have gone into prize money, breeders' incentives, investments in stadia.  This thing is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p><p>I cannot say I am happy with the situation but I am quite sure that the board and the interim chief executive would say exactly the same thing.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson said that there are historical issues here, a previous board, a change of Departments and so on.  Obviously, the issue of the decision to build the site in Limerick is a critical component of this and we all understand that.  That is probably one thing we all agree on, but there are many more bigger issues than that as well.  Perhaps Mr. Greally will answer the following question.  There was a request from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to extend the contract of the previous chief executive, who was the decision-maker regarding the building of the Limerick site.  If there were concerns about this, why did the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting an extension of the contract of the CEO who made the decision to build the Limerick site in the first place?</p></speech>

However, at the time, a case was made by the board for the extension of the contract of the CEO based on the submission of a business plan and on the need for continuity.  I believe that this individual had particular expertise in some of the proposals for the IT element of online services and commingling.  That was the basis of the submission made and it was on that basis that we agreed to an extension.  Ultimately, the CEO did not accept the post and was not appointed.</p></speech>

It is also a policy <i>volte-face</i>.  Regarding the review that was conducted in 2010 of the national State assets and liabilities, did the Department not say that a disposal of assets regarding Bord na gCon would have a very negative impact on the industry?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2010 felt any asset sale would be negative for the industry but presumably now supports it.</p></speech>

I refer to the Indecon report again.  The Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recommended that the Irish Greyhound Board facilitate meetings with industrial representatives of stakeholders such as the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation.  That is one of the complaints I have heard recently.  The board and executive are completely ignoring the stakeholders.  I have been told they will not meet them, converse with them or tell them what is going on.  Here is a recommendation from the Indecon report and from the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that the board discuss with them the future of the plan that is put forward.  Despite this, since January last year, when this recommendation came from the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the board has never met them and has completely ignored them.  That is what I am being told and I want clarification on that.</p></speech>

By way of a small bit of background, the industry is very splintered.  A number of the greyhound owners and breeders associations, GOBAs, around the country are not affiliated to the national GOBA.

Any time a Deputy asks a question that is not answered, we will note it.  The witnesses can answer further in their contributions in a while.</p> <p>  Regarding legal costs, has the board changed legal suppliers in the recent past?  Are there any outstanding legal cases?  Deputy Burke asked a question about the pension fund.  By how much is it underfunded?  I understand &euro;800,000 was given towards it.  Was that all fully put in recently?  Has there been a full section 50 consultation with the staff and, if so, was it done in the appropriate way?  We spoke earlier about staffing.  Were there any staff appointments recently at any level and, if so, were they advertised in open competition?  Is there an organisational review ongoing at the moment?

The job of members is to evaluate materials we are given in preparation for meetings of the committee.  We examine annual accounts - we will examine the opening statements made by the Comptroller and Auditor General and Mr. Meaney - and then do research on the organisations involved and the issues raised at our meetings.  That is the basis upon which questions are asked.  I hope Mr. Meaney, his colleagues and members understand that.  I will first make an observation rather than ask a question.  I found the performance so far to be shambolic and disjointed.  The level of planning for this meeting leaves a lot to be desired on the part of members of the board, which raises concerns for me.  I am giving my opinion, which the witnesses do not have to accept.</p> <p>  I will move on to questions.  In all the material I have read, I have noted mismanagement, poor decision making, bad judgment and incompetence for which nobody has been held to account.  Mr. Gleeson, one of the board members and some of the other witnesses responded to questions by making statements to the effect that they could not be held to account, the landscape was changing or something happened before their time.  We heard excuse after excuse, with nobody taking responsibility for anything as far as I can see.  Somebody else, the people who came before, were blamed.</p> <p>  My first question is directed at Mr. Meaney, although I will also put questions to other witnesses.  I am frustrated by the presentations given and the complete lack of acceptance of any wrongdoing, mismanagement or poor decision making.  I believe it was Dr. Brady who referred to good leadership and management, a statement I will return to in a few minutes.  Can Mr. Meaney tell me that there was no evidence of mismanagement, poor decision making, bad judgment or incompetence by the board or the previous board of the organisation?</p></speech>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine drew my attention to Circular 17/2016 and asked me to allow the Department of Education and Skills to look at the site.</p></speech>

Arising out of that process, on Monday last I received an offer from the Department of Education and Skills for the property.  The board of the IGB met and considered the offer, and got advice from Savills, our property advisers, that this offer was acceptable.

The reason for that rule, I guess, is that there is a desire to avoid a situation where a public body would have to enter into a bidding war with private developers in the context of providing a public asset.  That is the reason the rule is there and the process that the chief executive has described is consistent with that circular and consistent with that rule.</p></speech>

It is not about a bidding war.</p><p>One puts something on the open market and there are potential bidders and there is what is called competitive tension in order to get the best possible return for an organisation.  That is the purpose, it is not to create a bidding war or to encourage one but it is done to get the best possible return.  The reason I asked this is because there could be a perception that the Department of education buying this is a sort of state bailout of an organisation that has clearly failed.  The Department of education comes in and writes a cheque for &euro;15 million, wipes out a lot of the debt, every one is happy and, as usual, no one is held to account for the failures, mismanagement, poor judgment and everything else.  There is no point in asking that of the witnesses because they obviously will not agree, but it is a question that needs to be put.  When asking that question, I want to hear from the Secretary General of the Department of education as to why the Department was interested in these lands, who alerted it to it, what are its plans, what is it paying for it and all those issues.  I want to hear from the Department too and maybe we can come back to that at another time.  Deputy Cullinane can come back to that.</p></speech>

I have worked in a number of companies ranging from the dairy sector through to the malt sector and the sugar sector, and back to the dairy sector again in regard to marketing Ornua, where I was interim CEO.  So I bring a breadth of experience.</p><p>Also, I come from the country, so I am comfortable having a chat with a dog owner in a golf caddy with two or three dogs in it.  I have had many conversations with owners in Limerick Greyhound Stadium.  I bring a business perspective to the organisation.  There are some advantages, perhaps, in a chief executive not being immersed in the organisation in the sense that I can bring an objective view to things - although I am unsure.</p></speech>

I am a chief executive currently and I would actually disagree with the suggestion.  I do not think one needs to have industry knowledge.  I think one needs to acquire industry knowledge when one takes over.  However, I do not believe one needs industry knowledge to become a chief executive.  It might actually be dangerous.  There can be groupthink and inside-think.  My view is that a person can be the chief executive but would need to learn about the industry on taking up the job.  However, I would not agree that a person needs industry knowledge at the point of taking on the job.</p></speech>

The amount of people who have joined the organisation in the past three years and who have come from diverse organisations far outside of banking is extraordinary.

Second, they do not have the level of debt that we have.  Let us go back to Deputy Cullinane's question.  The presumption was that the profit in Harold's Cross was going to disappear when we moved to Shelbourne Park.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#V02500"><p>I am not questioning for Deputy Cullinane and it is not a follow-on from his question.  I am simply asking because Mr. Creed said he knew of no business in that situation.  I probably picked the most similar business in existence and offered it as an example that is 30 miles away.  Three very successful racing facilities exist.  From Punchestown to Naas is barely three or four miles.  With the benefit of the motorway, the run from the Curragh to Naas and Punchestown is probably closer and easier to navigate than the route between Shelbourne Park and Harold's Cross.  It is a reasonable, given that 1.1 million people live in the greater Dublin area and far fewer people live in the County Kildare area, to question the business criteria used to justify the statement made by Mr. Creed.</p></speech>

The Curragh only hosts flat racing, so it is a different track.  Punchestown and Naas probably have similarities because they run steeplechases.  I will reiterate the point I was trying to make.  If we did not have the level of debt overhanging, then it might be a separate discussion.  The issue is that we have a substantial debt.  We have two stadiums.  One is closed five nights per week.  The other is closed four nights per week.  By merging them into one operation in Dublin we are alleviating the debt burden and maximising the cost efficiency by having staff move to one location.  The decision is based on the criteria of where we are today as distinct from if it was a debt-free organisation.</p></speech>

We meet more often than I had presumed we would meet.  It is not a question of once a month.  It is probably once per week, if not a couple of times per week.  Our focus at the beginning was to resolve some of the legacy legal issues.  Then, it moved on to solving all the other issues we discussed earlier.  We spend a good deal of time talking about regulation.  We spend a good deal of time talking about drugs.</p></speech>

I put it to the representatives of Bord na gCon that Horse Racing Ireland took a decision to trade out of the difficulties.  It did so successfully and now it has surpassed Bord na gCon in terms of Tote returns and profitability and so on.  The point made by Mr. Creed in terms of two facilities for the same scenario, I respectfully suggest, has more of a banking and raw commercial focus than a focus on the culture and spirit associated with supporting a sport.</p> <p>  Mr. Creed used the banking analogy, so I will stick with that.  Bank branches close.  People are replaced by machines and telephones but sport is a little different.  It requires facilities.  I put it to the delegation that, by closing one of the main or flagship facilities, Bord na gCon is impeding its ability to trade out of the difficulties and grow the industry in terms of the capacity available to it in future.</p></speech>

Today, there is only one facility.  It is a fantastic facility, which I should have mentioned in the context of my remarks about the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park.  The IGB and the greyhound industry should aspire to having a facility like Leopardstown.  The strategy to which we have been working is due to expire and so we need to put a new strategic plan in place.  As pointed out by Mr. Creed, the landscape has changed a great deal in the last 48 hours and, as such, that plan will need to be very different to what was originally proposed.</p></speech>

In accordance with normal business practice we will need to commence work on a new five-year plan in the latter half of this year and to also commence work on budgets for the coming year, which are approved by the board.  Work is under way within the IGB in terms of short and long-term strategic planning.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh, our commercial director, might like to comment on marketing issues.</p></speech>

What plans are being put in place to grow the business and to increase prize money, attendances and so on between now and this time next year and what is the target growth percentage, notwithstanding that a new strategic plan will have to be put in place when the current one expires, which I accept is due to circumstances outside of the control of the IGB?</p></speech>

By way of information those plans are linked to the trading budgets of individual business units, for which clear objectives and strategies are set.  We break down our customer base by customer type, by month and we track very carefully.  We have monthly support and activation plans, which include radio advertising, and a full suite of digital activity to support those plans.  In terms of strategy, the focus is, as it has been for the past two years, on increasing awareness around attendance, tote and food and beverage revenue across the stadium network.  This is driven by direct and targeted sales and marketing activity across individual stadium brands and the Go Greyhound Racing brand.  In response to the Deputy's question, the growth target for this year is in the region of 2% across the IGB stadium network.</p></speech>

During the course of the last ten years the Irish greyhound industry, the operations of the stadia, the participants in the industry, whether they own, breed, train dogs or attend as fans, were not immune to the crash that occurred in the industry.  In terms of the pattern of decline, the largest decline occurred in the period up to 2012-13.  In the intervening years, from 2014 to 2016, we have managed to stabilise the attendances and the revenues.  Gate income for the first time in 2016 has stabilised and attendances stabilised over the 2014-15 period.  In 2015, average gate attendances increased by 4% to 5% on what they were in 2014.  We have achieved a marginal growth in 2016 of between 1% and 2% across the network.</p> <p>  From a marketing point of view, from 2014 onwards we have been building and upgrading the digital infrastructure and commercial competence of the organisation.  Previously, the tools to deal with a changing consumer base did not exist.  This year is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, such that we have experienced a mobile and smart technology revolution in the past number of years.  We have embraced that and built up an infrastructure and digital marketing strategy.  As I said, we have upgraded all of the facilities and this is beginning to bear fruit.  Our pre-book business has increased by 9% and our online revenue has increased for 23% - for the first time, it has passed &euro;1 million.  The organisation has had to adjust.</p></speech>

There is a departmental circular which governs the disposal of assets to the Department of Education and Skills if it is interested.  It is a circular; it is not a statutory instrument.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

The purpose of that circular is to ensure value for the taxpayer.  It is a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular, not a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine circular.  One might, for example, have very good value for one public organisation at the expense of another organisation.  The purpose of this circular is to agree ground rules for such sales and the ground rule is that the Valuation Office values the property and that is binding on both parties.</p></speech>

I wish to put on the record that Dr. Brady is going to come back to us with clarification as to what that valuation was.  We have established from Mr. Gleeson that this was a circular - the practice, therefore, not founded in legislation or law, to determine that it had to be followed in terms of governing a sale to the Department.  We have also established that Savills had at least one other interested party, including in Northern Ireland.  Am I wrong in anything I have just said?</p></speech>

People have had ways of life.  I have spoken to some of the people on the pickets.  They had a way of life and a way of doing things.  I respect their right and their wish to object to what we did and I am sorry for the inconvenience that has been caused to them and the inconvenience and pain the sale has brought to the industry.  However, at the same time, the creation of a viable future for the industry means that the board had to take decisions and I believe that things will get better in IGB now.  There is an absolute need for financial stability and, equally, a need for everyone in the greyhound industry to come together and pull like dogs for its future success.  We need to unite.</p></speech>

In the years that were referenced in his contribution, turnover prize money, track attendance, sponsorship, ownership, breeding and bookmaker and Tote income all collapsed.  Attendances fell from 1.28 million to just under 650,000 between 2007 and 2015.  However, if one looks at the Tote in 2006 for horse racing versus dog racing, there is not much of a difference but for some reason, in the horse racing industry, which is run very differently to the greyhound industry, the Tote has come through the recession but has not for the greyhound industry, which I think says an awful lot.</p></speech>

Regarding the comparison, the narrative that has been around is how the IGB Tote has not been operating or functioning to the same level as the HRI Tote and the horse Tote.  However, if one is going to adopt that narrative, one should have a direct comparison of like for like.  The on-Tote revenues for horse racing and greyhound racing have continued to operate in very challenging betting environments since 2007, with a decline in Tote revenues of 67.9% at domestic horse tracks and 66% at greyhound tracks.  Therefore, when one compares on-track Tote performance, there is a very similar level of decline.  HRI has managed to offset the on-track decline with an exceptional performance in international markets, which would include the US, South Africa, Canada, France, Germany and Italy.  Of those markets, IGB is only allowed to operate in the US.  It is precluded legally from trading in terms of Tote, and the US performance in 2016 is up 42%-----</p></speech>

In the witnesses' opening statements we were told that, "The IGB&rsquo;s difficulties are not unique. The industry globally is facing many challenges, notably as a result of the migration of wagering from track to technology platforms which has impacted on live attendances at race meetings."  This movement would have been known and has been happening for some time.  Were these challenges taken into account when Limerick stadium was being considered? Will the representatives indicate what would be a sustainable number of greyhound tracks?  We have a very detailed chart in the presentations that compares numbers with the UK in respect of population size. The attendances at greyhound meetings run to in excess of three million annually.  There is an income for prize money.  What is sustainable?</p></speech>

I ask everybody to turn off their mobile phones.  That would be appreciated.  </p> <p>  In the first session today we looked at the Bord na gCon financial statements for 2015.  In this session we will be looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts, Vote 20 for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dealing specifically with the internal audit of financial procedures in the Garda College in Templemore.  We will confine discussion in the meeting to that matter today.  We will deal with the rest of the Vote on 13 July when the Commissioner will be before the committee again.  That is a very good date as it is my birthday so I look forward to that.  Discussion is confined to a very specific issue and members might bear that in mind.  I ask members to co-operate with that direction in their dealings today.</p> <p>  From An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we are joined by Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan; Mr. Kenneth Ruane, head of legal affairs; Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, with responsibility for governance and strategy; Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit and; Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director of finance and services.</p> <p>  From the Department of Justice and Equality we are joined by Mr. John O'Callaghan, assistant secretary of the policing division; Ms Anne Barry and Mr. Paul McDonald, and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform we are joined by Mr. John Burke.  The witnesses are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I will first call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.

The statement on internal financial control in the 2015 appropriation account for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, includes a disclosure that a number of features of the provision of ancillary services in the Garda College were not compliant with standard public governance procedures, and that an examination by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal audit was ongoing.</p> <p>  The internal audit report finds that on a number of occasions over the past decade issues had arisen within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about certain financial procedures at the college.  These issues were not communicated to my office until 31 May 2016 when the head of the Garda's internal audit, Mr. Niall Kelly, notified us of the concerns. That was after the 2015 appropriation account had been submitted to me for audit, and while the audit was under way.  Mr. Kelly informed us that he planned to undertake an internal audit of the college&rsquo;s affairs, and that duly commenced on 22 June 2016.  On 29 August 2016, internal audit informed us that an interim report had been drafted, and that significant issues had been identified that required further investigation.  Because we did not have a report or the detail of the findings at that stage, we asked the Accounting Officer to amend the 2015 statement on internal financial control to disclose the non-compliance with corporate governance standards, and advised that an investigation was ongoing.  I signed off on the audit on 5 September 2016.</p> <p>  A copy of the interim report executive summary was provided to my office on 13 September 2016.  We were provided with the final report on the internal audit on 22 March 2017.</p><p>We are examining the information and concerns outlined in the internal audit report and will be examining relevant records as part of the audit of the 2016 appropriation account to identify the implications for Vote 20 and other Votes, if relevant.  I plan to report my conclusions on the matter in September when I publish the 2016 report on the accounts of the public services.</p></speech>

Many of the issues identified have their roots in the 1980s before the Garda Commissioner became the Accounting Officer.  While attempts were made to address some of these issues, they were not sufficient and did not go far enough.  While some practices, as identified in the interim audit report, should not have happened and are certainly well short of modern financial procedures and controls and public sector governance and financial procedures, it should be noted that the report has found the majority of expenditure at the Garda College is managed to a high standard and compliant with the Garda finance code.  It is also important to provide reassurance that the Garda College continues to provide high quality training.</p> <p>  As Accounting Officer, I take my statutory responsibility for how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na spends taxpayer&rsquo;s money very seriously.  It is vital that it be spent efficiently and effectively and in the best interests of the people, the State and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is why on receipt of the draft interim internal audit report in September 2016 the Garda executive immediately accepted its findings and commenced implementation of the recommendations.  We are actively seeking to ensure the issues raised in the recently published report will be addressed as quickly as possible by putting strong financial and administrative controls in place in the Garda College.</p> <p>  When the matters raised at the Garda College came to the attention of the Garda executive in July 2015, they were of grave concern.  It was directed that a high level steering group, to include representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, be established immediately.  Between July 2015 and March 2016, the steering group actioned a number of initiatives, including closing bank accounts and seeking legal advice to resolve some of the complex issues associated with unwinding the existing systems and governance arrangements.  </p> <p>  In March 2016 the Garda internal audit unit was appointed to examine all of the issues involved.  It produced a draft interim report in September 2016, including a total of 19 recommendations.  Given the seriousness of the issues identified, all of the recommendations were accepted immediately.  At the time all interested parties were also invited to make submissions.  The report was finalised and accepted by the Garda audit committee in March 2017 and published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The March 2017 report and its recommendations have been accepted fully by the executive.</p> <p>  Since September 2016, activity has been focused on implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  In that time we have also sought the advice of independent external governance experts.  I will outline some of the actions taken to date.  </p> <p>  Responsibility for college administration, including revised financial procedures, has now been assigned to an acting interim principal administrator.  The administrator is a civilian Garda member at principal officer level who has not previously worked at the Garda College and who has experience of public financial procedures.  The administrator is heading an interim administration team in the Garda College.  </p> <p>  A new operational structure for administrative functions and ancillary services in the Garda College has been designed and we are seeking approval from the Policing Authority to recruit personnel with the appropriate financial and administrative skills.  External accountants have been appointed to provide specialist accounting services and advice on the implementation of the recommendations made in the interim audit report.  </p> <p>  The number of bank accounts identified in the interim audit report in the Garda College has been reduced to six.  We are in the process of closing down the remaining accounts in line with the recommendations of the report.  </p> <p>  We are working with the Office of Public Works to ensure all interests in the lands are in State ownership.  We are working with the Office of Government Procurement to prepare tenders for the provision of food and ancillary services in the Garda College.  The Institute of Public Administration is to provide training for appropriate Garda staff and members on public financial procedures and standards.  </p> <p>  A dedicated project team has been put in place to ensure the interim audit report&rsquo;s recommendations will be fully implemented.  The project team reports to the steering committee chaired by the chief administrative officer, Mr. Nugent.  It includes a representative from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Regular updates on progress are provided for the head of internal audit, the Garda audit committee, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Policing Authority.  An assistant commissioner has been tasked with conducting a preliminary examination to establish whether there are other matters that require further inquiry and, if so, to make recommendations on the appropriate approach to be adopted.  </p> <p>  The practices identified in the interim audit report are unacceptable.  We are actively implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  As I have said publicly on other matters, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uncovered these deficiencies and we are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Policing Authority, the Garda audit committee, the Office of Public Works and the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure they cannot happen again.</p></speech>

There was limited assurance in other areas.  Is it more than unacceptable that, of all organisations, the corporate body that is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not able to provide an assurance for auditors or that the auditors are not able to provide an assurance for the public that the organisation is in compliance with public financial procedures, the Garda finance code and good practice and good financial controls?</p></speech>

I am interested in the relationship between the corporate body that is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and good practice.  An awful lot has been said - as I am sure the Commissioner is well aware - in recent times about the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a perception, with which the Commissioner may not agree, that when there is wrongdoing, failures or sloppy practices, the <i>modus operandi</i>or the instinct of the corporate body that is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to close ranks, defend wrongdoing, ignore issues and frustrate the work of people within the force who want to do the right thing.  I put it to the Commissioner that such is the perception out there.  I ask her to give me her opinion on that perception, of which I am sure she is aware.</p></speech>

On 9 June 2016, when we published our modernisation and renewal programme, one key issue we identified was the need to reform the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is more than just an aspiration in a document; it is something that we commenced going all the way back to 2014 when I took up the position of interim Garda Commissioner.  The Deputy will have seen from this and from other issues that part of the changing of that culture is to make sure that we identify the issues, make them known publicly and that we are prepared to open up the organisation to constructive criticism.  We also have to have the courage and bravery to empower our people to actually identify where mistakes have happened, where there are less-than-good practices or weak practices and to make sure that we do not just identify those but that we actually do something about them and go about fixing them.  That is what we are doing in this case.</p></speech>

I want to put that to the test and examine that because before one can reform any organisation, there must be an acceptance that there was serious wrongdoing and that the culture was not right.</p> <p>  In terms of the report itself, I am interested in following the timeframe.  It took an awfully long time for the internal audit unit to publish its report, given when this issue first surfaced in the organisation.  Page 12 of the internal audit report makes reference to concerns that were first expressed about the finances in the college in an incomplete and unfinished audit report which was conducted by the Garda internal audit section in 2006, a year before it was restructured.  Why was that report incomplete and unfinished?  Who was responsible for that report?  Is the person responsible for that report in the room?  I ask the Commissioner to answer those questions.</p></speech>

The issue has been highlighted and a report was prepared stating there was substantial risk to the organisation, to the corporate body.  What was done then?  The 2008 report was not forwarded to the Garda internal audit section and was only discovered as part of the more recent audit by the internal audit unit.

What I am trying to get to is why it took so long from 2006 to 2016 to reach some conclusion on this matter.  We are still at 2008.  We know a report was done that was not sent to the GIAS.  In a note to the Commissioner on 25 April 2008 - this is still page 12 of the internal audit - the then chief administrative officer advised that the audit committee be advised at its next meeting in June of the issues revealed and measures to correct them; that person&rsquo;s opinion was not to brief the audit committee; and at that juncture, it could be regarded by the external members of the committee as a significant breach of trust.  On page 13, it continues there is no record of such a briefing in the minutes of the June 2008 meeting or any subsequent meeting of the audit committee.</p> <p>  Again, this was a brief and note sent to the Garda Commissioner.  Why was that not done?  Why was it not sent on to the appropriate meeting?  Why was it not an item on the agenda for that meeting?  Who made the decision not to send it?  Who was responsible for briefing the committee?</p></speech>

Maybe if the organisation had been swifter, we would have been able to put questions to the people who were in charge.</p> <p>  In any event, it was not done.  Again, there were issues that were to be taken to the audit committee that were not.  The Commissioner at the time would have been briefed that not to do so would represent a significant breach of trust, yet it was not done.  Again, we do not know why the Commissioner is saying that is being examined as well.</p> <p>  There is no record of such a briefing in June 2008.  Then in his report the chief administrative officer advises that the director of finance be authorised to conduct a full and comprehensive audit of all the financial activities in the college.  On page 13, the report goes on to say the GIAS was not informed of this proposed audit.  Who made the decision not to inform the GIAS?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, for all of us it gets worse.  On page 14, it states that on 2 March 2011, the GIAS reported to the Garda Commissioner on financial controls in 2010.  It stated the GIAS could provide no assurance in regard to financial controls, that the GIAS sought to conduct an audit of the financial controls but was told work was being done by the finance directorate and because of that, it removed a paragraph from its own report.  It then sought access to this report several times from the finance directorate.  It stated that despite requests for access to this report, the GIAS was told it was still in draft even though it had been given to college management.</p> <p>  Again, there seems to be an ongoing attempt to frustrate the work of the GIAS.  It was seeking this draft report and it could not get it.  Is that the Commissioner&rsquo;s understanding of what happened?</p></speech>

I am sure the Commissioner will accept that legislation is put in place for people to follow, implement and abide by and that any breach of legislation is essentially a breach in law.  Is that the case?  If one does not follow legislation it is potentially a breach in law.</p></speech>

On page 4 of the report it is stated that "the issues identified in this report are serious and present considerable risk to the organisation and should be dealt with in an open and transparent manner."  On page 6 it is stated that Garda HRM would have to remind staff who are directors of Garda College Sports Field Company limited of their legal obligations to provide appropriate legal support to help them retrospectively report to SIPO.  The Commissioner will see that it says that superintendents, possibly a chief superintendent, and others who had legal responsibilities in respect of SIPO failed to make declarations that needed to be made.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

It states that money raised was to be transferred to the Office of Public Works.  Page 20 states section 29(3) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 prohibits garda&iacute; from being involved in land contracts and that the legal standing of the Garda college management as directors was questionable.  Page 21 states that Garda members, including superintendents, did not make declarations that they should have made.  There is a litany of breaches, potentially, in law.</p><p> This is my final question to the Commissioner.  This report is serious - the Commissioner has accepted that.  It seems there was an attempt by people within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College to frustrate the work of the Garda internal audit service.  That is how I see it, because it took a long time - this goes back to 2006 - to get reports, papers and documents that should have been given to internal audit but that were not given.  We had breaches in law as well.  I have not even got to any of the issues relating to the bank accounts, including the laundry account, the bar account and the restaurant account.  Other members will go through the detail in terms of how all the money was spent in ways in which it should not have been spent.</p><p> Several breaches of legislation are documented in the internal audit.  How can the Garda Commissioner be satisfied that the law was not broken by members of the force in terms of any of these issues?  How can the Garda Commissioner be certain that there was no criminal wrongdoing?</p></speech>

It is evident that a couple of things need clarity.  The company we are talking about was established in 1993.  To be fair to Mr. Kelly and the team, they did not have time to go back to 1993 to see what led to the establishment of that company and who was aware of the establishment of that company.  Moreover, the legislation in place at the time was a different form of legislation.  That is one thing.</p></speech>

The fact is the land was acquired.  There was a requirement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for land that needed to be acquired to develop a tactical training facility within the environs of Templemore, because of the development of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I was not looking for excuses around whether people own farms.  What I am saying is that this is the report I am working from.  Over and over, the report I have cited documents, potentially, several breaches of different Acts by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Who examines that?  Who investigates that?

Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can confirm the point.  With respect, the report states that &euro;126,000 needs to be transferred from the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote to the OPW because the money was collected.  We now know that much of that money was spent on things like donations and gifts to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Essentially, what is happening here is that the taxpayer is footing the bill.  The taxpayer has to pay the &euro;126,000.  The money will be given from the Garda Vote to the OPW, but much of that money was spent on insurance, gifts, bars and restaurants.  Again, the taxpayer is going to foot the bill.  Is that not what has happened here?  Much of that money is spent.  It is gone.  If the money is transferred from the Vote of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the taxpayer will be footing the bill and we will not get it back from the people who spent the money.  Is that acceptable?  Is that what is happening here?</p></speech>

It goes on to say the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College provides education and training programmes and interventions, ranging from MA, BA, BSc, police leadership, higher diploma, certificates in firearms, driver training, and public order courses.  Therefore, this is an educational establishment.</p> <p>  The Garda is acutely aware of the importance of training.  Page 4 tells us that the Garda staff assigned to administrative roles in the college had no training or experience of administration and had no knowledge of public financial procedures.  It is pretty shocking stuff, especially in the context of the college as a training and educational campus.  Someone obviously appointed the people to do the work.  We cannot blame people who do not have training.  The Garda has to provide the training.  However, someone decided to appoint them.  Is there a consequence?  Is the person who made that appointment still there?  Is there a consequence for anyone in that regard?</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy has rightly identified something that we have identified for a long time: it is not appropriate for Garda members who are trained police officers to be carrying out these types of functions or for them to be put into these functions without the appropriate training.  That is why we have moved on to working with the Policing Authority and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get properly skilled and suitably qualified civilian members into those roles.  That is why we have gone on to address it in the interim by putting in a principal officer with the appropriate level of skill to implement the revised recommendations.  It is quite inappropriate otherwise.</p> <p>  I do not think any other organisation of the size and scale of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that provides such a vital function and that requires such training would be expected to put members in place who are not qualified.  However, that was the reality at the time because there was a moratorium on recruiting properly and suitably skilled professional civilians.  Now that the moratorium has been lifted, we are moving to address it.</p></speech>

Those of us who are elected to the House are in fear of the standards in public office obligations and are aware of being in compliance with that office.

I have met with the directors of the company involved.  It is fair to say they were not aware.  I am not excusing it.  I am saying they were not aware of their obligations.  The committee will see that as part of the recommendations we have agreed to work with those involved in respect of providing advice in that area.</p> <p>  Across my time in the public service I have certainly seen circumstances where individuals have become directors as a result of taking positions in an organisation.  In this case, that would appear to have led people to believe certain things about how they should fulfil their requirements.  Clearly, it is not correct.  I have spoken to the directors about their responsibilities in that regard.</p></speech>

The whole principle here relates to this company.  The intention is that this company will be taken off the stage.  That is the priority in this regard.  As the Commissioner has said, it was established in the 1980s, long before the position of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Accounting Officer was established.  It was put there for a particular reason.  The Deputy might not like my saying it, but we do not know why this was or the specific rationale for it.</p></speech>

When anything like that arises there should be an immediate process of notification, because that is where the oversight is.  On page 11 of the report we are told that accumulated funds made by the college restaurant and shop were transferred to Sportsfield Company Limited or invested in various investment accounts.  It seems to have been quite a generator of income.  If we turn to page 27 there appears to be money transferred into the account to keep the restaurant going when the moratorium was fully in place, but there seems to be money going into that account even in years when it was making a surplus.  Was it just an account that money went through and then went to the Sportsfield account?</p></speech>

This money was allocated to cover the cost of the restaurant and facilities for members that were training in the college and it was capable of making a surplus.  That surplus went into the restaurant account and from there into the Sportsfield Company, and from the Sportsfield Company to the boat club.  The boat club happened to include the person who assigned it and who said it was given for the right reason.  The witness said at the beginning that this was unacceptable, but when one starts trying to work out the narrative, it is very hard to get around the idea that this was members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the people who enforce law.</p></speech>

As we get into the moratorium where the restaurant activity has diminished, the process of funding it was through the surpluses that had been accumulated.  It is possible that what we are seeing here is the return of other moneys that had just been in investment accounts at that time.</p></speech>

The land belongs to the State.  It is important to provide assurance to the committee.  My understanding very clearly from both the audit report and from my briefings is that nobody is suggesting that anybody other than the State owns the land.  There is no question about the title of the land.  This funding model developed from the time the college transferred to Tipperary in the 1960s.  There is an important context there.  A funding model was developed which certainly by today's standards would not be acceptable.  The Commissioner was not then the Accounting Officer and, therefore, several other parties were cited in respect of this model, which was put in place over time, and because of that model, different practices developed.  Going back to the Vice Chairman's question, it is important that we get to understand this.  As a trained investigator, I always look for the evidence trail.  We have to establish the facts.  As of this moment, as has been identified by the committee, the facts have not been fully established and, therefore, we are not in a position to assess what is there.</p></speech>

I did not hear anybody raise the issue of title or ownership of the land.

The Commissioner referenced in her opening remarks that this has been ongoing since the 1980s.  It is easy for all of us on this side of the room and others in the public domain to question the manner in which moneys were spent by the Garda training college and how it was run.  We can agree that it was in 2006 that it was first identified that there was a problem in terms of whether the college was compliant with accountancy rules inflicted upon all agencies of the State by various Departments.  In regard to the unfinished audit report presented in 2006, which I understand referenced finance directorate reports, the interim report states "which uncovered discrepancies in compliance with public finance procedures".  Why in the Commissioner's view did it take nine years for the Garda to do something about it?  </p> <p>  Mr. Kelly mentioned that he commenced his employment with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008.</p></speech>

When we were talking about the farm, Mr. Nugent used the word "transfer" in relation to, presumably, Office of Public Works, OPW, purchased land.  The Commissioner mentioned at the beginning of this discussion that rents were paid directly to, I think, the OPW, but that stopped and they ended in the various entities within Templemore.  Mr. Nugent said that happened to "some" rather than "all" the lands.  I am not specifically referring to the farm.  In regard to Sports Field Company Limited land, it was stated that the members of that company wish to divest themselves of the ownership of land.

The audit team is meant to be 11.  The Commissioner has said that obviously this is a critical issue and that they are going to get to bottom of it.

We have recently approved the increase in the strength, but it is extremely difficult for us to get civilian staff.  We have a number of layers that we must go through.  We have recently approved an increase in the strength beyond the 11 up to 12 and, indeed, in recent discussions up to 16 to allow the work get completed.  The chief administrative officer is working very closely with the Policing Authority trying to expedite getting the staff.</p></speech>

It is probably quite small money, but it is very troubling given that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did it.  The Garda Vote provides for Templemore a sum of money, as I understand it, for laundry services and-or supplementary food in the canteen or the mess, whatever they refer to it as.  For a period of time the college in Templemore was charging for the laundry service which led to large sums of money being accrued, which in turn led to money being transferred all over the place up to and including investment accounts and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  One of the troubling aspects of all of that, apart from it being unacceptable either from an accounting perspective or from a moral one, is that the moneys that were then transferred to the sports field then ended up being transferred in the amount of &euro;100,000 to the Garda Boat Club.  As stated in the interim report, the Garda Boat Club is a private organisation.  The report was very specific about who is in it.  It states that it is run by current and former staff and their families.  I have no problem with that.  I looked it up online and see it was established in 1954.  The website lists the committee, captains and all the rest of it.  It is a fairly open and transparent organisation from its public perspective.</p> <p>  However, &euro;100,000 was sent to a private institution and those who run it are not auditable or answerable to the Commissioner or anybody else for that matter.  The biggest issue I have with that is that those are public funds in a private organisation.  There is a term for that and it begins with an "e".  I looked up the definition of that.</p></speech>

I have no doubt in my mind - or at least I hope so - that individuals using that money were using it for garda&iacute;, former garda&iacute; and all the rest of it.  The bottom line is that it is public money.  Its source is profits in various organisations, rent being procured - to which I will return in a minute - from a site owned by the State with the money originally being paid directly into the Garda accounts, but subsequently not - as the Commissioner identified.  Who controls the limited organisation that is the boat club?  Has the &euro;100,000 been returned?  I believe that was transferred between 2000 and 2003.  Assume the answer is "No" and that it was spent.</p> <p>  We are discussing whether any illegal activity has taken place and when I raise something that is in the Garda's own report, the witnesses cannot guarantee me that anything.  We do not know that that &euro;100,000 went to the personal enrichment of current or former garda&iacute;, family members or anybody else for that matter because it went to a private organisation.  None of the witnesses can answer that question, which is very disappointing.  It is contained in a Garda interim auditors report.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  The witnesses have answered questions over which they cannot stand because they do not know.  I do not know if there is a question in there that the witnesses can answer - or even a remark.</p></speech>

I looked up the definition and I can ask Mr. Ruane and-or Mr. Kelly to define embezzlement in the context of accountancy but we all know what it means.  It does not necessarily infer certain things.  It means "misappropriation of funds placed in one&rsquo;s trust or belonging to one&rsquo;s employer" and that is exactly what we are talking about.  That is the definition of embezzlement in the Collins online dictionary.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions about the funding that was being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Templemore through one of its entities from the farm &ndash; the rent that was being paid, which I think was &euro;25,000.  The Commissioner opened the door with regard to the fact that some of that money was being paid directly to the OPW.  For whatever reason, and perhaps the Commissioner knows and could identify it, when did that money stopped being paid to the OPW and why did the OPW not ask why it was not getting the &euro;25,000 per year it was supposed to get?  I am not sure whether the Commissioner can answer that question.  Where did the money go in terms of the intended recipient?  I know it ended up in the restaurant account, the sports field account or one of those accounts.  Did nobody ask any questions?  How did it happen that this sum of money on an accumulated basis was sent around all sorts of different organisations?  Was Mr. Kelly aware of where the rent paid from that farm was going bearing in mind when that farm was purchased?  What did he do to highlight the fact that the money was or was not being sent to the appropriate accounts and-or offset against the Vote budget passed by these Houses?  I will start with the Commissioner and come back to Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>

I will provide some history first.  We have recently established records which show an auctioneer in the Templemore area sending rent on the land to the Commissioner of Public Works in 2007.  In his report, Mr. Kelly confirmed that the specific part of the OPW did not have records associated with that receipt.  The next period we have is the return of the next set of lands.  We understand there was a subsequent lease.  We do not know why that happened and why money was sent to the Commissioner of Public Works in 2007 and then stopped.  We do not know why that did not raise a red flag.  In Mr. Kelly's report, we have not been able to discover the records on the OPW's side in respect of that matter.  That is a difficulty for us at the moment.  It is not easy for us to provide all the information Deputy Farrell is looking for.</p></speech>

As we said from the outset, there are other parties outside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved in this and because of the very complex and convoluted arrangements that were in place across the OPW and various Government Departments, we have to go outside our availability of documentation to fill in some of the gaps.</p></speech>

We must first get sanction from the Department of Justice and Equality which must get sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We must also engage with the Policing Authority around the job descriptions, role profiles, etc.  There is then a series of sequences.  Mr. Nugent is working very closely with the Policing Authority in an effort to identify not just the internal audit positions but the other civilian positions.  Deputy Catherine Murphy identifies a really important thing.  For years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had to work on what I would call a 1940s architecture trying to modernise an organisation.  The practices are not good enough.  As members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are all trained police officers.  We are not trained administrators.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked a question about training which I do not think I completed.  In respect of the assurances we need to give to the committee, the Deputy asked a specific question.  The Institute of Public Administration is training all of our people in proper financial management procedures and this will continue as part of the ongoing training requirements bringing people up to date with best governance practices.</p></speech>

Part of this is keeping communities safe.  It is my job to ensure the necessary structures and practices are in place, so the threats posed by organised crime, terrorism and volume crime, and public safety issues that impact on everybody's day-to-day living priorities are priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am also very focused on ensuring we deal with a number of issues that are historic in nature but nevertheless identify where there are weak practices and bad practices in the organisation.  In doing that we also identify good practice and we make sure we shine a light on both.  There are good practices we have identified, and we make sure we put things in place to bring these forward.  Very important, in the context of the issues we are discussing here today, is where we identify issues such as we have identified here, we bring them to the fore and we make sure they are addressed, as in this case.  It is very important that we provide assurances to the committee and, by extension, to the public that actually we are not being remiss in doing this.  As soon as we became aware of these issues in 2015 they were immediately addressed, and we are actively engaging to ensure the recommendations highlighted in Mr. Kelly's report, albeit an interim report, are being fully implemented.  I have no doubt that as Mr. Kelly's work continues other issues will be identified, and we will also address these and deal with them.  I would like to provide assurances to the committee that we take this extraordinarily seriously.  The executive team is making sure all the issues are being addressed, but we have line managers who do the day-to-day business in this regard.</p></speech>

Would she be better sitting down with all the chief superintendents and the assistant commissioners to deal with core policing matters such as traffic management, terrorism and Border controls?  She is in here probably as often as the CEO of the HSE.  Would it be better if she did not have to do any of these things?  I asked for a proportionate breakdown.  I do not consider this the Commissioner's core business, as a layman in the street, but it is taking up a lot of time.  I am just trying to get a picture, for the people reading the transcript or watching this, of what proportion of the Commissioner's time is dedicated to firefighting, for want of a better expression, based on legacy structural deficiencies?</p></speech>

Going back over the years, we identified a number of positions we wanted to civilianise for the very reasons Deputy Murphy said, and get suitably qualified professional civilian members into the organisation to do this work.</p><p>Recently I tasked the deputy commissioner with this.  It has taken us an extraordinary length of time, despite the fact we have a HR section which is headed up by a civilian manager.  It is taking us a long time to get a workforce plan in place to do exactly what the Deputy has identified,  to gauge specifically the number of people.  I tasked the deputy commissioner with conducting a census across the organisation to identify that.  I will now ask him to talk specifically to that issue.</p></speech>

That did not necessarily mean this was where they were.  For some reason or another they may have been temporarily transferred to another duty or they may have been taken off the front line to perform some vital and critical administrative function in the absence of civilian staff to do that particular work.  At this early stage the data are just coming in and are being cleaned in respect of going in to each of our divisions and districts, working with that original spreadsheet and then finding out exactly what everyone was doing on that day.  We hope to be able to present, in the next week or so, a detailed breakdown of what we would call the low-hanging fruit.  This would be the people who could immediately be transferred to the front line if we get civilian help in to replace them because they are doing vital work for us.  That runs to at least 200 personnel at this juncture but there is still more work to be done on this.</p> <p>  There is another tranche of people who are doing administration work, but they may be on restricted duties because of sickness or health issues.  It is important for the organisation to make sure those personnel are used and that we get best value for money out of those people, who want to come to work.  We must put them in a position that will not put their health in danger.</p> <p>  There is another cohort of people who would traditionally have been assigned to offices.  Consider, for example, a district superintendent's office in the country.  Traditionally a Garda clerk would have been assigned to that superintendent.  We have to ask if this is still the position and do we still need a garda doing that work.  More in-depth work must be done on this issue because there are many views around it such as the view that a Garda perspective is needed in that role.  If we have civilians coming in at the bottom rung, they can work their way through the organisation and there is no reason why, in time, those positions could not also be civilianised.  It is not going to happen overnight, it will be a challenge but we can see that it can be done in phases.</p></speech>

I will give a real live current example.  Tomorrow we will be working with the Policing Authority, which has taken over responsibility in this area, to short-list for the head of a strategic transformation office.  This post is at executive director level and is the equivalent of assistant  commissioner.  We have also identified other senior civilian positions.</p></speech>

Is this done in respect of garda&iacute; who may have studied accountancy to put them, for example, into a role to assist Mr. Kelly?  Is there a practice or procedure along those lines?</p></speech>

Over the years there was a practice that recognised people who had certain qualifications.  The moratorium on recruitment, especially on civilian recruitment, meant we were not able to get civilian staff in all the way back to 1996.  By necessity, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who had specific qualifications or who had skilled themselves up in certain areas were brought in to fill critical gaps in the organisation.  Working with the Policing Authority, we are now making sure we identify the skill sets we require in the organisation and then we look to hire suitably qualified professional civilians.</p></speech>

In the absence of these resources, can the Commissioner be confident about that in her role as Accounting Officer?</p></speech>

As I said to Deputies Cullinane and McDonald earlier, we are running a 21st century organisation on an 1940s architecture.

It is a very worthwhile exercise.  I believe that most people want to respect the Garda and want to work with it.  In my time as a local councillor our biggest problem was getting Governments to realise that more resources should be put into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order that it could work with us and we could see community garda&iacute; on the ground.  I wish I was going through this account with the representatives today and asking them about community policing and the Garda stations throughout the country, especially in Galway, but unfortunately this interim report is taking up our time.  It is most unfortunate.  I look forward to the day when we can get back to working with the Garda.  I preface my questions to the witnesses by saying that I cycled to the bus station on Tuesday and I had a light on the front and back of my bike.</p><p>When this report came out, the Commissioner was quoted in the media in January - please tell me if I am wrong:</p><blockquote>Garda Commissioner N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan has said there was no misuse of public funds in the management of the Garda College in Templemore.  Speaking on RT&Eacute;'s Today with Sean O'Rourke, she was asked about an audit that uncovered financial irregularities ... [The Commissioner said] &quot;My information and what I'm advised is that there is no misappropriation of money or misuse of public monies.  I think that's very important.  It is accounting practices that by today's standards would not be acceptable, but it does span back and they are legacy issues.&quot;</blockquote> <p>After what we have been through here today and after the report, which I am sure the Commissioner has read, does the Commissioner still stand by that?</p></speech>

The issue I am putting to Ms O'Sullivan is the question of trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When this information was published, the Commissioner's immediate comment was there was no misappropriation of money and no misuse of public moneys.  Was that not, at the very least, premature?</p></speech>

Having had discussions with the Garda head of internal audit who had prepared the report, I asked whether there was evidence of any misappropriation of money and the answer was "No".  There are certainly irregularities around the use and the movement of money.</p></speech>

A response at that point would be, "Jesus, look at what is emerging here".  The report is damning in my opinion on any level and yet the Commissioner went on Sean O'Rourke's programme to reassure the nation.  That is my opinion and she is disagreeing with me.  Second, the Commissioner minimised the importance of what happened by referring to it as accounting practices and legacy issues, and unacceptable practices now as opposed to the time it happened.  Is that not incorrect as well?</p></speech>

Let us look at the report of February 2017.  It has already been pointed out by my colleague that the instinctive reaction of a Commissioner, not to mention any other obligations on an officeholder, should have been to bring it to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General at the point when she became aware of it in July 2015.</p></speech>

I think what I would do now certainly would be to involve the Comptroller and Auditor General from an earlier point.  At that stage it was not clear whether the Comptroller and Auditor General had been informed - and we now know that the Comptroller and Auditor General had not been informed.  Part of the work that was initiated in July 2015 was to establish exactly who had been told about what.</p></speech>

In view of all of the scandals with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na there was an extra onus on the Commissioner at that point to involve an outside agency of the highest integrity to look at it.  Looking at this now, it looks like the Garda were trying to find out the extent of it and trying to contain it rather than accepting it was a complete mess that had continued from 2006.  A report on it from 2006 was not completed and the report on it in 2008 was absolutely damning.  Does Ms O'Sullivan accept that the report in 2008 was damning?</p></speech>

The further assurance that we can provide to the committee - and I think this is important - because the Deputy quite rightly identified the importance of the Garda College, the Garda College is a very important and integral part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly has identified in his report at point No. 4 that the vast majority - I do not want anybody to interpret my comment as minimising or diminishing it - but the reality is that Mr. Kelly can provide us with reasonable assurances that the staff costs, the management of vehicles, the Garda College imprest account are managed to a high standard and are compliant with the Garda finance code.  What we are talking about here is very serious and very grave but it is a portion of the activity at the Garda College.</p></speech>

There were 50 accounts and it has been identified - Ms O'Sullivan said they would not have had training at that time but they will have training now.

The company was not set up until 1993, so let us stop talking about a time earlier than 1993.  This audit looks at a period from 2009 onwards.  We are not looking at issues prior to that because there are very few records and that is something that is ongoing about which Mr. Kelly presumably will revert to us.  We are looking at the period from 2009 onwards.  We are looking at a company that was formed in 1992 and 1993 not way back in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s.  During that period of time, we were attesting garda&iacute; and yet the witnesses from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are saying that the garda&iacute; had little training in financial matters.  Let us look at page dealing with St. Raphael's credit union, which also lists temporary investment accounts.</p><p>Look at the list.  It includes Bank of Ireland temporary investment accounts, a Zurich investment policy and so on.  There is a huge number of bank accounts.  There is Royal mutual investment, New Ireland Assurance and so on.  All these accounts have been open.  I understand garda&iacute; cannot open accounts without the permission of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We will look at ethics and disclosure, and perhaps Mr. Kelly can help me, because he has set out all this in his report.  I refer to page 21.  Under the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, officeholders over a certain grade must make certain disclosures and this includes garda&iacute; of the rank of superintendent and above.  The second paragraph states that Garda members, including superintendents and chief superintendents, have acted as directors of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sportsfield since its incorporation in 1993.  There is clearly a breach of the Act there.</p></speech>

He offered the view to the then Commissioner that as the State had not provided money to develop and improve the social and sporting culture of Garda students, the companies and committees identified in the 2008 report were formed as the only means to develop and improve the social and sporting culture of the college.  He goes on to say that he further offered the view that there was no suggestion that any funds generated were used for other purposes and that the moneys collected in these funds were contributed either directly or indirectly by members who use the Garda college.  We will come back to this deputy commissioner who was in charge of the Garda college which was training young garda&iacute;.  This was his view.  He offered the strong belief that any surplus money did not belong to the State and could not be used except for the welfare and development of facilities for members at the Garda college.  Was that offered in a written report?</p></speech>

It is impossible to say we have confidence in the Garda if this is what is happening even now.  This issue dates back to 2006.  We have the Commissioner's initial statement which I have quoted minimising the issue and saying it was a legacy issue.  Then the position changes when we realise it is a very serious and ongoing issue and the internal audit had to continue.  Then we have Mr. Barrett telling us it would not have happened in his previous life.  It is very serious.  How could it happen that this matter was not acted on in 2006 or 2008?  Yesterday and the day before the witnesses suddenly became aware that the very high ranking garda in charge had a completely different view from that of the Commissioner.  Does the Commissioner understand why my mouth is open?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is unfortunate that we are here discussing a report of this nature.  It is very important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not suffer any irregularities, that it is transparent and that it is seen to be so.  We must ensure we try to mitigate as much as possible the reputational damage done to the force.  The report before us is shocking.</p> <p>  On foot of that, the first question I want to ask concerns risk management procedures.  I note on page 16 of the interim audit report that "[t]here was a requirement from 2004 onwards from the Department of Finance for all Votes to have Risk Management Procedures in place" and that this happened from 2010 through Garda management.  That is obviously a huge delay.  We were giving out earlier about Bord na gCon's delay in its process, but this is not something one would expect in such an advanced force as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The final line of the same paragraph reads: "Despite these issues being identified as risks by the Finance Directorate, they were not included in the Garda College Risk Register, the Finance Directorate Risk Register or the Corporate Risk Register."  Has this been rectified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.1429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#AAA00300"><p>Yes.  Since the last day of March this year, we have launched a new risk framework which has been worked on over the past year and a half.  Our corporate risk register currently includes matters pertaining to finance and the management of finance.  This is a new system which will be cascaded throughout the organisation over the coming weeks, and we hope by year end that we will have a top-down, bottom-up approach to risk management right down to district level.  That is what we hope to achieve this year.</p></speech>

This is approximately 13 years late.  We are not talking about the dark ages when we talk about 2004.  We are talking about a very modern setting.  Why was there such a delay in getting around to implementing these issues that are set out by policy?</p></speech>

It was brand new to the organisation at that stage and took much time to get bedded in.  We did have teething problems with it.  We had issues about raising the awareness and establishing it as part of the culture of the organisation, and it was not fit for purpose as such.  It was seen as maybe a tick-box exercise, so we needed to renew it, which is what has happened over the past 18 months.  We have put much energy and work into it.  The system will be tested this year, and we will work very closely with our internal audit and the audit committee, which has seen the system.  We made a presentation to the committee at a recent meeting, and it is very happy with it.  It looks fit for purpose but it still has to be tested.</p></speech>

How can I have confidence that the Garda is able to respond to changes that were required and will be required into the future?  Is the Garda able to respond to these changes now?</p></speech>

Again, it is very difficult for us to explain what happened before 2014, but that year, on my taking up the position of interim Commissioner and, as such, becoming interim Accounting Officer, I initiated a review of the risk management procedures that were in place.  The deputy commissioner led out on it.  During that period, working with governance experts, the IPA and others, we have been making sure our risk management practices are up to best practice standards.  The new revised procedures that have been put in place have been presented to the audit committee to make sure it is happy with them.  My understanding is that the Policing Authority has also been informed of the revised procedures, and we will keep them under review.  As I mentioned to Deputy Murphy earlier, we are all engaged with the IPA in providing training to all our managers, both Garda and civilian members, to make sure they are aware of the current practices and governance arrangements.</p></speech>

And he is mentioned earlier in another entity.  From a common sense perspective, it seems very strange that an auditor would furnish an opinion saying that books of account have been kept except for the cash records.  As anyone knows, in a bar, cash is the most important thing and that there be controls to ensure its safeguarding and that it is accounted for correctly.  It seems very strange.  I note in the paragraph after that, that Mr. Kelly had discussions with him in relation to that.  Can Mr. Kelly expand on those discussions?</p></speech>

If I was looking at a bar with &euro;400,000 sitting in its current account, with years passing - even though activity had dropped with the moratorium there was still significant money there - and no accounts presented.

One of the bars has closed, so that was one of the actions taken.  The bar is not open at the moment, it is currently closed.

It is clear that common sense should apply in issues like this.  Ignorance is no defence.  I need assurance from the Commissioner on the changes that have happened in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that these issues would be reported immediately to the appropriate structures and identified and immediate safeguards would be put in place to ensure they do not happen again.  It is very easy to point to a lack of skills or administration, but a lot of these issues are common sense issues, that an ordinary individual would realise that they were wrong.</p></speech>

It is one thing to bring it to our attention but that appropriate actions are taken.

When they come, they should have answers.  I have sat and listened very patiently and I am none the wiser than I was at the beginning of the meeting.  Far from a skill gap emerging, I see incredible dexterity and a very deliberate system to funnel moneys in particular directions.  This shows remarkable skill and does not happen by accident.  I am sure the Commissioner would not claim it does.  The systems were consciously put in place and were in place for a very long time.  Regardless of whether people understood or cared about the seriousness of what they were involved in, they demonstrated remarkable ingenuity and determination.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly said he had been in position since 2007.

He is not getting it and he is all around the houses for a period of years.  Of course, he could not verify what was going on in the college because he does not have the basis to do it.  There are memoranda and communications flying left, right and centre.  What strikes me is that while all these little diversionary skirmishes are taking place, the facts are not got at.

There is something very important that needs clarification.  We are talking about something in isolation.  The Deputy has mentioned on a number of occasions the 2008 report.</p></speech>

The Commissioner may come back in at the end and rehearse the general scope, if she so wishes, but we are dealing with a very specific issue and I want specific clarification.  We need to clear up the question of whether it was a five-minute or a two-hour exchange because one version is correct and the other incorrect.

Section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is a provision under which matters can be informed to the Minister.  I received a report from the deputy commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, which attached a report from the head of legal.  As Mr. Ruane stated, there is client confidentiality and privilege attaching, but I have no difficulty in saying what I did on receipt of the report.  We had had discussions at the executive level about setting up this committee, making sure that all of the individuals that needed to be informed about this were informed and that we got an holistic view of precisely what we were talking about.  We then decided that the group would be established and would include representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality so that everyone would be completely sighted and <i>au fait </i>with what we were doing, that being, trying to find out the context of this.  The Magee report was in 2008.  We wanted to know who had knowledge and sight of this.  It is important to say that, in the funding arrangements that were put in place in the college, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance extensively advised on those structures.  We were trying to establish what we were dealing with and, more importantly, what needed to be done.</p></speech>

I could not compete with Deputy Aylward, to be fair.  I have a few general questions.  I will ask a couple of these questions of every witness.  Witnesses may feel free if they need to come forward to the microphone.</p> <p>  The Garda Commissioner said that she was told briefly about this before the meeting on 27 July.  Was 27 July the first date on which she heard about this?</p></speech>

Were any of the witnesses here today, including Department officials, aware of the issues relating to the 2008 and 2010 reports before June 2015?  Remember that I am asking every single person, so if anyone needs to step up to microphone, please do so.  Was anyone aware of any issues?  Okay.  I will rephrase my question.  Had any witness any suspicions of financial irregularities in Templemore before June 2015?  This is for the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No.  Okay.  I just wanted to get that on the record.</p></speech>

Pages 14 and 15 of my report detail what I knew or the attempts I was making to gain information.  As discussed with Deputy McDonald, they outline my seeking information, being uneasy about issues, bringing my concerns to the Garda Commissioner at the time and being provided with assurances and a summary report from Mr. Culhane.  At that stage, I accepted the assurances provided.  After that date, the college effectively closed down.  From 2011 onwards to 2014 and 2015, there was very little activity in the college.</p></speech>

The report would then have been referred to the chief superintendent in the college to take various actions.

Page 4 of the report states that college management responded in March 2010 rejecting many of the recommendations of the finance directorate's report.  It goes on to say that some of the issues were addressed by the college management but the structural issues in college governance were not addressed and, over the years, some of the improvements in financial controls were reversed.  Whatever improvements were made, some were actually reversed.  Far from being in a position to be helpful and to implement recommendations, the report says college management rejected many of the recommendations of Mr. Culhane's report.

Having said that, I have seen a letter in the last number of days, namely, the instruction from the Commissioner to the CAO with the six recommendations which were not implemented, which had on its margins a record of the Commissioner having mentioned it to the Secretary General at the time.

I understand that Mr. O'Callaghan is only representing the Department of Justice and Equality today and cannot be holistic.  I must declare for absolute transparency that I am from the town as Mr. O'Callaghan and I know him.  The Department was not aware of the financial irregularities in Templemore training college in June 2015.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  I respect that it is the answer.  It is not a reflection on Mr. O'Callaghan.  The idea, however, that since 1960, as well as since 1983 and the Walsh report which the Commissioner referenced herself, the Department had no idea there were financial irregularities in Templemore is, frankly, incredible.</p><p> I will move to some specific questions and I need Mr. Barrett in the room.  He had left but while he is composing himself, does Mr. O'Callaghan or do his colleagues, such as Ms Barry or Mr. McDonald, wish to make a contribution?  If there is anything they feel should be addressed in a different way, they need to say it now.</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman asked about irregularities and I will answer the question.  The Department, as far as I am aware, was not aware of irregularities in the college.  In terms of the structure of the finances of the college and how it was set up and arranged, it was done at a time when the Department had responsibility for the Garda Vote and the Secretary General of the Department was the Accounting Officer.  I am not saying the Department did not know in 1992 when the arrangements were put in place what had been put in place.  It clearly did as it had responsibility for that.  It presumed that things worked as intended.  I have seen nothing to suggest the Department knew at any time until 2015 of irregularities.</p></speech>

We have found on a file indications that there were after the 2008 report conversations or meetings with the then Garda Commissioner, the then chief administrative officer and the then Secretary General of the Department.  Again, I cannot speak for the people that had them.  It is important in the context of our discussion that there are indications on the file that external advices were sought in terms of how to address those matters.</p></speech>

I respect that the representatives here are not long in the Department in some cases and there is no inference involving them at all.  They cannot have complete knowledge of what happened before their arrival.  The information would be helpful to this committee as there are some questions we must ask.  We have the information from 2006 and the 2008 report, and that is probably the first time the issues were encapsulated.  We also have the 2010 report.  From evidence today we find these reports went to a certain level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but never made it to the internal auditor.  Is that a fair summary?  If anybody has a contradiction, they should speak up now.</p></speech>

I considered the matter and discussed it with the executive.  I was happy with the steps we identified to be taken.  It was clear that there was a 2008 report and a 2010 report.  My understanding is that at that stage, no further investigations had been done.  A number of issues were raised in those reports and we needed to understand what had been done with them.  We needed to understand precisely who knew what, what had been done and that we would be in a position to be fully informed and fully inform the Minister.

The reason for my line of questioning is that Mr. Barrett made a report in July 2015.  His role changed in September 2015.</p></speech>

In 2014, even before Mr. Barrett came into the organisation, there was a Government commitment to reform.  We fully accepted the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate reports - all of them - including the report in 2015.  As part of the process a number of recommendations were made and we accepted them.</p> <p>  I mentioned this earlier in speaking to some of the Deputies.  We are running a 21st century organisation on a 1940s corporate architecture.</p></speech>

We commenced that change in 2014.  We put in place a revised organisational structure.  In line with what happens in other organisations, in particular, in other policing organisations, one of the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate report was that there would be a deputy commissioner for governance and strategy.  We put that in place.  We also put in place a governance structure and realigned functions.  It has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Barrett's report of July 2015 &ndash; nothing.</p></speech>

Obviously, none of you were aware of anything before June 2015.

I was in the D&aacute;il speaking during Oral Questions and Topical Issues.  It happened to come up that way.  I have no wish to go over ground that has already been covered or questions that have already been asked, because it would only amount to repetition at this hour of the evening.</p> <p>  First, I will make an observation.  From what I have heard and from the evidence I have read, the financial controls at Templemore Garda training college were completely out of control.  There was no control.  As far as oversight and corporate governance is concerned there was no control, from what I have heard.  I think it is a poor reflection on everyone to note that this was happening for decades.  The figures I have heard suggest this was the case since 1982, but nothing happened until 2015, really.</p><p>It is unbelievable, in this modern day and age, that such time elapsed and people or individuals were allowed to carry on as if they owned the place.  </p><p> As many as 13 bank accounts have been closed down.  What type of business has 13 bank accounts?  How many bank accounts did Templemore college have in total?  What type of bank accounts were they?  Who used them?  It sounds to me like the accounts were used to operate a slush fund.  Proper governance would never allow such behaviour.  What were the bank accounts used for?  Were there 30, 40 or more bank accounts?    </p></speech>

Some of them were investment accounts.  Some of them related to specific sports type committees.  The details can be found in Appendix 1 on page 41 of the report, the ones we described.</p></speech>

We are implementing all of the recommendations of the audit report.  A number of them have already been implemented, including closing down a number of those bank accounts.  That process is continuing, to finalise it.</p></speech>

The option has ceased for the moment.  The local people availed of the facilities for years.  The college had a good relationship with the townspeople and people from the surrounding areas but they have been excluded all of a sudden.  The local people depended on the college for facilities.  The college is a public facility that has been paid for by taxpayers' money.  People can no longer use the swimming pool, access playing facilities and the GAA can no longer access the facilities.  The cessation of the arrangement is a strong attack on the long established and strong relationship that existed between the Garda and the people in the community.  Has that relationship been sacrificed because of this matter that we are discussing?</p></speech>

Over the years, since the Garda College moved to Templemore, the relationship with the local community has grown from strength to strength.  It is a very important relationship that we very much value, as we do with communities around the country.  It is very important because, over the years, the college made its excellent facilities available to the community.  The arrangement built very strong bonds and links that we greatly benefitted from over the years.  We were very happy to make our contribution to the community and, indeed, the development of the area.</p> <p>  Regulation has changed considerably since the arrangement existed.  We have had to close down a number of the facilities on which the chief administrative officer can talk.  Again, we have to look and see how we can rebuild the opportunities to use those facilities because we are very committed to doing so.  Regulation and governance has changed considerably and we have to look at how we are going to revise those arrangements.  I call on Mr. Nugent to comment.</p></speech>

I thought it would be more appropriate to say the following at the end of this session but I will mention it now because the Deputy raised the matter.</p><p>I represent Templemore.  I know that the people of Templemore are of huge value to the Garda College and <i>vice versa</i>.  Simply put, the facilities exist.  The facilities are not being used by the Garda for obvious purposes.  The community, which has worked with and facilitated the college in many ways, should have access to the facilities.  In the spirit of partnership will the Garda please consider allowing the community to use the facilities in the future?  The organisation may have to get its ducks in a row to do so.  All of a sudden a ladies GAA team can no longer use a pitch and a swimming and loads of other facilities are no longer available.  People in the community do no have the same standard of facilities as the college.  The local people have facilitated the college and made sacrifices in their own little way.</p></speech>

Getting one's ducks in a row is a very well worded plea.  There is no process.  We are not saying we will exclude people permanently but we need to sort out new administrative arrangements around the operation of those facilities.  The services had previously been provided, I mean our licensing regime, by the OPW.  As part of our discussions around that, this is a process that we need to take on.  We need to sort it out.  There is a broader piece around communications with the community and I think we can do better. It is something that we are interested in.</p></speech>

The facilities already exist but they are not being used properly now.  It is always a good thing to maintain a good relationship between the Garda and local people.  I urge the Garda to re-open the facilities or make them available again to the local community as soon as possible.</p></speech>

As the chief administrative officer has outlined.  One of our concerns is communication with the local community.  The local people have greatly contributed to the college over the years and to the whole fabric of the community, broadly.  We plan on having some type of a town hall meeting because there is a lot of fear and trepidation that not alone the facilities but the local economy and community will be impacted in some way.  We want to meet people to get that.</p></speech>

Before Deputy Cullinane commences I urge everyone to be concise in the next round of questioning as Deputy Connolly wishes to comment.</p> <p>  I thank the Commissioner for her comments, which are critically important.  I welcome what she said about a meeting and agree that people feel nervous with everything that has happened.  The college has a lot of facilities, which must be shared in an appropriate manner.  I presume Mr. Nugent will be the person to deal with this matter.  I understand that the Garda must get its ducks in a row and I know Mr. Nugent will do so as quickly as possible.  We are talking about swimming pools, playing fields and access to the athletics club.  Let us call a spade a spade and not avoid talking about the elephant in the room.  We are talking about a golf club that has been established for a substantial period.  I would appreciate if all of these issues were sorted out quickly.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Cullinane.</p></speech>

At the time I talked about the internal audit report being comprised of a litany of failures and used the term sloppy practice.  Mr. Kelly used the terms irregular practice and maladministration, which I think we can accept.</p> <p>  Earlier I asked questions about the culture of the force.  What is the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when these types of issues come to light?  How does the corporate body of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deal with them?  Are they dealt with in an appropriate manner?  After almost five hours of questioning and getting answers I am satisfied that the culture is not to root out wrongdoing and ensure the appropriate people have the appropriate information, and it certainly did not happen in this case.  That is my opinion.</p> <p>  The Commissioner can comment at the end but I have a couple of questions for Mr. Kelly.  Following on from Teachta McDonald's line of questioning earlier, I commend the fact that the Garda internal audit section, GIAS, did eventually publish a report.  It is the reason we are here because we now are in a position to see exactly what happened.  Does Mr. Kelly accept that it took a long time for the internal audit division to reach that point?</p></speech>

I can make no comment on it other than the fact the only corroboration I have in my calendar is when Michael Howard, who was the chairman of the audit committee, came to see me for that one meeting on 2 June 2016, 11 months after.  He came equipped with a report he got from Mr. Kelly and he seemed to have had that for only a brief period.  Whether it was done orally or whether there was a big discussion, I cannot say.  I do not attend those meetings.  Mr. Kelly can vouch for when he gave it to Mr. Howard, and that was ten months later or whatever.</p></speech>

My final question is for the Commissioner.  I have a different world view from her.  I see things a little differently because I have listened to every answer she has given.  When legislation is put in place, it applies to everybody.  I have responsibilities as a politician under the standards in public office, SIPO, legislation and under all Acts passed by Parliament.  I am one of those who is privileged to be in a position to put those laws in place.  We are all obliged to implement those laws and abide by them.  Instances have been illuminated in this report where bank accounts were opened without the permission of a Minister, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were directors of companies they should not been directors of, and land owned by the OPW was leased and the money generated used to pay for services that it should not been used for.  It is wholly unsatisfactory that there is a recommendation that &euro;128,000 derived from the Dromad Farm leasing arrangement be paid back to the OPW.  The taxpayer will foot the bill but, interestingly, I have discovered that the repayments to the OPW started in 2014.  Why did they start in 2014?  What triggered that?</p></speech>

Given that most of the &euro;128,000 that has to be repaid has been spent in areas where it should not have been spent, why is it acceptable for the taxpayer to have to foot the bill and that is the end of it as far as I can see?

I have made that very clear from the outset.  If I have not, I am quite willing to repeat it again.  The practices that happened in the Garda college should not have happened.  They were not acceptable.  We have stepped up to implement it.  I would like to come back to something.  The Deputy said he would give me an opportunity to finish at the end.</p></speech>

It is much more than just a modernisation programme.  One does not change culture overnight.  It takes a very long time.  I can tell the Deputy and the committee that we have undertaken a programme of work to change the culture.  Our aim is to empower people to raise the issues we are talking about here, to identify what the issues are, to have the courage and the confidence to speak up about them - to shine a light on them, to use the Deputy's phrase - and then to be able to do something about it and work with other stakeholders-----</p></speech>

There are serious questions to be answered in terms of permission from the Minister and knowledge.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017050400002#PPP04800"><p>Because it is something that concerns me will the Commissioner confirm in writing to us that between June 2015 and the date on which Mr. Kelly found out about it there was no correspondence, emails or documentation in the organisation which stated the report should not be brought to light, sent on or distributed or that people should not be made aware of it?  Will the Commissioner verify in writing to the committee that there is no such correspondence, emails or documents?  There are a number of requests for documents and information.  There is a huge volume as a result of this meeting and our hard working staff have kept a note of them.  The Commissioner has obviously kept a note of them also and we may be corresponding with her to make sure there is a correlation.  </p> <p>  In summary, this has been an extraordinary sitting and I thank the witnesses for their time.  I do not think I will ever attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts as extraordinary and incredible as this one.  Much of the evidence given was contradictory.  I do not think there is a unified theme, but that is just my observation.  There are massive issues.  There are also cultural issues in the organisation which say an awful lot about it.  I do not have confidence that the issues are being dealt with properly.  I do not have confidence that the issues have been dealt with appropriately in the past two years because of the trawl for information, the way information is being handled and the fact that people who try to have information brought to the very top of the organisation and made public are being thwarted on many levels.  We saw it happen in 2006, 2008, 2010 and, it could be argued, up to 2015.  As a committee, it is something on which we will have to reflect and I am sure we will have more questions.</p> <p>  We have a date for the consideration of Vote 20 - 13 July - but I understand Mr. Kelly will not have concluded his work.  With the agreement of the committee members present, we can use part of the time to get an update on these issues because we will have received a lot of correspondence in the preceding weeks.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I could not agree more.  May we have Mr. Barrett's documentation in the next 24 hours?  Much of it hangs on his documentation.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank all of the witnesses, including the Garda Commissioner and her staff and all those sitting patiently at the back; the representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, for participating in the meeting and the material they supplied to the committee.</p></speech>

The committee agreed that COM (2017) 133, a proposal for a Council decision regarding the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, in the joint committee of the regional convention on pan-Euro Mediterranean preferential rules of origin with regard to the amendments of Appendix II to that convention, does not warrant further scrutiny.  On schedule A, COM (2017) 114, a proposal for regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on European business statistics, is considered significant and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will assist the committee in its scrutiny of the proposal later in the meeting.  Details of committee decisions made relating to EU proposals are published on its website.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2342" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee.  Some people here may know that I spent five and a half years across the corridor as the Taoiseach's economic adviser, but this is the first time I have had the opportunity to address an Oireachtas committee, so I am thankful for the privilege.</p> <p>  The committee may be aware that in December we opened our first office in Dublin.  The EIB has offices in most European countries.  With me is Cormac Murphy, our recently appointed head of office.  As vice president of the EIB since September 2016, among my responsibilities is oversight of our operations in Ireland.  I was nominated by the Government to be one of the eight vice presidents of the EIB last September as part of the constituency that Ireland is involved in at the EIB, alongside Greece, Romania and Denmark.</p> <p>  The EIB was created in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome.  The EIB is the European Union&rsquo;s long term lending institution, owned directly by the 28 EU member states - although the number is an issue that might be revised - and we are often referred to as "the EU bank".  Our mission is to use loans and other financial instruments, such as equity-type instruments and funds, to finance long-term investment projects that support EU policy.  We are headquartered in Luxembourg.  We also have a subsidiary, the European Investment Fund, which was created in 1992 to further support Europe&rsquo;s small and medium-sized enterprises to access finance.  We are self-financing in that we do not raise our money through government budgets or EU budgets but rather on the international capital markets.  The EIB is the largest international public bank and the largest non-state borrower in the world.  We are approximately twice the size of the World Bank by lending volumes each year.  On average, we finance approximately 500 projects each year in over 160 countries.  During 2016, we provided &euro;83.8 billion in total financing via the EIB and the European Investment Fund, of which 90% was in the EU itself.  Approximately 10% is invested outside the EU and that percentage is growing.  Our financing  supported a total of &euro;280 billion in investment.  This is an important principle for the EIB.  Our financing of projects is intended to mobilise other financiers to also provide financing.  Our success is measured not by how much we lend ourselves but by how much we catalyse in terms of total investment.</p> <p>  Our ability to support the European economy was significantly enhanced in 2015 when the European Council and Parliament agreed on a new joint European Commission and EIB initiative, known as the investment plan for Europe or the Juncker plan.  The aim is to use &euro;16 billion of budget guarantees from the EU budget together with &euro;5 billion of our own capital, which forms the &euro;21 billion European Fund for Strategic Investments.  Using that capital, we can significantly expand our own lending and our own investments.  The aim is to catalyse a total of &euro;315 billion of additional investments in Europe between the middle of 2015 and the middle of 2018.  The EIB is not just concerned with lending more, it is also concerned with being involved in higher-risk lending.  We are seeking to move into market gaps for higher risk projects which would otherwise not be financed, particularly in areas such as transport, broadband, energy, innovation, energy efficiency and SME financing.</p> <p>  The EIB has been a long-term financing partner for Ireland since the country's accession and has provided nearly &euro;15.5 billion of financing for investments since it joined the EU.  Our lending activities here significantly increased during the financial crisis, with annual lending almost double the engagement before 2008.  During the crisis years we significantly expanded our support to Ireland at a time when other commercial banks and private sector financing partners were pulling out of Ireland.  In the past five years, EIB lending in Ireland totalled &euro;4.2 billion, supporting among other projects the motorways programme, the Dublin Port expansion, Dublin Airport's terminal 2, the LUAS extension, university campus expansions - we have been involved with university loans for every single university in Ireland except one, which we are about to sign - schools, primary care centres and social housing, to name a few, at a time when other sources of financing for enterprise and infrastructure investment were being cut back significantly.</p> <p>  Before the banking crisis, the EIB lending in Ireland averaged around &euro;400 million per year.  This year we expect to provide more than &euro;1 billion.  The EIB is also diversifying its engagement, last year financing 13 initiatives across a range of sectors compared with just three in 2008.  Part of the reason for the expansion in our lending is the strength of our relationships with new entities in Ireland, which is something that was absent before the crisis.  In particular, our relationship with the National Development Finance Agency, which is part of the NTMA, and the SBCI, continues to strengthen.  During 2014, the EIB provided a &euro;400 million facility to the newly-established SBCI, representing 50% of the initial funding for the SBCI at low-cost conditions, all aimed at kick-starting increased lending to SMEs through the SBCI.  More recently, the European Investment Fund and the SBCI signed the first EU programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, COSME, agreement in Ireland.  This transaction, guaranteed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments, allows the SBCI to support &euro;100 million of agriculture-related loans to 2,000 small and medium-sized enterprises by commercial banks in Ireland over the next three years.  In fact, the facility, as Mr. Ashmore will attest, has been fully drawn down at this stage.</p> <p>  In addition, the European Investment Fund has supported a number of equity funds in Ireland.  The EIB is primarily concerned with debt financing, but the European Investment Fund has also supported a number of equity funds for high-tech sectors.  It has also supported a &euro;20 million Business Angels co-investment instrument with Enterprise Ireland and a guarantee in favour of Microfinance Ireland issued under the EU programme for employment and social innovation to support very small businesses.</p> <p>  To further support Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic recovery, particularly in the context of the growing infrastructure bottlenecks here, as well as out of recognition that Ireland is uniquely exposed to the economic effects of Brexit, the EIB hopes to increase its level of support for Irish projects to an even greater degree.</p><p>With this aim in mind, as well as opening a permanent office in Dublin, we established with the Irish Government last December an Ireland-EIB financing group.  The group, which is chaired by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, includes senior management from the EIB, led by the president and myself, alongside the Minister the Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and other Ministers from the Irish Government, as well as senior officials from relevant Irish Government Departments and agencies, including Mr. Nick Ashmore.  To support the financing group, a number of thematic working groups have been created covering financing connectivity, financing social infrastructure and financing enterprise.</p><p> Without prejudging the outcome of the detailed and constructive discussions currently taking place, areas where we have signalled the potential for greater EIB financing include increased lending to the Irish sovereign for Exchequer capital projects to be identified in the revised capital programme; increased mobilisation of private finance, under PPPs and similar structures, for infrastructure investment including in roads, public transport, social housing and other areas, consistent with the Government&rsquo;s need to expand infrastructure investment while staying within the EU fiscal rules; direct lending support for the investment programmes of Irish semi-State companies; increased direct investment in mid-sized Irish corporates, including through equity-type products; credit guarantees to Irish commercial banks to increase their lending into key sectors, such as agribusiness, residential and business energy saving projects and the SME sector, consistent with the commercial banks&rsquo; own needs to preserve scarce capital while financing a growing economy and supporting those sectors particularly exposed to Brexit.  To have maximum effect, such initiatives will often combine EU and national budget resources, as well as EIB and Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, funding and capital; and increased project finance for the renewable energy sector in Ireland, including solar. </p><p> The Ireland-EIB financing group has committed to meet at least twice a year and the next meeting, planned for late May in Luxembourg, will review progress with the objective of producing a strong pipeline of projects across multiple sectors. </p><p> I will conclude my opening remarks and am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Ms Jillian Mahon, head of funding and strategic initiatives.</p> <p>  By the end of December 2016, the SBCI has supported more than 12,500 SMEs with more than &euro;540 million in low-cost loans and other forms of finance.  Our average loan size is &euro;43,000 but our loans have ranged in size from &euro;1,500 to &euro;5 million.  We have been successful in achieving a portfolio that is well balanced in terms of where our borrowers are located and in terms of the sectors in which they operate.  A particular feature of note is that 84% of all loans have been used for investment purposes, which means we are supporting the longer-term development of businesses.  A further 11% of loans have been used to meet working capital requirements, while 5% have been used to refinance loans owed to banks exiting the Irish market.  In short, we are supporting investment, working capital and refinance lending to SMEs in every part of Ireland and in a range of sectors &ndash; agriculture; wholesale-retail; accommodation and food; administration and support; manufacturing; transport; construction and more.  We have achieved this by partnering with eight on-lenders &ndash; three banks and five non-bank institutions.  This model has been very effective in helping us to meet our objectives. </p> <p>  The SBCI is the national promotional finance institution akin to similar, albeit much larger institutions in other European countries such as KfW in Germany, ICO in Spain or BPI in France.  The SBCI&rsquo;s initial approach has been to provide long-term large-scale liquidity on a low-cost wholesale basis.  The SBCI has sourced over &euro;1.2 billion in low-cost funding from KfW, the German promotional lender; the European Investment Bank; the Council of Europe Development Bank; and domestic sources in the NTMA and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The role of SBCI on-lending partners is that of retailer using the SBCI&rsquo;s liquidity as raw material for their lending products.  These on-lenders are a mix of smaller, specialist lenders with a focus on specific niches, Finance Ireland, Merrion Fleet, First Citizen Finance, Bibby and Fexco, and established banks with nationwide footprints that can reach a mass market, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  A major benefit of this wholesale lending model is that it facilitates increased competition in the market for credit to SMEs, while giving the SBCI nationwide reach. </p> <p>  Through our involvement, some of the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lending partners have been able to enter new market segments, providing finance or leasing products they have not provided in the past, bringing additional lending capacity, broader choice and lower interest rates to the SMEs that need the finance offered.  Through these partners, the SBCI has been able to offer term loans, asset leasing, agricultural leasing, contract hire for vehicles and invoice finance &ndash; all at lower rates or more flexible terms than were previously available in the market.  The SBCI is set to continue to expand its liquidity offering as it has a lot more capacity to provide finance to new on-lenders and is in active talks with several potential new on-lending partners.  The SBCI expect to have more announcements in this regard in the coming months.  </p> <p>  In addition, the SBCI recently commenced a new risk-sharing line of business.  Risk-sharing offers the SBCI the opportunity to target new specific SME market segments that may have difficulty in accessing finance.  In a first step, the SBCI was appointed in October 2016 as the operator and manager of the credit guarantee scheme, CGS, provided by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  A new version of this scheme, CGS 2017, will be deployed in the next few months.  This was closely followed by the launch of the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the European Commission and the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s COSME programme.  This is a ground-breaking policy measure in the Irish market and the first use of the COSME programme, which is also part of the Juncker plan or the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  Crucially for the SBCI, it represents the first time that the SBCI itself is taking on risk-sharing with other lenders &ndash; in this case, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  This initiative has enabled farmers to borrow up to &euro;150,000 at a special rate of 2.95% over periods of up to six years to address the difficult market conditions they have faced recently.  Based on the data received so far from the three participating banks, we anticipate that approximately 4,000 farmers will draw down low-cost loans under this scheme. </p> <p>  The SBCI is working to source other European supports and funding with a view to introducing new credit measures to address other market failures in the future, building a central conduit for European supports to the Irish market.  The SBCI also recognises the need to take a counter-cyclical approach so it avoids reinforcing any prospective excessive credit deployment. </p> <p>  One challenge we have faced is generating awareness among SMEs of the benefits SBCI-supported finance can bring to them.  The SBCI is very much open for business and is continuing to engage in an intensive SME awareness campaign based around local networking and brand-building events in every region in Ireland.  The SBCI has sought to arrange these events in conjunction with local business interest groups such as chambers of commerce, third level institutions and business advisory groups or law or accounting firms.  We are also aware that we do not operate in isolation but as part of a suite of government supports for SMEs and we look to collaborate with other groups such as Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, especially on communication. </p> <p>  The SBCI results show that its efforts have been successful but it is keen to keep building awareness among SMEs of its role and what it can offer and would welcome any assistance members can provide in putting the SBCI in contact with the businesses that it is here to serve. </p> <p>That concludes my opening remarks.  I hope members have found them helpful and we will be happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

The profile of the EIB has improved considerably in Ireland in recent months, not least through his own appointment and the opening of its office in Dublin.  It is good to see its activity ramping up and it hopes to reach about &euro;1 billion of investment into Ireland this year.  </p> <p>  There is a general acceptance that there is a need to increase capital investment in the economy, and a key constraint is the fiscal rules.  Can Mr. McDowell clarify the different platforms through which the EIB can provide funding, whether it is off-balance sheet in the form of PPPs or direct Exchequer capital expenditure which would be on-balance sheet?  Can Mr. McDowell address what opportunities there are for Ireland to increase capital investment using the finance available through the EIB but in the context of the constraint imposed by the fiscal rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#D00600"><p>It is a matter for EUROSTAT but generally PPPs are off the balance sheet.  They have to be judged case by case.  We can also lend directly to the sovereign, which we do frequently through the NTMA.</p><p>The NTMA identified projects for us on an annual basis for which it would like EIB financing.  The third area that we can support is commercial semi-State utilities, which generally are also classified by EUROSTAT and the CSO as private sector bodies from the perspective of Government statistics.  Even though most of them are fully owned by the taxpayer, because most of their revenues are generated through commercial charges, their statistical classification is as private bodies so our financing for utilities is off the Government's balance sheet.</p><p> I will go through each of these areas.  We have done about ten PPP transactions in Ireland over the past nine years.  We regard Ireland as probably one of the most sophisticated countries in terms of PPP project development in terms of the institutional capacity here.  The NDFA is really at the cutting edge in terms of institutional capacity.  We certainly regard Ireland as a very reliable partner, to the extent where I am happy to say we would do a lot more financing of PPPs in Ireland were they available in the capital programme.  That is a message we have conveyed to the authorities here, that in the context of the revised capital programme if there was a political consensus or decision that, on top of traditional direct Exchequer financing of infrastructure, there was a willingness to do more PPPs, depending on the details, we would be happy to be the main financing partner.</p></speech>

Does he have a view on the 10% rule we have here domestically, that no more than 10% of our annual capital expenditure can be accounted for by PPPs?  Is that overly restrictive in the current environment and how does it compare with how other European Union member states account for and deal with PPPs in terms of their own national budgets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#E00300"><p>I would say Ireland has been an extensive user of PPPs compared with EU countries over the past decade.  There is no doubt that particular constraint is beginning to slow the number of PPPs coming through the project pipeline.  It certainly is a political and policy matter for the Irish authorities so I would not like to comment directly on the choice of how the Irish authorities finance infrastructure.  Suffice it to say there are some other European countries who would have a much more ambitious approach to financing infrastructure, particularly the Netherlands.  It is probably the most ambitious country in terms of the development of PPPs to finance infrastructure projects.  I do not think it is a coincidence that the Netherlands tends to come on top if one looks at surveys across Europe, in particular surveys among business, in terms of which countries have the best infrastructure for business.</p></speech>

Having a steady consistent pipeline is important.  PPPs should not be looked at as a short-term stimulus response for the economy.  There needs to be a strong political consensus that they are a tool, and only one tool, because they are not appropriate for all forms of public infrastructure.  They are only appropriate for some types of public infrastructure, but they should not be viewed as something one does for a few years and then stops.  To maintain strong institutional interest there has to be a consistent pipeline because it is quite expensive, including for the EIB, but also for other institutional investors, simply to develop the capacity to analyse and assess the creditworthiness of the projects.</p></speech>

I also thank Mr. Ashmore for his opening remarks.  I commend him and his team at the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, on the work they do.  The profile of the SBCI is improving all the time and I know there is a lot of engagement with business representative bodies, for example, throughout the country.</p> <p>  On the delivery platform, there are eight on-lenders, three banks and five non-bank institutions.  Mr. Ashmore has named them in his opening remarks.  Does he believe that is the most effective way of getting the products to the customers who ultimately need them?  In terms of the marketing of the SBCI products, will he clarify whether it is done centrally by the SBCI or if it is done through the on-lenders as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  The use of the wholesale model was something we looked at and came up with based on the precedent of seeing it within a lot of other European countries especially Germany with KfW.  We saw a key benefit of that being its ability to drive competition, but also it was a very effective way of using the initial raw material we were provided with, namely, long-term, low-cost liquidity.  We think we are having an impact in terms of competition as a result of that in that there are now five new non-bank on-lenders providing finance that they were either doing on a smaller scale or were not doing at all.  We will continue to add on-lenders and to grow the competition.</p> <p>  There are, however, areas in which we have not yet achieved traction.  One is non-bank term lending.  It is certainly a key ambition for us to try to get someone into the market in that area, but it does bring with it further complications in terms of barriers to entry such as lack of a distribution network and teams and expertise on the ground in Ireland.  We continue to work our way to try to be a catalyst to see that happen.</p> <p>  For the terms of the liquidity we provide, the wholesale model works very well.  In terms of the risk sharing, again there is an opportunity there to work with multiple parties, in particular risk-sharing schemes or perhaps bilaterally down the line, but by sharing risk we are leveraging their expertise, their teams and distribution networks to get the support out the door in an efficient manner.  We can take relatively small amounts of capital and leverage them into much larger volumes of loans, as we did with the agri-scheme.  We think it is a particularly effective model.  However, we are a new organisation and we continue to look at other ways of doing things, and if there are better ways of doing things for specific market failures, then we will bring them forward to stakeholders and to the board for review.</p> <p>  The lines of business strategy we have adopted now allow us to continue with the on-lending and with the risk sharing in supporting and delivering the existing activities but also within those to explore new ways of using the resources and solving market failures that are there already or that arise in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of marketing we actively promote the SBCI brand.  Our vision is that an SME considering an investment or action should ask whether there is an SBCI option that could support it and potentially go into an on-lender and ask for the SBCI product.  We cannot guarantee, given the scale of the banks and other institutions, that the first person they meet will also be aware, so marketing is also focused on front-line bank staff for instance.  The on-lenders themselves have been very active in promoting SBCI funding through their own advertising, marketing and media campaigns, so it really is a joint effort.  It is individual institution by institution but also on our own.</p></speech>

Is it a margin on the interest rate or what is the commercial return for the on-lender in selling SBCI products to their customers?</p></speech>

What they get out of this is enhanced competitiveness.  By changing the cost of the liquidity, that is, the raw material that goes into the product, we bring the overall price down, but the on-lenders do not benefit.  They get the same margin on their loans as they would on our loans.  It is designed to be neutral.</p></speech>

On the liquidity provider product they get a credit margin.  When it comes to risk sharing it is a slightly different proposition because we are starting to account for some of the credit risks so we ask them to reduce their credit margin accordingly.  With the risk-sharing products a small element of it is us recovering our costs and then with the agri product there is a specific set of funding for providing a subsidy to the interest rate which creates a further discount, so that is why we were able to get the price down to 2.95%.</p><p>We design it so that our products versus their other products are neutral.  For them, there should not be a motivation either way.  We are very careful to make sure that they are not benefiting from the state aid inherent in these products.</p></speech>

The scheme was introduced in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the European Investment Fund, EIF, and the European Commission.  In the context of Brexit, however, and with SMEs in different sectors facing issues of market diversification, working capital management and foreign exchange risk, is the potential to introduce a similar type of scheme for other sectors that are particularly exposed to Brexit being explored?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#F00300"><p>The agriculture cashflow support loan scheme represents a strong effort, working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and capitalising on the use of the exceptional aid that was provided by the Commission, the state aid window that opened, as well as the EIF and the COSME programme, to craft a properly structured instrument that addressed the specific market failure.  As we look at that and at different market failures, we look to take the same approach, which is to look at the options available for funding and market measure, to customise that measure accordingly to fit those criteria and to mix and match that support to create an instrument that works for that specific market failure.  In the instance of a cashflow challenge to businesses - and some elements of Brexit may involve cashflow challenges - we could look at doing a shorter-term loan but with a risk share and potentially a small subsidy, depending on the resources available, to craft a risk-sharing product that would provide easier-to-access, more cost-effective and maybe more flexible loans for that specific issue.</p> <p>  On the other side of the coin, there might be an effort to support investment.  As well as its COSME programme, the EIF has a programme called InnovFin.  That provides an uncapped counter-guarantee to the SBCI or an uncapped guarantee directly to banks.  Bank of Ireland has one of these facilities.  We might use that resource, some of our own capital, State resources and, potentially, structural funds as well down the line, to create a longer-term product that might support loans for five to ten years by taking a greater share of the risk.  The agriculture cashflow support loan scheme was a capped portfolio guarantee.  It was only the first 15% of losses that were covered.  An uncapped guarantee would see all the loans in a portfolio covered.  It is about trying to take the resources available, working with the constraints they come with and mixing and matching them together to get the right combination to create a solution to the problem.  We see the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme as the real precedent for us to be able to do this down the line as issues arise.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Ashmore, Mr. Murphy and Ms Mahon.  I do not want to dwell on it but I wish to return to the issue of the investment plan for Europe, or the Juncker plan, in the Irish context.  In Mr. McDowell's opinion, what percentage of GDP should an economy spend on capital investment for it to be sustainable?  How would he comment on Ireland's most recent level of investment relative to GDP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#F00500"><p>I do not think there is any single right answer to this.  It depends on the level of development of the economy and the level of potential growth in the economy.  One would expect to see higher levels of capital investment in catch-up economies than perhaps in economies at the technological frontier.  In Ireland's case, with a fast-growing population and a potential output growth rate that is considered to be higher than most other European economies, mainly because of its demographics, one would certainly expect to see more public capital investment than is currently the case.  I believe that over the period of the crisis, infrastructure investment has fallen in Ireland from perhaps more than 5% of GDP to somewhere between 1% and 2% of GDP.  That is probably now the lowest level of public investment in infrastructure in the EU.  This is why we are having these new very intensive and constructive engagements with the Irish Government and its agencies on how we can help to reverse that trend, not just through support for Exchequer capital programmes, but by trying find other mechanisms that reflect the constraints faced by the Irish Government under the EU fiscal rules.</p></speech>

Has he an idea of the level of scope for an increase in capital spending that could take place in Ireland over the next number of years?</p></speech>

One might end up choosing projects that are not economically justifiable just to fulfil a quantitative target.  I believe it should be done on a project-by-project basis.  The key metric, under economic cost-benefit analysis, is whether the economic and social return of the project is higher than the cost of financing.  In those circumstances, it makes sense to proceed with projects.  That is the approach taken by the Irish Government, as we understand it.  It is certainly the approach taken by the EIB.  We will not finance projects, whether on or off-balance sheet, unless we see that the economic and social return is positive and justifies the cost of the financing.</p></speech>

I am based in Limerick city.  The single biggest project on our side of the country on the western seaboard is the M20, which is the Cork to Limerick motorway.  The mid-term capital review is taking place.  Public consultations were accepted up to last Sunday, 30 April.  I expect that many submissions have been made on the M20.  The witnesses are probably aware that the project was discontinued back in November 2011 due to the state of the economy.  We had a reactivation.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, agreed to my request that work be done within Transport Infrastructure Ireland, formerly the National Roads Authority, to look at pre-preparatory planning on the M20.  The project is estimated to cost between &euro;800 million and &euro;1 billion over a long number of years, including planning and building.  If we get the go-ahead in September when the mid-term capital review is announced, the planning may take three to five years.  It would take another three to five years to build the road.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McDowell to give me the EIB's perspective on such a proposal, the type of criteria it would use and its perspective on elements such as State investment, public private partnerships and tolling of the road.  I ask him to give me his sense of what percentage of funding the EIB would provide for such a proposal.  It is hugely important for us as a region.  At the moment, Dublin accounts for nearly 50% of economic activity in Ireland.  We speak about balanced regional development.  However, for it to truly happen, we need to connect the two largest cities outside of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, with a motorway.  It is incredible that is has not happened before now.  It needs to happen.</p><p> We are in a post-Brexit era and we must prepare for a hard Brexit.  We must be competitive and one of those elements that would make us competitive, as an island, would be a proper motorway linking Cork, Limerick, Galway and along the coast to Waterford.  Currently, a major piece of the jigsaw between Cork and Limerick is not linked by a motorway.  Will the witness give his perspective, going as far as he feels inclined to go?  It is very important for us in the Cork and Limerick region.</p></speech>

It is not rocket science but we have significant internal debates in the banks.  Occasionally, we must reject projects on the economic appraisal, although they may be credit-worthy.  We may lend to a creditworthy borrower, such as the Irish Government, but the economic appraisal may not justify the project.  That is why the EIB is trusted by its shareholders in these matters.  We do not finance bridges to nowhere or infrastructure for its own sake.  It will only come about where there has been a very positive appraisal.</p> <p>  If, for example, the Irish Government indicated it would be interested in this project with off-balance sheet financing for public private partnership structures, we would then go through a further process, working out whether it is just availability risk that we are being asked to finance - in other words, the construction - or would it be availability and traffic risk under a tolling scenario.  In those circumstances, we would want to understand what the tolling would be and if it justifies the risk if we accept part of the risk?  What we have indicated to the Irish Government is that before making final decisions on the best financing approach and the choices it must make for the mid-term review of the capital programme, there should be a preliminary exchange of information with the EIB.  It may be that we can look at a project, find it interesting and potentially finance it through some novel, off-balance sheet mechanism, whether it is through availability public private partnership with a unitary payment or through a full demand-risk public private partnership financed by tolling, where we guarantee private investors against some of the downside traffic forecasts.</p></speech>

Would it be 20 or 30 years?  There is a window now.  The mid-term capital review is under way and public consultation has been in train since 30 September.  The Government has stated it is looking to appraise this project over a number of months.  We expect something in the early autumn.  I cannot overstate how important the M20 is for the region as it will be the catalyst for the area.  Limerick and the western seaboard will not compete with Dublin but Dublin will bring back sustainable growth in Ireland Inc.  The interaction with the Government is ongoing on a range of capital proposals as part of the mid-term capital review.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Generally, in terms of the cost-benefit analysis, it would probably be 30 to 35 years on a road project.  Our financing of the project is a matter of negotiation between us and the promoter of the project.  Suffice it to say the EIB is the provider of the longest-term financing for infrastructure in Europe.  We do finance certain infrastructure projects with financing terms that stretch as far as 30 years and in some cases, even longer.  That can obviously make some projects financially much more feasible than would be the case if financing was only available for five, ten or even 15 years.</p></speech>

Could I ask Mr. Ashmore about the role of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI?  I have met with it a number of times.  The work it does is valuable.  I understand that it is done with quite a limited number of staff.  Could Mr. Ashmore address the committee in terms of the resources the SBCI has in terms of administering the fund?  My next questions concerns agricultural loans by commercial banks that come from the SBCI.  I have heard from farmers, including at a recent meeting with the IFA, that Ulster Bank has far more stringent criteria in terms of making these loans available when compared with other lenders.  Does the SBCI oversee how the application process evolves?  My understanding is that different criteria are used by different lenders.  Some require nearly every single piece of documentation that could have passed through a farmer's hands over the past number of months while others are less invasive when it comes to documentation required.  Is this something the SBCI oversees or does it just make the funding available and look at the results on the other side?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#H00600"><p>In terms of the resources, the SBCI runs with a team of 16 people dedicated to the organisation.  We also run with the support of the NTMA's broader centralised functions such as human resources, legal, finance, technology and some risk functions.  We estimate that the number of equivalent full-time employees represented by that support is between ten and 12 people.  That is the total team working on the SBCI.</p> <p>  In respect of agricultural loans, we provide a common set of terms to each bank.  We provide the guarantee and ask for significant amounts of management information back around the individual loans, which we use to ensure those loans are eligible for the financial support we provide.  As we support the loans being provided on an unsecured basis, that removes the need for farmers to apply and provide their land or other assets as security for the loans, which often results in an increased amount of paperwork and can result in significant legal fees, so it is one of the major positives of the loan.  We are certainly not aware of a different approach being taken by the different banks and we do not get into the detailed aspects of the credit evaluation because that is something we have delegated to the banks.  They are still on the hook for 20% of the initial losses and, ultimately, if losses go beyond 15% of the portfolio, they are on the hook for the entire loss so their credit rules and conditions still apply.  There will always be different approaches between banks in the market in terms of how they go about documentation and what information they require from SMEs but this is the first we have heard of that issue.  We will certainly raise the question with Ulster Bank and see what is has to say.  </p></speech>

In respect of the ambition of the organisation, where does Mr. Ashmore see it going?  We see the figures here.  The agricultural long lending is very impressive and has been hugely welcomed by farmers but we see other areas relating to SMEs.  When one puts it in the context of financing in Ireland, it is not even a drop in the ocean.  Is there potential to grow the SBCI?  If this potential exists, what do we need to unlock to allow it to grow, flourish and be more of a player in providing cheaper, easier and accessible credit to SMEs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#H00800"><p>In terms of the vision we have for the SBCI, it is to be a strong promotional financial institution within the Irish market that will have a major impact over the long term, a very effective conduit and support for channelling European resources, for example, the EIB banking group, into the market here and a real contributor.  With the added impetus, engagement and presence of the EIB in the market here, combined with SBCI's enabling platform and construction of infrastructure - in terms of channels to market and systems to deal with those channels to market - there is a lot more that we can do over time as we grow this.  The market failures we are addressing will evolve over time.  For example, quantitative easing has had a relative impact on how attractive our liquidity is - certainly to banks, which can fund more cheaply.  The EIB has been known to lend directly into banks in a similar way and that, again, is not happening at the moment because the markets are flooded with liquidity.  We will see different things come and go.  In essence, the SBCI needs to be counter-cyclical.  It needs to not ramp up its activity at a time when things are really taking off in terms of credit because we could reinforce a bubble if we were not careful.  It is not something we see as a risk at the moment but it is something we are very cognisant of.  We see significant potential to grow but at the same time, we do not want to be the market.  We have seen how in other countries, the promotional institution has become the market for SMEs and almost the entire market is effectively state supported.  That is at the extreme end of the spectrum and happened over a long time but it is not somewhere we want to get to.  We really want to support a strongly functioning market.</p> <p>  In terms of what we need to unlock to let it grow, the SBCI is fortunate in that all the legislation we need to be able to do what we do going down the line has been passed.  A key factor for us is to identify the right things to do and get the strong stakeholder support both in terms of the explicit authority from the Departments and any resources they provide, to source support from the EIB, which has been another provider of funding and support, and to deliver a mechanism that works in the market.  Those things take time.  We were able to get the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme into the market very quickly but that is only because the team and stakeholders put in about 18 months of work in advance to prepare for that situation.  We did not know what measure would come down the line that would be the first case but we were ready for it.  We had built a lot of capability.  We are certainly building our capability within the organisation without taking on too many resources and creating too excessive a cost base.</p> <p>  In a similar way to the EIB, we are looking for cases.  We are looking for the right places to deploy the support we can provide.  We are also doing a lot of research around what the art of the possible is.  We are members of two main networks within Europe - the Network of European Financial Institutions for SMEs, NEFI, and the European Long Term Investors Association.  They are networks of peer national promotional institutions.  We learn a huge amount of them as to how they operate in their countries - be they Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, BGK, in Poland, Instituto de Cr&eacute;dito Oficial, ICO, in Spain or Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, CDP, in Italy, which are really ramping up their activities at present.  We are hosting the next NEFI working group in Dublin this month.  They are very valuable sources of information and expertise.  There is no clear answer.  </p></speech>

We decided not to go down that route because it would have taken a long time and caused a significant delay.  The main reason for going for a banking licence would be to attract customer deposits.  That brings with it a whole raft of regulation, cost and so forth.  We are not constrained at the moment with regard to the availability of low-cost liquidity, so the main commercial, economic rationale for going for a banking licence is not there right now but it may well be in the future.</p></speech>

We welcome the work that he and his team are doing in that area.</p> <p>  I welcome the establishment of an EIB office here in December.  Mr. Andrew McDowell said last year that if he was giving Ireland a report card, it would read "could do better".  Last year, the EIB group invested &euro;950 million in the country through the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund.  The target this year is to exceed &euro;1 billion.  Ultimately, there is not a big difference between &euro;950 million and &euro;1 billion.  What would Mr. McDowell assess our position as being at this point?  Is it still "could do better", would it be "doing a little bit better" or where does he see us with regard to being able to access funding?  It is clear, from his words, that we have underperformed.  We are below the European average for accessing money from these supports despite the fact that we have the lowest capital investment in the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#J01000"><p>There are two main areas and two main reasons why our exposures to Ireland have been less than in other countries.  The first was that prior to the crisis and even during the crisis, up until 2014, there was a lack of an institutional partner in Ireland to channel EIB funding into the economy.  The establishment of the SBCI and the establishment of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, with which we also hope to partner on some equity investment-type projects, have helped to address that institutional gap that existed in Ireland.  We are beginning to see the fruits of that already.  Our exposure to Ireland is approximately 2.5% of GDP, which is less than the EU average of about 3.5%, but if we keep lending at the pace we have been lending over the past six to nine months - and the &euro;1 billion this year is based on that flow translating and being maintained over the course of the year - we will gradually build up our stock of exposures in Ireland towards the EU average over the course of four to five years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#J01100"><p>I am not criticising Mr. McDowell for that, because there is an issue with Ireland.  It is not just the State.  These are private corporations that apply for funding from the EIB.  To come up to the European average, we should be at approximately &euro;1.4 billion per annum, yet we have the worst percentage of public investment in the European Union.  The European average is made up of countries which have large drawdowns from the EIB but which also have large public investment programmes.  Should there not be a specific policy within the EIB in light of the fact that we have gone through a private investment famine and a public investment drought over the past decade?  Is it not the case that the EIB needs to be much more ambitious in reaching that target?  Four or five years is still only to get to where the European average stands.  Many European countries do not have the problems which we have and which Mr. McDowell identified with regard to water, transport and housing.  These are all crises that have either arrived or are about to present themselves in a very acute way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2418" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017050400002#J01200"><p>The best way I can answer that question is to say that there is no upper limit on the amount which we are willing to finance in Ireland.  Unlike EU budgetary funds and the Commission, there is no quota for EIB lending country by country.  We finance projects wherever they come from as long as they are consistent with our eligibility criteria and they are bankable projects.  As the Irish economy grows and the recovery continues, we would hope to see many more projects coming out of Ireland, but we are ultimately dependent on promoters making financing applications to us.  We have indicated our ambition to do much more here.  There are obviously two concrete steps that we have taken.  We have opened the office here in Dublin and appointed Mr. Cormac Murphy as its head.  At our own instigation, we have established this Ireland-EIB financing group to improve the flow of information between the Irish public sector and Government on capital projects.  I hope that those two steps in particular will pay dividends in the coming years with regard to the volumes.</p> <p>  There is a big opportunity for Ireland in the dark clouds of Brexit when it comes to the issue of EIB financing.  The EIB is inevitably going to do much less in the UK.  Many of our teams - including our infrastructure teams - that would have spent much time in the UK are now essentially looking for other jurisdictions and markets in which to finance projects.  The bottleneck within the EIB regarding how we can do business is rarely about money.  We have much capital and funding.  The bottleneck is often simply about available skilled human resources within the bank to appraise and assess projects.  That bottleneck has opened up in that there is a window of opportunity as a large number of people in the EIB are now looking for a place to do more business.  Ireland is very similar to the UK in some ways with regard to the legal situation, how the financial sector works in Ireland and how the Government authorities work in Ireland.  There is an opportunity for us now to get much more EIB attention from our skilled lending officers back in Luxembourg.</p></speech>

Can he address concerns about the EIB's involvement in the North of Ireland?  As we know, the population in the North voted to stay within the European Union.  There is concern that access to funding such as from the EIB will further damage the economy, and it is an economy that is isolated and could possibly have border controls and so on.  Has there been a discussion at EIB level about recognising the special status of the North, the peace process and so on?  Is there a willingness to continue to engage in financing programmes and, indeed, to ramp up focus on the North of Ireland in the context of infrastructure projects and other investment in potential projects?</p></speech>

I think much of this will depend on the negotiations.  We need to see what the outcome of that is with regard to eligibility of projects in Northern Ireland for further EIB financing.  Within the EIB itself, there is a strong recognition of Northern Ireland's unique vulnerability.  As long as the UK remains a shareholder in the bank for the next two years, Northern Ireland, like the rest of the UK, will remain eligible for EIB financing.  What happens after that, after the UK exits the European Union, will be a matter for the negotiators between the 27 and the UK.  We, as a bank, will obviously be bound by the outcome of those negotiations.  Particularly now that Ireland has a vice president in the bank, which we have every 12 years, it can be taken that I will see it as my role to work closely with my British colleague - who remains a vice president of the bank and who formally looks after our operations in Northern Ireland - and other colleagues on the management committee to pay special attention to the situation in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

What is Mr. McDowell's understanding of the timeframe for those house completions?  Why are we not seeing a more ambitious programme?  While we welcome what is the EIB's second round of investment in the past three years, why are we not seeing more ambition from the State and the EIB, given that we have such a housing crisis?  Some &euro;200 million is welcome, but we all know how much it costs to build a house, and 1,400 will not reach anywhere near where we need to be.  Is there more potential for the EIB to invest in social housing, given the current model?  If there are no upper limits to what the EIB can invest, why are we not replicating it in various sites across Dublin and other areas where there are social housing problems?</p></speech>

However, I will revert to the Deputy and confirm the details.</p> <p>  We indicated to the HFA that we were happy to engage in a further transaction.  This was the second transaction, and we regard the HFA as a well-established, reputable and professional partner.  The constraint that the HFA faces in this type of transaction is that it must be budgeted for.  This was a loan to the HFA that was guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, with such a guarantee moving the financing onto the Government's balance sheet.  Therefore, it must be consistent with the overall expenditure ceilings under the fiscal rules.  That is a natural constraint for the HFA in that it cannot by itself approach us and say that it would like more financing.  That financing must be consistent with the overall budget agreed by the Government.</p> <p>  We are exploring other mechanisms with the Irish authorities in terms of off-balance sheet financing of social housing.  I hope to see within the near future in Ireland the first public private partnership, PPP, on social housing that we have ever done in Europe.  It would allow us to invest more in the social housing sector without adding to the expenditure and fiscal rule pressures on the Government in the near term.</p> <p>  There are mechanisms in other European countries, such as funds whereby a government would establish a fund with some private sector participation that would invest in a mix of private, affordable and social housing.  Between the three forms of tenure, it would generate enough cashflow to repay the debt that we would provide.  France is an active developer in this regard, with municipal authorities partnering with private sector developers to develop funds and with us providing cheap long-term debt.  We have showcased these types of transaction to the Irish authorities.  Most recently, we held a housing seminar with the Government approximately three weeks ago.  We brought six or seven experienced housing lending officers from across Europe to meet the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the HFA and some of the local authorities to show what we could do.  Through that process, we hope to see more transactions in this regard.</p></speech>

We have a fund, namely, the old pensions reserve fund.  We have &euro;8 billion in a discretionary portfolio.  Some of it is used in the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  There is also the upcoming sale of AIB, the money for which originally came from the fund and could be returned to it.  Could that fund not partner with the EIB to create the type of investment in social housing that is required?  Given that the fund invests to make a return, is that type of structure possible for a mixed social housing unit involving rental, possibly some sales and social housing?</p></speech>

We have been exploring possibilities in that space.  Those discussions are at a relatively early stage.  At the end of the day, we need to see what the structure looks like before we can appraise it formally.  For a fund, the key is that the tenure mix is such that the cashflows generated are sufficient to repay the debt and the equity that would be provided by, for example, the ISIF at a commercial rate.  As the Deputy knows, the ISIF is required to seek a commercial rate of return under state aid rules.  Regarding the fund's structure, the devil is in the detail in terms of ensuring that particular box is ticked.</p></speech>

We know the serious problems that Ireland is facing as we enter into a number of decades of demographic pressures.  Those problems will present acutely in terms of our infrastructure, for example, the road network.  There is a view that investment from the EIB has allowed member states to reduce public investment.  For instance, building primary care centres is moved to the EIB and off the balance sheet, PPPs are undertaken, etc.  That allows countries to keep public investment low, and Ireland is already at so dangerously low a level of public investment that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has claimed that we are only maintaining our investment stock and not making new investments.</p> <p>  Has Mr. McDowell a view on the fiscal rules?  I am clear on this matter.  Hearing the various parties that campaigned and were cheerleaders for these rules now claim that they want them changed because they do not work for Ireland is interesting.  However, there are flexibilities within the rules that have never been used, for example, the structural reform clause, which allows us not to break the rules, given that it is built into them, but to move away from our current path and make a serious public investment if we believe that it would make a return for the economy.  In Mr. McDowell's role as vice president of the EIB, which examines these issues, does he believe that this option is something the State should be considering?</p></speech>

The Commission has committed to reviewing the impact of these flexibility clauses by the middle of 2018.  We will make our views known.  That process has to take place formally within the bank but, from our perspective, we do not see the investment clause flexibility as having had a significant impact on investment levels in Europe, which is consistent with the Deputy's understanding.  There have only been two cases in which the investment clause has been used by member states to justify enhanced investment.  The restrictions are tight.  Due to the fast growth in Ireland's economy, we understand that Ireland is not eligible for flexibility under the investment clause at this time.</p></speech>

I would argue that, in the middle of a housing crisis, this is a way for the EIB to be more ambitious.</p><p>The State could, using this clause, allow more money to the Housing Finance Agency to co-finance these types of proposals.  It is not just about housing.  We have other bottlenecks, as I have said.  Has the European Investment Bank looked at the structural clause?  I am aware of the review, which is too far down the line.  It is a year away.  This country has never even applied under the structural clause.  I am not sure why it has not, or whether we are assessing it.</p></speech>

When it comes to Ireland, we are happy to finance more investment by Ireland, whether through a traditional Exchequer capital programme or alternative off-balance-sheet mechanisms, and an expansion of both is probably appropriate in the Irish case.  Ultimately it is a matter for the national authorities, with the European Commission, to work out how those investments are consistent with the fiscal rules.  We do not mediate between the European Commission and the national authorities on the interpretation of the fiscal rules.  Certainly when it comes to European level debate on the future of European economic governance, we will make our views known on where we think perhaps the rules can be tweaked to promote and provide governments with more incentives to use whatever fiscal space they have to invest more for the future.  Ultimately, high quality investments are good for fiscal and economic sustainability, and this is certainly the philosophy we will bring to the debate.</p></speech>

A number of the bank's projects tend to be cross-Border inter-country projects, such as motorways and bridges. In Ireland's case we are not able to tap into this potential in the same way as other countries because we are an island.  Pre-Brexit or without Brexit we might have argued there is potential for projects with the North of Ireland.  Is there any way we can harness or tap into this?  Geographically we are where we are, but is there scope for us getting involved?</p></speech>

There used to be TEN-T and now there is the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF.  We co-operate very closely with the Commission in using these funds, where perhaps the Commission provides grant aid to a project and we provide debt on top of the grant aid.  We liaise very closely with the Commission in the deployment of these funds.  To my recollection, but this is a matter to be confirmed by the European Commission, there was special recognition for Ireland in the CEF to recognise the fact it has less potential for cross-border projects because of having fewer land borders.  There was a special allocation for Ireland, whereby projects could be part financed with grant aid from the European Commission if it could be justified, for example, as a road that led to a port that led to another European country.  I believe there were some special recognition of this but I can come back and confirm it.</p></speech>

Particularly in the context of Brexit, we need to strengthen our connections with the continent of Europe.  With customs and various barriers, potentially using the land bridge to continental Europe that is the UK may be more difficult.  I hope not.  We may need better capacity to go directly to the continent.</p></speech>

I do know the CEF, which is a fund for cross-border projects is financing the economic appraisal of the potential electricity interconnector between Ireland and France.  This is one example of a project being funded at a very early stage.  If this project were ever to move forward into a deployment or financing phase we will certainly be the likely financing of choice for its French and Irish promoters.  I understand the Port of Cork has received funding under the CEF also.</p></speech>

Obviously the relationship the EIB may have in future with the United Kingdom as a country depends on how Brexit pans out.  How does it work out that it is 90%?  What is the barrier to lending more or not lending?  Is it that EU countries get priority and if there is a bit left over the bank will lend to others based on criteria?  Is there anything to stop the UK from benefitting from the European Investment Bank?  Is there a clause that states countries that leave the EU can no longer benefit?  Are the criteria more difficult?  How does it work?</p></speech>

It also depends on the degree to which we can secure guarantees from the European Commission for some of our lending to the most highest risk countries.  For example, it is difficult for us to lend to non-investment grade countries outside of Europe in a way that is consistent with our own triple A rating unless we receive some type of credit guarantees from the European Union budget consistent with past foreign policy objectives.  This is probably the biggest constraint.  Lending in Europe tends to be quite safe in general.  Lending outside of Europe is less safe and there are limits to the amount we can do.  To lend outside of Europe to any particular country requires-----</p></speech>

When we lend outside of the EU it requires a decision of our board of governors, which is the Finance Ministers from each member state, to give the bank a mandate to lend outside of the EU.  All of this is hypothetical, but at present the statutes state a shareholder of the EIB must be an EU member state.  We take it as a given that once the UK ceases being an EU member state, unless the treaties are changed it will no longer be a shareholder of the EIB.  In these circumstances our board of governors would have to agree to give the bank a new mandate to lend into the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

Unlike many other multilateral lending banks, such as the World Bank and other multilateral lending institutions, there is no provision in our statutes for a country to exit and to withdraw its shareholding.  The legal situation, to say the least, is not clear.  There is no automatic right to recover upon exit the share capital paid in.  It is simply was not envisaged in the statutes establishing the European Investment Bank.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Ms Jennifer Banim, Mr. Joe Treacy, Ms Orla McCarthy and Ms Tara Davis.</p> <p>  The draft Regulation on European business statistics, amending Regulation No. 184/2005 and repealing ten legal acts in the field of business statistics is part of the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT,  programme.  It is the European Commission's regulatory fitness and performance programme for making EU law simpler and reducing unnecessary regulatory costs.  Business statistics has been identified as a priority area under the REFIT programme.   The draft regulation is known by the acronym FRIBS which stands for framework regulation integrating business statistics.  The draft regulation envisages the integration of statistical requirements and legal acts for business statistics by streamlining and simplifying them, leading to an intended reduction of the reporting burden on businesses.  The current system for producing European business statistics is fragmented into separate domain specific regulations, which leads to inconsistencies in the data collected and inefficiencies in their production.  FRIBS will provide a common legal framework for the production and compilation of business statistics for the European Statistical System. </p> <p>  The CSO can support the broader aims of the proposal, particularly relating to the rationalisation of the relevant legislation and the focus on burden reduction for respondents.  However, the CSO is extremely concerned about an aspect of the regulation that makes a provision for the mandatory exchange of confidential identifiable enterprise level data between national statistics authorities.  In the context of trade data compilers, that can include national central banks and national customs offices in the EU while usage is optional.  The inclusion of an "optional usage" clause is a pragmatic decision that reflects the reality that the asymmetries in trade data are significant.  In other words, exports captured by country A to country B do not match import data of country B from country A.  It is anticipated, for at least the medium term, that the collection of both export and import data will be required to ensure quality hence the optional usage clause.  This provision would involve the CSO in having to share sensitive, commercial information such as exports of a particular multinational with a statistical authority of another EU member state.  The essence and ultimate goal of this aspect of the proposal is that trade data compilers would eventually only collect data on the export side and that the amalgamation of the exports from the other 27 member states would provide the import data for any given country.  In this environment compilers of trade data would be dependent on 27 other statistical organisations spread across the EU.  The rationale being put forward for this initiative revolves around burden reduction and quality improvement, especially in a globalisation context.  The CSO does not believe that the proposal will address either of these objectives in a meaningful way. </p> <p>  On the burden side, the provisions set out that while the exchange of identifiable enterprise level data on exports is mandatory the usage, by individual member states, is voluntary.  It is widely accepted that in the medium term most member states will continue to collect both export and import data.  The overall burden on exporters will be increased in the medium-term under this proposal, as the VAT number of the counterpart to the transaction, that is the VAT number of the importer in the trading country, will need to be supplied by the exporter to allow for meaningful use of the exchanged data.  The burden issue, therefore, can and will only be addressed if member states stop collecting the import data.</p> <p>  Aside from the burden issues outlined, the mandatory exchange of identifiable and confidential micro data could seriously impede the CSO's ability to collect important commercially sensitive data from the large multinationals that are so critical to compiling Ireland&rsquo;s economic statistics, including the national accounts.  The guarantee of confidentiality that the CSO provides to respondents is critical to building trust and ensures that enterprises feel secure in providing accurate information on a timely basis.  The CSO's view is that this regulation poses a serious risk to the relationship with respondents and may compromise the CSO's ability to compile accurate business and economic statistics.  In the CSO's engagement with stakeholders, IBEC and a number of Irish-based multinationals have expressed concerns about the proposals.</p> <p>  In addition, the CSO has concerns about quality.  One of the arguments put forward by the Commission relates to the need to share data to get a better insight on globalisation.  In Ireland, to take account of our highly globalised economy, the CSO co-ordinates the collection of all enterprise-based statistics.  For example, structural business statistics, short-term statistical returns, trade data, balance of payments data and corporation tax data.  All of this work is done through one unit called the large cases unit to ensure consistency at enterprise or company level across the various statistical domains.  This approach of having a dedicated large cases unit is the exception across Europe rather than the norm.  In the absence of such a co-ordinated approach, and timely access to all of the relevant data sources, including on exported and imported goods, it would be difficult to compile data that is nationally consistent across these domains.  It is the CSO's view that in the absence of a co-ordinated approach the quality of the data being shared across member states could be of limited use.</p></speech>

Am I correct that the regulation just deals with the larger companies or multinationals?  I have read some of the minutes on CSO meetings and know a concern was expressed about the definition of an enterprise.  It was commented at the meeting that the regulation would not affect the majority of businesses in Ireland and would just affect larger multinationals.  Is that why IBEC and a number of multinationals are concerned?  Does the regulation affect every business in the State?</p></speech>

The threshold is set at a level where we still must collect export data from almost 200 enterprises and import data from a similar number.  That provision goes way beyond the multinational enterprises.  One can see from the concentration in yesterday's statistics on foreign direct investment that large multinationals mean about 20 enterprises.  The regulation will hit large multinationals but it will also have an impact on SMEs.  The regulation goes ways beyond the multinational perspective.</p></speech>

The regulation is still limited to the larger companies.  I mean 2,000 companies out of a large pool of companies.  The regulation affects the higher level but it does not just affect multinationals.  </p></speech>

In total, we have little over 14,000 exporters in the country and about 2,000 of them fall below the threshold.  The total value of exports is of the order of &euro;60 billion and the excluded enterprises only account for about &euro;1.2 billion.  Again, it is the structure of the Irish economy and the concentration and importance of a relatively small number of large enterprises.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners collect the data in Ireland and that is the case in the vast number of member states.  We take the data from the Revenue Commissioners and process, analyse and publish it but that is not the case in every other country.  In a number of countries the entire process is managed by their revenue or customs organisation but it differs in other countries.  In Belgium, for example, its national central bank collects the data.  The Revenue Commissions collect the data using the INTRASTAT survey and then we take the data from them in order to conduct the relevant processing and analysing.  Companies are legally required to provide the data.</p></speech>

Why?  Can a legal obligation not be placed on the companies?</p></speech>

The legal obligation always exists.  Unfortunately, sometimes we must take companies to court to make them comply with the CSO's data requirements.</p><p>We had a case recently in which we spent eight years in the courts with a company, during which period we did not get any data from it.  Imagine if that had been one of the larger players in the Irish economy.  We would not be in a position to compile accurate or robust national accounts data or business statistics data if any one of those larger multinationals decided not to engage with us.  It goes beyond the multinational companies as well.  Businesses in Ireland and Irish people, even the small and medium sized enterprises would, in our view, be concerned at the possibility that their data would be shared with 27 other statistical authorities across the EU, not all of which are national statistical institutes.  Our big concern is that there would be any reduction in compliance with our business statistical surveys, which feed in directly to the compilation of the national accounts, and in some cases the balance of payments as well.</p></speech>

The problem for us is more a concern at the reaction of the large multinationals.  We have a long history of engaging directly with the compilers.  We have a large cases unit which engages with these compilers on a one-to-one basis.  We know how they work and how careful they are with their data.  I think it is fair to say that on occasion they are reluctant even to give the data to the CSO.</p></speech>

If there is any sense of unease from the business community about the data it is providing to the CSO and if we do not get that data, it makes it almost impossible for us to compile robust national accounts and balance of payments data.  Our big concern is that the regulatory cover will not provide us with the necessary assurances for the businesses.</p> <p>  We have a history and we know that despite the fact that we have statistical law in place, some of these businesses do not comply.  It is not the same as compliance with a tax requirement.  People view tax legislation very differently from statistical legislation.  While they provide the data to Revenue for tax, the concern for us is that in respect of the structural business statistical surveys and the short-term statistical surveys, both of which are key components of the national accounts, we could see a reduction in the response rates from the business community. </p></speech>

Our own experience is that it took us eight years in one case to reach a conclusion and in that period we got no data.  We were lucky it was not one of the big players.  Had it been, I am quite sure I would have been in front of another Oireachtas committee being asked why the CSO's data on gross domestic product, GDP, gross national product, GNP and the new gross national income*, GNI* were not fully capturing activity within the economy as a whole.

Let us imagine that they were providing it to us.  Does this improve the situation or not in the medium term?  Mr. Dalton has said that in the short term, the CSO will continue to gather export and import data.  Six or seven years down the road, if enterprises go along with it, will this be a better system?</p></speech>

For example, Ireland's exports to Germany should match Germany's imports from Ireland.  When we do the asymmetries between imports and exports, there is a discrepancy of &euro;3 trillion at EU level.  There is a whole range of reasons for that.  All member states are planning to continue to collect import and export data until such a point as they are satisfied that the asymmetries issue has been addressed.  It is a huge issue.  Germany's exports to Ireland are relatively small as a proportion of its overall total exports.  For that reason, the Germans do not sample to the scale that we would need to get the relative accuracy of the import data that we would require or the export data we have for Germany.  The big countries will be forced to over-sample to try to ensure the quality not of their statistics but of the statistics for smaller member States such as Ireland, Malta and so on.  That is not specifically addressed in the legislation.  It is questionable whether the quality issue will be addressed.</p> <p>  The quality issue they are talking about really involves trying to get a better handle on globalisation.  Ireland is in a very lucky situation in that the national statistical institute, the CSO, compiles the balance of payments, trade statistics, structural business statistics and the short-term statistics, and we have a legal right of access to the administrative data.  That means that in our large cases unit, we can compare the data from those multiple sources at unit record level.  Where there is an error or where we see an inconsistency in the reporting, we go back to the company and flag the issue and ask them to explain it to us.  That is how we assure the quality of our data.</p> <p>  The vast majority of national statistical institutes do not compile the balance of payment statistics.  In most countries it is the national central bank that does so.  Only in the last two years has the legislation been passed at European level allowing some national statistics institutes access to administrative data.  In practice, it is not happening in some of those countries.  The trade data is not always compiled by the national statistical institute.  Our experience says that if we do not have access to those five data sources or a large cases unit addressing potential inconsistencies in the data, we cannot be sure of having nationally consistent data and a full picture.</p> <p>  Now we are in a situation in which our import data would be based on data from 27 other member states, yet we know that some of those countries do not have access to all of those relevant data sources.  We cannot be sure of the quality of data from different countries and they cannot be sure about us.  They are all very professional organisations, there is absolutely no question about that.  The problem for a lot of them is access to the data.  They do not have access to the same level of data that we have in trying to build a coherent picture.  If we want to address globalisation, which is one of the stated objectives of this commission, we need access to all of that data at micro level, not at aggregate level.  We need to be able to see the picture at individual company level.</p></speech>

I understand that the data says what it says.  The problem is how far we were able to rely on those type of indicators and benchmarks in the past.  I presume the calculations are correct.  Eurostat has looked at all of this and given the CSO a clean bill of health in terms of those revisions.</p> <p>  I take on board what Mr. Dalton is saying about having the micro data and a bird's eye view of all the data that is out there.</p><p> I want to go back to the principle.  I am not suggesting that I support it, but I want to get the Central Statistics Office view.  Mr. Dalton opened his contribution by referring to supporting the broader aims.  Does Mr. Dalton believe that the information collected should be shared across the European Union, although perhaps not in the exact way the proposal has suggested?  Does Mr. Dalton believe that some version of that is what is needed?  Does Mr. Dalton believe that the position here should remain constant?</p></speech>

We have received a number of study visits.  The statistical office of Luxembourg is visiting Ireland today.  The representatives are arriving this afternoon to look at our approach to the compilation of national accounts and the balance of payments.  The Dutch have been over.  Representatives from the UK are coming later this year.  Representatives from the statistics office of Luxembourg will be here today.  What is actually happening is the opposite of what Deputy Doherty has suggested.  Rather, they are looking at us and asking whether the large cases unit structure is the way they need to go to gain access to all the data sources.  In fact, the opposite is happening.</p> <p>  There was a question about getting back to the principle of it.  We could sit back and say that in theory we can see the value in some of it.  However, I cannot separate it from the practice.  Perhaps if this proposal was coming in five or ten years time, when we had time to focus on ensuring that every compiler of official statistics has access to all the data sources necessary as well as an ability to influence the quality of all the various data sources, then our perspective would be a little different.  We need to ensure that there is confidence as well.  The big thing here is confidence as well as trust in the national statistical institute.  Generally speaking, the vast majority of compilers and respondents in Ireland comply because we have a record of maintaining the confidentiality of the data provided, although a small number of companies do not comply.  We have a strong record to stand on in that regard.</p> <p>  That is really important.  Our concern is that anything that might dilute their trust in us creates a risk for the national statistical system.  In theory, at a European level I can see some value in it.  However, at a national level other issues arise.  Let us consider it from an Irish perspective.  Approximately 90% of the ultimate ownership of foreign direct investment is in the USA.  Therefore, for us to get data from the member states will not help.  It does not address the global nature of FDI.  That is the thing about globalisation.  Globalisation cannot be addressed purely at a European level.  It needs to be addressed at a global level if we really want to get to the bottom of the issue.</p></speech>

He has made a strong and convincing case in respect of the impact this would have in terms of our national accounts.</p> <p>  We have many challenges in interpreting the data as policy- makers, especially in trying to figure out some of the anomalies we have seen from different data.  Can Mr. Dalton comment on the reduction that we are seeing in the unemployment rate, which has been consistently dropping in recent months?  If it is across the board, that is fine.  However, what we are seeing is a reduction in income tax against what is profiled.  It seems to be an anomaly.  Since unemployment is falling at the current rate, we should be seeing an increase in income tax, or at least for that increase to be on profile.  However, what we are seeing is a significant drop in the first quarter and in the results from last month.  Is there something that we are not seeing?  How can both of these things be happening at the same time?</p></speech>

If a person is in work for one hour in the reference week, that person is termed as being in employment.  This applies officially not only in Ireland but everywhere according to International Labour Office standards.  Therefore, one of the things that we always have to examine is the quality of the employment.  We need to look at the breakdown between full-time work, part-time work, hours worked, the sectors where growth in employment is occurring, whether the jobs are high-value jobs or lower-income jobs.  Another consideration is the tax-take associated with those types of jobs.  I do not have those figures before me now.  Anyway, when we are considering tax and employment data it is not a simple one-to-one correlation.  We can go back to our colleagues on the labour market side and ask for some insight into that question.</p> <p>  I would always be careful.  We always say that in the case of short-term series we have to be careful about interpreting one instance.  We always like to examine a series over a given period.  We would prefer to examine a 12-month period to see the correlation.  Generally speaking, the correlation is rather strong between the two over the longer term.  It can break down on an individual quarterly basis sometimes.  However, generally, over the long term we will see a consistency in the movement between the two.</p></speech>

I agree 100%.  For example, corporation tax is so lumpy that we cannot really comment on it for the first quarter or second quarter.  Anyway, income tax should be more stable and predictable.  The assumptions used to profile income tax should not be so far off in terms of the type of employment and so on.  Therefore, when we see a four-month trend, it begins to become concerning.  At least it should be in the sense that we should sit up and take notice and try to figure out what is going on behind the scenes.</p></speech>

Committee members can see from the series on employment and unemployment that there is a clear trend.  It has been evident not only for four months but for close to three years.  We have seen the gradual decline in the quarterly national household survey and in the monthly unemployment figures as well.  Anyway, I take Deputy Doherty's point about the tax figures.  Obviously, everyone is looking at those published yesterday.  We will look at that and see whether there is anything we can do to explain this mismatch.</p></speech>

There are three key pillars for any official statistical system: political and professional independence, objectivity in analysis and a guarantee of confidentiality.  We have put it to the Commission clearly that we do not agree with the mandatory exchange.  We believe the exchange should be made optional.</p></speech>

If I had to go one way or the other all the current signals would suggest that this regulation will pass.  One never knows, however, what is going to happen when it goes into the Council and Parliament process.  First it will go to the Council working group for statistics.  It will have to agree a position, which is always a negotiated position so it will change from this.  It will then go to the committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and once they give the Presidency the mandate for negotiation it will go to a trilogue.  I do not know what will happen once we go to COREPER and to the Parliament.  A question that could be asked is why one would take a big risk on mandatory exchange of confidential microdata for optional usage.</p></speech>

The data can only be used for statistical purposes and the data cannot be put into the public domain by any one of the other 27 member states that would lead to the identification of an individual company.  That is written in the legislation but the risks can grow.  For example, the CSO is currently the compiler of the export and import data.  The CSO is in control of that data.  It is easy for respondents to look at one organisation and say "We have seen the CSO in operation for many years, it has a strong track record on data confidentiality and we know as an organisation it will protect our data".  The problem for us is that people will be getting the same guarantees from EUROSTAT and the other 27 member states but they do not have any relationship with those other 27 member states.  The big concern is perception and whether companies perceive that there is any greater risk of a breach of confidentiality of their data.</p></speech>

The level of detail required by the EU cannot be provided unless the CSO gives a level of micro detail.  Mr. Dalton makes the argument very coherently.  It is a long road but the CSO is obviously briefing all the relevant parties.  I will take it back to our own party also.</p> <p>  I have two questions on the CSO statistics, and especially the analysis on employment and unemployment.  When Ireland had a hiatus in GDP growth what was the eventual detailed, valid and logical explanation?  Was it the patent cliff?  Is that the logical explanation?</p> <p>  My second question concerns the CSO's analysis of the employment and unemployment figures where a person who works one hour per week is considered to be employed.  Does the CSO do any sub-data to provide details on categories of the hours that are worked and does the CSO make distinctions around part-time and short-term working and so on?  It may not be visible but it may be in some sub-report of the CSO.  I contact the CSO office in Cork quite a lot and the staff are excellent.</p></speech>

We collect information on hours worked from the respondents also.  There are two measures for employment provided in the quarterly national household survey.  One is the international measurement by the International Labour Organization, the ILO basis, which is the one hour per week.  Every country measures it in that way.  We also compile statistics on the principal economic status where we simply ask the person if they are in employment.  They are given five categories and it is self-perception rather than the ILO.</p></speech>

It all comes down to the intellectual property products.  That is where it came from.  We appeared in front of this committee last November and we spent two hours talking about it.  It comes down to the trend that has existed in Ireland going back to 2011 when we started to see its emergence; the relocation of intellectual property products or intangible assets in to Ireland.  The treatment of those assets is very clear in the system of national accounts and in the European system of accounts, the ESA 2010, which are the regulations governing the compilation of national accounts.  That is the explanation for that.</p></speech>

They are moving, relocating or transacting.  They can do it in a variety of ways; they can move a whole company here that is dominated by intellectual property products, or they can have the Irish entity purchase or import intellectual property products.  The Senator is right about the value of it and there is a science around it.  There are accountancy standards around how companies value these products.  The relocation or transfer of the actual purchase is neutral on GDP.  The 26% level shift that we saw in 2015 referred to the relocation of whole balance sheets for a number of entities that had a large amount of intellectual property products associated with them.  Contract manufacturing type activity was also associated with it.  These were entities that had production outside of Ireland, a net value was added from that production and all of the value added production was attributable to Ireland under the standards.  This is what drove the 26% shift.</p></speech>

However, this might help somewhat.  In 2015 we had that 26% jump in GDP.  The national accounts framework has another indicator, net domestic product, which strips out many of these globalisation events.

They are actually very good.  That is because we have a very good relationship with them.  That is based on the current environment in which we operate.  I do not believe penalties provide the answer.  The information we get from these companies is highly sensitive at an individual level.  I do not believe any level of penalty we might consider here would mitigate their concerns or potential concerns.</p> <p>  It is not definite, indeed it is highly unlikely, that there would be a breach of confidentiality.  However, we are responsible for compiling robust economic statistics on behalf of the Government and the people.  If we see a major risk to our ability to do that, it is our responsibility to highlight that risk.  That risk is much higher for Ireland than for any other EU member state because of the concentration of a very small number of multinationals and the impact on our economic and business statistics.</p></speech>

At the moment the total value is given in the final destination.  However, as members will have seen previously from these global value chains, the production of products is not a straightforward process.  It does not just happen in a factory in Ireland or a factory in Germany.  It involves multiple components some manufactured outside Europe with value added at different parts of the production cycle.  EUROSTAT and the Commission want to get a better handle on globalisation and then beyond that a better handle on global value chains.  From their perspective this may only be the start of a bigger issue.</p></speech>

I apologise that that is probably the extent of my Gaeilge.  The witnesses are very welcome and we are really glad that they are here with us today.  I know that we have at least one Gaeilgeoir on the committee and possibly others with better Irish than I have myself.  I give a very sincere welcome to Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Mac Giolla Bh&eacute;in, bainisteoir abhc&oacute;ideachta, Mr. Julian de Sp&aacute;inn, ard-r&uacute;na&iacute;, and Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Tiarnaigh, feidhmeannach cumars&aacute;ide, from Conradh na Gaeilge to our joint committee meeting today.  I invite the witnesses to give their opening statement.  This will be followed by questions from the committee.</p></speech>

Mar eolas don choiste, t&aacute; mise chun an caint a dh&eacute;anamh chun an rud ginear&aacute;lta a thabhairt don choiste.  Ansin, t&aacute; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Mac Giolla Bh&eacute;in chun beag&aacute;in&iacute;n c&uacute;lra a thabhairt don choiste ar an moladh do Acht at&aacute; againn at&aacute; sna c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; at&aacute; ag na baill.  T&aacute; leagan B&eacute;arla ann.  There is an English version of the caint, m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; ag teast&aacute;il &oacute; aon duine, sna c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; a chuireamar thart freisin.</p> <p>  T&aacute;im f&eacute;in agus Conradh na Gaeilge an-bhu&iacute;och as an deis seo teacht os comhair an choiste inniu le ceist na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh a phl&eacute;.  Ba mhaith linn bu&iacute;ochas faoi leith a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCathaoirleach agus le cl&eacute;ireach an chomhchoiste as an seisi&uacute;in seo a eagr&uacute;.  Aithn&iacute;tear d&uacute;inn c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; Comhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta do na pobail ar fad ar an oile&aacute;n seo, pobal na Gaeilge ach go h&aacute;irithe, agus aithn&iacute;tear d&uacute;inn fosta an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an gcomhchoiste seo agus muid ar fad ag iarraidh an comhaont&uacute; stairi&uacute;il sin a chosaint agus a fhorbairt.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn inniu go mbeidh muid &aacute;balta cur leis an obair fhi&uacute;ntach a bh&iacute;onn ar bun ag na baill go laeth&uacute;il anseo.</p> <p>  Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom roinnt eolais a thabhairt daoibh maidir le Conradh na Gaeilge, agus go h&aacute;irithe faoin obair a dh&eacute;anann muid &oacute; Thuaidh.  Mar is eol don choiste, is f&oacute;ram daonlathach &iacute; Conradh na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; breis is 200 craobh againn in &Eacute;irinn agus ar fud an domhain agus t&aacute; thart ar an ceathr&uacute; cuid de sin lonnaithe &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute;imid an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il go nd&eacute;anann craobhacha agus baill na heagra&iacute;ochta cl&aacute;r oibre na heagra&iacute;ochta a sti&uacute;radh agus go bhfuil gr&eacute;as&aacute;n l&aacute;idir de dh&iacute;ograiseoir&iacute; deonacha at&aacute; ag obair go dian d&iacute;cheallach don teanga ar bhonn lean&uacute;nach.  Chomh maith leis sin, is ceann na de na s&eacute; cheanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; muid roghnaithe ag Foras na Gaeilge, agus dualgais againn d&iacute;rithe ar chosaint teanga agus ard&uacute; feasachta na teanga.</p> <p>  B&iacute;onn Conradh na Gaeilge ag pl&eacute; le r&eacute;imse leathan tionscadail, togra&iacute; agus feachtais leis an nGaeilge a chosaint agus a spreagadh &oacute; Thuaidh.  Ina measc, t&aacute; feachtas chun cearta teanga a bhaint amach do phobal na Gaeilge, agus beidh m&eacute; ag teacht ar ais chuige sin n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Is cl&aacute;r &eacute; &Aacute;r dTeanga Roinnte at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l againn sna scoileanna &oacute; Thuaidh, ach go h&aacute;irithe scoileanna nach bhfuil aon eolas acu faoin nGaeilge, le heolas a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh faoin teanga.  D&iacute;r&iacute;onn muid ar pholasaithe Gaeilge a fhorbairt sna comhairl&iacute; &oacute; Thuaidh.  B&iacute;onn muid ag pl&eacute; leis an nGaeilge agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais sna scoileanna nach bhfeidhm&iacute;onn tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus sna Gaeilscoileanna dar nd&oacute;igh chomh maith.  I gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; craolt&oacute;ireachta, t&aacute; an-chuid nascanna d&eacute;anta againn le mionteangacha eile ar fud an domhain, b&iacute;odh siad sa Bhreatain Bheag n&oacute; san Albain.  T&aacute;imid mar bhall de chomhghualla&iacute;ocht darbh ainm ELEN san Eoraip agus foghlaim&iacute;onn muid go leor as sin.  B&iacute;onn sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; againn &oacute; Thuaidh chomh maith.  Le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, gach seans go raibh cuid de na baill p&aacute;irteach i Seachtain na Gaeilge, ina raibh 750,000 duine p&aacute;irteach ann.</p> <p>  Leis sin r&aacute;ite, ba mhaith liom anois aird a thabhairt ar an gc&eacute;ad rud a luaigh m&eacute;, agus an f&aacute;th a bhfuil muid anseo inniu, is &eacute; sin, Acht Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh mar thosa&iacute;ocht agus mar riachtanas le muin&iacute;n i gComhaont&uacute; Aoine an Cheasta, Comhaont&uacute; Chill R&iacute;mhinn agus socruithe aontaithe i ndiaidh sin a choth&uacute; sa phobal Gaeilge.  Is cinnte go bhfuil dul chun cinn ann &oacute; Thuaidh &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de &oacute; s&iacute;n&iacute;odh Comhaont&uacute; Aoine an Cheasta.  T&aacute; borradh tagtha ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute;, t&aacute; f&aacute;s m&oacute;r tagtha ar an nGaeloideachas agus t&aacute; gr&eacute;as&aacute;n l&aacute;idir de ghr&uacute;pa&iacute; pobal-bhunaithe ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, mar shampla.  Ach feictear d&uacute;inn agus d'&aacute;r mbaill go bhfuil bagairt&iacute; m&oacute;ra ann don Ghaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh chomh maith.  Is minic a dh&eacute;antar ionsaithe ar phobal na teanga agus is minic a chuirtear bac ar fh&aacute;s na teanga, go d&iacute;reach agus go hind&iacute;reach.  Bheadh pobal na Gaeilge den bhar&uacute;il go bhfuil go leor den dul chun cinn a luaigh m&eacute; ina thoradh ar a dh&iacute;ogras f&eacute;in agus gur tharla s&eacute; in ainneoin an St&aacute;it, seachas mar gheall uirthi.  Fosta, nuair at&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il &oacute;n St&aacute;t, go minic b&iacute;onn s&eacute; ag brath go m&oacute;r ar c&eacute; acu p&aacute;irt&iacute; lena mbaineann an tAire n&oacute; c&eacute; at&aacute; sa chomhairle agus an bhfuil s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; f&eacute;in b&aacute;&uacute;il don teanga.  Cuirtear in aghaidh molta&iacute; dearfacha teanga, agus sa ch&aacute;s go n-&eacute;ir&iacute;onn leis na molta&iacute; sin, is minic a mb&iacute;onn iarrachta&iacute; ann iad a tharraingt &oacute;na ch&eacute;ile ar&iacute;s i ndiaidh achar beag ama.</p> <p>  T&aacute; ocht bhfor&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anann tagairt don Ghaeilge i gComhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta.  Ina measc t&aacute; bearta a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn; le h&uacute;s&aacute;id na teanga a &eacute;asc&uacute; sa chaint agus i scr&iacute;bhneoireacht; le hiarracht a dh&eacute;anamh chun deireadh a chur le srianta ar fhorbairt na teanga; le hidirchaidreamh le pobal na Gaeilge a th&oacute;g&aacute;il; le dualgas reacht&uacute;il a chur ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna chun oideachas tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge a spreagadh; agus roinnt for&aacute;lacha t&aacute;bhachtacha eile bainte le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; craolach&aacute;in.</p> <p>  T&aacute; muid ag teacht leis na for&aacute;lacha sin uilig.  Ar an drochuair, &aacute;fach, agus muid 16 bliana &oacute; aonta&iacute;odh Comhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta, feictear d&uacute;inn agus do phobal na Gaeilge i gcoitinne nach guirtear go leor de na for&aacute;lacha sin i bhfeidhm sa spiorad n&oacute; sa chaoi go meastar ag an am agus go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; f&oacute;ralacha teipe de dh&iacute;th.  Mar a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; agam, go minic n&iacute;l for&aacute;lacha an chomhaontaithe &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm, agus nuair at&aacute;, b&iacute;onn iarrachta&iacute; l&aacute;idre ann le haisghairm a dh&eacute;anamh orthu.  B&iacute;onn ar phobal na Gaeilge i bhfad bharra&iacute;ocht ama a chaitheamh ag iarraidh iad f&eacute;in agus an teanga a chosaint, seachas a bheith ag obair ar shaothair dhearfacha chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Bheadh muid s&aacute;sta sampla&iacute; den cur i gcoinne agus de na hionsaithe sin a thabhairt, ach d&eacute;anfaidh muid aird an choiste a tharraingt i dtreo an chiorr&uacute; a rinneadh ar an sc&eacute;im spar&aacute;ntachta l&iacute;ofa.</p><p>D&rsquo;fh&aacute;g s&eacute; seo blas searbh i mb&eacute;al an phobail.  Is f&eacute;idir linn dul tr&iacute;d &eacute; sin beag&aacute;n&iacute;n eile n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute;, m&aacute;s mian leis an gcoiste.</p><p> Mar a luaigh m&eacute;, t&aacute; Conradh na Gaeilge i mbun stocaireachta agus feachtasa&iacute;ochta le hAcht na Gaeilge a bhaint amach &oacute; Thuaidh le roinnt mhaith de bhlianta anois.  &Oacute;n taith&iacute; at&aacute; againn &oacute; a sh&iacute;n&iacute;odh Comhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta, creideann muid go l&aacute;idir go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; le reachta&iacute;ocht leis an nGaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge a chosaint agus a choth&uacute; agus go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; leis le dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna at&aacute; m&eacute; i ndiaidh a lua.  T&aacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh seo bunaithe ar &aacute;r dtaith&iacute; f&eacute;in agus ar shaineolas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta n&oacute; sin a bhfuil molta ag na N&aacute;isi&uacute;in Aontaithe agus ag Comhairle na hEorpa.  N&iacute;os suntasa&iacute; ar&iacute;s agus de bharr stocaireacht d&iacute;reach agus lean&uacute;nach an Chonartha, is rud &eacute; go bhfuil m&oacute;ramh na mball sa Tion&oacute;l anois ar a son den ch&eacute;ad uair riamh - 50 ball as 90 ball.  T&aacute;imid an-s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an dul chun cinn sin d&eacute;anta.</p><p> Pl&eacute;ifidh m&eacute; na f&aacute;thanna a rachfadh Acht Gaeilge i ngleic le go leor de na constaic&iacute; at&aacute; luaite agam go luath ach ar dt&uacute;s ba mhaith liom fadhb amh&aacute;in eile a th&oacute;g&aacute;il leis an gcoiste.  Ceist mh&oacute;r eile a chuireann imn&iacute; orainn, agus t&aacute; a fhios agam gur ceist &iacute; seo ata faoi chaibidil ag an gcoiste le roinnt m&iacute;onna anois, n&aacute; ceist na Breatimeachta.  Beidh impleachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra ann do phobail agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge an oile&aacute;in mar gheall ar an mBreatimeacht.  I measc na n-impleachta&iacute; sin, m&aacute; dh&iacute;r&iacute;onn muid ar cheist reachta&iacute;ochta, gan aon reachta&iacute;ocht cosanta int&iacute;re, is &iacute; an Chairt Eorpach do Theangacha R&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha n&oacute; Mionlaigh an cosaint is m&oacute; at&aacute; ann don Ghaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; laig&iacute;, d&aacute;r nd&oacute;igh, ag baint le cur i bhfeidhm na cairte, mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite go lean&uacute;nach ag Comhairle na hEorpa, ach is creatlach ceart-bhunaithe idirnaisi&uacute;nta gur f&eacute;idir a &uacute;s&aacute;id le tomhas a dh&eacute;anamh ar chosaint na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  C&eacute; go mbaineann an chairt le Comhairle na hEorpa agus n&iacute; go d&iacute;reach leis an Aontas Eorpach, t&aacute; buaireamh m&oacute;r ann go mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; sp&aacute;is ag an st&aacute;t tarraingt siar a dh&eacute;anamh &oacute; threoracha an chairt mar thoradh ar an mBreatimeacht.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; go leor ceisteanna eile ann i dtaca leis na ceanneagra&iacute;ochta&iacute;, na pobail Ghaeilge ar an Teorann, na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; agus an obair trasTeorainn, an t-infreastrucht&uacute;r uile-&Eacute;ireann a d&rsquo;eascair &oacute; Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an C&eacute;asta, stad&aacute;s na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach agus eile.</p><p> T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh patr&uacute;n a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute; don choiste inniu agus sin go bhfuil p&eacute; dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta le blianta beaga anuas &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de i mbaol lean&uacute;nach.  T&aacute; an fh&eacute;idearthacht ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go nd&eacute;anfar scrios ar an bhforbairt, rud a tharla&iacute;onn go rialta agus go minic i gcaochadh na s&uacute;l.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go gcuirfear reachta&iacute;ocht inmhe&aacute;nach i bhfeidhm le pobal na Gaeilge a chosaint; le forbairt na teanga a chosaint; le cinnti&uacute; nach mbeidh tionchar cinni&uacute;nach ag Air&iacute; aonaracha n&oacute; St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s aineolach n&oacute;, i gc&aacute;sanna &aacute;irithe, naimhdeach ar thodhcha&iacute; na teanga; agus le cinnti&uacute; go dtig le pobal na Gaeilge aird a tharraingt ar an obair a ba mhaith leo a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> Chuige sin, d&rsquo;fhoilsigh muid pl&eacute;ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is i m&iacute; an Mh&aacute;rta ag d&eacute;anamh briseadh s&iacute;os ar cad &eacute; a bheadh i gceist le hAcht Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh agus an costas a bheadh leis.  Rinneadh an-iarracht a bheith airdeallach ar an gcomthe&aacute;cs polaiti&uacute;il &oacute; Thuaidh, ach go mbeadh an c&aacute;ip&eacute;is ag freastal ar mhianta an phobail agus ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il ar an saineolas ar fad at&aacute; bailithe thar na blianta.  D&eacute;anfaidh an tUasal Mac Giolla Bh&eacute;in cur s&iacute;os air sin agus, mar sin, n&iacute; dh&eacute;arfaidh m&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n eile faoi.</p><p> T&aacute; deis ar leith againn sa tr&eacute;imhse seo cinneadh stairi&uacute;il dearfach a bhaint amach don teanga.  Creideann muid go daingean go gcabhr&oacute;dh seo le cosaint a thabhairt don teanga roimh p&eacute; rud a thiteann amach faoin mBreatimeacht agus fosta go gcuideodh s&eacute; go m&oacute;r le maol&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar roinnt den achrann a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh agus, dar nd&oacute;igh, go gcuirfidh s&eacute; le rath&uacute;lacht Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta.</p><p> Bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh dh&aacute; rud a bhaint amach &oacute;n seisi&uacute;in seo inniu.  Ar dt&uacute;s, bh&iacute; muid ag iarraidh an deis a bheith againn roinnt ceisteanna a bhaineann le molta&iacute; at&aacute; againn d&rsquo;Acht Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh a phl&eacute; leis an gcoiste.  S&iacute;leann muid go bhfuil s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  Chomh maith leis sin, ba bhre&aacute; linn agus bheadh muid an bhu&iacute;och den choiste d&aacute; mbeadh an coiste s&aacute;sta r&uacute;n a rith ag tac&uacute; leis na molta&iacute; at&aacute; muid ag cur chun tosaigh agus go mbeadh an coiste in ann iad a chur os comhair an Taoisigh agus an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Eachtracha agus Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh cine&aacute;l achoimre gasta a thabhairt don choiste ar mholta&iacute; seo againne i dtaobh Acht na Gaeilge.  Mar phointe beag ag an t&uacute;s, bh&iacute; mise 16 bliana d'aois nuair a s&iacute;n&iacute;odh Comhaont&uacute; an Aoine Ch&eacute;asta.  Ag an am sin, gealladh r&eacute; &uacute;r don Ghaeilge.  Bh&iacute; an Ghaeilge ar an imeall ar fad &oacute;n st&aacute;t &oacute; Thuaidh leis na blianta ar fad roimhe sin.  Le Comhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta, bh&iacute; r&eacute; &uacute;r geallta.  Gealladh go mbeadh gn&iacute;omh l&aacute;idir deimhnithe d&eacute;anta ar son na Gaeilge.  In ainneoin na forbairt&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais de agus &oacute; thaobh an infreastrucht&uacute;r uile-oile&aacute;nda de, t&aacute; an spiorad sin caillte.  Fiche bliain beagnach i ndiaidh gur s&iacute;n&iacute;odh an comhaont&uacute; sin, is l&eacute;ir go bhfuilimid go f&oacute;ill ag fanacht ar na buncheartanna sin agus ar an spiorad den chomhaont&uacute; sin a bheith curtha i bhfeidhm.  Th&aacute;inig an t-&eacute;ileamh le haghaidh Acht Gaeilge ina dhiaidh an chomhaontaithe.  Cuireadh an deimhni&uacute; seo i gcomhaont&uacute; eile idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta - Comhaont&uacute; Chill R&iacute;mhinn - in 2006 agus ar&iacute;s eile t&aacute;imid go f&oacute;ill ag fanacht air sin a bheith curtha i bhfeidhm.</p> <p>  Nuair a chuireann daoine ceist - is fi&uacute; &eacute; seo a r&aacute; - faoi c&eacute;n f&aacute;th ar ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh Acht Gaeilge ann, is f&eacute;idir linn tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh do Chomhaont&uacute; Aoine an Ch&eacute;asta agus Comhaont&uacute; Chill R&iacute;mhinn, na conartha&iacute; idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta at&aacute; s&iacute;nithe, an taca&iacute;ocht forleathan at&aacute; ann n&oacute; an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann anois &oacute; thaobh m&oacute;ramh na mball tofa sa Tion&oacute;l &oacute; Thuaidh.  An pointe is tabhachta&iacute; domsa n&aacute; go bhfuil Acht Gaeilge de dh&iacute;th ceann is go bhfuil pobal Gaeilge beo br&iacute;omhar &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; pobal beo ann at&aacute; ag caitheamh a saol tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, at&aacute; ag foghaim faoin domhan tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge agus at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il p&aacute;ist&iacute;, ag f&aacute;il oideachais agus ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;id as seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; pobalbhunaithe uilig tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an pobal sin ann.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; ag dul &aacute;it ar bith, ach t&aacute;imid ag fanacht ar an staid agus ar an aitheantas at&aacute; tuillte againn a chur i bhfeidhm tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n reachta&iacute;ocht ceartbhunaithe.</p> <p>  Luadh an tUasal de Sp&aacute;inn c&uacute;pla pointe t&aacute;bhachtach ansin chomh maith i dtaca le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Breatimeachta agus leis an infreastrucht&uacute;r uile-oile&aacute;nda.  B'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh deis againn pilleadh air sin ar ball.</p> <p>  I dtaca le molta&iacute; seo againne &oacute; thaobh na hAchta de, rinneamar iarracht, ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, a bheith airdeallach ar na cinnt&iacute; polaiti&uacute;la ar leith at&aacute; ann.  Aithn&iacute;mid nach bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht forleathan polaiti&uacute;il ann.  C&eacute; nach leithsc&eacute;al sin gan na geall&uacute;int&iacute; a chur i bhfeidhm, tuigimid go bhfuil s&eacute; seo measartha casta.  Mar sin de, chuirimid pac&aacute;iste le ch&eacute;ile a dh&eacute;anann, dar linn, ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os agus an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;, freastal ar mhianta an phobail an m&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir Acht a dh&eacute;anamh agus, ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, at&aacute; ind&eacute;anta ar bhonn polaiti&uacute;il agus ar bhonn eacnama&iacute;ochta de.  Mar sin de, choinnimid na costais &iacute;seal agus rinneamar iarracht ruda&iacute; a bheith ann do leas an phobail.  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; nach bhfuil an tAcht ag dul an teanga a chur ar bheola aon duine &oacute;g, ach chinnteodh s&eacute; go bhfuil creatlach reacht&uacute;il ann don st&aacute;t &oacute; thaobh na dualgais at&aacute; air agus naruda&iacute; a chaithfidh an st&aacute;t a dh&eacute;anamh.  Mar is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n taith&iacute;, agus luaigh an tUasal de Sp&aacute;inn cuid de seo cheana f&eacute;in, sin rud at&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; ann d&oacute; &oacute; Thuaidh.</p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh &aacute;r molta&iacute; de, ag dul tr&iacute;othu go gasta anseo, t&aacute;imid ag caint go mbeadh st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il ann don Ghaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; an tAcht ar fad bunaithe air sin.  Murach an st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il, n&iacute; fi&uacute; na m&iacute;reanna eile at&aacute; luaite againn anseo.  Is &eacute; an st&aacute;das oifigi&uacute;il a thugann cearta don phobal agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r achan rud a dh&eacute;anaimid.  Beimid ag moladh go mbeadh aonad l&aacute;rnach aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n a bheadh in ann taca&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il le comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.   Amharcaimid air seo mar an rud is s&aacute;bh&aacute;la&iacute; ar an chostas go fadt&eacute;armach.

Ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute;imid ag moladh go mbeadh ini&uacute;chadh d&eacute;anta ar fhoireann reatha na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; seo.  T&aacute; aithne againn ar roinnt daoine at&aacute; ag obair sna comhlachta&iacute; a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, n&iacute;l an deis acu a gcuid scileanna teanga a &uacute;s&aacute;id chun leas an phobail.  An ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im leis sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; ini&uacute;chadh a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ar mhaithe sin, an rud at&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh n&aacute; ag moladh go mbeadh caighde&aacute;n&uacute; n&oacute; rang&uacute; d&eacute;anta ar na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.

T&aacute;imid ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il an m&uacute;nla seo &oacute;n Bhreatain Bheag, &aacute;it a bhfuil caighde&aacute;n ann seachas sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  Is l&eacute;ir d&uacute;inn &oacute;n luath-taighde air sin go bhfuil i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; feidhm agus tairbhe ag baint leis an chur chuige sin.</p> <p>  Chomh maith leis sin, molaimid go mbeadh rialtas &aacute;iti&uacute;il ann a bhfuil mar buanrialtas, m&aacute;s maith linn, &oacute; Thuaidh.  B&iacute;onn go leor leor teagmh&aacute;la ag saor&aacute;naigh an Tuaiscirt leis ar bhonn rialta.  Molaimid go mbeadh polasa&iacute; l&aacute;idir Gaeilge ag achan comhairle.  Rud at&aacute; iontach soil&eacute;ir &oacute; thaobh mholta&iacute; Chomhairle na hEorpa i leith pholasa&iacute; teanga de n&aacute; go mbeadh oifigigh Gaeilge ann agus go gcuirfeadh siad bunchreatlach seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Molaimid go mbeadh cead againn Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id sna c&uacute;irteanna.  De r&eacute;ir reachta&iacute;ocht &aacute;rsa - iarsma &oacute;n stair - t&aacute; cosc ar an Ghaeilge sna c&uacute;irteanna &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am deireadh a chur leis an Acht sin agus go mbeadh cead againn an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.</p> <p>  Molaimid go mbeadh l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge aitheanta &oacute;n Fheidhmeannas.

Molaimid go mbeadh comhartha&iacute;ocht dh&aacute;theangach ar na pr&iacute;omhb&oacute;ithre agus go mbeadh comhartha&iacute;ocht dh&aacute;theangach ag leibh&eacute;al rialtais &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus ag na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;.</p><p>Molaimid go mbeadh athr&uacute; agus c&oacute;ras lean&uacute;nach ann le haghaidh ainmneacha sr&aacute;ide &oacute; Thuaidh bunaithe ar tromlach na ndaoine at&aacute; ag caitheamh v&oacute;ta&iacute; ar na sr&aacute;ideanna seo a bheith b&aacute;&uacute;il do chomhartha&iacute;ocht d&aacute;theangach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin iontach t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn ar ch&uacute;pla ch&uacute;is, &oacute; thaobh feice&aacute;lacht na Gaeilge de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta go hidirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta go bhfuil feice&aacute;lacht mhionteanga r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach &oacute; thaobh shealbh&uacute; teanga agus cur chun cinn teanga de.  Chomh maith le sin, aithn&iacute;onn muid go bhfuil sciar maith d'&aacute;r bpobal &oacute; Thuaidh at&aacute; ar bheag&aacute;n eolais faoin nGaeilge.

Maidir leis na me&aacute;in de, t&aacute; leithcheal d&eacute;anta faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; leatrom ann &oacute; thaobh an mhaoini&uacute; at&aacute; &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il ag an BBC do Albain agus don Bhreatain Bheag i gcompar&aacute;id le pobail na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  An rud at&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach faoi sin, de r&eacute;ir an daon&aacute;irimh, n&aacute; go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilgeoir&iacute; &oacute; Thuaidh ann n&aacute; mar at&aacute; lucht labhartha na Gaidhlige in Albain.  Mar sin f&eacute;in, caithfidh Rialtas na Breataine c&uacute;ig oiread n&iacute;os m&oacute; airgid a chaitheamh ar Ghaidhlig na hAlban n&aacute; mar at&aacute;.  T&aacute; BBC Alba ann ach n&iacute;l a mhacasamhail ann &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go nd&eacute;anfar comh-imeacht le TG4 agus go mbeadh seirbh&iacute;s agus infheist&iacute;ocht ceart d&eacute;anta i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; craolt&oacute;ireachta &oacute; Thuaidh, mar at&aacute; tuillte againn.</p><p> Ar deireadh, i dtaca le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais de, is &eacute; bunchloch n&oacute; cuisle na hathbheochana &oacute; Thuaidh an c&oacute;ras Gaeloideachas.  Caithfear sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; dleathach a dh&eacute;anamh i leith an dualgais reacht&uacute;il.  Caithfidh an Gaeloideachas a bheith ar chomhch&eacute;im leis an oideachas tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n an Bh&eacute;arla.  Caithfidh teacht &eacute;igin laistigh den ch&oacute;ras B&eacute;arla a bheith ag daoine ar ranganna Gaeilge.  Caithfear cinnte a dh&eacute;anamh go mbeidh an obair &oacute;ige Gaeilge ar chomhch&eacute;im leis an obair &oacute;ige B&eacute;arla chomh maith.  Is &iacute; sin mo chuid.</p></speech>

I hope that the witnesses do not mind if I ask it in English.  Deputy Breathnach spoke about the language diminishing here in the Twenty-six Counties, yet there seems to be a huge demand for children to go to Gaelscoileanna.  In my own constituency and in my own county, there is at least double what the school can take in applying for places every single year.  Obviously, the witnesses would see that as a good thing.  Do they see that as a positive in terms of the language diminishing while people are sending their kids to Gaelscoileanna?  Do they see any sort of connection between the two?  What is the demand for Gaelscoileanna in the Six Counties?  Is it in any way similar?  I do not imagine that the demand is the exact same, but is it increasing?</p></speech>

Beidh na comhchainteanna a thosaigh i ndiaidh an toghch&aacute;n &oacute; Thuaidh ag teacht ar ais in am tr&aacute;tha.  Don ch&eacute;ad uair riamh, t&aacute; m&oacute;ramh i measc na baill nua-thofa i dTion&oacute;l Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann ag teacht leis an Acht.  D&aacute; mbeadh guth l&aacute;idir aontaithe ag teacht ar bhonn trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; &oacute; na p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la &oacute; Dheas, creidim go gcruth&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin m&oacute;iminteam &oacute; thaobh na ceiste seo n&aacute;r f&eacute;idir a stopadh.  Bheadh s&eacute; ina cuidi&uacute; m&oacute;r d&aacute; mbeadh baill an choiste seo, ar dh&oacute;igh ar bith, in ann an br&uacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo a choinne&aacute;il ar an Taoiseach, ar an Aire, an Teachta Flanagan, n&oacute; fi&uacute; ar na polaiteoir&iacute; eile Thuaidh agus Theas.</p> <p>  T&aacute; m&eacute; ar aon ghuth leis an Teachta O'Sullivan i dtaobh na molta&iacute; at&aacute; leagtha amach aici.  Bheadh coimisin&eacute;ir de dh&iacute;th chun a l&aacute;n de na molta&iacute; sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Is d&oacute;igh linn gur cheart an coimisin&eacute;ir a chur ar bun mar cheann de na ch&eacute;ad ruda&iacute; at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; dualgas saini&uacute;il ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga chun m&iacute;reanna &aacute;irithe, mar shampla, maidir le comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; agus maidir le logainmneacha, a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il amach.</p> <p>  Labhair an Teachta O'Sullivan faoin nGaeloideachas freisin.  Chuir an Cathaoirleach ceist maidir leis an &aacute;bhar seo.  Is &iacute; seo an earn&aacute;il is m&oacute; f&aacute;is &oacute; Thuaidh.  Nuair at&aacute; scoileanna eile ag d&uacute;nadh, agus l&iacute;on na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ag freastal ar scoileanna i gcoitinne ag titim, t&aacute; r&aacute;ta rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ochta an Ghaeloideachais ag dul in airde.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil timpeall 40 na&iacute;scoil, 35 bunscoil agus dh&aacute; mhe&aacute;nscoil saor-scartha againn faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; aonad n&oacute; sruth i gc&uacute;ig n&oacute; s&eacute; me&aacute;nscoil &oacute; Thuaidh freisin.  T&aacute; breis is 6,000 p&aacute;iste ag f&aacute;il a gcuid oideachais tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  Bunaithe ar chompar&aacute;id a rinneamar i mbliana idir na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; iontr&aacute;la i rang a haon agus na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; f&aacute;g&aacute;la i rang a seacht, t&aacute;imid ag tuar go dtiocfaidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; de 50% ar an earn&aacute;il seo laistigh de seacht mbliana.  T&aacute; an earn&aacute;il seo ag f&aacute;s, ach tagann deacrachta&iacute; leis sin.  T&aacute; roinnt de na Gaelscoileanna &oacute; Thuaidh ag feidhmi&uacute; i mboth&aacute;in agus in aonaid eile nach bhfuil ar bhealach ar bith s&aacute;s&uacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra againn maidir le sainriachtanais.  N&iacute;l deis ag p&aacute;ist&iacute; a bhfuil sainriachtanais oideachais acu taca&iacute;ocht a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; m&oacute;ra againn maidir le taistil chuig Gaelscoileanna.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th gur mheas muidne go raibh s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach m&iacute;reanna l&aacute;idre a chur isteach.  T&aacute; an-&eacute;ileamh ar an nGaelscola&iacute;ocht &oacute; Thuaidh.  Ar bhonn pearsanta, t&aacute; m&eacute; mar chathaoirleach ar scoil.  T&aacute;imid sa bh&aacute;d c&eacute;anna.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ann do sp&aacute;sanna.  T&aacute; i bhfad barra&iacute;ocht daoine ag lorg sp&aacute;sanna sa Ghaelscoil agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn freastal a dh&eacute;anamh orthu.</p> <p>  D'iarr an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Donnghaile c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a bhfuil an tAcht ag cruth&uacute; deacrachta&iacute;.  S&iacute;lim gurb &eacute; an easpa cearta an rud a chrutha&iacute;onn deacrachta&iacute; n&oacute; scoilteanna maidir leis an nGaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  T&aacute; an pobal seo ag f&aacute;s agus ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; agus t&aacute; a gcuid cearta &aacute; n-&eacute;ileamh acu agus iad ag teacht i dteagmh&aacute;il leis an st&aacute;t i r&eacute;ims&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la go laeth&uacute;il.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, n&iacute;l an st&aacute;t &aacute;balta pl&eacute; leo.  Braitheann s&eacute; ar an Aire agus ar an feidhmeannach n&oacute; st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;seach a fhreagra&iacute;onn an guth&aacute;n.  Go minic, n&iacute; fhaigheann t&uacute; seirbh&iacute;s r&eacute;as&uacute;nta n&oacute; fi&uacute; seirbh&iacute;s ar chor ar bith.  Ar an d&oacute;igh c&eacute;anna, is minic nach bhfaigheann t&uacute; sc&eacute;im taca&iacute;ochta a fhreastala&iacute;onn ar na mianta at&aacute; agat, n&oacute; fi&uacute; sc&eacute;im taca&iacute;ochta ar chor ar bith.  Is &eacute; sin mar at&aacute; s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.  Crutha&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin teannas, aighneas agus coimhlint idir an pobal agus an st&aacute;t.  Is &eacute; an bealach is fusa &eacute; sin a r&eacute;iteach n&aacute; tr&iacute; reachta&iacute;ocht a chur i bhfeidhm agus an fr&aacute;ma n&oacute; an chreatlach reacht&uacute;il c&eacute;anna a leagan amach do gach uile roinn, comhalta n&oacute; Aire &oacute; Thuaidh, b&iacute;odh siad &oacute; ph&aacute;irt&iacute; amh&aacute;in n&oacute; &oacute; ph&aacute;irt&iacute; eile.

D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur cheist tola at&aacute; ann, ar bhealach.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn i gc&oacute;na&iacute; amharc ar na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; at&aacute; ag tac&uacute; leis an Acht agus ar an mbealach ar fad at&aacute; taobh thiar d&uacute;inn.  T&aacute; an-taca&iacute;ocht faighte ag an Acht, go h&aacute;irithe le blianta beaga anuas.  Mar a luaigh an tUasal de Sp&aacute;inn, faoi l&aacute;thair t&aacute; 50 as 90 MLA nua-thofa ag tac&uacute; le hAcht Gaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh.  Dar liom, is &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair go raibh m&oacute;ramh sa Tion&oacute;l n&oacute; san bhFeidhmeannas &oacute; Thuaidh ag tac&uacute; lena leith&eacute;id.  Ar bhonn idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, t&aacute; na N&aacute;isi&uacute;in Aontaithe agus Comhairle na hEorpa i ndiaidh taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do shol&aacute;thar reachta&iacute;ocht ceartbhunaithe cosanta teanga &oacute; Thuaidh fosta.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, ritheadh r&uacute;n ag an gComhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n an mh&iacute; seo caite le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Acht Teanga.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an freas&uacute;racht ag laghd&uacute; de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile.  Thagair an Teachta do roinnt cruinnithe a tharla ar na mallaibh.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite acu si&uacute;d a bh&iacute; bainteach leis an bhfreas&uacute;racht a bh&iacute; ann roimhe seo go bhfuil siad ag smaoineamh ar shol&aacute;thar reacht&uacute;il don Ghaeilge.  S&iacute;lim gur dul chun cinn suntasach &eacute; sin, ach t&aacute; go leor oibre f&oacute;s le d&eacute;anamh.  Is fi&uacute; a lua gur gealladh strait&eacute;is Gaeilge fosta.  Bh&iacute; a leith&eacute;id de strait&eacute;is aontaithe i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais agus - ar n&oacute;s an Acht Gaeilge - i gComhaont&uacute; Chill R&iacute;mhinn, ach bh&iacute; freas&uacute;racht sa Tion&oacute;l.  Tar &eacute;is do Chonradh na Gaeilge athbhreithni&uacute; breithi&uacute;nach a ghlacadh san Ard-Ch&uacute;irt an bhliain seo caite, th&aacute;inig rial&uacute; dearfach amach &oacute;n Ard-Ch&uacute;irt i m&iacute; an Mh&aacute;rta na bliana seo a d&uacute;irt gur ch&oacute;ir go gcuirf&iacute; strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge &oacute; Thuaidh i bhfeidhm.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh reachta&iacute;ocht n&oacute; strait&eacute;is ag brath ar thoil, ach gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeid&iacute;s ann faoi mar a ghealladh iad.</p></speech>

Beagnach l&aacute;ithreach, thosaigh s&iacute; ar chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n leis an phobal le hamharc ar mianta an phobail i dtaobh strait&eacute;ise.

I would just like to say that I can hear, to a certain extent, the frustration in the witnesses' voices.  I can appreciate that.  I think it was Mr. de Sp&aacute;inn who noted it has been nearly 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement.  Clearly we are the committee tasked with trying to ensure the Agreement gets fully implemented, so it is no difficulty for us to support his proposals.  We genuinely thank the witnesses for coming in and we will stay in contact in respect of progress.  There is definitely a need for an Irish language Act and the witnesses definitely have our full support.</p></speech>

I have at least had the opportunity to send my sons to a Gaelscoil.  Hopefully they will help me to improve my Gaeilge.  There is a little more awareness and people are certainly embracing it more than they would have in the past.  It is not too long since I was in secondary school, but even since then there is a greater appreciation of the language and an understanding that a person can come to the language at any age and learn and embrace it.

I welcome to our first session Deputy Joan Collins, Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail and Ms Treasa Brannick O&rsquo;Cill&iacute;n.  At today's meeting we are considering Deputy Collins's Bill on water in public ownership.

Translation is available for members if required.</p><p>Before we begin I draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Deputy Collins to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

This proposed constitutional amendment seeks to address significant concerns which have been strongly expressed by the public about the possible privatisation of public water services.  The public have indicated their strong desire to have the public water supply protected from privatisation.  This issue has been reflected as a matter of public importance in the report of the expert commission on domestic public water services which recommends constitutional protection from privatisation.  The Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services has also recommended that water should remain in public ownership and that a constitutional referendum should be held on that question.</p> <p>  It been recognised by both the expert commission and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services that the appropriate means of addressing this issue is through our Constitution, as the people&rsquo;s document.  Constitutional protection can ensure that responsibility for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system remains the responsibility of Government and that this key public resource remains in public ownership into the future.  This also ensures the public interest can remain at the heart of decision-making into the future.</p> <p>  Providing constitutional protection also prevents the threat of a Government being strong-armed by an external authority or otherwise into transferring key assets and responsibilities to private interests.  It essentially puts it off the table and ensures the public water system and access to it is secure and protected into the future on behalf of the people.</p> <p>  The proposed amendment is designed to clarify and copper-fasten State ownership of the public water system as distinct from privately owned and operated water systems in the form of group water schemes and private wells and boreholes.  These privately owned water systems are not in public ownership.</p> <p>  The proposed amendment is also designed to clarify and copper-fasten the Government&rsquo;s responsibilities in terms of protecting, managing and maintaining the public water system in the public interest.

Is seanchara liom &eacute;.  Bh&iacute;omar ag troid le ch&eacute;ile ar an taobh c&eacute;anna san Ard-Ch&uacute;irt blianta &oacute; shin.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an prionsabal at&aacute; anseo.  N&iacute; raibh aon dabht agam riamh gurb &eacute; seo an treo ceart, ach cad a thiteann amach i dt&iacute;ortha eile?  An bhfuil aon bhunreacht eile a bhfuil cuid mar seo ann?  What is the precedent in other countries?  How did they deal with this issue?  I fully support the principle of public ownership and always have supported it.  I never varied in that regard.  I am just wondering what this was benchmarked against.</p> <p>  T&aacute; ceist eile agam.  M&aacute; &eacute;ir&iacute;onn leis an reifreann, d&uacute;irt an tUasal &Oacute; Tuathail go mbeidh an dualgas ar an D&aacute;il na ruda&iacute; a bhaineann le toradh an reifrinn a chur i ndlithe nua.  Rud bun&uacute;sach n&aacute; an r&oacute;l a bheidh ag Uisce &Eacute;ireann n&oacute; an comhlacht a bheadh i gceannas ar an uisce poibl&iacute;.  C&eacute;n difr&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anfadh an reifreann don chomhlacht sin, go h&aacute;irithe, agus don cheist idir Uisce &Eacute;ireann agus Ervia?  For clarity, if this referendum is passed, what implications, if any, will it have for the company called Irish Water, specifically and particularly in terms of its relationship with the company called Ervia, which is the holding company for Irish Water?  One of the problems I have always had, which relates to the intention behind setting up Irish Water, was that it would be a stand-alone entity and would not and could not be subject to the influence of Bord G&aacute;is, as it was initially, or Ervia, as it became.  I lost that argument in the debate with my political colleagues but it is one that concerns me.  Is there any implication for Ervia or the separation of Irish Water?  Would it better for Irish Water to be totally separate from its holding company in terms of the responsibility and accountability it will have under the Constitution?  While Ervia is a semi-State company, it is a commercial company.  I have concerns in that regard.  M&aacute; t&aacute; aon fhreagra ar an gcuid sin de, bheinn s&aacute;sta.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#D00500"><p>I thank Deputy Collins, Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail and Ms Brannick O'Cill&iacute;n for both the legislation and the presentations.  Before I ask my questions, I wish to put two general comments on the record.  The first is that it is significant that the single largest issue on which the expert commission received submissions of interest was, as Deputy Collins has outlined, the issue of the need for a referendum to protect the public ownership of the water and water services.  That is testament to how significant an issue this is among the public.  There were many things that those of us who sat through the 11 or 12 weeks of the hearings of the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services did not agree on, but it is also significant that this was one of the issues, in terms of the core principle behind this Bill, on which we ended up reaching agreement.  We wanted to see such a constitutional protection, whatever the eventual wording.</p> <p>  The other point is that water is different.  Sometimes this gets lost in the public debate.  It is not like other so-called utilities.  Unlike fossil fuels that can be replaced by renewable energies etc., water is not replaceable.  Water is an increasingly finite resource and we are seeing in other parts of the world how the failure to manage this strategic asset adequately in the public interest is causing social, economic and cultural problems.  This is one of the most compelling arguments why this particular public resource needs to be retained in public ownership.</p> <p>  We received a briefing document from the Department.  It does not have an awful lot to say about the legislation but it raises a number of possible concerns.  I would be interested to hear the responses of Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail and Ms Brannick O'Cill&iacute;n to those concerns from a legal point of view.  The Department seems to be suggesting that there could be so-called unintended consequences if the wording of a constitutional amendment is not drafted carefully.  That is, that somehow assets which currently are private assets - privately owned boreholes, wells or group water schemes - could somehow be dragged into the definition of the public system.</p><p>What are the witnesses' views on it?  Do they think that there is currently any legal confusion about what is a public asset and what is a private asset?  If we were to pass this text into the Constitution by way of referendum, do they think it would allow assets which are today clearly private assets to be incorporated into the public system against the wishes of the owners of these assets?</p><p> The other issue that came up in the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services is this business of whether the State could sell decommissioned assets of the water system.  As we know, we have far too many water treatment plants.  Many of them are old and in a state of disrepair.  Irish Water has a plan to replace them and build new ones.  We will then have many of these facilities which will no longer be in use and therefore decommissioned and not part of the water system.  Is there anything in this text which would prevent Irish Water or any other public utility from selling those decommissioned assets once they are no longer part of the system?  Those are my questions.  Depending on how others proceed, I may come back with more.</p></speech>

The other issue relates to ongoing public private partnerships on the design, build and maintenance of schemes throughout the country.  As of now, I think there are 115 schemes for approximately 230 sites throughout the country.  What impact, if any, would it have on those?  Would the State still be able to participate in those schemes?</p> <p>  What assurance can be given that the management and oversight of the Irish Water entity will not shift from the Oireachtas to the Judiciary?  Is it wise to have the utility, as it is constituted, named in the Constitution?</p></speech>

D'ardaigh an Teachta Cowen an cheist sin freisin.  D'fh&eacute;adfadh socruithe teacht amach anseo.  An cheist a bheadh ann n&aacute; cad &eacute; an cothrom&oacute;id idir poibl&iacute; agus pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach.

T&aacute; sampla amh&aacute;in i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath de dhroichead a t&oacute;gadh mar sin, an East Link bridge.  N&iacute; raibh aon fhadhb ann faoi riamh agus, i ndeireadh an lae, th&aacute;inig s&eacute; ar ais i seilbh poibl&iacute;, c&eacute; gur lean, faraor, Comhairle Cathrach Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath leis na t&aacute;ill&iacute; a ghearradh.  Is faoi sc&aacute;th an Bhunreachta a oibr&iacute;onn an c&oacute;ras poibl&iacute; agus an c&oacute;ras pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach sa t&iacute;r seo.  Mar sin, n&iacute;l aon fhadhb leis sin.</p> <p>  D'ardaigh an Teachta O'Dowd ceist maidir le g&aacute; le reachta&iacute;ocht.  De ghn&aacute;th, nuair at&aacute; airteagal nua &aacute; chur isteach sa mBunreacht, t&aacute; reachta&iacute;ocht ag freagairt leis.  Mar shampla, tagann cuid mhaith den reachta&iacute;ocht sa t&iacute;r seo &oacute;n mBruis&eacute;il.  Pl&eacute;itear leis mar ionstraim reacht&uacute;il go minic.  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann s&eacute; isteach sa D&aacute;il, ar &eacute;igean.  Maidir le ceist ar bith mar sin, bheadh reachta&iacute;ocht ann dar liomsa ag lean&uacute;int an thogra reifrinn seo.  D&aacute; mbeadh gear&aacute;n go raibh an reachta&iacute;ocht m&iacute;-bhunreacht&uacute;il toisc &eacute; a bheith r&oacute;-ch&uacute;ng n&oacute; r&oacute;-leathan, sin ceist bhunreacht&uacute;il agus t&eacute;ann daoine isteach sa ch&uacute;irt.  N&iacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin r&oacute;-mhinic.  Sa chiall sin, &oacute; tharla go bhfuilimid ag pl&eacute; le leas&uacute; bunreacht&uacute;il, t&aacute;imid ag pl&eacute; le reachta&iacute;ocht ina dhiaidh sin agus, m&aacute; t&aacute; fadhb ar bith, pl&eacute;ifear leis sa ch&uacute;irt.</p> <p>  Deputy Cowen asked whether we will be mired and have to go to the courts about everything.  Critical issues arise at times and the courts decide them.  Then there is a precedent that governs any other issues that arise in that particular area.  This constitutional amendment, if accepted by the people, is no different from any other constitutional requirement except that it safeguards the public water supply in the public interest.  As I understand it, that is its main function and it is set out in the text.  The responsibility primarily lies with the Government.  The Government, as we know, generates the Bills that come into the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Therefore, the Government is in the best position of all, in the constitutional shadow, to protect the asset once this particular amendment goes into the Constitution, assuming it does.  I would have no trouble with that.</p> <p>  Public private partnerships have operated under the Constitution as it stands, with the requirement of the protection of private property.  I would not envisage that an extra layer or dimension, if one likes, of protection for public water supply would be any different in terms of its playing out in subsequent legislation or litigation.  I can only respond in general terms given that there is no particular example coming along the road.  When an issue arises in the courts and there is great uncertainty as to which way the courts will decide it, it is notorious that Article 35 in the Constitution gives that job ultimately to the Supreme Court.  We have a new Court of Appeal, but under the Constitution, the Supreme Court is still the deciding body for issues that go to the courts.  Often, in fairness to the courts, when an issue is decided in principle in one area, it assists in other areas in terms of clarity.  I hope Deputy Cowen can accept that rather vague explanation.</p> <p>  I have nothing further to add.</p></speech>

I agree with the tone of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.</p><p>I do not see any difficulty in distinguishing between private and public ownership of water supplies.  There was a question on what would happen to decommissioned assets.  When State companies have assets that are decommissioned, they are usually sold by the State company, such as Bord na M&oacute;na for example.  They can be sold, but they are sold subject to the requirements of Bord na M&oacute;na in its semi-State personality.  If there is any issue around public or private in that situation, Bord na M&oacute;na makes a decision which anybody can challenge.  The most famous challenge ever to Bord na M&oacute;na was about who owned the cutaway bogland.  That is now becoming very important because of the suggestion that we can have a huge lake in the midlands, drawn from the Shannon, to supply Dublin with water.  We have an underground aquifer on the Dublin-Kildare border that has been there since the ice age.  The experts say it can supply Dublin's domestic and commercial needs for 25 years but we might not want to tap it.  In respect of the cutaway bogland, the decision was that Bord na M&oacute;na's statutory remit from the Oireachtas was to cut, save and sell the turf.  The Oireachtas did not, however, give it ownership of the cutaway.  That was a famous case near Athlone many years ago.  That is still the law.  The position of these public bodies that have existed and served the people and the country very well in difficult times is not affected in any way by the passage of this referendum, which specifically deals with the public water supply.</p></speech>

Whereas most people wish the water issue would go away because of the discussions over recent months, for me it is something that should remain on the agenda forever.  There is one aspect which I feel is a potential weakness and I wonder if could the Bill be strengthened.  That is in relation to the ecosystems services.  We talk about the public good but we are not talking about the ecological aspect of water.  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail spoke about water distribution but not about water in terms of supply, wastewater collection and the services around that.  Would there be or could there be an opportunity to strengthen the Bill a little beyond the public good?</p></speech>

As it stands, what is in the proposed amendment is the headline situation.  That aspect, in so far as I understand it, could possibly be accommodated in legislation independent of the amendment.  Another possibility would be if the D&aacute;il were to decide to add something in this regard on Committee Stage.  As it stands, the essential element and principle is adumbrated in the amendment as proposed.  While I am not in any way against such a proposal, I would certainly have to think about it for much longer before I could say yes to it.  That is my point of view at the moment.</p></speech>

We have to acknowledge that there is concern in the public regarding the public ownership of water.  That has been reflected through the Deputy's Bill, but also through the expert commission and indeed our own work on the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.</p> <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I have some concerns regarding assets that are already in public ownership.  For example, speaking in layman's language, I am aware in County Waterford that Waterford County Council has a number of old wastewater treatment plants that are no longer in use.  They are being decommissioned because new treatment plants have been installed.  They are obviously on pieces of land and they are now part of the overall water infrastructure.  How would Irish Water or the State dispose of those when they are no longer of use?  Will this amendment to the Constitution tie their hands so that they could not dispose of them?  I know Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail has tried to address that issue through his Bord na M&oacute;na response but, from what I heard, that was more or less about a product of the land, the turf or the briquettes, rather than about the land or infrastructure itself.  These are the technicalities that cause the complexity.  I am only giving one example and I would like to hear Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#F01500"><p>I just wanted to follow up on Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's answer to that because it ties in with Senator Coffey's question.  The first sentence of the amendment talks about the public water system.  The word "system" here is very important.</p><p>Let us say there is an asset that is part of the system today but in the future is decommissioned and is no longer part of the system, as outlined by Senator Coffey.  As the asset is no longer in the system, it is no longer covered by the amendment and there would be nothing to prevent Irish Water or another State agency from selling it on.  That is my reading of the situation, which I ask Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail to confirm. </p><p> I will be unfair to Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail by asking for a "Yes" or "No" answer to my next question, which I acknowledge is difficult for a senior and eminent legal professional to say.  The Department included in its response to us the following line: "unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals' [constitutional] rights to private property".  I ask Mr &Oacute; Tuathail to state, as clearly as possible, whether he believes there is anything in the Bill put forward by Deputy Joan Collins that would have unintended consequences that could impinge the constitutional right of individuals to private property.  I want to know because that aspect will be one of the main discussion points when the Minister and his officials attend here for the next session. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#G00200"><p>I shall reply to the questions posed by Senator Coffey and Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p> <p>  Senator Coffey raised the issue of obsolescence, as I understand it.  One can ask oneself the following question using any semi-State company.  What happens to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann's buses when they are no longer fit for purpose and have for reasons of public safety been taken off the road?  Personally, I do not know what happens to them but, clearly, that would be a matter for the relevant State authority to decide and to get rid of.  I have mentioned that in some part of my presentation in which I stated that from the basis of first principles, if an asset relating to the public water system has become obsolete then it is no longer being used and cannot be considered to be part of the public water system.  Clearly, there would be a disposal way of doing it.</p> <p>  I can recall a period when Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had a lot of obsolete railways.  There was a controversy years later about how it disposed of the sleepers and rails.  I have lost sight of the controversy since and it is long gone as an issue.  There were issues about the matter.  I understand they were issues of accounting for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann at the time, which was the responsible body.  If something becomes obsolete and is no longer of use in the public water system then clearly, like any properly managed asset, it should be disposed of.  There will be plenty of people willing to take that up.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, I do not see any public-private issue arising from the proposed amendment.  If anybody has an issue, the legislation passed on foot of the amendment coming into place in the Constitution would either deal with the issue or it would become a matter for the court and the court would then deal with that issue.  The Deputy must remember that the proposed amendment refers to Article 28.  It does not apply to the private property article in the Constitution, which makes private property sacrosanct.  A constitution, when amended, must read as a whole.  One must read the entire Constitution and decide what is meant.  If there is an apparent conflict the courts come along and balance the Constitution and state what is the real meaning.  That is the specific function of the Supreme Court.  That aspect has operated successfully over the years in different contexts, with which I have no difficulty.   </p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the provision in the amendment that states: "The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system."  The Government, on any of these issues, would have the best advice available to it via the Attorney General as to what should be done with something that has become obsolete or is no longer of use.  Let us say a new development arose for the distribution of water.  We know that there is a leakage of over 40% in the public water supply, which is being addressed.  If some issue arose that required the Government to take a view in light of the proposed amendment, assuming it is accepted, then the Government has the best advice available to it via the Office of the Attorney General, if required, and then the D&aacute;il, Seanad and the President can legislate. </p></speech>

Clearly, we are talking about the public water system.  We are not talking about group water schemes, boreholes or private water systems, which are constituted differently.  If the Government perceives a problem in its own situation in respect of the public-private aspect, the Department should tell members where the problems arise and explain them.  The Department has not clarified why it has raised the clause of unintended consequences.  Its explanation should form part of the next debate on this matter.  If a question has arisen then the Department should identify the problems.  They have not done so because I do not believe problems exist.  The proposed 35th amendment of the Constitution simply ensures the resource remains in public ownership and that the Government is responsible for its maintenance and management.  Therefore, it is important that the amendment is passed.</p> <p>  Water is a huge concern globally, particularly in terms of the role played by big private companies.  Water is the new oil and will be a scarce resource in the future.  It is important that the people of Ireland have an opportunity to vote in a referendum to keep their water resources in public ownership.  Many people throughout the world will appreciate the State taking such an action.  I call on the committee to take this matter on board. </p></speech>

At that time a good debate took place with Members on all sides of the House contributing.  That debate reinforced the fact that all of us share a common view on the State owning this vital public service.  Not once have I heard a dissenting voice in the Oireachtas on this issue. </p> <p>  There are a number of features of the water sector in Ireland that are relevant when considering the Bill.  First, the nature of our topography and population dispersal means that we have an extensive number of small, mainly surface water sources, rather than single large aquifers which can be the case in other countries.  In addition, the evolution of water services in rural areas has largely been dependent on private or group water investment.  Thus the public water utility, Irish Water, is not the exclusive provider of water services, but does provide drinking water to 83% of the population and waste water services to 64% of the population.</p> <p>  Water policy is seeking to ensure the appropriate stewardship of all of the nation&rsquo;s water resources and that all citizens have access to quality drinking water, across a sector that has multiple stakeholders and varying ownership and delivery structures.  That being said, the majority of citizens receive water services from Irish Water, the State&rsquo;s public water utility, and the concerns raised regarding potential privatisation of water services are focused on Irish Water.  That is my understanding from Deputy Collins's Bill.</p> <p>  It may be useful if I set out both the current legislative safeguards to prohibit the privatisation of Irish Water, as well as the current status of work, from my Department&rsquo;s perspective, on proposals for a constitutional amendment.  The Water Services Act 2013 places a clear prohibition on the shareholders of Irish Water, that is, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; the Minister for Finance; and the board of Ervia, from alienating their shares in the utility.  Subsequently, in 2014, the Government introduced a further safeguard through the Water Services Act 2014.  Arising from the Act, were a situation ever to arise where any privatisation or part-privatisation of Irish Water was to be contemplated, through alienation of any share in Irish Water to anyone other than another Minister, this could not occur without three specific actions taking place: first, both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to pass a resolution approving such a proposal; second, a majority of voters in a plebiscite would have to give their approval to the proposal; and third, the Minister would then have to initiate legislation to privatise Irish Water or alienate any share held by the Government.  In other words a triple lock was put in place in legislation to try to reassure people on this issue.</p> <p>  A key principle in addressing the fragmentation within the system and bringing delivery and strategic planning into a single water utility was that this would be a public utility - a State body in public ownership.  The objective of moving from a system of water services delivery by 34 water services authorities towards a single utility approach was to achieve economies of scale, greater efficiency and more effective long-term strategic planning, which I am glad to say is all happening now.</p> <p>  The strong policy intent of the State has always been to maintain public water services in public ownership.  This was already reflected in the Water Services Act 2007 and, in transferring functions from local authorities to Irish Water in 2013, the protections in that Act against what is termed &ldquo;alienation of public water assets&rdquo; were carried forward into the new arrangements.  Concerns that the reform process, initiated in 2011, might lead to the future privatisation of water services, persisted.  Recognising these concerns, the previous Government twice legislated on the issue of public ownership of water services to give further protections and I have outlined what those protections were.</p><p> Existing legislation, therefore, already provides a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water and sets out a range of steps that would need to be taken in the event that the statutory prohibition involved was to be removed.  However, despite these legislative barriers to privatisation, people continue to have genuine concerns and I accept that.  The Government respects and acknowledges these concerns and the efforts made by the authors of the Bill to address them.  Indeed, it was in this context that I asked my officials to meet Deputy Joan Collins and her team to develop a shared understanding of the specific operation of the existing prohibitions and the issues that would need to be carefully considered in further future arrangements.</p><p> The possibility of a constitutional amendment to protect public ownership of water infrastructure has been considered previously.  The provisions on the plebiscite, reflected in the 2014 legislation, were brought forward as an alternative to a constitutional provision in light of concerns at the time regarding potential unintended consequences of such a provision.  They also reflected the fact that the operation of State structures is usually described in legislation approved by the Oireachtas rather than in the fundamental legal document of the State, namely, the Constitution.  However, in the intervening period, Opposition Deputies published four similar Bills proposing a constitutional amendment to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  Resulting from this, I stated during the Second Stage debate last November in the D&aacute;il that I am open to considering a workable proposal that provides the necessary certainty in respect of the future public ownership of Irish Water.  I also indicated that due to the complexity of issues involved in any potential constitutional protection, I reserved my position to propose a Government amendment to the wording on Committee Stage.</p><p> Among the issues to be considered in drafting a constitutional amendment are wording challenges arising as a result of the range of categories of infrastructural ownership, achieving a balance between principles reflected in the Constitution and the more detailed policy to be reflected in legislation and addressing the risk of unintended consequences.  The last is probably the biggest concern that I have, to be honest, but we can talk through these issues further.  Issues around the wording of any amendment arise from the plurality of water infrastructure ownership categories.  These include private bore holes, private group water schemes, private group schemes that are sourcing water from the public network and water infrastructure located on privately-owned land.  There are also issues to be considered in the context of the potential for unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals&rsquo; rights to private property, which are strongly protected in the Constitution.  My officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issues arising in order to provide advice to me, the Government and this committee, as this Bill progresses through the Oireachtas.  I will possibly be bringing forward amendments to address some of the issues I have outlined.</p><p> I recognise where we have come to in terms of the water debates.  I also recognise the recommendations that have been made by both the expert commission and the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  This was one of the issues on which there was not a lot of division or contention at the aforementioned committee.  I hope that people will accept that there is a willingness to try to be helpful here.  That said, I also want to ensure that, in our efforts to put this issue to bed in terms of the concerns around privatisation of our water infrastructure, we do not do something that will prevent the normal functioning and management of Irish Water as a single utility in the context of its efforts to provide safe, efficient and well-run services.  I refer here to the infrastructure that needs to be put in place, as well as to the treatment of drinking water and wastewater.  I want to ensure that we do not, in some way, freeze Irish Water in its ability to be able to create partnerships and be innovative in its approach to the work it must do.  I am also concerned that we do not create unintended consequences for water infrastructure that is currently privately owned through group water schemes and other water infrastructure like, for example, the extensive network of septic tanks and wastewater treatment facilities, many of which are privately owned and operated.</p><p> I am anxious to be helpful.  I think I know what people are looking for here but we can tease that out further.  People want more than reassurance in legislation that could potentially be changed by a future Government with a majority.  They want constitutional protection and a permanency in terms of policy in this area regarding maintaining public ownership of core public water infrastructure and the company or, more correctly, the State entity that manages that.  That is where I am coming from.  If we can tease through the issues while also being willing to take sensible and good legal advice, particularly from the Attorney General's office, then we should be able to work together to get a good outcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#M00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will start by saying that I found the presentation we got from the Department and the Minister's opening statement very disappointing because they do not say an awful lot more than what was said on Second Stage.  In fact, the bulk of what the Minister has stated was said during the Second Stage debate in November, almost six months ago.  The purpose of this meeting, as I understand it, is for us to engage in detailed scrutiny of the actual legislation but the one thing the Minister did not talk about was the legislation.  I am genuinely not trying to score a political point here but that was the whole purpose of us inviting the Minister to appear.  If I remember correctly, during the Second Stage debate one of the Minister's final comments was that he would provide the expertise of his officials to the committee to tease this out by way of pre-legislative scrutiny.  What we are seeking to do today is to get into the detail of this.  I am hoping that in the course of our question-and-answer sessions we will start to deal with the actual legislation, which is what we are here to deal with.</p> <p>  On page 6 of the more detailed submission prepared by departmental officials, the two sets of general concerns that the Department has with this Bill are outlined.  The submission says that the wording of any constitutional amendment seeking to enshrine public ownership of the public water system "may" be problematic, given various issues.  Do the officials believe or does the Department have legal advice to say that Deputy Joan Collins' Bill is problematic?  Is it or is it not problematic?  It could be that the Department does not have advice from the Attorney General on that and the Minister cannot tell us now.  Is it problematic or not, based on the legal advice or the policy expertise that the Minister has available to him?  </p> <p>  The aforementioned document goes on to say that seeking to enshrine such property in public ownership through a constitutional referendum could have unintended consequences and could impinge on individuals' constitutional rights.  Again, this committee wants to know if, on the basis of the legal advice that the Minister has on this legislation and the policy expertise available to him, this Bill would rather than could have unintended consequences.  That is what we are trying to grapple with here.</p> <p>  I am also concerned that, on foot of his remarks, the Minister seems to think that there may be a confusion between publicly and privately-owned assets.  We already have constitutional protection for private assets and this Bill seeks to provide constitutional protection for publicly-owned assets.  Is it the Minister's fear that if this referendum were to pass, assets which today are privately owned under law could somehow be dragged into the public system against the will or the legal rights and entitlements of the owners?  If that is what the Minister believes, I ask him to explain how he thinks that could happen - given the constitutional protection for private assets -  and to provide concrete examples.  We had senior counsel in this morning and we asked them if they believed that there could be any impingement on the rights of private asset owners as a result of this legislation and they said "No", categorically.</p> <p>  At the end of his opening statement, the Minister raised the issue of partnerships, which is not referred to in the documents supplied to the committee by the Department.  Obviously, we are dealing with design, build and operate models for the delivery, for example, of water treatment plants and other such public private partnerships.  Whatever our individual policy views, it is an important issue that the Minister raises.</p><p>We again asked senior counsel this morning if, for example, this referendum on the constitutional amendment was to be passed and enacted, whether it would in any way affect the current operation of design, build and operate treatment plants.  The senior counsel categorically has said "No".</p><p> I believe it was Deputy Cowen who asked would it or could it affect the ability of a service provider - whether it is Irish Water or some other entity - acting on behalf of the State to enter into such arrangements in the future.  My understanding of the answer is that it would not.  The issue is that there needs to be clear public ownership and governance of the water system.  I do not want to know if the Minister has a general fear but is there something specific he is being advised about?  If so, can he give us the detail if it is contrary to what we have already got?</p><p> I take it from the last paragraph of the Minister's presentation that he does not have the Attorney General's advice on Deputy Joan Collins's Bill at this stage.  The Minister should confirm whether he has that advice.  If and when he does have it, however, the committee would like to know.  We understand that he cannot share the legal advice but on previous occasions he has given the committee a detailed oral summary of that advice.  If he does not have the advice at this stage, will he give a commitment to provide it to us at a later stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#N00200"><p>I thank the Minster for coming before the committee and acknowledge the work involved.  There are 38 signatories to this Bill, which is interesting.  I took the time to consult the Official Report of Wednesday, 9 November 2016, including the deliberations on what the Minister had to say, as well as what Deputy Joan Collins and other colleagues said.  That is more or less what we have heard again here today.  I accept exactly what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said.  The Minister's response is more or less the same thing as was said back on 9 November 2016 - in some cases it is exactly word for word.  That is the reality of it.</p> <p>  While I am open to correction, this is effectively about copper-fastening the ownership of water services.  In her statement, Deputy Joan Collins spoke about retaining Irish Water in public ownership and stressed the need for public management of the utility.  I would totally disagree with her on that point.  I do not think we should get hung up on Irish Water's day-to-day operations.  </p> <p>  I reiterate that this Bill in no way seeks to abolish Irish Water, despite the personal or political views of all the signatories.  I met someone outside the gates of Leinster House earlier today who was talking about the abolition of Irish Water.  I told him members would be talking here today but there is no question in Deputy Collins's proposal concerning the abolition of Irish Water.  The Deputy has advocated strongly against Irish Water but in this Bill there is no proposal to abolish the company.  That interesting and important point is worth making.</p> <p>  Why should we all get hung up on the public management of a structure?  A range of public utility services are contracted out to the private sector.  If it is the best way to do it and is value for money it should be pursued.  We should not get hung up on a political dogma or view that we have trotted out time after time that somehow State agencies or the State itself should be doing everything.  It is about value for the customer and the public generally.  We are really interested in having a top-quality service, not in the consistency of a political message.</p> <p>  The Minister has clearly set out the issues.  We all know the technicalities involved in having a constitutional amendment.  We should forget about the cost of having a constitutional referendum because while that is a consideration, it is not the most important one.  As regards the wording, what are we trying to achieve?  Let us not get hung up on the process.  I do not think anyone is against copper-fastening the ownership of Irish Water as a service and a public asset.  We need to separate those two.  </p> <p>  I understand that the Minister cannot share the Attorney General's advice with the committee at this point, but clearly he has an idea where all of this is hopefully going.  We are meant to be scrutinising legislation, so it would be helpful to know that view.  Can the Minister flag any concerns, such as the unintended consequences?  Can that be teased out?  Clearly, this has been coming down the tracks for many months and the Minister's officials and others have been advising him.  There are legal and technical issues involved.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about these key issues. </p> <p>  In the D&aacute;il debate, Deputy Wallace stated "Like most people in Ireland, I do not think the water service should be privatised, but, sadly, unless we get rid of Irish Water, it might as well be privatised because that is where we are."  I do not know what that is all about.  We want a top-quality service for the public.  We should not get hung up on ownership.  Some people have set a political position whereby they want to get rid of Irish Water, so they throw everything at it but it does not wash with me.  It does not make for good policy, not to mention good politics.  </p> <p>  The Minister has outlined that in 2014 the Government had introduced further safeguards in respect of the Water Services Act 2014.  While I am happy about it, I would like it to be teased out.  The Minister referred to the triple-lock system and that eventually there would have to be a plebiscite, and he could not alienate his shares other than to another Minister or a part of Government.  Because the whole thing is so complex, people need to understand the certainty of the triple-lock system.  There has been a huge debate over this but people on all sides are trying to clarify it and keep it all simple.</p> <p>  Everyone, including the Minister, now agrees that Irish Water is an asset that needs to be safeguarded by the public.  How can we keep that simple and assure people that it will happen?  If there was a change of government in future with a vast majority, there would be some comfort in that it could not change or be unwound in some way.  There is the issue of protecting it.  I will leave it at that but there are critical issues involved.  As the wording of a referendum is a complex issue, how does that process work itself out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#N00300"><p>I obviously support the Bill and happily signed it.  There has been huge concern in the opposition to water charges that the final intention was to privatise water.  It is not an idle concern; it is an obvious one.  It happened with bin services that once charges were introduced, the services were eventually privatised.  When we had these debates in the D&aacute;il it was said that nobody in the House wanted to privatise water but I do not believe that.  Many Deputies would not have a fundamental or principled opposition to water being privatised and that is why people want a constitutional provision to prevent any political party from doing that in future.</p> <p>  In fact it is backed up by what Senator Boyhan just said in his contribution.  He said that we should not get hung up on political dogma about things being State-run or privately run; it is about value for the customer.  I do not want to be a customer for water, however.  I just want to have water that is paid for through central taxation.  I do not want to become a customer and get a bill.  Those words were used by Senator Boyhan.  He was basically saying that he would not have a principled opposition to water being privatised but that is why people want to see a referendum.  As we will be having other referendums, there should not be a problem in incorporating a referendum on this matter. </p> <p>  As regards the Minister's concerns, everybody is asking the same thing.  We need to hear a bit more detail about these concerns and why it could be problematic.  One issue being raised is that because of the diversity of water structures - approximately 15% of people are in group water schemes - it is being presented that such people would have a problem if it went into public ownership.  I would like to talk to some of those group water schemes to see if that is the case.  That was stated in one of the documents.  I think that a lot of those group water schemes should be brought into public ownership.  There is a basis for doing that and it could protect people from facing exorbitant fees and costs in the future.  </p> <p>  It seems that every time we want to have change - be it in housing, compulsory purchase orders for land or anything else - it is cited time and again that the constitutional right to private property could be impinged upon.  This argument is now being posed again in respect of water.  We seriously need to change that article in the Constitution and to downgrade the right to private property because it would seem that we cannot protect the common good otherwise, or at least it is always cited that way.</p> <p>  We have had countless presentations here on housing.</p><p>That is deliberately overused by parties that do not wish to see any constitutional change or public ownership being advanced and enhanced.  It is incumbent on the Minister to give us the legal advice or to indicate what impediments he believes there might be to proceeding with this.  There is huge public support for it.  We were all led to believe that when it was agreed at the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, it would be taken as read that it would be enacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#O00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  From a theoretical point of view, this is the first time I have participated when it is not a Minister but a Member who is introducing the legislation.  That is unusual and welcome.  In fairness, this is the proper process for the people who have introduced the legislation.  The Minister made it clear that he is listening.  He or his officials have met with the proposers of the legislation.  I do not know if I am the only person who has seen it but he states in his official submission, "My officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issues arising, in order to provide advice to me and the Government, as this Bill progresses through the Oireachtas, and possibly on bringing forward some amendments to address some of the issues I have outlined."  The Minister is being reasonable.  He is listening, is in touch with the Attorney General and he is working on the wording.  If he came here and said the opposite, such as that he did not agree with a certain line and that he proposes this, that or the other, people would make the charge that he was interfering with the due process or was not giving due weight to the analysis of the issue.  The Minister has been clear that he will refer back to us on Committee Stage.  He is not opposing the legislation.  As I understand it, nobody opposes the principle.</p> <p>  I have some questions, although I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer them immediately.  I have a concern about Ervia, which is the holding company for Irish Water.  I introduced the original legislation in the first instance and the express intention at the time was that Irish Water, after its initial support from Bord G&aacute;is, would be a stand-alone, separate company.  That is not the case.  I argued strongly and trenchantly for that view, although it did not prevail with the political people involved in the decision-making at the time.  It was a bad decision to have it as part of Ervia.  I would like it to become a separate company.  I realise that the latter is not an issue for the Bill we are discussing.  As Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail said, it is a matter for the D&aacute;il, not a referendum.  However, it is exceptionally clear to me that Irish Water should have no hand, act or involvement with Ervia.</p> <p>  On my next question, many of these assets are very important and valuable.  Irish Water will have to raise funds and it will have to go to the private sector to get them.  It might be the case that a piece of infrastructure could be provided by a private company.  This happens at present, whereby a company might design, build and operate, DBO, water infrastructure.  Irish Water would work with it on that.  Are there any implications for that process or would it be neutral in its impact?  The officials can correct me if I am wrong but I understand that the supply of water to a significant part of Limerick city was built and is operated by a private company.  It is efficiently run and well managed.  It operates under the direction of Irish Water and does what it is told.  Would there be any issues in that regard?</p> <p>  My main point is about the principle of public ownership.  I introduced the initial legislation.  I debated the issue of public ownership with the Department and it was to be included in the legislation.  When the legislation was presented to me, however, it was not included.  I was very concerned about that and people were right to be concerned about it being in public ownership.  This referendum is essential for that reason.  At the same time, I wish to know the implications, if any, for the future operation of Irish Water, particularly in respect of design, build and operate, DBO, mechanisms and investment.  There are many legitimate funds, such as teachers' pension funds and so forth, that are seeking investment in infrastructure such as water.  That is a good thing if it is not exploitative investment.  It is long-term, low-interest investment in a solid and unique structure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#O00300"><p>I will try to respond.  First, I cannot give members information I do not have.  We shared the briefing we sent to the Office of the Attorney General with the committee.  It is the same briefing, so we have been transparent about what we are doing.  We are in consultation with the Attorney General's office in terms of getting advice - the type of advice the member appears to have received from a senior counsel this morning.  I do not know who it was.  I presume it is a good senior counsel but I must ensure that I take my lead from the legal advice that is available to the Government.  As this process moves on, we will continue to take advice from the Attorney General on what we are doing.  Changing the Constitution is a big deal.  If one gets it wrong, it is difficult to correct.  It is not like legislation, because there must be another referendum.  We have seen in other areas where there have been unintended consequence and legal actions, both at home and abroad, to test the Constitution and its consistency with other legislative obligations and so forth.</p> <p>  The current position is that we have sent the briefing document the committee has seen to the Attorney General's office.  We are asking her to provide advice on how best to proceed.  I have made it clear to her that we want to try to do this.  It is not a blocking exercise.  We want to get it right.  That is how we are proceeding.  I will happily return to the committee to have the type of discussion mentioned when we have that advice.  I cannot publish the advice but I can talk it through in respect of some of the issues that are being raised.</p> <p>  As to whether it is problematic, there are issues here on which I must obtain legal clarity in so far as that is possible.  Until I have that, I cannot give the committee a definitive answer as to whether it is or is not problematic.  There are issues here on which we have to be reassured.  If we cannot get that reassurance, we will have to change the wording to ensure we are covered in the areas where there is concern.  That is my point.  We can potentially make that change on Committee Stage or Report Stage, but we would be better off doing it on Committee Stage rather then leaving it to the last Stage of the process.</p> <p>  It would probably be useful, during pre-legislative scrutiny, for the committee to speak to some of the stakeholders who have issues in this regard.  Deputy Coppinger raised the matter of group water schemes.  It would be helpful if the committee invited representatives from the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to appear before it.  The federation has indicated concerns to the Department about this issue.  Again, its members are trying to get their heads around what the State is proposing to put into the Constitution and how it will affect them.  There are group water schemes all over the country that have being managed and paid for over many years.  Some of them are working very successfully, others are under a little pressure.  We must be supportive of those groups, as is clear in the Oireachtas water committee's recommendations.  It is a different issue to suggest that we will simply take all of it into public ownership without suggesting how that would even work or who would take charge of it.  I am sure many group water schemes would have a problem with that because they are running their own operations, and very successfully in many cases.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan referred to the normal daily running and work of Irish Water.  We must allow this single utility entity, which has had a difficult introduction, to get on with the work it must do.</p><p>In regard to privatisation of the water system, or concerns around that issue, when local authorities were in charge of the water system there was a lot more privatisation going on in terms of treatment plants.  Local authorities did not have the capacity to put in place large water treatment facilities and so they contracted people in the private sector to build and operate them, many of which are working successfully.  Irish Water has now taken over that responsibility.  It is also building facilities because it has the capacity, not only in terms of economies of scale around financing but also economies of knowledge in terms of the teams it has, to run its own treatment plants.  We need to be careful in what we are trying to do that we do not prevent Irish Water creating partnerships with the private sector that make sense in terms of innovation and new methods of treating water.  In regard to the existing network of water treatment plants, some are owned and managed by Irish Water - I recently opened some of them - and some are operated on a contract PPP basis and they are working well.  We need to understand the consequences of the wording being put into the Constitution for those relationships and those day-to-day practical operations. </p><p> I get the sense from Deputy &Oacute; Broin -  Deputy Coppinger has a slightly different perspective on this and I respect that - that what he seeks is that there would be public ownership of the responsibility around delivery of water.  Deputy Collins's Bill proposes that the Government would bear responsibility for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  My concern is around the definition of the public water system.  We need clarity on that in terms of what we are proposing to put into the Constitution.  Whether we need to provide that definition in legislation is one of the issues on which we need advice from the Attorney General's Office.  This about ensuring that the diversity of the current system can be managed within all of that diversity mix.</p><p> I do not want to get into the political debate around whether there was an agenda for privatisation.  I have been involved in much of that discussion at various stages and there has never been any plan of which I am aware to privatise Irish Water or the Irish water system; rather there was a plan to introduce a much more efficient and cost-effective way of delivering water, with a conservation-based approach and a utility-based approach to providing water.  Just as there has never been any attempt to private the gas network, there was never an intention to privatise the water network or its management.  </p><p> We need to be cautious around changing the Constitution through a referendum.  We need to learn lessons from the past and we need to try to get it right.  From my perspective, I would encourage the committee to invite in some of the people who may consider that they might be directly impacted by what is being proposed.  It would be important to get their perspective on that in terms of the practicalities of how the system runs today and any potential concerns of an impact of the kind we are proposing to make.  We will continue to provide information.  When I get more definitive advice from the Attorney General, I, or my officials - whichever is easier - will happily come back before the committee to discuss the consequences of that with a view to trying to improving the wording proposed.  That is what the stage process is.  Normally, a Government brings forward legislation of this type.  If this was Government legislation members would rightly ask me about the legal advice on it because legislation does not get produced without legal advice.  I am being asked to respond to Deputy Collins's legislation, it being used as the basis for what we are seeking to do.  I am happy to do that but I will not be bounced into something that I regard as not having been fully legally tested and so on.  I am afraid people will have to be patient.  When I get the response from the Attorney General I can discuss it with the committee without publishing it and provide some suggestions in terms of how we an improve the wording, if that is necessary.  If it not necessary, we can proceed without too many changes.  I do not want to doubt the aforementioned senior counsel but it is the Government that will be blamed if we get this wrong, not Deputy Collins, with respect.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure this is tested appropriately from a legal perspective so that we can get on and fulfil the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee on water and fulfil the aspirations of everybody here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017050400002#P00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill.  It is important there is clarity around the issues concerned.  The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights did not include water because it was not envisaged 70 years ago that private companies would be set up to run water services.  In 2010, 122 countries agreed that water sanitation is a fundamental human right.  That was a very important declaration after two decades of people raising the issue.  In contrast, in 2012 the European Commission issued a letter stating:</p><blockquote>Privatisation of public companies contributes to the reduction of public debt, as well as to the reduction of subsidies, other transfers or state guarantees to state-owned enterprises.  It also has the potential of increasing the efficiency of companies and, by extension, the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, while attracting foreign direct investment.<br /><br />The Commission believes that [the privatisation of public utilities, including water supply firms] can deliver benefits to the society when carefully made.</blockquote> <p>As long as the European Commission believes that water provision would be privatised the potential exists for that to happen.  Also, there is the potential that a strong arm of a troika would force countries into privatisation of their water services.  I take on board the Minister's point that the Government, and the parties to it, do not want to privatise Irish water services.  That may be the case now but it may not remain so into the future, which is the concern of the public.  The only way we can protect water services provision is to provide in Article 28 of the Constitution that public ownership of it be the responsibility of the Government of the day.  </p><p>I wonder if some people have read the Bill.  It is very simple.  It provides that the Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system and that it shall ensure, in the public interest, that this resource remains in public ownership and management.  It does not mention what entity shall do that.  There has been nothing concrete forthcoming from the Department regarding group water schemes, private wells and so on.  The senior counsel, S&eacute;amus &Oacute; Tuathail, who participated in this morning's session of the meeting, has vast experience in terms of public-private ownership legislation and law and so on.  I would like to make a few points for the record.  Private wells are protected under private ownership.  Group water schemes are set up as private companies.  To become a public company they have to apply to the local authority and go through a particular process.</p><p>Therefore, they are protected and it is clear that they are not part of the public water system, under which they receive subsidies.  The only aspect of group water systems governed through regulations is the requirement introduced by the European Union that governments must ensure public water systems reach a certain standard, are of good quality and well delivered.  There is no impact on group water schemes, bore holes and so forth. </p><p> It is a pity that a few individuals were not present this morning when it emerged that obsolete assets were not part of the public water system and could be sold off to raise revenue.  If the Department is concerned that group water schemes are not private and may be public, it should inform them of that concern.  It is clear from the structure and operation of group water schemes that they are private and separate from the public water system.  This issue needs to be clarified because it is used to muddy the waters when we hear about unintended consequences.</p><p> The Department and Irish Water should draw up an inventory of assets owned by local authorities.  I understand the local authorities are checking what assets they have.  It is only a matter of providing a record for the Government to ensure it is aware of what assets are in public ownership.  I ask for a response on that issue.  The Department should indicate whether it has concerns in that regard and if there are no such concerns, it should make a clear statement that there is no problem.

If group water schemes are part of the system that is providing water for the public, we need to be able to define it.  That is all I am saying.  I am not arguing that group water schemes are in public control.  However, the question as to whether they are part of the public water system needs to be clarified.  If, in the past, Cork County Council relied on a private company to build and operate a wastewater treatment plant in Youghal, Cobh or elsewhere and the plant is still being run under a 20-year contract as part of a public private partnership, it is in private ownership and being run privately while being paid for by the State through a local authority.  Such a facility is clearly not in public ownership, even though it is very much contributing to the public water system.  These are the issues we must nail down.  Interestingly, Irish Water is, by and large, opting to build and operate its own water treatment facilities, as opposed to engaging in public private partnerships.  However, it will partner with private companies in availing of engineering expertise, specialisation and so on. </p> <p>  To reiterate an earlier point made, we are not undermining normal, sensible efficiency operations around wastewater and drinking water.  I take the point that overall responsibility for the operation needs to rest with the State, through government, something Deputy Joan Collins is also trying to achieve.</p> <p>  I am glad to note a change in the language used on the issue of water services.  It is encouraging to hear the words "hugging the Government" used.</p></speech>

There has been much debate and many marches and disagreements on concerns about the privatisation of public water systems.  Putting this issue to bed is part of the overall settling of the water issue.  While the Fine Gael Party and the Government accept that there are also genuine issues which need to be teased out and finalised before we settle on a wording and commit to changing the Constitution in a way that is consistent with this wording, if we were to get this wrong, we would kick off a new series of problems linked with water.  In this case, the issue would be ownership.  I do not believe anyone intends to have such a scenario, not least the author and promoter of the legislation.  It may well be the case that the wording is correct, but I want to ensure the legal advice available to me is consistent with what the Deputy heard from her senior counsel this morning.  We should be able to do this relatively quickly.</p></speech>

Government policy at the time was that local authorities had to enter into design, build and operate contracts to provide infrastructure.  It was not that they were incapable of providing infrastructure but that they had no choice other than to follow Government policy.  It was made clear by previous Governments that if local authorities wanted to take the conventional route, they would not be given the funding needed to provide the infrastructure they required.  I make this point to correct the record.  The Minister outlined the position in Cork where I understand a design, build and operate contract was used.</p></speech>

I picked two towns at random because I do not know the specific detail.  I am not referring to specific design and build contracts or any specific case in Cork because I am not familiar with the facts.  The only wastewater treatment facility with which I am familiar in Cork is one which I opened in Cork Harbour a few weeks ago.  It is a &euro;90 million wastewater treatment facility which will be owned, operated and managed by Irish Water.  I do not wish to give the impression that I am giving examples, although I could do so, if members wish me to do so.  I did not refer to towns in Cork with the intention of using them as specific examples.</p></speech>

Ultimately, ownership remains in the hands of Irish Water and, previously, the local authorities.  The issue the Minister raised in terms of a conflict of ownership of the infrastructure does not arise because ownership is retained by Irish Water.</p></speech>

As Deputy Joan Collins stated, a group water scheme must submit an application to a local authority for approval before it can operate.  It must be distinguishable in terms of its ownership, in other words, it must be a co-operative, trust or company.  The distinction between a public and a private water system is already made in law. </p> <p>  On regulation, the European Commission, in a case related to water quality, accepted and recognised this distinction and determined that Ireland had a regulatory role in group water schemes because they provided water for their members.  The Commission required Ireland to set regulations for the quality of water provided by group water schemes.  If it is the Minister's argument that the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment could have the unintended consequence of breaking down this distinction, it must be the case that it has already been broken down because there is a clearly accepted distinction made between public and private assets.  The wording of the amendment would not interfere with it.</p></speech>

The Deputies do not need to convince me - I need to be convinced from a legal perspective that the wording we are using does what we want it to do.  I am not giving excuses but asking legitimate questions to which I need answers from the Office of the Attorney General.  This will either confirm that the wording proposed is right or allow us to amend or improve it.  If there are fundamental problems we can find a way of addressing them.  I need to provide reassurance to Deputies that we can support what they want to do, following the receipt of legal advice to Government and consistent with the recommendations of the committee on water.  It is important the wording is not likely to be challenged, meaning we have to come back here to deal with unintended consequences or to have a second referendum to correct a mistake we should be seeing now.</p> <p>  I take the point that in the design, build and operate contracts being put in place the ownership remains in State hands, whether in the case of Irish Water or local authorities.  Some temporary plans have been put in place, however, by developers linked to new projects and I have been told that some issues need to be addressed in this regard.  If the Constitution refers to a public water system there needs to be a definition of what that is, either in the Constitution itself or in law, so that there is clarity and we can prevent unforeseen consequences.</p></speech>

It is important to stress the distinctions and perhaps the Minister will pass on this morning's submission from senior counsel to the committee to the Attorney General.  It might help inform her decision making around potential conflicts between public and private ownership.</p></speech>

We take the Constitution, and proposals to change it, as seriously as the Government does.  The Minister is right to say there have been occasions where bad decisions were made, often when decisions were rushed as a result of political considerations, such as one case with which we are dealing at the moment.  Many good changes to the Constitution have, however, been made, some of which were proposed by the Government and were supported by many of us, such as the insertion of the rights of the child, which is very valuable.</p> <p>  I am, however, really frustrated as it is not as if this issue has landed on the Minister's desk in the past week.  We passed Second Stage of this legislation six months ago and an expert group stated five months ago that this was probably a good idea.  Even before the water committee finalised its report we knew there was a consensus among parties for some kind of constitutional referendum on the final wording.  I am frustrated because nothing we are doing in this committee is of any value to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I accept that the Minister cannot give us answers he does not have, but that is the problem.  We were meant to be hearing the legal advice to Deputy Collins, who helped draft the Bill, and some concrete information from the Minister or his officials.  Instead, we are getting the same doubts the Minister was expressing six months ago.  These are significant issues and we should be considering them but we are having a circular conversation which is not allowing us to progress.  The same would be the case if we were to invite representatives of group water schemes.  I am more than happy to do so but they will want to know if passing this wording would impinge on their constitutional rights to private property.  We have one senior counsel who has an opinion on that which we could share with them, but ultimately it will depend on the legal advice from the Attorney General.  Inviting the group water schemes or any other stakeholder to appear before the committee prior to some indication of the Attorney General's advice will involve another circular conversation.</p> <p>  I am at a loss.  I am not trying to be awkward and the Minister is correct to raise all these issues but he raised them six months ago and we are having the same conversation today.  There is no point in my going back over the arguments because his answer will be that, while something may be significant, we cannot progress until he has the legal advice from the Attorney General.  In that case, what is the point of pre-legislative scrutiny?  What is the point in having the Minister here if he cannot answer any of the questions?</p> <p>  Maybe there is one question the Minister can answer, although he obviously cannot answer all the questions relating to Deputy Collins's Bill, which is the subject of today's discussion.  Has the Minister or have his officials seen any advice which suggests that, under the current legal situation, there is confusion between the ownership of assets in private wells, bore holes and group water schemes and those in the public system, owned by the State and currently managed by Irish Water?  The implication that our wording may impinge on categories of ownership of water services infrastructure suggests there is some uncertainty as to whether something is a private asset or a public asset.  Have there been any previous legal advices on this?  The Minister mentioned new projects and I assume he is referring to new water infrastructure developments but there is a legal process for taking a group water scheme into the public system, just as there is a process for taking private water infrastructure developments into the public system.  It is known as "taking in charge" and Irish Water now has a mechanism for doing this, as have local authorities.  In all these cases there is a clear legal process for incorporating a private asset into the public system.  I am not confused as to what is public or private but is the Department confused?</p> <p>  The Minister always tells us there are genuine concerns but repeating the point, on the basis of no legal advice whatsoever, that Deputy Collins's Bill may cause difficulties with public ownership or group water schemes, and may have unintended consequences, muddies the waters.  That might not be the Minister's intention but people in group water schemes might think it is a problem.  Before the Minister would have received the legal advice on whether this was or was not a problem, he would have created such a level of doubt as to cause significant concern.   The briefing note from the Department should say that something may or may not be a problem until the legal advice is received.  Likewise, it should say it may or may not have unintended consequences but it simply states that it may create problems.  My worry is that the Minister does not want this legislation and is hoping to delay it, which would be a tragedy.  If he says he will have the legal advice shortly I will take him at his word and I hope we can come back for another discussion.  Until we have that advice, however, there is no point in talking to anybody else at this stage. </p></speech>

I want to make it clear where I stand on this.  I believe, 100%, that Irish Water should be in public ownership but I come from an ideological viewpoint on this proposal, and it is nothing to do with the fact the legislation is proposed by Deputy Joan Collins.  The people put their trust in us to pass legislation they want.  I mean no disrespect to any senior counsel or to the Attorney General but I have a fear of inserting into the Constitution small individual lines to satisfy a political desire, whether it is something with which I agree or fundamentally disagree, to transfer responsibility from where it should always lie, that is, the Oireachtas and its Members, to a small group in the Judiciary to arbitrate, at some point in the future, on some case that cannot be foreseen by anybody in this room relating to the idea that the Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system and shall ensure, in the public interest, that this remains the case.</p><p>I began my political involvement when I was very young in the 1980s and I have seen where we can end up when, with the best of intentions, people insert lines in the Constitution to copperfasten something they believe in and end up with exactly the opposite to what they thought they were doing.  The Minister's caution is well placed.  The triple-lock mechanism in place at present, ironically, is probably an even greater protection.  At the end of the day, if a constitutional amendment is passed, one can go back to the people and ask them to vote again.  There is built into the triple-lock a provision that requires consultation through a vote of the public on any Oireachtas decision.  My worry is not the wording or the proposal <i>per se </i>but the solution to what we want to achieve, which is to ensure that without the consent of the people and the Oireachtas, the water of this country cannot end up in private hands, is not best served by using this process.</p></speech>

It is strange because she was exercised by the water committee's recommendations before it had come to a conclusion, yet she is not in a position to comment on this Bill, which Deputy Collins brought before the D&aacute;il many months ago.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure this is not delayed much further and to ensure adequate scrutiny because he cannot contribute to the scrutiny of the Bill without advice from the Attorney General.  This meeting, therefore, does not serve much purpose.  I take on board his recommendation regarding other stakeholders such as the representative bodies for group water schemes and so forth contributing to this process.  It would be fair and appropriate to give them that opportunity and I would welcome that.</p></speech>

The reason I interacted a lot with the Attorney General in the context of the water committee's recommendation is I was anxious that the final report would make recommendations that were legally sound.  I had an obligation to do that as the Minister who will have to put the legislation together on the back of those recommendations.  We are going through the same process here.  The Bill was introduced by Deputy Collins and sponsored by others.  I said that I would be helpful in the process of trying to get it right.  We are only at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.

We have had consultation with Deputy Collins.  Following that consultation, we indicated that we would make the briefing note we had put together for the Attorney General available to the committee.  If the Deputy wants to muddy the waters with group water schemes in the context of that briefing, he can.  I have not done that.  I have provided the briefing to the committee to provide transparency in respect of what we are asking of the Attorney General.  If the Deputy wants to turn that into a political issue that muddies the waters outside the committee, that is a matter for him but I will not do that.  To turn the terminology in a briefing note that I have sent to the Attorney General primarily, but that I have also provided to him to show what we have we have asked of her, into a political suggestion that we are try to muddy the waters is not only inaccurate but it is also probably unfair.  We have given the committee clarity in respect of what I have asked of the Attorney General and as soon we receive a comprehensive response from her office, I will be in a position to give more clarity.  However, I have to operate on the timeline of getting good advice rather than the timeline of responding to political pressure.  Amending the Constitution on the back of political pressure and timelines generated by that has proven to be a mistake in the past.  We are talking about a matter of weeks, not months into the future.  My understanding is this comes down to the definition of the "public water system" and whether that relates to the system that delivers water to the public or public ownership versus private ownership, which is the interpretation that Deputy &Oacute; Broin is putting on it.  The word "system" may be more encompassing than that because private assets provide water to the public and one of the issues we need to consider is whether they are defined as the "public water system".</p> <p>  The answer to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's question is I will happily provide information to the committee as soon as I have it.  I will make it clear to the Attorney General's office that parties are anxious to move this process on and I will seek a response from her.  A constitutional change is much more significant than the special water committee's report and recommendations, which we are acting on, and any legislative change we make.  Once we change the Constitution, we cannot change it again without another referendum.  We should take a few weeks to get this right.  If that causes a little frustration and impatience on the part of the committee, I am sorry but I would rather have the legal advice we need to progress the Bill.  We will then tease through these issues anyway on Committee and Report Stages.</p><p>Although I do not think we need to have everything perfect at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, it would be good to nail down some of the concerns expressed and receive Government legal advice on them.  That is what I am looking for.</p></speech>

I might get an answer to it.  It is not a matter of weeks but almost six months since the Bill was debated.  It is my understanding it has to proceed through Committee and Report Stages and into the Seanad.  It will then be brought back to us.  If we did not have the current delay, there would still be sufficient time to scrutinise everything.  The source of my frustration is not that the Minister wants to receive legal advice which I also want but the fact that we have spent six months in getting to this point, yet we cannot have a substantive discussion because of the absence of that advice.  Will the Minister tell us the date on which he asked the Attorney General to comment on Deputy Joan Collins's Bill?  Will he tell us why, if Mr. Ryan is right, the advice given to him on earlier drafts of the report of the water committee did not include some commentary from the Attorney General on the suggestion that we consider holding a constitutional referendum?</p></speech>

We sent a briefing note to the Attorney General's office a number of weeks ago.  I understand it was made very clear during the deliberations of the water committee that the holding of a referendum to change the Constitution to reassure people on public ownership of water infrastructure was a policy decision that was supported.  Its actual implementation and the detail were thought to be matters for this committee and we were going to use Deputy Joan Collins' Bill as the basis.  Now we need to go through a detailed process of scrutiny and receiving advice to make sure we get the legislative proposals right.  We are going to go through the various stages.  We are only in the first stage.  We on the Government side agreed that we would try to be helpful.  We have had discussions and briefing sessions with Deputy Joan Collins, as I committed to do.  We have also shared our correspondence with the Attorney General's office, which is almost unheard of, in asking the Attorney General to give us advice.  That was done in an effort to be helpful, as I said I would be.  We have been doing what I agreed to do five or six months ago.  However, we do not yet have an outcome to that process and I am afraid people will have to show a little patience.  We will have it in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

We met once, at which point he was sending the information to the Attorney General for feedback.  I respect the fact that there is a process and that we have to try to get this right.  At the same time, however, we should try to move things on.  I certainly do not want to attend another meeting without having the clarity we are seeking.  At least we could then start moving towards Committee Stage.  I hope we will hold a referendum in order that the people can make a decision on the matter.</p></speech>

That is why the Government is providing both advice and legal expertise.  I hope we will not have a situation where I will be appealing to other parties not to support legislation on Report Stage on the back of the Attorney General's advice.  That is the conversation we have been forced to have, for example, on the legislation dealing with rental changes and so on.  I want to be in a position to support this legislation.  That is why at an early stage, at pre-legislative scrutiny stage or before Committee Stage, I hope we will have clarity on the changes of wording needed in order that we can move on quickly.  Despite the frustration of some committee members, I am not in a position to provide that clarity today, but we are anxious to follow through on the commitment we made and I think I have done so.  I am afraid I am not operating to the Deputies' timeline but to that of the Attorney General's office.  There has been no shortage of demands on her office in the past six months in a series of areas, not least water services.  The matter is with her office.  This is legislation into which the Government needs to have an input.  We have agreed to use Deputy Joan Collins' Bill as the basis.  We could have introduced a separate Bill, but she asked us not to do so and I supported the adoption of that approach.  If I was introducing my own legislation and we were at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, I still would not have the advice.  We would not be introducing legislation this early.  I am afraid we are just going to have to work through the process.</p></speech>

I will focus my remarks this morning on the State pension and highlight issues which we hope will be addressed in budget 2017 and then discuss what must be done in the medium to long term to ensure a sustainable and fair State pension.</p> <p>  Ensuring that every person who hopes to grow old has enough money to do so with dignity cannot be left to when the individual reaches retirement.  Less than half of people aged between 20 and 65 have a private pension.  For those aged over 65, public transfers, of which the State pension is the most important, make up almost two thirds of their average gross income.   This figure is higher for women pensioners, those living in rural communities and particularly those in the lowest socio-economic group.  This is what makes the State pension so critical - for those on the lowest incomes, more than 85 % of their weekly income is from State supports.  The State pension is the most important tool we have for preventing poverty among older people.  </p> <p>  As members will know, during the recession the rate of the State pension was not changed.  This prompted some commentators to claim that older people were insulated from the effects of austerity.  While the State pension was not cut for the vast majority of pensioners, a point to which I will return, the secondary income supports of many older people, such as fuel and telephone allowances, were cut or abolished.  Age Action has calculated that between January 2009 and January 2015 the weekly incomes of older people dependent on the State pension and secondary income supports such as the household benefits package and the fuel allowance fell by more than &euro;13 per week.  While the incomes of older people were being cut, costs were rising due to increased insurance rates and the introduction of new taxes and levies on the family home and on prescriptions.  Research undertaken by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice in 2013 noted that while the overall consumer price index fell by 0.15 % in the period 2008 to 2013, the cost of a minimum essential standard of living for a lone pensioner and a pensioner couple rose by over 5 % and 7.3 % respectively.  The cumulative effect of the 2016 and 2017 budgets, which saw increases in the weekly rate of the State pension, the restoration of 75 % of the Christmas bonus and an increase in the fuel allowance, amounts to the equivalent of &euro;11.51 a week.  We welcome those measures, all of which will make a difference to older people.  However, even with the latest pension increase, the reality is that the income of a pensioner reliant on the State pension and the household benefits package is still below where it was in 2008.  We hope that will be addressed in budget 2018.</p> <p>  Another issue we seek to have addressed this year is the change introduced in 2012 to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension.  While those entitled to a full pension were unaffected, many of those who would have been in line for smaller pensions lost out.  Under the old system, for example, if one had an average of 20 contributions, one would be entitled to &euro;228.70 per week.  This has now dropped to &euro;198.60, a cut of more of more than &euro;30 per week.</p><p>Research commissioned by Age Action, which the Chairman mentioned and has been furnished to the committee, shows that this change, combined with the averaging rule used to calculate contributions, is punishing women who took time out of work to care for their children or other loved ones.  Figures provided by the Department of Social Protection as part of this research indicated that, of the 36,000 people affected by these changes by June 2016, more than 62% were women.  They will continue to be affected in the years to come, receiving smaller <i>pro rata</i>increases in the State pension.<br/><br/>In the October budget, Age Action is asking the committee to support two specific proposals: an increase in the top rate of the State contributory pension; and a reversal of the 2012 cut in the State pension.  In the medium-to-long term, there is a consensus that the State pension system must be reformed, including by putting in place a system to govern increases in the pension to ensure that they are fair, but also sustainable.  Ireland is, as the Department of Social Protection acknowledged to the committee in December, unusual in setting the pension rate in the budget every year without using any particular formula.  For example, committee members will be aware of Britain's triple lock system, under which the state pension increases annually by the rate of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is highest.<br/><br/>In 2010, the national pensions framework stated: &quot;In order to maintain this aim of preventing poverty for older people, the Government will seek to sustain the value of the State Pension at 35 per cent of average weekly earnings&quot;.  Preliminary figures from the CSO for the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the average weekly earnings in Ireland was just over &euro;716.  Under the framework, this means that the State pension, currently &euro;238 at the top rate, should be &euro;250.62.  Age Action believes that the 35% target should not simply be identified as aspirational, but should be used, and supported in legislation, as the minimum benchmark for the State pension.<br/><br/>It is also essential that, in considering the reform of the State pension in the years to come, the committee examine the gender disparity in pension income and, particularly, the failure to backdate the home maker's scheme, which was introduced in 1994.  This time limit means that, for the current generation of pensioners and many more to come, the home maker's scheme will be of little or no benefit.The refusal to backdate the scheme, combined with the 2012 pension cut and the averaging out approach, means that hundreds of thousands of pensioners - mostly women - face far smaller incomes in their old age than they had anticipated.  The contribution that these carers made to society, whether by raising a family or stepping in to provide care for a loved one where the State was unable to do so, must be recognised by our State pension system.<br/><br/>Committee members will be conscious of discussions ongoing in the Department about the introduction of an auto-enrolled, mandatory, second-tier pension.  Age Action supports any initiative that would help to deliver a secure income in retirement for older people, but we have concerns, including about the potential for this to affect the State pension system.  Our first concern is that, by potentially investing this money in a private pension scheme, we will see a privatisation of risk.  Individuals will see the value of their pensions rise and fall with the market while presumably being obliged to pay fees to private pension companies.<br/><br/>Our second concern relates to the sustainability of the State pension.  While there are many different opinions about how it can be assured in the years to come, most accept that there will need to be some sort of increase in the social insurance contributions made by employers, which are among the lowest in the EU.  As unpalatable as any tax increase might be, it will be made doubly so if employers are already making payments under the new auto-enrolment scheme.  This potential for the introduction of a mandatory, second-tier pension to undermine the existing State pension has not received the attention that it should.<br/><br/>Writing in 2015, the economist Professor Colm McCarthy pointed out that Ireland did not face a demographic crisis, but a policy crisis that was a product of our collective failure to prepare and plan for the coming societal changes in age and demographics.  The objective of our national pensions policy should be to ensure that growing old in Ireland does not mean growing poor.<br/><br/>As a first step, we should assess whether the resources that we are currently allocating could be better spent.  As committee members will be aware, we spend approximately &euro;7 billion on the State pension every year, but we also spend approximately &euro;2.4 billion as the total cost of private pension tax reliefs according to research by Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins and Professor Gerard Hughes.  In 2014, the top 20% of income earners received 73.6% of this tax relief compared with 0.6% for the bottom 20%.  The national pensions framework declared that tax relief on private and occupational pensions should be set at 33%.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, subsequently estimated the savings to the Exchequer of such a move to be approximately &euro;180 million.  Were tax relief to be reduced to 33%, could the savings achieved be used, for example, to pay the bulk of the &euro;290 million estimated by the Department as the cost of backdating the home maker's scheme?  Put simply, of the billions of euro in the State pension and private pension tax relief that we are currently spending on ensuring that people have a decent pension in old age, are we spending it in the most effective and fairest way to provide incomes for pensioners?<br/><br/>I urge the committee to play its role in planning for an ageing society by emphasising that reform of the State pension should be the first priority for pension reform, including indexing the rate to weekly average earnings; leading calls for backdating the home maker's scheme; ensuring that the proposed mandatory, second-tier pension does not undermine our existing first-tier State pension system; and reviewing the current allocation of State resources in the pension system to ensure that it is fair and equitable.<br/><br/>I thank committee members for their time.</p></speech>

Regarding the calculation of &euro;13 per week in actual loss, is Age Action taking into account the fact that normal inflation rules do not apply to people over the age of 65 years?  Normal inflation takes into account luxury goods and high-end items, for example, aircraft, super cars, etc.  Were one to use the pattern of stuff that people over the age of 65 years generally buy as the measure of inflation, one would probably arrive at a larger figure.</p> <p>  Does Age Action have a costing for a reversal of the 2012 rule change to the eligibility criteria?  How much would it cost the Exchequer per annum?  Two changes would be required.  Obviously, the original averaging system would have to be restored and we would have to reverse the change in the criteria and move from 520 contributions to 260.</p> <p>  In net terms, how much would it cost to restore the retirement pension to 65 years of age?  It is a net issue rather than a gross one, given that people now receive jobseeker's allowance or benefit of &euro;193.50 instead of the &euro;238 or whatever it was.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran made an interesting observation on the proposed auto-enrolment system and its capacity to undermine the current State pension system.  He might elaborate on that interesting point.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran mentioned reducing tax relief to 33%.  It is available at 20%, which is the bottom rate, and the top rate of 40%.  Is Mr. Moran suggesting that the top rate - the marginal rate - at which relief can be given should be reduced to 33%?  He is not suggesting that people who can only qualify for relief of 20% should-----</p></speech>

I also thank it for its continued great work in representing our older citizens.  It has asked our committee to make pension reform a priority, and we all agree with it that pension reform is needed.</p> <p>  I will touch on a number of basic points.  These changes, including to the pension bands, form one of the main issues about which constituents contact me.  Over 65s have been placed on the transitional pension and people are being forced to take up jobseeker's allowance.  Everyone at this meeting is singing from the same hymn sheet.  I commend Age Action's report, which shows the real impact of the 2012 cuts on our older people.</p> <p>  We need to close the gender pension gap, which came about as a result of previous cuts.  We must have a full recognition of caring roles in the home maker's scheme and a fair calculation of PRSI contributions as regards the State pension.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions about the State pension.  We must protect it regardless of the introduction of a mandatory, second-tier pension system.</p><p>How do the witnesses envisage that we can sustain the State pension?  How do they think we can protect it while we create this second tier mandatory pension?  Do they have any figure in mind for the increase in employers' PRSI?  I would be grateful if they could answer those questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the research that has been done to draw out some of the issues around the gender pension gap in its many forms.  Women seem to be disadvantaged in the current system in two ways.  The second layer almost adds insult to injury.  It seems that opposing logic is being used to justify each of the two forms of disadvantage.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on this matter.  The changes that were made in 2012 were justified on the basis that there needed to be a greater match-up between people's contributions and the payments they get.  They were also acknowledged as a cost-saving measure.  Older female pensioners were almost seen as invisible in the system because so many of them were on reduced-rate pensions.  I ask the witnesses to clarify how all of this breaks down in terms of gender.  Who is getting a full pension and who is getting a reduced pension?</p> <p>  The argument that was made in this regard was that there needed to be a link with contributions.  However, the same rationale did not apply in the case of the backdating of the home maker's disregard.  If I am correct, someone who has contributed the required number of contributions for a full pension over a period of work with a gap in it - he or she might have made as many pension contributions as someone who worked 20 years in a row - will not get the value for his or her contributions because of the averaging rule.  It seems that two contradictory forms of logic are being employed.  We have been told we cannot afford to fix it.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the incompatible forms of logic used in these two cases.  As I see it, both of them are adding two layers of disadvantage to women in the pensions system.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear about the proposal to reverse the change that was made in 2012.  I would like to know whether the witnesses believe it is satisfactory that we should wait until 2020 before we bring in averaging.  Do they agree that backdating needs to be done on an earlier basis in order to address this direct form of disadvantage?</p> <p>  I would like to move away from issues that are currently affecting people of pension age.  How do the witnesses believe care should be recognised within the pension system, focusing primarily on the first system?  How should care and the contribution of care be recognised in any new supplementary system that is introduced?  Other members of the committee have mentioned the question of a second-tier system.  Do the witnesses believe the first tier of the current system - the contributory and non-contributory pensions system - needs to be addressed first as a priority?  Perhaps it should be done in this way as a means of building trust in the public mind before we introduce automatic enrolment.</p> <p>  The averaging of tax relief was one of the few points in our memorandum of understanding with the troika not to be implemented.  The troika sought a move from marginal-rate tax relief to an average-rate tax relief.  There is a gender aspect here as well.  We are giving the top 20% well over &euro;1.5 billion in tax relief - that is an approximate figure based on my calculation of 75% of &euro;2.39 billion - and we know the people in that category are largely male.  It seems that there are three or four different ways in which women are currently systematically disadvantaged within the pensions system.  I agree with the witnesses that the rerouting of these moneys should be considered as we seek to address the gap that exists.</p> <p>  The witnesses made an interesting point about the pension target of 35% of average income.  Is that the best model of linking from their perspective?  How important is the target for ensuring predictability for older people as they plan for the years ahead?</p></speech>

I thank Age Action Ireland for the work it does on behalf of all older people in the State.  I am trying to get a better understanding of how other European countries deal with the home maker's model.  Is it in vogue in other European countries?  A figure of &euro;290 million has been mentioned in the context of the backdating proposal.  Have models in other EU countries been examined to see how they deal with this question?  I think the other pertinent questions I intended to ask have been covered by previous speakers.  I look forward to hearing the witnesses' answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2723" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017050400002#J00400"><p>I would like to put a few points to Mr. Moran and Mr. Scully.  I thank them for their attendance at this meeting and for their submissions.  Mr. Moran said in his opening statement that "in the October budget, Age Action is asking the committee to support two specific proposals".  I assure him that as this committee addresses the pensions issue, it intends to draw up a report with proposals and recommendations before the summer recess in the hope of influencing the budgetary process.  The appearance of the witnesses before this committee today, and the presentation they have given us, are timely from that point of view.  Even though we are in the month of May , we are working towards the budgetary process.</p> <p>  While Mr. Moran quite rightly referred to the 2012 cut in State pensions, I suggest it would be more correct to refer to the change in the averaging bands.  The imposition of additional bands moved people into different categories.  The witnesses are proposing that we should go back to the older system.  I want to confirm that this is exactly what they have in mind.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran referred to "the &euro;290 million estimated by the Department as the cost of backdating the home maker's scheme".  He might explain in a little more detail the composition of that &euro;290 million.  Would it be a recurring annual cost from here on?  Is that the way it is?</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea spoke about the need to future-proof pensions.  One of the proposals relates to average salaries.  Under the British system, pensions are linked to an index like the consumer price index.  Would it be more appropriate to create a specific index for people who are older, given that their needs are different?  They might not have educational needs but they might have higher health care needs.  Should an index be established that would reflect the actual living costs of older people?  Specifically, such a system could ensure the rate of increase is relevant to the needs of older people rather than to a more general need.  The witnesses might give me their views on that.</p> <p>  Under the current system of payment for pensions, one must have a minimum total figure initially and then a calculation is made on the basis of an average annual contribution.  Most of those who have taken time out of work are women.  In some cases, they qualify for a reduced pension, rather than the full payment, because of the reduction in their average earnings over their working lives.  It is possible that the total amount paid by someone in these circumstances could be greater than the total amount paid by someone else who is getting a higher payment.  What is the view of the witnesses on the whole idea of shifting from an annual average to a total payment contribution system?  Do they think that would be more equitable?  I am not suggesting that there would be no issues with such a system.  Would such a system be more equitable than the current system?  Obviously, it would have to be worked out exactly in terms of bands, etc.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on whether it would be a more equitable system.  I do not expect that this could be done in a single budget, but is it something we should be actively looking at?</p> <p>  We have come through an economic recession.  While the recession may be over, there are continuing legacy issues, for example in the whole area of housing.  We have a cohort of ageing people who are in private rented accommodation.  Traditionally, people in this country have finished paying for their houses by the time they retire.  At present, there are many people in this country who have lost their homes.  Do the witnesses have a view on the adequacy of the current pension arrangements for older people who do not own their own properties as they reach retirement?  Is it possible that in 20 years' time, we will be looking at a scenario that is different from the scenario we are looking at today?</p><p>That might be a more longer-term issue but we do need to be cognisant of the fact that there is a cohort of people who traditionally would have owned a property - their home - that are now living in private rented accommodation.  As we know, the number of people living in private rented accommodation is higher now than ever before.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on that particular cohort.</p></speech>

On Deputy O'Dea's point regarding the calculation, I accept that it is a blunt instrument that does not take into account some of the inflationary pressures he mentioned.  However, it is important to highlight the impact on older people.  There are people who say they were insulated, so it is important we challenge that.</p> <p>  In regard to reversing the change introduced in 2012, the latest figures we were given from the Department of Social Protection is that, since its introduction, approximately &euro;10 million per annum has been saved, and if it was to be reversed, the cumulative cost would be &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

The cost of reversing and backdating for people who had been on lower pensions since 2012 would amount to &euro;60 million.</p> <p>  In regard to the net cost of the restoration of the transition pension to 65 and taking jobseeker's into account, regrettably, I do not have that figure but we do intend to pursue that issue.  On the auto-enrolment scheme and its potential to impact on the State pension, we are talking not about a scheme that exists but ideas and suggestions around such a scheme, including, for example, the introduction of a small, perhaps 2%, contribution from employees, employers and, possibly, some sort of State supports.  It is modelled a little on the British system that has been introduced.  My concern would be that if that system was brought in and, six or seven years down the road, it was decided that PRSI contributions needed to be increased to ensure the State pension was sustainable, we would be going back to the same pot again.  We would be requiring the people paying into the auto-enrolment scheme for the second tier pension also to pay into the first tier pension.  That could be a difficult ask of the people concerned.  A mandatory second tier pension could be a very helpful and sensible approach to ensuring people have adequate income in retirement.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has stated time and again that he sees the first tier State pension as a priority.  What we would like the Government to do in the context of considering a second tier system is to ensure that what it introduces does not immediately, or potentially, undermine the State pension, which is the most important.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Mitchell's point regarding people at the age of 65 being forced onto jobseeker's benefit.  There are more 65 year olds on jobseeker's benefit than there are people of any other age, which we hear frequently from a lot of our members and supporters who would not only be in receipt of a smaller payment than the pension but who in many cases find it dispiriting to be told that despite their having worked their entire lives, they now have to go on the dole.  This is, in part, linked to the issue of mandatory retirement, which was raised by Deputy Brady and in respect of which Deputy O'Dea has also introduced legislation.  The fact is many of those people were forced to retire at 65 when they would have liked to continue working, not perhaps for ten, 15 or 20 years but until State pension age.</p> <p>  On the point regarding how we sustain the State pension and make it more sustainable, as a first step, we need to have that debate and to identify ways of doing it.  The proposals that came forward from the national pensions framework were around increasing the retirement age.  I would view that as an ask of older people to continue working for longer to get a State pension to make it more sustainable.  Perhaps it is time we looked at other asks that could be made.  For example, could we consider how to make the State pension more flexible?  Some people would like to put off getting the State pension and to continue to work for longer while other people would like to continue to work for longer but they cannot do so because of the mandatory retirement clauses.  If we enabled them to do that, not only could they continue working, they would continue paying tax.  Currently, older workers pay no PRSI and employers pay only a small amount of PRSI for them.  Perhaps that could be looked at in terms of trying to increase the amount of money that would be going into the Social Insurance Fund.</p> <p>  When talking about the State pension we need to move away from the very black and white and fixed concept of a person being entitled to a pension at 66 years.  As I said, some people might want to put off getting the pension to a later age and others might want to get it earlier.  In a number of European countries particular classifications of workers are entitled to claim the full state pension a couple of years earlier because they work in very physically demanding areas, including construction, heavy industry, home care and so on.  In France and Belgium people who work in those areas are entitled to a full state pension a couple of years earlier.  Consideration could be given to the introduction of a similar model here.  I am not talking in that regard about making the State pension more sustainable but it is worth bearing that in mind.  I have worked in offices most of my life.  When it comes to retirement, the demands in terms of the wear and tear of my body will be very different from those of friends of mine who have worked in construction and continue to work in that area.  I agree with the point regarding the need for full recognition of the carer's role.  In that regard, the homemaker's scheme needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  On Senator Higgins's point regarding the breakdown in gender, in terms of the contributory State pension, 64% of recipients are men and 36% are women.  These are figures from the Department in relation to 2015.  Regarding the non-contributory State pension, 62% of recipients are women and 38% are men.  The figures we got in terms of the impact of the 2012 changes are that 62% of people affected by that were women and 38% were men.  In terms of the new rates that were brought in, the biggest cut was to the rate that had the highest proportion of women.  It is almost 2:1 for women in general but in terms of band 4, which is the one that lost around &euro;30, the cut is higher there.  That needs to be borne in mind.  As stated, these are people who were doubly discriminated against.  In many cases, the people who approached us were forced out of employment because of the marriage bar.  In other cases, people believed that they had difficulty getting employment in the 1970s and 1980s because they were women.  There are layers of discrimination involved.</p> <p>  I agree also with the point about the contribution that workers have made.  On the point about linking the contributions to the pension, the example that comes to mind whenever I discuss this issue is that of an Age Action member who worked for 18 months in 1968-1969, left the workforce to provide care to her family, which I would strongly argue was a contribution, returned to the workforce in late 1990s and worked for about 12 years and then retired who, had she not worked in 1968-1969 would have received the full State pension but because she worked during that time, a decision she made more than 40 years ago and one which I suspect the Government of the time would have been encouraging people to make, she is in receipt of a much smaller pension.  These types of anomalies could be addressed by a move to a total contributions approach.  Taking into account the Senator's point and also the point made by the Chairman, we believe that could be a better system, but in terms of the mandatory retirement system, we have not had sight of what the Department proposes.  A system that is closely linked to the contributions made by workers over their time in employment would be more positive and would remove some of the anomalies in the current State pension system.</p><p>However, that system would have to provide fair treatment for care that is not considered to be paid employment but is the care of family members, and not just children but also people with special needs or disabilities.</p><p> One of the reasons we are a little bit cautious about it is that when the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was discussing this issue before the committee last year, he said that in the move to a total contributions approach, there would be winners and losers.  Considering the people we represent, we want to ensure there are as few losers as possible in this regard.</p><p> I strongly agree with the point that the initial tier should be addressed first.  Elected representatives who deal with people in their constituency clinics will know how complicated the State pension can be with all the different stamps and changes to it.  My colleague, Mr. Scully, deals with it daily on our information line.  We need to reform that system by making it simpler, fairer and more effective.  That is not just because it is the one that most people rely on but also to achieve that issue of trust in moving to a second tier pension.</p><p> I also wish to mention the question of whether 35% is the best model to choose.  This is also the point the Chairman made.  Honestly, the answer is probably not but it is the one that is there.  As an advocacy organisation, we look at the commitments the Government has made and entered into.  It has carried out its own research and decided that the best way of doing this, and the simplest formula, was to look at a 35% figure based on average earnings.  In that way the pension would continue to rise in line with the demands of the economy.  It would be far preferable to take the approach outlined by the Deputy, which was that we would examine building a system specific to older people and responsive to their needs.</p><p> We have looked, for example, at research undertaken on the cost of living for older people.  Much of it, however, does not include the fact that many older people have high rates of private health insurance coverage.  They will make enormous sacrifices to ensure they meet those insurance payments.  There is, therefore, a difference between demands on older people and demands on others that could be addressed with a different formula.</p><p> I regret to tell Deputy Carey that we are not familiar with the homemaker's scheme in other countries.  Our research programme over the past year has focused on the 2012 State pension cuts, which is the material we have produced.  We also examined the homemaker's scheme as it operated in Ireland.  Our pension research programme will examine gender and not superficially the homemaker's scheme.  I regret to say that I do not have an answer for the Deputy's question, but it is something we have recognised as a priority to be examined.</p><p> As regards the Chairman's points, I welcome the fact the committee will consider making recommendations and suggestions.  That is important ahead of the budget later this year and given the cross-party nature of the committee.  The figure of &euro;290 million comes from the Department.  As the Deputy will see from the footnote, we are not completely clear about the evidence for it either.  The committee may be aware that the original figure for backdating the homemaker's scheme was around &euro;140 million.  It came from the 2007 Green Paper on pensions and was the figure we were using for some considerable time.</p><p> In his contribution to the committee in December 2016, the representative from the Department of Social Protection said they had done a more substantial piece of work and had now identified the figure at &euro;290 million for backdating the scheme.  The question is, however, how far it would be backdated.  There is a big difference between backdating it forever, or to 1973 or 1974 when one uses the marriage bar to link it back to something.  I would not question the Department's figures and I am sure the &euro;290 million figure is accurate.  However, it would be great to get some context on how the figure was calculated and achieved.</p><p> I agree with the Chairman's point on the specific index.  I would encourage members of the committee to look at the work that has been done by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, including minimum essential standards, not just for older people but in general.</p><p> Rental issues for older people have been coming up more from our members in the past six to 12 months.  It concerns not only those in rental accommodation but also owner-occupiers who would like to move into sheltered housing, but there is no such accommodation available.  One of the challenges in the years to come is how we can provide housing options for older people that are not currently in place.  We have owner-occupiers who would like to move into sheltered housing but cannot do so because they are not on the housing waiting list due to their status as owner-occupiers.  We also have people in rental accommodation who would like to move out into communities that are more responsive to older people's needs.</p><p> Sheltered housing is one of the issues that will need to be addressed in the years to come.  There is much more investment in it in Britain and the private sector is much more involved in building retirement homes and communities.  It has not really taken off in Ireland.  Organisations such as Cl&uacute;id are doing fantastic work, but the matter has not been sufficiently addressed so far.</p></speech>

He attributed a comment to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that in moving to a total contribution basis there would be winners and losers.  As I said to him at the time, that is assuming the pot is exactly the same.  Mr. Moran has already made that assumption.</p> <p>  As regards moving from the annual averaging system, and notwithstanding that people get credits whether as homemakers or for whatever other purpose, there is an inherent inequity in it.  Somebody could have a lot more contributions than someone else, but the time they entered the system affects it.  There is probably merit in looking at another system.  The challenge is to ensure it addresses anomalies before the system is introduced.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran referred to the type of people who should get credits and that needs to be built into it as well.  However, moving away from annual averaging to another system would have greater equality built into it.  While it probably will not be addressed in next year's budget, we do need to get to a fairer system than annual averaging.</p> <p>  A number of colleagues have supplementary questions.  I will call Deputy O'Dea first.</p></speech>

Let us presume, for example, that the Minister for Social Protection said he was going to introduce a new system based on total contributions of an average working lifetime of 40 years at 52 contributions per annum.  In a situation like that there would be a hell of a lot of losers and our clinics would be very well attended.  We have to be careful in that respect.  I take the point that Deputy Mitchell and others have made about care, but I could see a situation where, for a change, men would lose out more than women in a total contribution system.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran made an interesting point about people being able to put off receipt of their pensions in the event of the legislation ending mandatory retirement coming into effect.  Will the Chairman contact the relevant authorities to see where we are with that legislation, which is pretty central to this matter?  The Bill is not being opposed by the Government, so we just want to see what stage it is at now and if the money question has been sorted out.</p> <p>  As I understand it at the moment, if somebody reaches pension age and is entitled to a contributory old age pension, but continues working, they are still entitled to get their pension.  As I interpret it, Mr. Moran is suggesting a sort of trade off.  We would have a new system whereby if they were working, they would not get their pension.  In compensation for that, people below the age of 66 who are working in certain occupations like the construction industry, might be able to balance one off against the other.  That is a very good idea and we should examine it closely.  I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation which was very informative.</p></speech>

I am aware of the debate in France, for example.  There was a lot of simplistic coverage about retirement at 55, but in many cases they were talking about people who had worked for 40 years since the age of 15.  We should examine the question holistically in terms of what people have been doing, while recognising care as part of that.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran discussed the double-bind highlighted by the 2012 changes.</p><p>There is a potential interim position whereby the 2012 changes are suspended and not introduced until we address the question of introducing total contributions and created a new system.  I appreciate the concerns highlighted by Deputy O'Dea.  I agree with him that we must be careful when deciding the type of total contribution to adopt and what it includes.  There is a contradiction.  It seems unusual to have introduced and further imbedded a new measure in 2012 that was based on an averaging system acknowledged as being unfair.  Introducing a new measure to provide for total contributions or subsequently strengthening or adding bands would be counter intuitive.  I wonder about that position.  </p><p> Concerns have been expressed about PRSI.  In order to be realistic about our ageing population and to plan for the future, should we increase PRSI contributions now because a second tier system may take years to introduce?  An increase now would mean we would not seek an increase after the fact.  </p><p> Does Age Action Ireland find the current tax reliefs defensible when we have recognised inequities in the first tier system?  A rate of 33% was mentioned by the organisation.  Does the organisation think we should move entirely to a standard rate of tax relief in the medium-term?</p></speech>

If a person worked 52 weeks a year for 40 years, he or she would have made about 2,000 contributions.  Recently I asked the Department for a breakdown on how many people in receipt of a pension had made total payments of 1,800 contributions, 1,500 contributions and so forth.  It emerged that the Department did not have the data to hand.  People are concerned that we cannot design a proper system because, without that data, the bands in a new system might be just as problematic as the banks in the current system.  In my view, very few people will have worked 40 years uninterrupted or have made contributions, availed of credits or whatever for 40 years.  It is important that the design of the system reflects reality.  We must not introduce a new system that might be more equitable but gives people much less.  It is tricky to gather the appropriate information.  I am disappointed that some of the big figures are unavailable.  If they were, one could commence analysing how a new system might look like.</p></speech>

In terms of being realistic about how the workplace now operates, we know that the amount of precarious and insecure work is on the rise.  As has been mentioned, 60% of the people who have insecure, low hour and non-fixed hour work are women.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to share their thoughts on the non-contributory pension and the capacity to make voluntary contributions.  As the Chairman outlined, in the future it will be hard for people to have made consistent contributions because their work life does not allow them to do so. </p></speech>

The system outlined by the Chairman would be fairer.  We would worry how long it will take us to get there.  We have heard a lot about it being introduced by 2020 but we think that is optimistic.  The discussion would be greatly helped if the Government gave us more information on the design, format or structure of the scheme.  If the Government was serious about changing something as substantial as the State's pension system by 2020, it would need to be talking about it in some detail now.</p> <p>  I will outline one of the challenges that we experienced as a result of the 2012 pensions cut.  Many people came to us about it, and still do, because they did not know that a change had occurred.  The Government or Department might be spurred on to adopt a total contributions approach if they took Senator Higgins's suggestion on board to suspend the 2012 changes.  The move would be welcomed by many people.  Our members have taken the initiative to write personally to the Department or to their Deputies and public representatives.  They have received letters to the effect that the respondent appreciates they are in a certain situation and there is an anomaly but the Government is moving to a total contributions approach in 2020.  Being told that the Government will tackle the matter in 2020 is unhelpful when one can lose &euro;1,000 per year, as a result of the 2012 changes, as some women and men have done.  The amount involved is a fairly substantial sum, particularly for someone in receipt of the State pension.      </p> <p>  Senator Higgins suggested that it would be better to increase PRSI payments now and I agree with her that we need to do so.  Our opening statement contains a reference to the research conducted into this area.  Mr. Paul Sweeney highlighted the fact that Ireland has one of the lowest employers' PRSI contribution rates in Europe, which is 7 points lower than the OECD average and lower than the average of the EU's 15 countries.  Employers and job creation would be impacted by increased social insurance contributions.  We need to commence a conversation.  If we want a sustainable State pension system, people must put money into the Social Insurance Fund.  Many employees and workers already pay a substantial amount of taxes, not just PRSI but through other income contributions.  In a situation where workers are asked to work longer due an increased retirement age and we prevent them from working beyond the mandatory retirement age of 65, it is time to consider the type of contributions employers make, especially in the context of the sacrifices that workers have made over the past number of years. </p> <p>  In response to whether the current tax reliefs are defensible, I raised the issue because when we talk about the State pension a figure of &euro;7 billion is bandied about.  We spend &euro;7 billion a year and it will increase by &euro;200 million a year.  We actually spend more on pensions but in the form of occupational and personal pensions.  If we are going to have a discussion, then let us have it in the round.  Let us add the two figures together, which is &euro;10 billion more or less, and decide how to spend it.  Perhaps the best and fairest way to spend it is to have a State pension system and to adopt a total contributions approach and provide supports for private pensions.  At the moment the supports are not geared in the right way, especially when one considers the disparity between where the benefits for the private pension tax reliefs occur.</p> <p>  To be clear, saving for retirement and having a private pension is a sensible thing to do.  It is an appropriate and sensible use of Government funding to incentivise people to save for their  retirement.  I wonder if we are putting money into the State pension that could be better used elsewhere.  </p> <p>  The Chairman made a point about getting the necessary data.  We found it a little challenging to get a gender breakdown of data for our report on the 2012 figures.  Such data is not published in the annual statistics report released by the Department of Social Protection.  Bad data leads to bad decisions but good data leads to good decisions.  The more information is publically available to elected representatives and organisations like ourselves the better, and everyone can make an informed decision. </p> <p>  Mr. Scully will answer the question on the non-contributory pension.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned people who are self-employed and other categories of people who do not qualify for a State pension.  For people who want to make voluntary contributions, the problem with the 2012 changes was that people were told up to three or four months before they retired that they were safe and had made enough contributions, but then they fell off the cliff so to speak.  They were not warned.  They were not advised when they still in employment that they were still in the system and, thus, could make voluntary contributions to improve their record of voluntary contributions.  The offer was not given to people and it has not been offered since because people are still falling off the cliff edge.</p><p>People are still ringing Age Action to tell us that they have just realised that they will not get a full pension although they thought they had made sufficient contributions and were told eight or ten years ago that enough contributions had been made.  Nobody has ever gone to those people to tell them that they needed to make voluntary contributions in order to avoid the cliff edge.  We either need to suspend the changes introduced in 2012 or start being fair with people and start an education campaign to tell people, if they are in work, to check their contributions and begin making voluntary contributions if needed so they can avoid the cliff edge.</p></speech>

Is there scope for the voluntary contribution to be expanded beyond the limited groupings of people it currently applied to?  Should that area be explored?  Its cost doubled in recent years from somewhere between &euro;200 and &euro;300 to &euro;500 per year.</p></speech>

Anybody who wishes to do so should be able to make voluntary contributions.  There is no justification for having somebody in the system but receiving less in the system than somebody else.  For example, those in paid employment can make voluntary contributions but the self-employed cannot.  We need to look at the system in its entirety and simplify the rules.  The rules governing voluntary contributions need to be extended so that everybody who is paying PRSI contributions at some level, whether that entitles them to a State pension or not, should be allowed to make voluntary contributions in order to become eligible for the State pension.  A self-employed person whose business folds may find himself or herself on the dole two or three years before retirement age and he or she cannot make voluntary contributions or get a State pension and may not have a private pension.  He or she may not have been wise enough to pay into a private pension.  Those people are left on the non-contributory pension after working all their lives, which is grossly unfair.</p></speech>

The lady who launched the Age Action report on the 2012 cuts was from Sligo.  She had been due to retire and had found out what her contributions were going to be.  Her employer then asked her to stay on for an additional year because of a staff shortage in her department.  If she had retired when she had planned to do so, she would have had almost a full State pension.  She did not know the 2012 changes were going to be implemented and she liked where she was working so she continued doing so for an additional year.  When she retired, she found that her pension income had dropped.  Her decision to work for an extra year will cost her, possibly for the rest of her life.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Mary-Elizabeth McMunn, head of our supervisory risk division, and Mr. Mark Cassidy, head of the financial stability division.  Mr. Cassidy is also the chair of our internal Brexit task force.  This task force was initiated approximately one year in advance of the referendum and indicates our proactive approach to preparing for potential Brexit-related issues.  The task force comprises representatives from divisions across the bank and provides comprehensive assessments of Brexit-related matters to the Central Bank Commission and to the bank management generally.</p>  <p>  Brexit will have significant implications for trading arrangements between the UK and the EU with effects also on labour markets, investment patterns and capital flows.  The impact will depend crucially on the terms of the UK&rsquo;s exit, in particular the timing and nature of a final trade deal.  In addition, the impact will depend on the nature of the transitional arrangement, if any.  Ireland stands out as the EU economy likely to be most affected.  This reflects the size and nature of our economic and financial linkages with the UK, including our shared land Border.  In my opening remarks I will set out the assessments of the Central Bank regarding the channels through which the economy is likely to be most affected, with reference both to challenges and opportunities, as well as some important policy issues for national authorities, including the Central Bank itself.</p>  <p>  Ireland's reliance on UK markets for our international trade has reduced considerably over the past 40 years but remains significant.  Before Ireland's accession to the EU in 1973, the UK accounted for over 50% of Irish trade.  This has fallen to under 14% for goods exports and under 20% for services exports.  Almost 26% of the goods imported into Ireland, but only 8% of services imported, are from the UK.  Nevertheless, Ireland is still more reliant on the UK export market than any other EU country.  Certain sectors of the economy rely more on UK markets than others.  These include traditional manufacturing sectors, agrifood, materials manufacturing and tourism.  Interestingly, these sectors are often quite labour-intensive, and it is notable that a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises are engaged in UK markets either through trade or tourism.</p>  <p>  The overall impact of Brexit on the Irish economy and financial system remains subject to considerable uncertainty, depending in large part on the nature of the new trading arrangement to be agreed between the EU and the UK, including possible transition arrangements and the capacity of our economy to adjust.  From communications issued by the UK Government, we know that the UK will not seek continued membership of the Single Market, or a "soft" Brexit, as red lines for the UK are the control of immigration and the ending of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.  It will instead seek an ambitious free trade agreement with the EU, perhaps some form of customs agreement and some form of transitional arrangement or, as the UK calls it, a "phased process of implementation".  Under this scenario, an agreement would be based on tariff-free trade in goods but not services.</p> <p>Over time, some regulatory divergence between the UK and EU may emerge, which could lead to an increase in non-tariff barriers.  This seems to plot a middle course between a soft and hard Brexit, although until the negotiations are finalised, a hard Brexit cannot be ruled out.  </p> <p>Under a hard Brexit scenario, the UK would leave the EU without a trade agreement and would instead exercise its rights under the most favoured nation, MFN, clause of the World Trade Organization, WTO.  Under this most damaging scenario, goods trade would be subject to tariff and non-tariff barriers, which would vary across sectors, leading to more significant negative effects on trade.  Under this scenario - the hard Brexit - our estimates suggest that after ten years, GDP would be lower by 3% and the number of people employed would be 40,000 fewer, compared with a benchmark no-Brexit scenario.  This estimate is in line with those of the ESRI and the Department of Finance.  These aggregate figures mask the fact that certain sectors and indeed regions of the economy would be disproportionately affected and some small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to be among the hardest hit by Brexit. </p> <p> A hard Brexit may also require sudden regulatory and financial adjustments, since UK financial firms would lose passporting rights associated with EU membership.  This is likely to be accompanied by a period of heightened uncertainty in the financial services sector.  The importance of a transitional period to mitigate potentially disruptive cliff effects in the workings of the financial system must be recognised.</p> <p> Our analysis is that the overall economic effects for Ireland in both the short term and longer term will be negative.  The effects will be much worse if no free trade agreement can be reached.  In the short term, before new arrangements come into effect, which is not likely to be until at least 2019, the main effects may come through the exchange rate channel and uncertainty.  The value of sterling has generally traded in the range of 10% to 15% weaker against the euro since the time of the Brexit referendum in June 2016.  This makes Irish exports to the UK more expensive.  There is already some tentative evidence of this exchange rate effect in the economic data.  For a number of important food and beverage sectors, the value of exports declined last year even though volumes increased.  This may be some indication of exchange rate fluctuations having an effect on export values. Irish imports will also be affected by Brexit, that is, the prices that exporters receive for exports to the UK.  Imports will also be affected by Brexit.  In the near term, the weaker value of sterling has put downward pressure on import prices, which is beneficial for consumers and producers who use UK imports in the production process, but can leave Irish producers who are competing in the same markets at a competitive disadvantage.  </p> <p>Over the long term, slower growth in UK consumption and investment, if it materialises, and in particular, any new barriers to trade including tariffs, will also weigh on some Irish firms.  In the event of a hard Brexit, the trade impact on different EU countries will depend on the share of total exports and imports accounted for by the UK, the size of tariffs imposed on exports, which differs very significantly across sectors and products, and the sensitivity of exports to price changes, which also varies across sectors.  A detailed EU-wide sectoral analysis undertaken by ESRI researchers shows that Ireland is the economy most affected by Brexit due to the fact that we have the highest share of our exports going to the UK and that the tariff rate on our exports to the UK would be almost double the EU average due to the very high rates on agricultural and food products under WTO rules.  Their analysis shows that under a hard Brexit, and taking into consideration all these factors, Irish exports to the UK might fall by around 30%, which would be equivalent to an overall reduction in our exports of over 4%.  The imposition of tariff or non-tariff costs would not only reduce trade volumes but also increase import prices, which would likely be passed onto consumers.  </p> <p> From a financial stability perspective, we are monitoring the impact that Brexit will have on the Irish banking system.  Weaker UK and Irish growth will negatively affect those banks which have significant UK exposures.  The weaker sterling exchange rate will reduce the value of profits and assets that are denominated in sterling.  Other financial sector firms may also be affected, either positively or negatively, depending upon their business models and the extent of their UK business.  Since before the referendum the Central Bank has been engaging with firms from across the financial sector to ensure that they are fully accounting for risks that may arise from the Brexit process.</p> <p> The risks and uncertainties regarding Brexit underline the importance of stability-oriented policies, notably in the area of public finances and financial system stability.  Also, the challenges in areas of trade and investment underline the importance of maintaining competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland remains a flexible, adaptable economy that is supportive of enterprise and innovation.  The risks from Brexit can be mitigated by further expansion of our trade links with other EU and non-EU countries, particularly for the indigenous sectors that are currently more reliant on UK markets.   </p> <p> Brexit will also present new opportunities for the Irish economy.  Most notable in this regard is potentially stronger inward foreign direct investment as a result of both a relocation of existing UK-based FDI to Ireland and new FDI flows locating to Ireland instead of to the UK.  It is too early yet to see any evidence of such flows but they could create new employment opportunities and add to growth in the economy, while at the same time potentially creating challenges and opportunities, including for the property sector.  Already Irish commercial property agents have noted increased office accommodation enquiries from British companies.  In addition to the availability of office space, sufficient housing and adequate infrastructure will be required to accommodate any additional investments in Ireland, including notably in the international financial services sector.  </p> <p>In the financial sector, new business lines and new firms bring new opportunities, new challenges and new risks.  In addressing these, it is important to note at the outset that the Central Bank does not have a mandate to promote the development of financial services in Ireland.  Rather, our mandate is to safeguard stability and protect consumers.  In assessing any application, we are guided by that mandate such that each application is assessed to understand the business, its risks and how they are managed and mitigated.  This is critically important for the stability of the sector as a whole, for ensuring that financial firms are soundly financed and soundly run, and for ensuring that consumers of financial services are appropriately protected. </p> <p> Since the referendum, as firms weigh their options for a post-Brexit world, the Central Bank has received a large number of Brexit-related authorisation inquiries from across all sectors, including banks, insurance companies, investment firms and payment institutions. They have been considering a variety of factors relevant to their business, and wish to understand our approach to authorisation and ongoing supervision, such as substance, risk management and governance structures. </p> <p> Overall, the level of Brexit-related activity and developments is in line with what we expected to see following the referendum decision.  In the coming weeks and months, as firms make decisions, we expect to see a meaningful increase in applications for authorisation or for extension of existing business. As the Governor, Professor Philip Lane, has already said, we deal with inquiries in an open, engaged and constructive manner and are committed to providing transparency, consistency and predictability in our regulatory decisions.  To deal with the increased level of activity, we have increased or are in the process of increasing our authorisation teams across all sectors.  Since Ireland is already home to a large-scale international financial services centre, we have considerable experience in dealing with such authorisations.  Our regulatory approach is in line with sound practices being agreed across Europe; our responsibility is to ensure that firms authorised to operate from Ireland demonstrate compliance with EU requirements.  To this end, we seek to ensure that an entity will be substantively run from Ireland and that the set-up permits effective supervision, with local management accountable for decision making.  The Central Bank has consistently said it is not sustainable to entertain proposals that fall short of these basic requirements.</p> <p>We are actively engaged in the work of the European supervisory authorities and with our colleagues within the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM.  It is worth noting in this regard that the SSM has recently issued important guidelines for banks looking to relocate their businesses within the euro area.  The guidelines set out the ECB's supervisory expectations in a number of areas, including internal governance, risk management and outsourcing.  ESAs are also advancing their work on these issues in respect of other entities such as securities firms and insurance companies.  Regardless of where a firm locates, it should expect that there will be rigorous assessment of the applicable EU regulatory standards and intrusive ongoing supervision of its activities.</p> <p> The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to monitor Brexit developments in this area and, via its Brexit task force, co-ordinate expert analysis from across its supervisory and economics functions to ensure an integrated and comprehensive understanding of economic, financial and regulatory risks.</p></speech>

Before I bring colleagues in, I have three quick questions.  On authorisations, Mr. Fagan mentioned a number of inquiries.  How many applications for authorisation have been received and what is the average waiting time to process them?  Mr. Fagan mentioned the opportunity in respect of trade expansion.  Is he interested in sharing the names of those countries or regions which are most ideal in terms of possible expansion?  The first questioner on my list is Senator Joe O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2771" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400004#C00300"><p>I welcome our guests and thank Mr. Fagan for his submission.  To begin where the Chairman left off, it has been alleged in some media outlets and anecdotally that the Central Bank is too restrictive and conservative in its authorisations and that we run the risk of missing opportunities.  While I understand the point Mr. Fagan made on that, is he happy that the bank is going to strike an adequate balance between the need to attract new financial services and banking, employment and trading opportunities for the country and the need to operate proper restrictive practices?  That has been alleged and I am interested to hear the response.</p><p>How much of a bonus will we see?  One of the opportunities in Brexit is that we might attract new financial services to augment business here.  We are being told that Frankfurt is going to win the lion's share.  How optimistic is Mr. Fagan?  I acknowledge that he will not want to be overly speculative, but what is his sense of that opportunity from Brexit in the event that our previous distinguished speaker and former Taoiseach, John Bruton, is not correct in his hope that Britain will not leave?</p><p>I turn to trading arrangements.  Assuming that there is a form of customs agreement, does Mr. Fagan rule out completely the prospect of free trade?  We have obviously had a huge achievement in the area of free movement of people, which has been well discussed and documented in the last few days.  It is not necessarily totally a matter of Mr. Fagan's remit.  In any event, the achievements there are to be noted and were a critical first set of achievements.  Now, however, the major focus is on trade in respect of which there was a somewhat disappointing report this morning from accountants.  Does Mr. Fagan see any hope of the <i>status quo</i>continuing to obtain?  In the event that it does not, what levels of custom duty will apply in practice?  How greatly would they devalue our exports?  What sectors of the community will be hit?  Am I right in thinking that agriculture is under huge threat and that some agricultural exports may not be viable?</p><p>Mr. Fagan referred to transition arrangements.  Is he hopeful of a delay?  Can he elaborate on what he meant in saying that we might achieve tariff-free trade in goods but not services?  I am interested in teasing out, in practical layman's terms, how Mr. Fagan sees Brexit impacting on specific exports in the cost added, the degree to which value will be weakened and the degree to which the domestic economy is threatened.  How will arrangements unfold?  Will people have to pay direct customs?  If there were no customs, would a monitoring process for goods crossing the Border still be required as it will be a frontier between the EU and UK?  Will there have to be a checking of goods at that level involving a cost for exporters?  What are the nuts and bolts of how Mr. Fagan envisages it working so that we can be informed in our discussions with the sectors seeking to discuss the matter with us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400004#C00400"><p>There are a lot of questions for Mr. Fagan there.  The notion of tariff-free services has occurred to me.  To take something close to home, if a lawyer in Ireland provides services to a British firm and sends a bill, in what sense would there be tariffs on the payment made?  It might be a lawyer's or a financial adviser's bill.  I find it difficult to grasp how, apart from the lawyer paying VAT in Ireland or Britain, tariffs on services could operate very well.</p>  <p>  Given that the Central Bank takes the view that Ireland is the most affected country and that the effects could be quite serious by sector, can Mr. Fagan say something about special arrangements for Ireland?  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, mentioned the possibility of a common trading area as well as a common travel area.  In that context, I presume the disengagement of the UK from the EU will involve a multi-annual period.  Has any consideration been given - by the Central Bank or any of the State agencies with which it operates - to different phasing arrangements for Ireland?  In other words, if tariffs were to come in, could they come in at a slower rate for Ireland or over a more extended period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400004#C00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  My first question is on the efforts that have been made by the remaining member states to attract banks and financial services.  There are reports that there will be a race to the bottom in terms of supervisory standards, which, considering all that we have been through with the banks not only here but abroad, is shocking.  My colleague has asked if there will be flexibility so that we can attracts banks and financial services to Ireland.  In what areas will we be allowed to be flexible?  Where can wheeling and dealing be done to attract businesses without compromising standards or taking an undue risk of compromising a system put in place to protect people in member states who have had to bear the brunt of the near collapse of the banks?</p> <p> I have heard comment and discourse in the media suggesting that if we do not get what we want in the event of a hard Brexit, we should leave or threaten to leave the European Union.  This does not appear to be a sensible proposition.  It is not clear what the British want from Brexit or even if they know what they want or know how they propose to get it.  All we have heard is what they do not want and everything seems to point towards a hard rather than a soft Brexit.</p> <p> The witnesses described how our dependence on the UK market has declined since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973.  Sectors such as agrifood and indigenous manufacturing continue to rely on the UK, however.  People in the west are not expecting financial services companies to wing their way over to us.  Galway city is probably the only location in the region that stands a chance of securing such investment.  We are preparing in whatever way we can for Brexit.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the suggestion that the Government's position was weakened by its failure to threaten the European Union with leaving.</p> <p> On the rules associated with the fiscal compact, the witnesses and speakers at previous meetings described the need for businesses to restructure and find new products and markets.  The Government intends to assist companies to do this.  This will require an increase in expenditure, which could put pressure on the Government to increase the fiscal space.  Should the Government seek a derogation from the expenditure rules under the exceptional circumstances provided for in the treaty?  Is such a derogation being considered and would it give us flexibility to deal with the fallout from Brexit, especially given the current trajectory of the negotiations?</p> <p> On state-aid rules, certain regions, specifically in the west, are especially disadvantaged and are not experiencing the economic recovery to the same extent as other regions.  Figures from the 2016 census show that the population in the west is declining and ageing.  The reason for these trends is that young people are leaving owing to a lack of job opportunities.  Another critical factor is that areas in the west do not have good infrastructure and did not benefit from investment in roads and rail during the Celtic tiger period.</p> <p> Ireland West Airport Knock is strategic infrastructure in which has been earmarked for growth.  State-aid rules present an impediment to its expansion, however.  I understand a temporary arrangement in respect of state-aid rules was in place in 2009 which allowed us to deal with the banking crisis.  Could we do something along these lines again and invest in infrastructure in disadvantaged areas to stave off the negative effects of Brexit and address infrastructure deficits?  This would allow us to fund Ireland West Airport Knock without seeking the European Commission's approval every time the airport requests additional funding.  I understand the maximum percentage of funding that can be provided is 90%, whereas Ireland West Airport Knock needs 100% funding in certain areas.  Under current rules, the airport can only be offered assistance in safety and security measures, which precludes capital investment for expansion.  I ask the witnesses to address the issues I have raised, especially my final point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2775" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400005#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  My concern with respect to Brexit is in finding out what solutions the witnesses may be able to offer.  The problems associated with Brexit have been well rehearsed in the public domain and the discussion appears to be focused on whether it will be a hard or soft Brexit.  In my view, it will be a somewhat disorganised process in which some solutions may be negotiated at an early date, while it may prove very difficult to negotiate solutions in other areas.  My focus, therefore, is on what solutions the witnesses are in a position to offer to the committee or the Government.</p>  <p>  Does the Central Bank have all the expertise it requires or does it need to employ or acquire additional expertise in specific areas?  If additional expertise is required, has the Central Bank sought Government approval to employ additional staff and, if so, what has been the Government's response?</p>  <p>  The areas highlighted by the witnesses include materials manufacturing, agrifood and tourism.  Agrifood and tourism will be two key areas in terms of the downside of Brexit.  Has the Central Bank modelled different scenarios and solutions to the problems that will arise based on certain outcomes?  If so, does it have a best and worst case scenario, particularly in agrifood and tourism?</p>  <p>  Reference was made to the possibility of a 30% fall in exports to the United Kingdom, which is a significant figure by any measure.  Michel Barnier and various other people to whom we spoke in Brussels indicated that the Commission would take a favourable view of requests for support for market diversification activities and the construction, if one likes, of better infrastructure with European Union partners, for example, the establishment in the south east, perhaps in Waterford, of a major port that would provide a direct link to Europe, thereby precluding the need for goods and people to traverse the United Kingdom.  Has the Central Bank examined this possibility, including construction costs and the savings that would be achieved in respect of tariffs levied on entering and departing Britain?</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned by the statement that exports could decline by 4% overall.  The documentation is very clear in this regard.  However, the figure masks a very serious impact on companies that are almost married, as it were, to the UK market.  We have been somewhat lethargic in developing markets in countries whose languages we do not speak.  England has always been a safe bet.  Has the Central Bank explored this issue?  Several Irish suppliers in the agrifood sector are recognised worldwide.  However, we also have many small indigenous companies, including one-man and two-man operations in certain niche areas, which export solely to the United Kingdom.  A 30% decline in trade with Britain would effectively knock these companies out of business.  EU rules limit the supports that can be provided to such companies.  Has the Central Bank examined which rules need to be relaxed to provide the supports that would be needed during a transition period?</p>  <p>  I am more interested in solutions than problems because the latter have been so well rehearsed that the dogs in the street are barking about Brexit.  That discussion does not give us an idea as to where we are likely to go and the Central Bank appears to be the only organisation that is focused on the impact of Brexit on the entire economy, sector by sector.</p> <p>I thank the witnesses for their time.  I am sorry for throwing all these questions at them</p></speech>

We have 20 minutes remaining with three more speakers indicating and the responses from the Central Bank.  Let me repeat that I ask all Senators to keep their contributions to questions, and ideally, to limit them to one to two minutes.  That applies to everyone and I am not just picking on the most recent speaker.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400006#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Ireland is in the unfortunate situation - and the Central Bank in particular - of suffering from a post-banking crisis stress disorder.  Unlike other European member states, having gone through a banking crisis and regulatory issues around it, the human reaction is to over-regulate.  That happened and was due to lack of oversight and regulations, issues with which the officials are well aware.  As a result, we now are seen to be more cautious than anybody else.</p>  <p>  How many applications, if any, has the Central Bank rejected?.  My concern is that companies will not even bother to apply but will think Ireland is far too regulated at this time.  When people do not apply, we do not know how we are doing compared with other countries.  Is there an analysis of how many financial service companies in Britain have made applications to other European countries and whether they made multiple applications?  Will they hedge, as they would in any other financial situation, and apply in Ireland, Frankfurt and Luxembourg?  While I acknowledge the Central Bank does not have a role in attracting companies, the critical question - which is directed to Mr. Mark Cassidy - is whether, since the task force was established and especially since Brexit, the Central Bank has introduced reforms to make Ireland more attractive.  That is the only thing the Central Bank can do that is within its gift.  Has the Central Bank made changes to itself since Brexit to make it more attractive?  If the Central Bank has not done that, that is of concern to members.  If the Central Bank has not done it, is it planning to do it?</p></speech>

My question is on similar lines to that of my colleague, Senator Mark Daly.  We have not fully emerged from the major banking crisis and now Brexit has been sprung on us.  Recently I used the analogy of a carpenter with the ingrown toenail who hits his thumb with the hammer.  He soon forgets the ingrown toenail but it has not been cured or gone away.  His focus comes on to his throbbing thumb.  Is there a possibility of that scenario playing out here?  While Brexit is very important and has to have a major focus, could it take all our focus away from other areas that still very much need remedial care as we have not fully turned the corner?  I seek the views of the witnesses from the Central Bank, not only from its perspective but possibly whether we as a nation, have a tunnel vision on Brexit.  What potential and possible fall-off could there be because of it?</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and Senators for their questions.  I will group a number of questions together as they are variations on a theme.</p>  <p>  I will deal with the position around conservatism and the questions on the other jurisdiction in terms of attracting their share of financial services companies.</p>  <p>  From our perspective, we are very conscious of the potential for companies to move to Ireland as a result of Brexit.  As we have outlined in our opening statement, however, we do not have a role in attracting businesses to Ireland.  That promotional role has been explicitly removed from our mandate because it was felt that it compromised our authorisation and supervisory stance.</p>  <p>  Let me take a step back.  Central to the concern from our perspective is implementing our mandate, which is about financial stability, the protection of customers and that there is a well-functioning and well-regulated financial system.  For any authorisation process, one must think in terms of where one is starting from.  We are starting from an understanding of what is the business that is being presented to us; what are the risks associated with that business and how those risks are managed and mitigated.  Our starting point is not what is the most conservative position we can adopt in respect of this applicant firm.  It is about understanding the risks of that particular business.  We also seek to ensure that customers are very central to the business proposition.  From a financial stability perspective, we would stand back and ask what would be the potential harm to the citizens, to the economy and so on were this firm to fail.  From that perspective, the Governor mentioned at our press conference on the annual report yesterday that it was his ambition that regulatory issues would not play a role in decisions around relocation.  Many different factors go into influencing the relocation of a firm to a particular jurisdiction and I can go into those.  We are not proposing to comment on individual firms' specific relocation decisions to various different jurisdictions because as I said, a range of factors influence where firms chose to locate.  </p>  <p>  When we look at supervision, the EU has a harmonised approach to regulation of financial services and our approach to authorisation is firmly embedded in the European system of financial supervision.  What is important from our perspective is that regulatory authorities ensure that any migration of those firms does not lead to any disjointed or fragmented supervisory system.  Regardless of where an entity seeks to locate, firms should expect a rigorous application of both authorisation standards and ongoing supervision.  We are actively engaged at a European level with our colleagues in the ECB and in the other supervisory authorities to ensure that UK firms' Brexit-related decisions reflect a consistent approach across the EU.  We have referred in our opening statement to some guidelines that have been issued by the ECB recently with regard to frequently asked questions, FAQs, about what one should expect in the context of a bank, for example, relocating to the euro area.  It also sets out supervisory expectations on a number of key issues and we are very supportive of that.  Other European authorities are moving in the same way.  </p>  <p>  I will deal with Senator Paul Daly's point on specifically taking away the focus from existing areas.  There is a significant ongoing effort across the organisation on Brexit-related activity.  We also continue to fulfil our mandate and I will speak specifically to supervision from an ongoing supervisory perspective.  We are not taking the focus off our existing mandate in respect of ongoing supervision, intrusive supervision, enforcement and so on.  While we have an incumbent population for which we need to seek to do our job, perhaps specifically in the context of the authorisation processes and the Chairman's direction on time, the most important perspective from our side is that we are keen to be very transparent about the process.  We regulate more than 10,000 financial services providers in Ireland.  We have alluded to the sectors in our opening statement.  The nature of any application is very particular to the type of entity that is presenting itself.  That flows directly through to the timeline around authorisation.</p> <p>For example, while the principles of our authorisation and gateway roles are the same, their practical implementation is very particular to the type of application on the table.  If, for example, we were considering a qualifying investor fund, the authorisation could be turned around in a matter of days.  A banking licence, however, is an entirely different proposition and the SSM regulations speak to at least six months in the context of turning around a banking application but a decision must be made within a year.</p> <p> We publish six-monthly reports on our regulatory performance against standards we set for ourselves regarding authorisation timelines so we measure ourselves against timeliness standards.  This outlines not only the number of applications that are live, but also how we have performed against our own protocols for meeting them.  The last report in this regard was published in February.  It dealt with the period from July to December last year.  The next report is due in the summer and will cover the period from January to July.  Regarding authorisation, it is important to say that our goal is to be engaged, open and pragmatic and that it is a rigorous process with the firm.  However, as we recognise, particularly for complex applications, that firms may need some help, we have a pre-application process whereby we engage with institutions to give them some assistance.  As for what a completed application might look like and what might be the key areas one might need to address, without trying to evade the question, it is very difficult to give an indication as to the time it takes to authorise a firm because it is very particular to the type of authorisation with which one is dealing.</p> <p> We have received a large number of inquiries since the referendum and they have been pretty steady.  What we are starting to see with that pipeline activity is that it is migrating as Article 50 has been triggered but also as firms are starting to narrow down their own options and make decisions about possible relocation choices.  We expect much of that activity to take place over the rest of 2017.  The difficulty - and the Governor mentioned this yesterday - is that when one talks about numbers of inquiries, some are very marginal in nature and some require quite extensive engagement with us.  Both cases are represented as a single number so it is often not useful to talk about the number of inquiries in that regard.  In addition, as I think alluded to by one of the Senators, many firms are making inquiries across a number of jurisdictions at the same time and there are reasons for not pursuing an inquiry further.  In some cases we do not know and, in others, it can be just as the firm gets a clearer understanding of the implications of Brexit for its own strategic planning.  There can also be some of the additional factors - infrastructure, culture, language - that are outside of regulation and supervision.  What we can say is that we are engaged with firms at all stages through that process and we have been very open to doing so.  In addition, we will publish the number of applications.  They will come through in the summer because they will be linked to our performance against the standards.  However, there could be a number of institutions that might reflect a small amount of financial services activity.  There could be one application that is very significant in terms of its financial services presence, so again, there is the difficulty in outlining a few numbers.  However, to return to one of the Senator's other questions, we do expect, given our engagement with those firms, that a good proportion of those will come through to actual live applications.  It is very difficult at this stage to be definitive about what that proportion is for some of the factors as outlined but also because many of the firms have not made decisions at this point in time.  However, given our engagement with the firms, it seems likely they will translate into live applications.</p></speech>

Because of the financial crisis, the Central Bank's rules were changed so that it is not out there championing the cause of Ireland being a location for financial services investment and that has changed the bank's remit.  How many other central banks in the EU have the same standard, the same rule, that they are no longer advocates and that they just process the application and that is it?  This goes back to my earlier question to Mr. Cassidy.  Is that making us uncompetitive?  If the Central Bank of Luxembourg is out there championing Luxembourg and the Central Bank of Ireland is not championing Ireland, we had better change that rule because if we do not, we will lose out.</p></speech>

I am not sure.</p></speech>

From a competitive point of view, this is a fundamental issue for Ireland for examination by the task force.  If other central banks are not only being regulatory bodies but also are actively engaging on behalf of their countries, we will not be able to attract financial services.  We will be looking at this in two years' time wondering why we did not get these guys.  It will be because Luxembourg was championing its banks, Germany was championing its financial services centre and the Netherlands was championing its own but our Central Bank was not doing likewise.  That is not the Central Bank's fault but that is the rule in place at the moment and it is one of the regulations I am talking about that needs to be changed.</p></speech>

We have changed our standards.  That is the financial crisis and post-traumatic stress disorder I am talking about.  We changed our standards because the Central Bank was out there looking for business.  This is a hangover from the financial crisis that will now affect our performance.  I suggest that the task force should have answered the question when it was examining the opportunities of Brexit.  Was this one of the things it examined?  I am not talking about the standards; I am talking about the basic rule of central banks in other jurisdictions.  Are they out championing their financial services?  We do not know and we need to find out.  They are out championing their causes for their financial services sector and we are not allowed to do so for ours.  If that is the case, we need to find out and we need to change our rules.</p></speech>

There is essentially a more or less fully harmonised approach to banking supervision across Europe.  Therefore, an individual competent authority in another country cannot offer a better regulatory deal than it will get in Ireland.  It is very important to recognise that this is part of a Europe-wide framework.  It is very strong in banking.  There is a single institution.  However, even for the other sectors of finance - say, for insurance, funds and so forth - there is a kind of common set of standards applied.</p>  <p>  The Senator makes a very interesting point.  There are other dimensions that countries can exploit.  For example, some countries are talking about having lower tax rates for British bankers that come to their jurisdictions.  That is not a supervisory matter; that is kind of a governmental matter.  A range of other things are being done, for example, changing the language in which forms are written and so forth, which makes it more attractive to the UK.  However, many of these are outside the realm of supervision and the supervisory authority.  They constitute Government action.  I do not think it is fair to say Ireland is not being promoted; it is being promoted by the IDA and other institutions.</p></speech>

This comes back to the task force.  What has been highlighted here is that we have changed our rules regarding the Central Bank promoting Ireland as a location for financial services.  If that does not change - and obviously, other European countries have not changed -  we need to find out who they are and whether we are going to change it.  If we are not, we are at nothing.  I agree with Dr. Fagan that other State agencies are out there championing the cause but if other central banks in Luxembourg and elsewhere are championing their financial services centres and the Irish Central Bank is not allowed to do likewise, it needs to go to Government and say the reason we are not going to get them is because we are hamstrung.</p> <p>If this does not change, we will be back here in two years time saying, "I wonder why we didn't get those?"  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Cassidy" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400008#G00200"><p>A number of questions related to the nature of the new trade deal and the impact it may have on tariffs and particular sectors.  It is reasonably fair to say that in terms of trade arrangements, it would suit all parties in the negotiations to have reasonably free trade arrangements.  The effects of that would certainly be much more benign for Ireland, the UK and Europe in terms of trade and investment links.  Of course, this does not mean that this will be the eventual outcome.  I think this depends on the other factors in an overall comprehensive deal so we cannot rule out the possibility that the outcome will be the more unfavourable one of trading goods reverting to WTO arrangements.  In the more benign scenario, we would have either no tariffs or relatively low tariffs on trade between Ireland and the UK.  In that case, many of the effects would come through the impact on the exchange rate - I will come back to the permanence of that in a moment - and the fact that the economic outlook for the UK might be slightly lower over the short and medium term than it would be otherwise.  Those effects would be much more short term and limited for Irish exports so while I am not ruling out the fact that some sectors may be affected, the economic impact of a free trade arrangement or close to free trade arrangements would be much more benign.</p>  <p>  In respect of the more unfavourable situation whereby trade in goods reverts to WTO conditions, we refer to no tariffs on services possibly because the WTO covers goods.  It is much more difficult for some reasons that have been mentioned to impose tariffs on services but over time, the regulatory requirements for services can differ across countries which can impose the main restrictions on trade in services, very notably in the financial sector.  In terms of trade in goods, a very useful and granular ESRI analysis looks at what sectors and countries could be most affected.  It is important to know that the impact on a particular country does not just depend on how much of our trade goes to the UK but the sectoral composition of that trade.  Some notable facts in this regard include the fact that tariffs on agricultural and clothing products, particularly agricultural products, are at the highest end of the range.  This is largely because trade in goods under the WTO rules tends to be trade as a percentage of the value but, very significantly, trade as a percentage of the weight of the good.  Often these goods are among the weightier goods traded.  Ireland would fare unfavourably because of our sectoral composition of the goods.  In fact, the ESRI analysis suggest that the average tariff on Irish exports could be between 10% and 18%.  That compares with the European average of closer to 6% so we are talking about significant effects in addition to the other effects that might arise because of the exchange rate and any downturn in the UK economy.  Clearly, while a number of sectors, including tourism and computer services, would be significantly affected, those most affected would include those where the tariffs are also particularly high in addition to the other effects.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the exchange rate effect, it is fair to say that the value of the exchange rate that currently pertains reflects the expectations in the market regarding what a future trade deal might look like.  If the adverse scenario materialises, a further weakening of sterling compared to the euro may be expected.  One does not like to predict exchange rates too far into the future but some weaker level into the future may be expected.  If more favourable outcomes materialise, some closing of the change that has already occurred may be expected.  With regard to exchange rates, economies tend to adjust to those changes over time.  It does not mean that there will no short-term effects.  Services will also be affected by the exchange rate.  For example, the tourism sector would be mainly affected by the exchange rate without tariffs on goods.  Over the longer term, tariffs might be the more important effect.  </p>  <p>  I am afraid we are not privy to the type of special deals that may be available.  Those more directly involved in the negotiations over the next two years would be better able to answer those questions in terms of whether special deals in terms of transition arrangements reflecting Ireland's closer trading links with the UK could be put in place but it is certainly very welcome to hear European and UK representatives highlight the importance of the Irish trade and economic links with the UK.  </p>  <p>  In respect of issues and authorisations, I cannot really add to what Ms McMunn has said.  There have been many initiatives within the banks in terms of our engagement with firms, the numbers involved and ensuring we have the appropriate skills.  I am not aware if the mandates of central banks elsewhere contained or have contained the requirement to promote the financial services industry.  What other banks are doing on the ground is very difficult to ascertain and we are not familiar with that.  The supervisory and authorisation activities that have taken place in the Central Bank have been highlighted by Ms McMunn.  Of courses, we are interested in other policies.  We have a role in terms of providing our views publicly in respect of macro-economic stability and the importance of maintaining stable public finances to protect ourselves against any economic shocks that may be coming down the line.  Ensuring we can maintain flexibility for any additional public expenditure requirements that come down the line is particularly important.  We must also be aware of the potential shocks to the economy either via international financial markets or any volatility that may emerge in residential or commercial property markets.  In that regard, we have an important financial stability mandate and in terms of policy measures taken, have developed a comprehensive macro-prudential policy framework to reduce the risks of cyclical financial shocks occurring and to protect or enhance the resilience of the economy and financial sector against any shocks that may come down the line, including but not restricted to those related to Brexit.  I am not sure whether Dr. Fagan has anything to add.  </p></speech>

In terms of the special arrangements, I would add that, as Mr. Cassidy has highlighted, it is very important that both the European and UK authorities have signalled their recognition of the special nature of the problems facing Ireland so there is quite a lot of goodwill there and an awareness of the problems.  That is very welcome.  There may be scope to achieve some adjustments in terms of special programmes for Border areas and stuff like that - all sorts of arrangements that could be considered.  The goodwill seems to be there.</p>  <p>  In respect of the fiscal space, as Mr. Cassidy highlighted, despite the considerable improvements in the public finances we have seen since 2012, we are still in a fiscally vulnerable position.  The debt is high.  It may be flattered by a GDP number which is very large but when one uses a  more realistic measure, one can still see that the public finances in Ireland are relatively vulnerable to shocks so we should be very cautious in saying that because of Brexit, we need to relax in some sense in terms of the fiscal programme for the country.  That might be going in the wrong direction.  </p>  <p>  What the Central Bank has done has been raised.  It is important to state that we have increased considerably the amount of resources we have in the bank to deal with Brexit-related issues such as authorisations and are planning to increase them considerably.  The bank is an independent organisation so it does not need permission from the Government to increase its staff.  It does that in the context of its own board - the Central Bank Commission - which makes the decision.  That has been done.  The budget for 2017 envisages quite a significant Brexit-related increase in staff mainly in the area of supervision.  The basic point is that there will be no constraint caused by lack of resources in the Central Bank for financial firms to locate in Ireland if they wish to do so.  </p></speech>

There were a lot of questions and we could not necessarily address each question.  I am not sure that the specific point raised by the Senator Mulherin is within our area of competence.  That is more an EU legal issue.  It could be said, however, that there is a lot of goodwill towards Ireland and there is recognition that there are problems, as highlighted by the Senator, specifically affecting Ireland.  I believe there would be scope within the interaction with the EU to identify possible programmes that could alleviate those problems, but it is not really a matter for the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  With regard to what we have done, it is important to recognise that we are now part of a broader EU framework.  The regulation of banking supervision and the rules are all part of the single supervisory mechanism so we are not really in a position to change our rules.  It is not like the old days when we were fully detached from the rest of Europe and we could make our own rules.  Now we are part of a broader European framework so it is not possible to do that.</p>  <p>  On the issue of promotion, there is very little scope for any supervisory authority anywhere in the EU to attract business by changing or by adopting a lax regulation.  Regulation and supervision are now harmonised across the EU.  There are other dimensions by which countries can compete such as in taxation or promotion.  IDA Ireland is actively promoting Ireland as a location for financial services.  It is not right to say that because the Central Bank is no longer in this business that Ireland is not being promoted and that other countries are doing the same.  Countries cannot compete on the basis of supervision and regulation; we are now within a harmonised framework.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Garrett Murray, the department manager for policy and government relations and by Ms Anne Lanigan, the department manager in our Brexit co-ordination unit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports indigenous companies in every region of Ireland to start and scale their business, to innovate and to win business in international markets.  We focus on the manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, which are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.</p>  <p>  On 9 January 2017 Enterprise Ireland announced that the driving enterprise, delivering jobs strategy over the period of 2014-16 - our three year strategy period - 45,592 new jobs were created by our client companies.  This brings the total number of people employed by companies supported by Enterprise Ireland to 201,108.  This is an all-time high for the agency.  It is the first time we exceeded 200,000 jobs.  In 2016, which was the last year of that strategy a total of 19,244 new jobs-  full and part-time - in Enterprise Ireland supported businesses were created.  Almost two-thirds of these new jobs, 61%, were outside Dublin, and all regions recorded increases in employment.  This translates into a net increase of 9,117 jobs for 2016, taking account of job losses.</p>  <p>  The contribution of Enterprise Ireland client companies to the domestic economy is very important, particularly from a regional perspective, as it sustains over 300,000 direct and</p>  <p>  Exports to the UK as a proportion of our total client exports declined from 45% in 2005 - a decade ago - to 37% in 2015, as more of our client companies have diversified their export strategies into Northern Europe, the USA, China and the Gulf region.  We expect this trend to continue.  Supporting clients to diversify their exports while also growing exports in existing markets including the UK - our nearest market - has been a central pillar of Enterprise Ireland strategy for over a decade.  In 2015 there were 1,476 Enterprise Ireland client companies that recorded exports to the UK and between them these companies employ some 100,000 people.  This represents half of the total employment of Enterprise Ireland clients.  The sectoral breakdown of these 1,476 companies is as follows: food at 15%; ICT and international services at 40%; and industrial, life sciences and consumer at 45%.</p> <p>The sectoral breakdown of these 1,476 companies is as follows: food accounts for 15%; ICT and international services, 40%; and industrial, life sciences and consumer, 45%.  Irish exporters are significantly impacted by Brexit and over 600 of the 1,476 companies generate over 20% of their turnover from the UK market.</p> <p> It is expected that the UK will remain the largest market for Irish exporters in the short term.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus on supporting our clients to sustain and grow exports in the UK and in other established and high-growth markets will continue.</p> <p> In January this year, we published our strategy for the period 2017-20.  This strategy was specifically developed in the context of Brexit and focuses on supporting clients to both build scale and expand reach, in other words, to diversify.  The strategy sets ambitious targets out to 2020 including to sustain and grow jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies to in excess of 220,000 and &euro;26 billion in exports.  The objective is that at least a 50% growth in exports would be outside the UK.  We have set a target of increasing the annual total spend in the economy by Enterprise Ireland client companies of &euro;27 billion, as well as increasing their direct annual research and development spend by 50% to &euro;1.275 billion.</p> <p> The UK vote in June 2016 triggered a period of uncertainty for Irish business and this has continued.  The primary cause of uncertainty since then has been currency volatility.  However, in the medium term, the outcome of the negotiation process and the new trading structures that will exist thereafter may provide further challenges.</p> <p> The devaluation of sterling impacts differently on companies in different sectors in different ways; it is not uniform.  Some companies are hedged through their banks and others are naturally hedged, so Brexit impacts on all sectors in different ways.  What is clear is that the devaluation of sterling and any other impacts of Brexit will not be temporary and will require a strategic response from Irish exporters and from Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p> The challenge is significant in terms of exchange rate volatility.  We have been here before in 2009 when the euro and sterling were near parity.  Irish companies, while severely challenged during that period, took actions that assisted them to respond to the movement and overcame that challenge.</p> <p> Enterprise Ireland's focus in the immediate aftermath of the vote in June 2016 was to set up a helpline and directly reach out to our clients.  Since then we have taken many actions including working with clients company by company and sector by sector.  We have developed a new guide to exporting to the UK, and a webinar on currency volatility and hedging.  In addition, we have promoted global market opportunities in the media through our global ambition campaign.  We have prepared a guide to exporting to the UK, which will continue to be a very important market. </p> <p> We have published a revised schedule of trade and investment missions for the second half of 2016, which we implemented, and published a trade and investment mission schedule for this year involving over 145 trade missions and international trade events.</p> <p> We have worked closely with local enterprise offices through our Brexit and competitiveness units to support LEO clients.  We have worked through our parent Department and other Departments to ensure that any issues raised by our clients are highlighted in the policy system and are addressed.  In addition to many other actions undertaken, we have refined and promoted our own client offering to support client growth strategies.</p> <p> Enterprise Ireland has advised, and will continue to advise, our clients to prepare for a hard Brexit.  That is our advice, but if it is better than that, it will be great.  Companies are alert to the challenges posed by Brexit, but not all of them are taking action as yet.  Our focus continues to be on supporting companies on a one-to-one and on a sector-by-sector basis to enhance their competitiveness and capability and build on their success in existing and new markets.</p> <p> Enterprise Ireland is focusing on four strategic areas of action: innovation and research and development; competitiveness; financial management; and expanding reach, in other words, diversification.  We are working systematically with clients through our client engagement model to support their priorities and actions.  Our overseas offices will continue to work with clients in a range of market areas focused on winning business.  A focused eurozone strategy will be launched in the coming weeks.  On 31 March, Enterprise Ireland launched our Brexit SME scorecard, a new interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars, where they have not already done so.  Based on the answers those companies have supplied, the scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions.</p> <p> By completing the online questionnaire, the Brexit SME scorecard will provide companies with an assessment of their preparedness.  The tool is a starting point for SME management teams looking to develop an action plan to help mitigate risks and leverage opportunities which may arise from Brexit.  While the SME scorecard Is available to all companies, Enterprise Ireland client exporting companies that utilise the Brexit scorecard will then be able to engage with the agency&rsquo;s experts both domestically and through the overseas offices in global markets.  Enterprise Ireland will provide funding up to the value of &euro;5,000 to exporting clients to support the development of a business action plan.  Enterprise Ireland will work with those companies on a one-to-one basis to support the implementation of the plan.  The roll-out and marketing of this initiative is being complemented by a schedule of regional events.  Over 420 companies have already completed the Brexit scorecard.  </p> <p> Enterprise Ireland will continue to directly implement our strategy build scale and expand reach 2017-2020.  We will work closely with others, including other governmental and non-governmental bodies to support our clients to overcome the challenges of Brexit and build on their ambitious strategies to sustain and create jobs throughout Ireland.</p></speech>

Mr. Sherry referred to helping EI's clients to seek and target new markets.  What are the ideal target markets and where should the Irish economy be looking in order to expand post-Brexit, either through potential new EU trade deals or in markets where we have an existing footprint but where there is also more scope in which to develop?</p></speech>

In the past I have had dealings with Enterprise Ireland.  When it comes to exports, their criteria for SMEs are off-island and they do not tend to consider Northern Ireland.  A company with which I was involved did a lot of business in the North and has suffered a lot through currency exchanges.  However, when we knock on Enterprise Ireland's door it is not considered an export because it is not off the island.  In light of what Mr. Sherry has said, will he plan for the worst and hope for the best?  In planning for a hard Brexit, that is, the possible reintroduction of customs posts at the Border, would Enterprise Ireland have a strategy for supporting companies who do a lot of cross-Border business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400010#J00400"><p>I welcome our guests and agree with Mr. Sherry's strategy that it is good to prepare for a hard Brexit, while hoping that it will be otherwise.  We very much hope that it will be otherwise, but it is nonetheless important to prepare for the worst.  Coming from the Cavan-Monaghan region I am concerned about the implications of Brexit for a number of enterprises that Enterprise Ireland supports there.  The implications could be devastating.  I was reminded recently that Lakeland Dairies, a major milk processor in our area, sources quite an amount of milk North of the Border.  Were customs duties and tariffs to come into play, they would inevitably be forced to create a new plant North of the Border with a dislocation of jobs in the South and extra levies on farmers to support that plant.  If not, their suppliers would have to cope with customs duties and tariffs.  That is the kind of dilemma that is being presented in our area.</p>  <p>  I am interested in Mr. Sherry's figure that 225 companies or businesses with which Enterprise Ireland is involved are in the food sector.</p> <p>I suspect many are in the Border region.  Will Mr. Sherry comment on the number in the Border region?  Will he outline what sort of practical supports that Enterprise Ireland can continue offering?  What would he recommend to the Government in terms of support for these enterprises in the lead-up to Brexit and post Brexit?  The obvious direction is the expansion of markets, and one of Enterprise Ireland's objectives is to achieve a 50% growth in exports outside the United Kingdom.  I echo the question put by the Chairman.  Where does Enterprise Ireland see the best possible locations to achieve this growth?</p> <p> Is it the case that because of our fixation on business to China and it is a market with extraordinary potential, nobody questions the efficacy of that pursuit?  Taiwan has a population of 24 million and is a prosperous and growing economy.  We may be missing that market in our anxiety not to upset the Chinese.  I understand that may not be the case for other European countries who trade freely with Taiwan, still trade with China and have a gateway from Taiwan to China.  It is only one theatre of operations.  I would be interested to learn where Enterprise Ireland would site the expansion of our exports, particularly in the food sector.  I see the food sector taking the big hit in the Border region.</p> <p> A point I made to a colleague is that we will not be able to replace the jobs in the small food enterprises as it will be difficult to locate other jobs in the small towns and villages in which these enterprises are based.  This exacerbates the problem.</p> <p> Would Mr. Sherry comment on the currency and how sterling impacts on the mushroom industry?  The mushroom industry came under major threat from the sterling factor.  What specific efforts can be made for that industry?  Enterprise Ireland works sector by sector and company by company.  My experience as a public representative of making introductions and dealing with Enterprise Ireland and firms that are working with Enterprise Ireland is very positive.  I have heard nothing but good things.</p> <p> Research and development are critical to deploying exports elsewhere and to diversification.  Will Mr. Sherry expand on that and see how we can achieve more?</p></speech>

Their presentation is an excellent example of an organisation that is up and running and is ready to meet the challenges of Brexit.  I congratulate Enterprise Ireland on that.</p>  <p>  An issue I have raised with every group I have met during our meetings on this topic is the issue of a hard and soft Brexit.  It will be an extremely disorganised Brexit rather than hard or soft.  Some elements may be hard and others soft and some elements may take years to resolve.  That is a particular problem for me.</p>  <p>  I congratulate Enterprise Ireland on the scorecard.  Organisations working through Enterprise Ireland have a place to go to which will give them some indication of where they stand as they move forward.</p>  <p>  Does Enterprise Ireland have sufficient resources to provide all the supports it needs?  Is there anything it wants from Government or from the Oireachtas which would ease the work it is doing or support it in a better way?</p>  <p>  In respect of market diversification, the figures Enterprise Ireland has given for our reliance on the British market are generally macro figures.  When we get down to the micro level, Brexit may be fatal for some organisations.  A question that was put to me some time ago was the case of the small artisan or single product producer, such as a husband and wife team working on the production of cheese which they export to the United Kingdom only.  They do not have the resources to put a marketing organisation in place.  Does Enterprise Ireland see a need for a separate marketing group to provide marketing for small organisations that cannot provide for marketing?  I am not sure how it would work.</p>  <p>  At present because of the Border, we have raw materials coming from one part of the jurisdiction into another jurisdiction with some processing taking place and the product going across the Border to be completed.  That would seem to be a problem if tariffs were to apply on the way in and on the way out.  My constant plea is for solutions.  Has Enterprise Ireland a solution that we can offer to Michel Barnier and the various other negotiators that will help us overcome those types of problems?  We cannot have a situation where we are paying tariffs on both sides.  We also have the ridiculous situation where a farmer has cattle in Northern Ireland in the morning and in South in the afternoon.  That does not bear thinking about.</p>  <p>  I thank the witnesses.  Its presentation shows that Enterprise Ireland has its foot on the pedal and is working hard.  I congratulate it.  I am very pleased with it.</p></speech>

It is very clear our indigenous companies dealing with Enterprise Ireland are in a different situation from the foreign direct investment companies that are not going to have the same adverse impact arising from Brexit.  The indigenous sector is more highly dependent on the UK market and faces a significant fallout.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has described one of its strategic areas of action, namely, innovation and research and development.  I believe it is the case that there is more innovation, research and development in foreign direct investment companies than in indigenous companies.  I see that in a comparison of Irish indigenous companies with indigenous companies in other countries, we are falling behind in research and development.  Why is there not the same level of interest or activity in research and development?  Is it to do with cost?</p>  <p>  Does Enterprise Ireland match education and training needs of citizens with the needs of the companies it attracts to Ireland?  To what extent is Enterprise Ireland being asked to engage with educational institutions?  I am thinking in particular of the IT colleges where a recent study shows that the ambition is that there would be more of a correlation between the needs of business and the types of courses offered.  It also shows that the institutes of technology would be an integral part of economic growth for these companies.  Is this happening?</p>  <p>  Do the staff of Enterprise Ireland meet boards of management, governing bodies or departments in the colleges?  Is it pretty specific or is it a high level notion?  It is important to grow the institutes of technology and also to grow the businesses.</p>  <p>  How do the number of start-up enterprises in Ireland compare with those in other similar countries?  The view is that we are not seeing the same number of start-up businesses or entrepreneurship in our indigenous sector.</p>  <p>  I know that Enterprise Ireland has a drive to scale up companies, but there is also the problem that many Irish companies sell out once they get to a certain point.  If the business continues and grows, that is good and well, but if it sells out and goes somewhere else, that is not desirable.  What does Enterprise Ireland do to counter that?</p></speech>

Indeed, Senators Mark Daly and Joe O'Reilly have mentioned the possibility of special arrangements in respect of cross-Border trade.  If there is to be a special economic zone, either for Northern Ireland or for the whole island of Ireland, with special trading rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the United Kingdom as part of the imaginative and flexible Barnier proposals, who is thinking about that?  Is it the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  Is Enterprise Ireland involved in a dialogue on that?  Where in the Government is the thinking on that concept going on?  Is it in the Department of An Taoiseach?  Is Enterprise Ireland being consulted or being asked for input into the imaginative and flexible solutions that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and various other people were talking about in terms of dealing with the island as an economic unit or having special arrangements with the United Kingdom?  Who is actually working on that scenario or possibility?  Is Enterprise Ireland being fully consulted on such matters?</p></speech>

First, regarding what Senator Paul Daly said about not supporting companies who want to trade with the North, is Enterprise Ireland going to look at that issue?  In terms of proposals from Enterprise Ireland on imaginative solutions which the EU is seeking, has the organisation looked at replicating or seeking to replicate the trading arrangements between West and East Germany prior to reunification?  In that scenario, East Germany was treated, effectively, as a member of the European Community, without anybody formalising that.  Could that be used as a precedent for a trading arrangement between the North and the South of Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Sherry" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400012#L00300"><p>I thank the Senators for their questions.  I will start with the Chairman's question about ideal target markets.  Unfortunately, when we look at ideal target markets, it is somewhat complex in that we have to look at each individual sector and at individual companies to identify what might be the most appropriate growth markets.  Different sectors have different dynamics so we have been working on it sector by sector.  I mentioned that in 2015 exports to the UK grew by 12%.  While we have not finalised our figures for 2016, growth certainly will not be at that level.  The US grew in the same period by 27% and we would view the US as a very fertile and substantial opportunity for many companies in a range of areas including ICT, services, life sciences and medical devices.  There is less of an opportunity for food except in terms of non-perishables like infant milk formula.  It very much depends on the sector but we would certainly see the US as a substantial growth opportunity.</p>  <p>  Irish companies have benefited from substantial and continuous growth in the Asia-Pacific market.  We have seen substantial growth in China in the general area of food but particularly in the area of infant milk formula.  Ireland exports a lot of formula to that market, where the demand is very high and prices are strong.  We see substantial opportunities in that market for companies in the dairy area.  We have also seen growth in certain parts of the Gulf region, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, in areas where Irish companies have products and services that are in demand in those regions.  We are seeing growth in sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa in some sectors.  </p>  <p>  What we are doing is segmenting it, market by market, sector by sector.  We must look closer to home for some of the sectors that are more vulnerable.  One factor at play in that regard is the transportability of products.  There are particular product areas that are very vulnerable because they are highly exposed to the UK and are not easily transportable.  I am speaking here about areas like timber, construction products, pre-cast concrete and a whole range of other areas.  Those companies are facing different challenges because it is not as easy to go into alternative markets.  What we are doing for such companies is focusing very strongly on improving their competitiveness and also looking at investing in research and development to enable them to move up the value chain, in the sense of getting into areas of premium product where they can differentiate themselves.  That is possible but it takes time and investment for companies.</p>  <p>  There are substantial market opportunities for many companies.  Some companies will be able to take their existing products and services and transport them into other markets.  However, in many or even most cases companies will need to invest in modifying the product or service in order to make it suitable for the particular characteristics of the new market.  In other cases, unfortunately, given the transportability of the products and their nature, opportunities in more distant markets, such as the US, the Gulf and Asia-Pacific regions, will be more limited.</p>  <p>  Senator Craughwell asked if Enterprise Ireland has the resources it needs.  Enterprise Ireland has been allocated an additional &euro;30 million in the current year towards the activities it is undertaking, principally in the area of supporting companies in response to Brexit.  We got an allocation of an additional 39 posts for which we are currently actively recruiting and we are bringing people on board specifically for that agenda.  Obviously, we are in continual discussion with our parent Department about the deployment and optimisation of our resources.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Garret Murray, to elaborate on that point.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a currency benefit there and less of a risk and there is a very significant focus on that aspect.  We have gone through it, company by company, sector by sector, to determine how we can maximise impact.  In terms of resources in general, we asked for 39 posts and got them.  In fairness, there was a dialogue involved and we had to outline what we needed the posts for and where the resources would go.  What is important is that we are preparing competitiveness here before companies go overseas as well as supporting them within the market.</p>  <p>  In terms of innovation, two of the new posts are related to Horizon 2020 and how we can maximise the European money that is available and link our SMEs into that innovation base to try to increase their innovative capacity.  It is absolutely critical, in terms of product development, to focus on research and development.  That is about Enterprise Ireland, as well as the companies, making it simpler for companies to apply for research and development funding and to understand it better.  We have a significant focus on that area.  We are looking at how our products can be marketed to our clients to make it easier for them to apply.</p></speech>

Our research and development committee sat this morning and looked at a plethora of SMEs who are looking for research and development funding that would already have been approved.  Many of these are companies that are moving in a new direction and going from a service to a product or looking at new markets.  It is key to our agenda and how we sell that to our clients is important.  Brexit has made companies realise the importance of innovation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2827" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Sherry" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400012#L00700"><p>Just to expand on the research and development issue, we set ourselves a target of increasing by 50% the spend of companies on research and development.  We have also repositioned our own offering to make it as simple as possible for companies to engage and to try to leverage to the maximum extent the investment that is being made in basic and applied research so that companies can access technology and investment in research that is being undertaken in the institutes of technology and universities.  In that regard, one of the supports we provide is the innovation vouchers scheme where vouchers are, effectively, cashable with the institutes of technology to leverage the skills that are available.  That is a widely used scheme and is part of our step-by-step approach to encouraging companies to go down that route.  It is particularly aimed at those early-stage SMEs that do not have the same level of resources as larger companies.</p> <p>We are heavily engaged with the institutes of technology on the specific needs of companies and are working closely with them in the area of skills.  A good example of that is in Limerick where we are working with the colleges on the availability of engineering skills.  There is close collaboration on the available flow of skills.  The collaboration between employers in the region is highly connected with the colleges there so that suitable graduates who are readily employable emerge from those colleges.  It is a key agenda for us.</p></speech>

It is part of the agenda of our local regional offices and the regional director in engaging with the institutes of technology and the universities in the region.  It is a key part of the regional action plan for jobs and the regional action agendas that the skill requirements of companies in the region are addressed by colleges in the region.  In certain areas such as ICT, there is a global shortage so competition in the area is fierce.  It is a question of having to increase the overall supply.</p></speech>

On a strategic level, there is an enormous amount being done with education and probably more than I have ever seen in my time in the agencies, particularly on the national skills fora.  On a regional level, they have brought the agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and others - and our regional representatives, the colleges and, most importantly, the companies together.  It is not just us going into the colleges saying we need X, Y and Z in the region; it is building the relationship between the companies and the colleges so they are listening to each other.  We take the view that in the past the colleges have listened a bit more to FDI companies because they are larger in many cases.  We are trying to shift that relationship.</p>  <p>  On Senator Craughwell's point about funding for the ITs, the HEA is currently doing its review of funding for the higher education sector.  In our submission to that, we will be saying the importance of the ITs in terms of research is critical for SMEs.  That is not to say it is not important for universities but we want to strengthen the relationship with the local ITs.  The regional skills fora have worked quite successfully in this regard and we are fairly happy with the structures.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland has focused on supporting internationally focused start-ups.  Last year, in terms of spin-outs in third level institutions, we had the highest level of new start-ups so we are very pleased about that.  In that area, we focus on specific sources of start-ups and work with them to try to increase the number in that area and also the number that achieve scale.  A good example of that is in the female entrepreneurship area.  If one goes back five years, about 7% of the high potential start-ups we supported were led by female entrepreneurs.  Last year, it was closer to 28%.  Internationally the figure in the ICT area is typically around 8%.  We have much more to do but we have seen that when we take specific initiatives and specifically focus on an area, we get a result.</p>  <p>  We are also seeing an increase in the number of start-ups led by entrepreneurs coming from outside of Ireland into Ireland to start their business.  We have a specific focus on encouraging entrepreneurs from regions outside Ireland to look at Ireland as a location.  When entrepreneurs are starting a business, increasingly they can make decisions on locations.  Even if they are from Ireland, there is a decision on whether they will start the business in Ireland or look at other international locations.  There is a constant challenge to these companies staying Irish and scaling their business.  The availability of development capital is a key factor in that regard.  If there is strong availability of development capital and venture capital in Ireland, there is a better chance that those companies will stay and grow a scale as indigenous Irish companies.  We are particularly focused on ensuring its availability and encouraging international VCs to partner with funds that Enterprise Ireland is involved in supporting in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will address the implications of Brexit for the food sector.  Senator Reilly raised the question of the Border region and mentioned Lakeland Dairies.  There is no doubt the food sector is an area that potentially will be particularly impacted by Brexit and the outcome of the discussion on tariffs and cross-Border trade.  If we look at the 600 most vulnerable companies, the Border region accounts for a little under 100 of those companies, which between them employ a little over 10,500 people.  The food sector is an important sector within that.  I mentioned China earlier and companies in the dairy industry are looking to produce high value products such as baby and infant formula and being able to look at other markets.  If one takes a company like Lakeland Dairies, in terms of logistics the number of cross-Border shipments even on a weekly basis is substantial.  We are very concerned about tariffs or associated additional costs involved in the logistics and trade associated with it.  When I talk about working sector by sector, it is something we have been discussing with our parent Departments and with Bord Bia which has also worked with us on the food sector.  </p>  <p>  I will address the question Senator Daly asked about Northern Ireland.  We regard it as on-island trade.  Our focus with companies at the moment is to assist them to prepare for international markets.  As it stands, our approach is to prepare for a hard Brexit.  On-island cross-Border trade would face significant additional challenges to what it is currently facing.  In terms of support for those types of companies, we are working intensively with companies involved in cross-Border trade but which are not exporting much beyond those shores.  We have an agenda with many of those companies to encourage them to look at additional markets.  It is part of our issue. </p>  <p>  On the sterling issue, Senator Reilly mentioned mushrooms.  It is a particular area that was first impacted.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Murray, to comment on it.</p></speech>

We put a lot of focus on applying our expertise on Lean.  We brought a cohort of mushroom companies together, provided them with a Lean grant to work with Bord Bia to try to improve their competitiveness.  That is what we have been able to do with them.  Bord Bia had been working separately with them in terms of new markets and development.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland's approach to this has been that any sort of barriers that exist in trade and freedom of trade is not good for our client companies.  We see that as an issue.  Ideally, we would like the current position to pertain, but that is not the case.  We have fed strongly into our own parent Department and to other Government Departments that are looking at this issue.  We have also seconded one of our own colleagues to the Department of Taoiseach to specifically focus on the sectors we feel there is strong vulnerability in terms of Enterprise Ireland client companies.</p> <p>We are working across Government in terms of the inputs to that agenda.  My colleague, Mr. Garrett Murray, may want to contribute further on that.</p></speech>

We put forward the point that the nearest to the <i>status quo</i>is what we are looking for.  It is for policy makers in Government to decide how they are going to position that from a negotiation perspective but that is certainly what our clients and companies are looking for.  When one goes through different areas of the negotiations, different sectors will have different priorities.  Our priority will be to make sure that the policy system is aware of those as they emerge when contingencies are being discussed.</p></speech>

One challenge we see in the marketplace at the moment, undoubtedly in the food area, is that companies supplying into the UK multiples are seeing an increased move towards initiatives such as Red Tractor, which is about buying British.  We have seen this in the beef sector and in some other areas.  Some of the options the companies in the food area must consider - we are in discussion with Bord Bia on this - include the question of whether they can look at other verticals, such as the food service areas, as opposed to the retail side.  When one considers the beef area, which is very different from the artisan area, &euro;1 billion of the &euro;7.5 billion sales to the UK is in beef.  Were the WTO tariffs to apply to beef, Irish beef producers would face a big challenge.  The question of what ultimately emerges in respect of tariffs is a huge factor.  We must bear in mind that the UK is a big net importer of food in its requirement and need for food.  As Ireland produces enough food to feed a population of around 30 million and is a big net exporter of food, these factors are at play.  There is a need to help artisan food producers and those companies that can produce premium products to look at other European markets and to look at channels other than retail.</p>  <p>  Senator O'Reilly referred to Taiwan and the opportunities in China and the Asia region.  Enterprise Ireland has three offices in China; Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.  We currently service the Taiwanese market from our office in Hong Kong.  With regard to the scale of the Taiwanese market, we also have a pathfinder.  This is a trade consultant who works specifically with us in accessing that market.  We cover a number of the smaller markets from those offices.  We are very focused on working company by company and sector by sector.  We have companies who are exporting into Taiwan and we would see opportunities in that area.  It is not yet at a scale that would justify Enterprise Ireland opening a separate office in Taiwan.  We keep that situation under constant review but we are driven by matching the opportunity in the market with the capability of our client companies.  Where we identify opportunities, we will work with them to go after those opportunities, not just by diversifying out or lessening the dependence on the UK, but also in looking at the opportunities that are there for growth in the long term.</p>  <p>  I do not know if this has answered most of the questions but I will ask my colleague, Ms Anne Lanigan, to speak on the work we are doing on some regional initiatives and roadshows that are running now - we had one in Cork yesterday - and what is coming out of those initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2842" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Lanigan" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400014#N00600"><p>The focus with our clients currently is to encourage them to prepare as much as they can for Brexit.  There is a sense that there is a lot of uncertainty and we are not sure what is going to happen, so there is a risk that companies will not take action.  We are very much encouraging them to prepare, and to prepare for a hard Brexit.  That has been the objective behind the scorecard.  We have a regional roadshow that we started in Cork yesterday.  We will go to Waterford, Monaghan, Galway and Limerick over the next month to encourage companies to see what their peers are doing.  We bring in clients who we have seen reacting to Brexit in the right way by putting measures in place.  That is a real focus for us.  The scorecard is available to all companies and it is not just for Enterprise Ireland clients.  We have a grant that is specific to our client base but the scorecard is available to all.  I encourage all members to use it as anyone can do so; one just needs to log in and create a password.  It is worth doing to understand the different areas of exposure for businesses.  There has been a lot of focus on the currency, which has settled at 85p to the euro at the moment.  Many of our companies say they can cope with that rate but we need to get them to look beyond that and into the other areas where they may be exposed, for example, if there was a downturn in the UK economy or an issue affecting their supply chains.  There is much talk about the North-South issues, which are very important to us, but there is also the east-west aspect and the custom and barriers we expect to come in to play there.  These are all part of what we call the nine areas of exposure.  We focus on those areas and try to translate them into what it will mean for each of our companies.</p></speech>

As members know, IBEC is the country&rsquo;s largest business organisation and the voice of Irish business on a domestic, European and international level.  We are working to support member companies across the country and in all sectors as they manage the immediate risks of Brexit and plan for disruption into the future.</p>  <p>  The IBEC approach to Brexit is threefold.  We are working at a domestic level to ensure the Government and relevant State agencies respond swiftly and decisively to support businesses during this period of uncertainty.  We need to take immediate action in areas under our control.  IBEC has set out its key proposals in a position paper which I have forwarded to the committee.  We are working at a national, UK and EU level to ensure Irish interests are protected in the exit negotiations and in the new trading relationship that the UK will have to forge with Europe.  Business comes with new ideas and a constructive approach and IBEC will be setting out detailed proposals over the coming weeks.  We are working to support member companies as they navigate the challenges of Brexit.  A new IBEC guide to Brexit looks at the potential impact on key sectors, as well as at how Brexit may affect currency transactions, supply chains, contracts, financing and the labour force, among other issues.  I have sent a digital copy to the committee and have brought hard copies with me. </p>  <p>  Preliminary estimates show that the economy grew by 5.2% last year, making Ireland the fastest growing country in the EU for the third year in a row.  While growth is very strong, certain components showed some worrying trends as growth in both consumer spending and exports slowed compared with previous years.  In 2016, export growth slowed to 2.4%, the joint lowest growth rate since 2008.  Growth in goods exports was slightly higher at 4.6%.  This was driven by strong growth in exports of electrical equipment and chemicals.  As a large proportion of these goods are exported to the US, the strong dollar was a factor.  Overall exports excluding these two sectors fell by 4.6% year on year, revealing a weakening for the indigenous export sectors.  Goods exports to the UK fell by 3.4% last year mainly as a result of the weak position of sterling.  Food exports, of which 44% go to the UK, fell substantially, down 5.2% on the previous year.  The weakness in sterling faded a little toward the end of last year.  This has given a welcome break to some exporters but there is likely to be further volatility as the year progresses.</p>  <p>  Of course, there are potentially bigger challenges ahead.  Unless there is a major rethink on the part of the UK, some form of customs border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, and between Ireland and Britain, seems unavoidable.  This presents the potential for major economic disruption along with massive logistical headaches.  In a worst-case scenario, under current World Trade Organization rules, some meat cuts would attract over 50% tariffs, with dairy tariffs of more than 30%.  Although Irish indigenous exporters, two thirds of which are in the food sector, make up just 10% of our exports, they employ more and spend more in the domestic economy than the entire multinational sector.  While our reaction has been to promote market diversification, this takes time and is expensive and difficult.  It is cheaper to find a new plant than a new market.  Little attention has been paid so far to the prospect of Irish food companies moving operations to the UK to avoid tariffs.</p>  <p>  What, then, can we do?  In the first instance, we must focus on what is within our control.  This includes introducing targeted aid for affected companies.  To achieve this, we will need the support of our European partners.  European fiscal and state aid rules must not become a hindrance to our efforts.  An intense focus on cost competitiveness is also required.  Brexit will increase the competitive pressures on many businesses.  We need to avoid runaway increases in labour costs and to take strategic decisions which could avoid increasing energy, regulatory and insurance costs.  As we look to the medium term, and some of the opportunities which may come our way, we need to ramp up public investment far beyond current plans and put in place the quality transport network, education system and housing needed to attract new investment and compete in a post-Brexit world.  The regions that are most exposed need particular attention.  My colleague Mr. Gerard Brady from the IBEC economics team will be happy to talk through some of the specifics in more detail.</p>  <p>  As negotiations begin, Ireland must continue to play a central, collaborative and constructive role in what we can already see will be a fraught process.  It is critical that the UK retains as close a relationship as possible to the EU.  We need to support these efforts in negotiations.  The political settlement in the North must be afforded special attention, along with a continued commitment to the development of the all-island economy.  The common travel area between the UK and Ireland must be preserved.  The EU-UK divorce bill debate is a minor distraction in economic terms compared with what is ultimately at stake.  It is vital that rapid progress is made on exit arrangements in order that meaningful trade talks can begin.  Unfortunately, a massive and dangerous gap exists between current UK objectives and what is realistically possible within the parameters of the EU guidelines.  It is vital that the shared economic interests of the EU and the UK begin to inform the mood and timetable of negotiations.  A far-reaching free trade deal with minimal trade barriers is the goal, while fair competition must, of course, also underpin any new relationship.  I thank the members for their time and we look forward to answering any questions.</p></speech>

We will come back to him and Mr. Brady during the questions and answers sessions.  I will now move straight on to Ms Patricia Callan, director of the Small Firms Association.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400015#O00400"><p>I thank the Senators for the opportunity to be here today.  The Small Firms Association represents companies that employ fewer than 50 people, which make up 98% of the 238,000 businesses in the country.</p> <p>We account for half of the jobs and one third of the value of the total Irish economy.</p> <p> The UK is a key marketplace.  It is essentially where all small companies have traditionally learned how to export - same language, same culture, many of the same tastes - and this requires a dramatic change from them going forward.  Those in the marketplace are already dealing with the fallout of Brexit, even before it has happened.  As the committee has already heard from Enterprise Ireland, there is a real push now to look at diversification and in trying to move into new markets.  However, taste, for example, in the food sector, is one of the key considerations and that may not be possible.  Companies are going to have look at other, more dramatic options.</p> <p> I would also flag at the outset that despite the fact that the main focus is on export at this stage, only 6.4% of all exports are accounted for by small firms because most businesses and most jobs are in the domestic economy.  In our discussions around this, we need to have an eye to what might be the impact for those businesses.  My real concern is those businesses think that they are immune to this because they are not in the front line.  There is an exercise about trying to get people to start planning and thinking within and outside supply chains of what could be the knock-on implications.  For example, tourism will be directly impacted, as will the retail spend and sectors such as the hospitality sector.  Moreover, I would say simply that when the UK economy is doing well Ireland is doing well.  Therefore, the biggest issue is that if the UK ends up in recession then we will have to move dramatically here in terms of trying to prepare our own economy to withstand that.</p> <p> In the statement I submitted, I have shared data from the surveys we conduct six-monthly.  This one is from November last.  We will be conducting one shortly and I will certainly forward the current data on to the committee because I know it will be continuing to meet.  In November last, 41% of our members stated that this already had a negative impact on them, with 68% expecting it to be more negative in the next six months.  Only a minority of 10% of our businesses felt that it would be positive in any way whatsoever.</p> <p> In real terms, the biggest implication we have seen is that one-in-two businesses immediately postponed investment decisions.  Some are firing ahead going into the market but others simply stated that they needed to wait and see, that this is too uncertain.  Some 37% stated it already had a negative impact on their sales in the UK, but the most surprising finding, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, was that 30% of businesses stated they had lost share here at home, with retailers substituting cheaper imports from the UK onto retail shelves here.  Before Christmas, we ran a campaign with Love Irish Food that was all about trying to create this whole sense of buying Irish because that will be critically important.</p> <p> Another change that we have seen, also in their supply change, is that people have started to move to source more raw materials from the UK to act as a natural hedge against the exchange rate and that is having an impact further down the line.  We have also seen a minority of 4% make plans to move operations fully or partially out of Ireland and into the UK because it is their biggest market and it makes sense for them to do so.  We are beginning to see a trickle effect on employment.  Some companies have had to move to redundancies but more have had to move to short term and lay-off, as they have had to drop orders into the UK market.</p> <p> In terms of the most significant challenges, the exchange rate volatility has been the biggest impact.  Only 15% of the small companies would use financial hedging products and they were completely exposed.  Nobody expected this to happen.  The investment confidence piece is the second challenge.  That is why we are seeing a lag in the national growth figures compared to where we would have expected to be.</p> <p> Finally, companies very much want us to focus on cost and tax competitiveness, going back to this idea of issues that are in the locus of our own control.  In much of what is happening, we are one of 27, we are on the negotiating team - to be fair, we have enjoyed a lot of success in our positioning to date - but we need to be getting match ready in terms of preparing ourselves for what lies ahead.</p> <p> In my submission, there is a testimonial from a member that is a food company in the midlands.  They outline that in their business, which is a low margin business of 3% to 5%, when the exchange rate moved against it, by 11%, 20% or 24% at various times, this meant simply that they had to drop over &euro;3 million in orders and that had an impact on their job times.  So far, in reality, the Government has not moved at all to help those sorts of businesses.  We have talked about it a lot.  What I would like to say today is that we need to be moving to action the aid package.  We have certainly seen good initiatives for raw agriculture, but not into prepared consumer foods and into the broader business community.  I will leave the committee to read that statement in its own time.</p> <p> In terms of the priority actions, as I stated, we need to move now.  My concern is that we are more uncompetitive at this time than we may necessarily be post Brexit.  Once Britain is outside the market one would assume it will become more negative for it whereas at present it has an exchange rate that is in its favour, it has already a very attractive tax package for entrepreneurs and for personal tax compared to what we have here, and its cost base is much lower.  We need to ensure that our businesses can survive during these two years.</p> <p> Critically, we also need to keep lobbying the EU to introduce temporary state aid rules, as it did in 2009.  We met the EU Commissioners and raised this, and their attitude is that was a financial crisis that affected everyone.  This is a crisis of equal scale for our country and they need to accept that.  We are beginning to hear that they might be considering it a bit more than they would have.</p> <p> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been working on low-cost finance measures for six months.  We expected an announcement early in January.  We have seen nothing.  We need to see those measures out in the marketplace.  We need to see specific export trade finance, which is available in most countries but not here, come back as a product too.</p> <p> The work Enterprise Ireland is doing has been good and it has taken the right approach.  However, we must remember that it represents only a small portion of the exporters.  Many of our members are not Enterprise Ireland clients.  What struck me with all of the new announcements, the new Brexit tool and the associated funding to do a Brexit plan, is that these are only available to Enterprise Ireland clients.  We need to stop having these demarcation lines and to think that all affected businesses need these type of supports.  If they are exporting, they should be entitled to it regardless of their client status.</p> <p> As I mentioned already, a public awareness campaign to raise conceptually the issue of buying Irish is important.  In the context of the move to online trading, the committee may be aware that we have an online trading voucher scheme for micro-enterprises - companies with fewer than ten employees - and we would argue the category needs to be raised up to 50 employees.  We need to allow all businesses - retailers are on the sharp end of this - to gain a web presence to understand that market.  With such practical measures that are already in place, it is simply about investing more funding and ramping up the delivery of them.</p> <p> We have already been working closely over the past number of months.  In terms of the negotiating teams in the UK and the EU, there has been good recognition of Ireland's issues, including the land border with the UK and the issues around customs - physically, getting one's product around the place.  The freedom of movement of people is also viewed as critical.  Our common travel area has to be protected at all cost; it is the top priority for SFA members in that more strategic longer-term frame.</p> <p> We need to focus on cost competitiveness.  That goes back to labour costs, the minimum wage, joint labour committees and public sector pay deals, all of which have knock-on implications in the private sector.  Other committees of the Houses are working on insurance, where we have seen increases of over 33% in the cost of motor insurance.  If one looks at issues such as the commercial rates review that is causing havoc around the country and the 2% differential in aid, through to public sector pay, all of these issues act against our companies and are issues the Government can move and act on.  I encourage the committee to tackle them.</p> <p> I repeat my plea to Brexit-proof budget 2018.  That involves man-marking the UK in terms of what it is offering already.  Post Brexit they will probably become even more attractive.  If we do not have a CGT entrepreneur's rate of 10% up to, as they have, &pound;10 million - our limit is &euro;1 million - and if I am deciding today to set up a software company, would I set up here or would I go to the UK?  We must start thinking about how to make it more attractive for people to set up in business.</p> <p> Clearly we advocate a soft Brexit, trying to keep Britain as close to us as possible, and in the Single Market and customs union.  Equally, strategically we need to be planning about our future and working with other European countries in terms of gaining new allies.  We have been on the coat-tails of the EU on many issues, in particular, on regulatory issues.  We, as an organisation, and the Government will have to step up to that into the future.</p> <p> I thank the  members of the committee for their attention and I am happy to discuss matters they may wish to raise.</p></speech>

I have 30 years' experience in the agrifood business and I was commissioned by the alcohol beverage federation to look at the impact of Brexit on the industry.  I produced a report which has been shared with this committee.  I am joined today by Mr. Ross Mac Math&uacute;na, director of ABFI, who will answer questions.</p>  <p>  The following is our view and what comes out of an analysis of Brexit.</p> <p>When we look at all the elements of our trade with the UK, especially for food and drink products, what we have is a cumulative &euro;12 billion trade.  That is made up of &euro;4.5 billion worth of product that goes from Ireland to the UK in the food and drink sector and &euro;3.5 billion worth of imports.  There is also a significant cross-border trade and tourism contribution.  If &euro;7 billion was spent last year by tourists in Ireland, 40% of those tourists came from the sterling area.  Therefore, it is clear that trade relations and currency exchange rates between the UK and ourselves have a dramatic impact.  Since the Brexit vote in June, all of those impacts have been against Irish business on the export and import sides in terms of cost comparisons.</p> <p> The drinks industry produces, brews, distils and distributes products throughout Ireland.  The concerns with Brexit relate to competitiveness and ongoing access.  As mentioned previously, there is extensive access to the UK market.  The reality is that all Irish products going to Europe go through the UK market.  That is an ongoing issue.</p> <p> One of the major challenges facing the sector has been illustrated by the short-term impact of sterling.  I am referring to cost competitiveness.  In that context, we believe there needs to be a major focus on the cost of doing business in Ireland, including the way we tax business, the way we tax consumption and elements of regulation that are currently being looked at.  In that context, two key issues jump out for the drinks sector.  One is excise duty.  At the moment, Ireland has the highest priced alcohol in the European Union.  We have the second or third highest rate of excise.  We know from 2008 and 2009, when sterling weakened significantly, that we can get significant cross-border trade.  This draws more than simply alcohol consumption out of our market.  It draws considerable consumption throughout the grocery sector and takes out badly needed income.  Therefore, we need to be pragmatic and competitive with regard to our excise tax.  We need to look at a situation whereby that is not sustainable.  A tax that is so high that it is ignored is not worth being a tax.</p> <p> The second element of these costs is the cost of doing business here, especially the cost of regulation as it comes from the proposed public health (alcohol) Bill.  Many of the measures in that Bill will ultimately put up costs in Ireland without having in any way established on an evidential basis that they will have an impact on the consumption or abuse of alcohol.  We need to be pragmatic at a time when we are trying to support jobs throughout the economy, especially jobs in the rural economy.  We need to ensure that we are not committing own goals in respect of aspects that would put up costs.</p> <p> In addition to the remarks on excise, I wish to point out that, as part of the public health (alcohol) Bill, the proposals on minimum unit pricing would further put up alcohol prices here.  I realise it has been clearly stated that these will only be introduced here if they are introduced across the Border.  Again, with the restrictions on advertising and some of the other aspects of the proposed Bill, what we are getting is a situation whereby the cost of either continuing to do business by companies in the South or the cost of new entrants to the business here will become very high for small companies seeking to get involved in the business.</p> <p> In recent years, there has been an increased interest in growing the drinks sector in Ireland.  We are fortunate that the large companies in the sector have invested significantly.  A total of &euro;400 million has been invested in the brewing and distilling sector in the past five years.  That began even before the economic recovery.  Those investments have deep rural roots in Ireland not only in terms of the pubs and tourism they support, but in terms of the ingredients bought in the economy.</p> <p> There is a renewed view that whiskey distilling and micro-brewing have become growth areas.  We have plans to increase the numbers of whiskey distilleries to approximately 20 in the coming five years.  As well as increasing business operations in the community, these enterprises have an ongoing tourism impact.  We know that 650,000 whiskey tourists visited Ireland last year.  That number will grow to 1.5 million by 2024.</p> <p> I will conclude by echoing elements of what has been said previously.  There are clear issues around the support of industry that need to be looked at in the context of state aid.  The philosophy and ideology behind state aid rules is that the Single Market is operating.  The exit of the UK is a fracture of the Single Market.  To apply constraints on state aid rules when the market is fractured simply does not make sense.  Unfortunately, we have seen a sluggish rate of recovery by Europe from the recent 2008 and 2009 recession because of a fixation on an ideology around the restriction of state aid support.  It only leads to recession and austerity.  It is important that the background to these controls is examined and that a case is made to recognise the reality.  It is important to deliver on the fact that whatever about the motives and origin of the decision of the UK to leave the European Union, Irish taxpayers and consumers should not become worse off because the United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union.  In that context and in order to strengthen our case that state aid should be examined, we really should look at the prices, costs, taxes and regulations that are within our control.  That means looking clinically at excise and the public health (alcohol) Bill.</p></speech>

I believe these hearings are important.  Insurance Ireland is available to support the work of the committee in any way that it can.</p>  <p>  By way of background, I am keen to give the committee an overview of who we are and what we do.  We are the representative body for the insurance industry.  We have over 140 member companies throughout all classes of insurance, reinsurance and captive management.  I will set out some figures to give the committee an impression of the scale of the industry.  Total industry employment is approximately 28,000 people, made up of those employed directly and indirectly.  Insurance Ireland members pay out more than &euro;13 billion in claims and benefits to Irish consumers each year.  Gross premium income for our membership was &euro;51 billion in 2015.  The industry holds &euro;200 billion in assets under management, with &euro;35 billion invested in Irish infrastructure or Government debt.  We pay &euro;1.8 billion in tax and one in four jobs in financial services are in insurance.</p>  <p>  Our members take on the risks of individuals, households and businesses and are involved in almost every aspect of economic activity in the country.  Under the umbrella of insurance, products range from international insurance to reinsurance, health, protection products and pensions.  These sectors need regulatory staff, underwriters, loss adjustors and sales staff among others.  The breadth and depth of the industry is considerable.  As an industry based on risk management, we are accustomed to dealing with changing circumstances, but Brexit is a unique challenge.</p>  <p>  Insurance is a global business and within Europe it has developed for providers in the Single Market.  This means we have companies with operations in many countries serving different markets.  Ireland has benefited greatly from the market and has developed into an international insurance hub.  Also, given our proximity to the UK, we complement and compete with the UK market.  Given this interconnectedness there are two distinctive sides to the coin for us.  The first is the potential upside.  We are ambitious for the sector and want to maximise the potential inward investment from companies looking for a base to maintain European market access.  However, there are potential down-sides too.  As well as the threats to the domestic economy, a substantial proportion of our membership export to the UK.  They require access to the UK market on existing terms in the same way as the agrifood sector and others.</p>  <p>  Therefore, Brexit must be seen in the context of keeping existing jobs as much as it is seen as gaining new ones.  Winning new investments is the key to keeping existing jobs since we are in a competitive international market and the credibility and attractiveness of a location is determined by the players in the market.</p> <p>In addition, any Brexit-related impact on the domestic economy will have an impact on spending and potentially the purchase of discretionary insurance products with the risk that households and businesses take on risks that could materialise and result in severe financial hardship.</p> <p> We surveyed parts of our membership on two occasions in recent months on Brexit.  In December, we surveyed our independent non-executive directors, INEDs, who are an important constituency with a broad industry perspective.  At the time, 75% saw more opportunities than challenges arising from Brexit.  In March, we surveyed the chief executive officers, CEOs, and chief risk officers, CROs, of our member companies and found a change in outlook.  A total of 45% of our CEOs and CROs saw more opportunities and 55% saw more challenges arising from Brexit.  Admittedly, these are different groups but it was a clear change in outlook.  We also asked our CEOs and CROs about a potential "Brexit dividend" for Dublin and to rate the key priorities to realise this.  The response in order of priority was addressing the regulatory considerations, infrastructural bottlenecks, personal taxation, availability of talent, and competitiveness issues.  This should not be read as a wish list from the industry, but it does point to areas we need to consider for insurance but also for many other sectors.</p> <p> I refer to one of these issues, in particular, which is regulation, and how we can develop a proposal to protect and grow the sector here.  The European goal has been to create a single market for insurance subject to adherence to certain criteria such as standardisation of solvency ratios.  The directive covering this is Solvency II.  This is a directive in European law that codifies and harmonises EU insurance regulation.  Primarily, this concerns the amount of capital that EU insurance companies must hold to reduce the risk of insolvency.  The regulatory regime is administered by national supervisory authorities and there is an element of national interpretation of standards, which is allowed.  The development and implementation of Solvency II took approximately 20 years and came at a cost of &euro;4 billion to implement across Europe and approximately &euro;150 million in Ireland.  Using Solvency II as a guideline, we are reiterating a proposal we made last year for two regulatory reforms which we believe would have a significant impact in terms of managing the downside and maximising the upside.</p> <p> The first is grandfathering.  This is where there is approval in principle for insurance undertakings that are regulated in other jurisdictions.  For example, if the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority, PRA, licenses an existing company and it has a good record, then this should be a credit in the approval process and the Central Bank of Ireland should say it will allow the entity to trade on a similar basis to the circumstances in the UK.  In short, this is an approval in principle approach based on the good standing of an equivalent regulatory authority.  The second is a regulatory corridor.  This is a joint grandfathering arrangement between the UK and Ireland.  There is a desire for such an arrangement within the UK.  This would allow for rapid approval of Irish entities who are seeking to export their services to the UK.</p> <p> Brexit is a set of circumstances characterised by volatility and uncertainty.  These proposals can provide reassurance to the domestic industry and facilitate new entrants in a manner that supports the UK and EU insurance markets.  Solvency II is a robust regulatory system - I refer to the stress tests published in December 2016 to illustrate this - and Ireland should exploit this to its advantage.  The proposals outlined above are in line with Solvency II and would allow us to realise the potential in our industry.  They are also within our control, can be deployed quickly and would add to our standing as an enterprise-friendly destination within the EU.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2859" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McGrane" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400018#R00300"><p>On behalf of the board and members of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, I thank the committee for inviting my colleagues and I to make a presentation.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce is the only organisation focused exclusively on the trade between Ireland and the UK, championing it, protecting it from being undermined and increasing its current value of more than &euro;60 billion per annum and the 400,000 jobs which that sustains directly and many more indirectly.  We respect the will of the UK people to leave the EU but a bad outcome for the UK in its future trade relationship with the EU would also be a bad outcome for Ireland and because of the extent of our connectedness economically, culturally and otherwise, we have much with which to concern ourselves.</p>  <p>  Brexit has rightly been described by Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the most important challenge faced by the island of Ireland in modern times.  While Brexit is about more than the economy, I appreciate that the committee's focus today is on economic challenges and on seeking potential solutions and, therefore, I will confine my remarks to that context.  The UK is Ireland's largest two-way trading partner not just for our exports, but even more so for our imports.  It is not often highlighted, because no other organisation speaks to the business of importers, that while the UK accounts for about 16% of our exports - this figure increases to 50% for indigenous firms - we also depend on the UK as the source of approximately 33% of our imports, and as a relatively small island economy without the UK's heavy industrial manufacturing tradition, we need those imports to keep our own economy running efficiently and competitively and to sustain thousands of jobs in such as retailing, packaging, medical devices, clothing, food processing and many more sectors.</p>  <p>  Turning to such effects of Brexit as we can predict, the Economic and Social Research Institute has calibrated that, depending on just how hard a Brexit we end up with, UK-Ireland trade could decline by as much as 20% as a consequence of Brexit, with the loss of as many as 40,000 jobs and a decline in Irish GDP of as much as 3.5% over subsequent years.  Based on current GDP figures, that amounts to a &euro;9 billion loss and rising to the economy.  Nobody in Ireland would be unaffected.  Given the nature our open economy, every business and employer in Ireland effectively either trades with the UK or trades with somebody else who does.  If someone is a barber in Barberstown, he or she does not export to the UK but he or she probably cuts the hair of somebody from Intel who does.  The UK and Ireland have always traded together and we always will but because of tariff and non-tariff costs imposed by Brexit, the problem is that trade will be at lower value and will, therefore, support fewer jobs.  The most exposed sectors are food and agribusiness where WTO tariffs would make our exports significantly more expensive to the UK consumer, and tourism, where a weaker sterling and barriers to free movement of people could make Ireland a less attractive destination for our largest tourism market, which is the UK.  In the same way, there would be a loss of opportunity in education and research where British, Northern Irish and Irish students and researchers currently choose freely between our respective colleges.</p>  <p>  A hard Brexit with no deal between the UK and the EU for free movement of people, goods, services and capital would present these and many more examples of barriers to the conduct of business, trade, investment and employment in the ways we have come to take for granted since we joined the EU together with the UK more than 40 years ago.  While nobody has left anybody yet, the effects of the risk that such a hard Brexit could result in are being seen, with Irish businesses looking to establish operations within the UK to protect their access to the more than 60 million consumers in the UK while retaining their Irish business to serve the EU.  I refer to the example of a call centre in Dundalk servicing the customers of a UK retailer.  Ireland has particular competencies in this area.  Faced with the need to match sterling income with sterling costs, it can simply pull out the phones in Dundalk and plug them back in in Newry, and it is no surprise that some are thinking this way, with consequent danger to employment in the Republic.  The good news is that almost nobody anywhere wants a hard Brexit.  It seems certain that few, if any, of the UK voters who voted to leave in last year's referendum meant that the UK should negotiate to walk over a cliff to an inability to trade with an EU it knows or with others who have shown no urgency to agree new bilateral trade partnerships. </p>  <p>  In general, we can assume that, political buffeting aside, the shared focus of all negotiators will be on achieving a soft Brexit with managed trade and managed movement of people, ideally with minimal operational intrusion on day-to-day community or business life.  Key to this will be to intelligently square the circle of the UK's rejection of free movement of people with the shared UK-EU desire for free trade among 28 countries.  That will be challenging for all member states but of all the regions of these islands, Northern Ireland is the most exposed to the downsides of Brexit and, therefore, most in need of ensuring the softest possible separation from the EU.  Solutions for Brexit's threats to Northern Ireland touch all of the wider Brexit risks - border checkpoints, proof of origin of goods in transit, proof of nationality and status of non-nationals, fishing rights, access to markets and continuity of key EU support programmes.  Physical security of communities in Northern Ireland is heavily predicated on economic security for the region and on the avoidance of abuse of economic freedom as much as civic freedom.  While we know that here, it is a huge achievement of Irish political and diplomatic skills that the unique circumstances of this island are to be given particular acknowledgement in the context of the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  However, as First Vice-President Timmermans said, it will take all of Ireland's famed creativity to devise ways and means by which this island's particular needs can be satisfied "in the context of EU Law".</p> <p>What we need to do, and we need to start doing this now, is to bring together business and legal expertise to quickly develop fully thought through and legally proofed solutions for our negotiators.  It seems that key to stress-testing of any of those measures will be their impact in the context of Northern Ireland.  Thus, we have to devise solutions for Brexit that work for Northern Ireland, softening the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union and from the customs union.  The British Irish Chambers sectoral policy and Brexit committee fora, led by my colleagues Mr. Paul Lynam and Ms Katie Daughen, who are accompanying me today, span our hundreds of member firms, who together employ over two million people.  They are focused on solutions of the type I will reference.  These member firms bring together the experience and expertise of numerous businesses that know the issues and are motivated to solve them for the good of all.  Our focus now is on working together with public representatives and agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Revenue and customs officials and so on to develop practical solutions, including anti-abuse measures, that acknowledge the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland.  It will take further time to proof any concepts to an adequate degree but the following are some potential ways forward that are currently under consideration in the work we are doing with member firms.<br/><br/>On free movement of people, bearing in mind that there is a difference between a person's right to travel and the procedures to validate that right, such as presenting one's Irish passport prior to boarding a flight to Dublin from the UK, the solution might be fully preserving the common travel area, notwithstanding that it has never operated with both Ireland and the UK either in or out of the EU.  To ensure anti-abuse of free movement between Ireland and the UK, we may need to introduce a system of well managed movement, as is already the practice in Belgium, to which EU citizens, including us, may move for work but if we fail to get it within three months, we have to leave.  We also need to confirm continuity of the existing shared visa waiver schemes between Ireland and the UK, which enable citizens from other nations, particularly Asia, to visit both islands on one permit.<br/><br/>On free trade in goods, bearing in mind that truck drivers are already accustomed to presenting other documents when boarding vessels etc., the solution might be a pre-clearance model for through-traffic, that is, trucks and drivers, regardless of the driver's nationality, that pass through the UK land bridge to and from the EU, which is vital to Irish business.  For trade with Britain and Northern Ireland, Irish traders could pre-register loads through an easily accessible online platform and already used portable or fixed number plate recognition and-or GPS locator systems that can track movement of those loads.  We do not propose that the Norway-Sweden border model, which limits the number of border crossing points, thus rendering some roads as unapproved - we know what that means here - and which allows for hot pursuit - we also know what that means here - by border police into each other's territories for up to 15 km in either direction, nor do we propose fixed checkpoints at either today's national border or air or sea ports where the physical infrastructure to address massive slowing of freight in transit would be impossible to provide and impossibly disruptive of trade, not least in fresh or chilled food trade, which is hugely important to the Irish economy.  Reasonable anti-abuse measures will need to be provided to allow mobile spot-checks for proof of origin throughout the UK and Ireland.<br/><br/> On free trade in services, which are very important, bearing in mind that services, ranging widely from education to legal advisers to downloadable software, are typically provided by mobile persons, which are to be treated as provided for in my earlier remarks, or through internationally transmitted data, the issue will be to enable unrestricted payment for such services between the UK and Ireland, without exchange controls of the type previously a feature of certain UK-Ireland transactions.  It is not that long since we had exchange controls here.<br/><br/>On fishing, we believe the UK will not set as high a priority on retrieving its pre-EU fishing grounds as it will on ensuring the stability of Northern Ireland and on ensuring maximum market access for fish caught by UK fishermen and so we propose that today's <i>status quo</i>of fishing rights as between Ireland and the UK remain as is.  <br/><br/>On energy, as set out in the most recent publication by the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, the well-being of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain depends on access to an energy supply which is resilient, decarbonised and competitive.  The best way to assure this is through physical interconnection of existing and planned energy connectors between our two islands and between North and South on this island. <br/><br/>On financial services, there is a natural co-habitation and complementarity in delivery of financial services among service providers on both islands, both grounded in common law, unlike the European system, and frequently working to each other's natural competencies.  For its economic security, Northern Ireland needs to retain its opportunity to trade in these services with the Republic of Ireland and so provision should be made for a trade corridor for a pre-agreed menu of passported services between us.<br/><br/>Alongside all of these provisions, the UK and Ireland will need to give disrupted operators phased support for adjustment to the new environment.  Such supports may be both financial and non-financial, including training and new market development advice and so on.  Above and beyond such operational provisions as I have outlined, Ireland and the UK will need to invest in assuring the infrastructure for long-term successful growth in the economy and in our communities.  For us, this must, as the great Dr. T.K. Whitaker knew, include assuring the future of the highest quality of third level and post-graduate education in this country.  An immediately actionable step towards this would be to implement the proposals of the languishing Cassells report now.<br/><br/>At fair cost to the UK in contributions, etc., there is also the need to preserve EU funding programmes into Britain and Northern Ireland.  Regardless of the timing of changed arrangements, we clearly have to provide together for a phased transition model to give all affected adequate time to prepare.  We also suggest that there is now scope to craft together the wider opportunity of a UK-Ireland powerhouse model.  In the context of newly shaped arrangements, Ireland and Britain can leverage our respective competencies in manufacturing and services, education and research, food and tourism, technology and cyber and at the same time deliver convergent costs of doing business on either side of the Border.  This will promote more trade and employment among us, not less, supported by initiatives like the chamber's British Irish Gateway for Trade project which connects many more UK and Irish businesses online and with the involvement of trade support agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, UKTI and the various chambers of commerce throughout Ireland.<br/><br/>The agenda for action is clearly huge and apart from anything else there will be a practical need to avoid swamping our negotiators with more questions than answers.  To that specific end, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce invites the Government to engage a tight, well-resourced collective of business representation, including ourselves, IBEC, SFA, the CBI from the UK, including Northern Ireland, the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, to draw together the business community to firstly triage the issues offline and to bring forward really powerful solutions that are fully worked-up and already proofed to satisfy the EU legislative agenda.  For example, the Government can have understandable difficulty commissioning any one law firm to advise it, but this expert group could bring together best legal thinking of Ireland and the UK so as to bring forward proposals capable of making it through the negotiating process, ideally in ways which can also strengthen the EU itself, as is required for its future viability.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce will be glad to lead and facilitate this collective contribution to the work of Government, the Oireachtas and our negotiating officials and we strongly commend this valuable offer to the committee for consideration and endorsement.</p></speech>

Before we proceed, I must appeal to members to keep their contributions brief and to confine them to questions, directing specific questions to specific witnesses.  I will lead by example.  My first question is to Mr. McGrane's.  In regard to infrastructure, has the British Irish Chamber of Commerce identified any priority areas for strategic capital investment?  My second question is to Mr. Thompson.  We are reading many reports in the media that Ireland, in terms of insurance services, is losing out post-Brexit.  Luxembourg is being mentioned as a country that we are losing out to, and if that is true, how can it be addressed?  If it is not true, how can we address that perception?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400019#S00300"><p>I thank all of the delegates for attending today and for the time they spent on putting their presentations together.  I was very interested in Mr. McGrane's suggestion that we seek to bring together various organisations - a powerhouse of interested parties - to draft the Irish strategy.  I compliment him on that excellent idea.</p>  <p>  I would like to know if any of the organisations have examined the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are clearly not allowed any bilateral negotiations when it comes to Brexit but under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement there is nothing stopping us having bilateral discussions, which may lead to recommendations which, in turn, may find their way into the overall negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The opening of plants in the UK was mentioned by IBEC.</p>  <p>    </p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p> <p>That would move jobs out of the Irish economy, which is something that would be of concern to me.  How is it proposed to maintain job numbers if we move plant out of the country?  Has the Small Firms Association carried out research in respect of the knock-on effects on organisations lower down the food chain, such as suppliers to manufacturers which in turn export to the UK?  Short-term lay-offs were mentioned.  Do we have numbers in this regard?</p> <p> In the context of food and beverages and the alcohol industry, when we speak about putting in place supports, particularly to allow for market diversification, I assume we are referring to short-term supports to allow for diversification into global markets and not ongoing subsidies to maintain unviable organisations.</p> <p> I know of an insurance company in the North of Ireland which was considering moving to the South.  It has postponed this move because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  Is there any evidence in this regard?</p></speech>

The first is to Mr. Fitzgerald.  He spoke about below-cost selling.  Does this dislocate jobs in bars and pubs throughout the country?  Does it cost the State enormous money in the areas of health and justice, in this sense disadvantaging the country facing into Brexit?</p>  <p>  It was stated that &euro;13 billion was paid in insurance claims.  Is it not the case that insurance costs are rocketing and that this is disadvantaging firms more than Brexit?  The public liability premium on a small licensed premises in my village has increased from &euro;1,800 to &euro;3,300 this year.  There is a similar issue with car insurance.  In deference to the Chairman, I will not elaborate but the witnesses get my point.  It is a huge issue, which is worse than Brexit in some respects.</p>  <p>  The representative from IBEC spoke about targeted help.  What does he mean specifically?  What could realistically be done which would be sensible and useful and which we, as politicians, could advocate?</p>  <p>  Are the organisations before the committee already lobbying independently of the Government in Europe and, if so, how?  I ask the witnesses to tell us about specific tariffs that might be introduced in the context of the amounts that would be charged, how these tariffs would work, how they would inhibit trade and the type of firms that they might be likely to put out of business.</p></speech>

We have identified areas with difficulties and we are looking at how we can assist to diversify markets and new products.  Ms Callan gave a particular example of somebody with a profit margin of 3% to 5% exporting to the British market, and how the currency fluctuation floors somebody in this situation.  I wish to make a comment in the round as the witnesses are representing various facets of industry.  People have derived benefits from the drop in the cost of fuel but the multiples by which insurance premiums are increasing is the elephant in the room.  Senator O'Reilly mentioned the &euro;13 billion in payments.  Mr. Thompson stated that &euro;51 billion is being taken in.  A lot of the mystery still has not been cleared up in the context of profits going to shareholders, what is really happening in terms of claims and the fact that the finger is being pointed with regard to awards, etc.</p>  <p>  Small businesses are trying to ride out what will happen with Brexit but not only do they have problems with their public liability insurance being unaffordable, in rural areas where people must have a car - it is not luxury because there is no public transport - young drivers cannot afford to be insured in order that they might get to work.  These are realities coming from the people represented by the witnesses.  This must feed into it and it feeds into competitiveness.  The insurance industry will not have customers to take out insurance policies in certain areas and people have been put out of business because they cannot afford insurance.  This is a reality, aside from whatever else the Government can do.  It seems that any good the Government can do is being taking back with the other hand by the insurance industry through increases in premiums.  This view has been expressed already, but what is happening is appalling.</p></speech>

By virtue of the fact that the witnesses have been brought before the committee in one group, they are all sitting in front of us.  Have they sat together prior to today?  What issues that they have flagged have they tried to address among themselves?  Before Mr. Thompson got a chance to make his contribution, Ms Callan stated that insurance is an issue.  She mentioned companies in the group which have suspended investment and which are actively considering relocation.  Without getting into specific names and details, will she elaborate a little more on this?  Is the suspension of investment specifically Brexit-related or is it due to some of the issues already mentioned, such as escalating insurance costs?</p></speech>

I wish to zero in very briefly on what Mr. McGrane has told us about his proposal for a collective think-in on the flexible and imaginative solutions with which the European Union is asking Ireland to come forward.  Throughout the morning I have been asking people where is this debate, who is driving it, are we depending on five civil servants in the Taoiseach's Department or is there a collective channel of communication and a national debate on what the flexible solutions are.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, came before the committee and spoke about a common trade area, and whether this would be North-South or east-west in nature is another day's work.   The special position of Northern Ireland is hugely important for all the reasons mentioned.</p>  <p>  I am supposed to ask a question rather than make a statement.  Is this the first time Mr. McGrane has ventilated this idea in public and is he getting acceptance of it?  To me, it is the most important proposal and we should begin now to focus on the positive invitation from the European Union to come up with this flexible and imaginative deal for Ireland.  We just have to do it.  I felt this morning, and I do not want to say anything about the previous contributions made prior to this particular session, that there is a sense of what might be termed "spectatorhood".  These solutions will not come from five civil servants in three Departments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2872" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McGrane" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400020#T01000"><p>I will pick up on the earliest question with a very quick name check against specific infrastructure opportunities.  We have the only Government in Europe with a national strategy for housing, which is a very good thing and we need to move as fast as we possibly can to execute it.  Education is a key current and long-term infrastructure piece.  We need to implement the Cassells report and get on with a funded, viable, globally-competitive education system.  We need to build a second runway at Dublin Airport for air access, so let us get on with it.  With regard to capital investment in the economy, we have a broadband strategy which is great but we need to move faster to roll it out.  We also need balanced regional recovery.</p> <p>This is not about Dublin, or indeed Cork, good as both are, but about achieving a response that is long-term, Whitaker-esque, has a 60 year view and has a vision for the recovery for the whole of Ireland through some of the opportunities that present themselves now.  That is not least considering the threat to agriculture and tourism, which is clearly a provincial issue. </p> <p> Senator McDowell's question is an important one.  The work that is being done by the five civil servants and others has been of an extraordinarily high grade.  The work of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce spans the UK and Ireland, and indeed the EU.  We know of no other government or government team supported by civil servants and diplomats that has done as much work with such focus to such excellent outcomes.  We put that on the record.  Many of us have stood to let that work happen.  We did not disappear but waited alongside.  We have sat one chair behind our colleagues so that they could do the hard work at diplomatic level that had to happen first.  That was done below the radar, when many out on the street where asking where the Minister for Brexit was and what the plan was.  We had the privilege of knowing the work that was being done, and they have brought it in.  The onus now moves to business and the rest of society to play our part.  Of course, it is too big a task to ask diplomats and civil servants, and Ministers and the Taoiseach, dare I say, to come up with the solutions.  Business, which in the UK was fatally silent before the referendum, now knows that it has to play its part.  </p> <p> On the specific question of whether we had met before and ventilated this, this is an emerging work in progress between people of like mind across diverse franchises, people who represent one territory or one cohort.  The unique position of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce as a two island neutral organisation involves a responsibility to think on that broad plane.  We are happy to bring that forward for consideration and we will ventilate it with our colleagues and like minded organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400021#U00200"><p>The proposal by the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce is an excellent one.  I am surprised that it was not approached already.  It should be one of the key recommendations of our report.</p>  <p>  On the insurance industry and the idea of grandfathering and joint corridors and so on, again it is very credible.  We had the Central Bank in here in an earlier session, and one of the issues that I raised is that it has changed its rules and is not in the business of promoting Ireland as a location.  It simply sees itself as a regulatory body.  Do central banks in other European countries promote themselves?  Are their regulatory systems promoting their countries as locations for the insurance industry in a way that we are no longer doing?  </p>  <p>  With regards the contribution from the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, I am not quite sure how the public health (alcohol) Bill is related to Brexit.  Can the witness please outline how that relates?  We have had much debate here on that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2875" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompson" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400021#U00300"><p>I will address the question on insurance costs and premiums, because it is a competitive issue and ultimately feeds into the debate we are having on Brexit.  The Senator highlighted that we take in &euro;51 billion in premiums and only pay out &euro;13 billion in claims.  We need to clarify that.  As per the early part of my opening statement, our 140 member companies includes both domestic insurers servicing the local domestic economy and insurers based here in Ireland not taking premium from the Irish economy, but inward premium from foreign jurisdictions.  They have no interaction within this jurisdiction.  If one looks at the general insurers who operate in this market, across motor insurance and public and employer liability insurance, the industry has suffered a loss of &euro;875 million over a four year period, and that has been validated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Unfortunately, premiums have increased, but the mechanisms which the Department of Finance, through the cost of insurance working group, have implemented have lead to 33 recommendations being brought forward, involving 71 action points, which we as an industry have actively engaged in.  The two real recommendations which carry the most severe rating is the work that will come out of the personal injuries commission, under Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  They will be looking to have a standardisation of grading of injuries and at benchmarking our level of awards against other jurisdictions.  Equally, we are looking at enhancing the powers of the Injuries Board so that we can take ancillary costs out of non-contentious cases so that we can get claims through and get them paid more effectively on a daily basis.  Ultimately premiums come back to the cost of claims, and until we actually see the outputs of these recommendations coming though we are at a new norm.  We are acutely aware of it, and aware of the distress that it has posed to our consumers, but as an industry we are actively engaged in coming forward with solutions to address the cost of claims.</p>  <p>  On the final question on promotion, we would like to recognise that we work with IDA Ireland, Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach on a daily basis and do a sterling job in trying to promote this jurisdiction as a jurisdiction of choice for financial services.  Other countries do the same, but within the promotional ecosystem that they have, regulators would be involved.  That is the case with Luxembourg.</p></speech>

We know that from our experience.  On the question of whether Ireland is losing out and what we can do in terms of addressing the perception around that, it is unfortunate that in recent weeks we have seen high-profile cases that have been decided in favour of other jurisdictions - not just one jurisdiction, but we have seen decisions in favour of Luxembourg and Brussels, and unfortunately Dublin has come up second best.</p>  <p>  I go back to my statement on our proposed solutions.  If we look at the implementation of Solvency II since 1 January 2016, it is a harmonised and robust prudential framework.  It is based on the risk profiling of each individual company.  Within that, national supervisory authorities have a certain amount of leeway in how they actually apply it.  We firmly believe, particularly in the context of Brexit and for companies that are regulated by the prudential regulatory authority in the UK, which is a regulatory authority the equal to our jurisdiction, that if companies have gone through a robust approval process in that jurisdiction and are looking under a common Solvency II-EU framework and seeking to re-domicile some of their business so that they can maintain access to the European framework, that should be taken into account.  If it is taken into account, we believe it helps us in terms of stabilising our insurance market, it helps the UK in terms of their access to Europe, but more importantly it helps the European insurance market as well.  That would be the first point.</p>  <p>  In terms of a regulatory corridor, we know from dialogue between our membership that the PRA, for companies that are based here and accessing the UK market, face the same challenge.  If we could get a regulatory corridor in place it would help greatly.  If we have this grandfathering idea and have an approval in principle - we know some other jurisdictions are doing that and then working through the detail - it would help greatly in terms of perception.</p>  <p>  There was another question asked about an insurance company in the North considering relocating to the South.  From an insurance perspective it is a huge decision and it takes time to decide on a location if one decides to exit the UK.  There are many considerations at play, such as infrastructure and housing, but the most heavily weighted consideration is the regulatory environment and how that regulatory environment is operated within this jurisdiction.</p> <p>I think I have covered all the points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Fitzgerald" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400022#V00200"><p>In the first instance, I want to address the overall issue of how Ireland Inc. best approaches this issue.  I accept the point that was well made that there is a need for a collaborative approach.  As well as looking at ways in which they have to become leaner and more competitive due to the short-term currency movement, never mind the possibility of a hard or soft Brexit, many companies have been involved in the discussions at European level about the famous stricture that is state aid.  It used to be the case in the 1970s and 1980s that if one had a good idea for something constructive and one went to the Government, the Department of Finance was usually blamed for blocking the fact that a good idea could not take place.  State aid has become this all-encompassing stricture on practical ways in which one deals with the now, which is that there is a fracture of the European market, one of its biggest members is leaving, a member state that happens to be geographically beyond that member state will be hugely disadvantaged and Europe should not tell us that the rules that apply under normal circumstances should apply now.  Unfortunately, one of the issues that arises when we talk to people in the European Commission is that Ireland has not put up its hand and said it wants state aid to change.  The first thing that has to happen before we get into what may be done is that Ireland must put up its hand and say we recognise that these are exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  That is in the generality.  With regard to some of the points made on the drinks and alcohol industry, there was a ban on below cost selling in Ireland up until 2006.  It lasted from 1987 to 2006.  It was abolished by the then Government and the drinks industry has called for the ban to be reintroduced.  A ban on below-cost selling was introduced in England and Wales three years ago and has worked very well.  It addresses the issue of people buying extremely low-cost alcohol and, more importantly, supermarkets using alcohol as a loss leader whereby one comes in for the cheap beer and the supermarket recovers its revenue on the other products one buys, but clearly it is both socially undesirable and also misleading to consumers and involves all sorts of price bundling.  There is a solution to that level of abuse that is addressed by the reintroduction of a ban on below-cost selling.</p>  <p>  With regard to that and the overall point about the public health (alcohol) Bill, the proposal is for minimum unit pricing and an Irish-only label when EU labelling regulations are about to come through which are far more constructive.  All of those things, plus the proposed restrictions on advertising are imposing costs on business in Ireland that will do absolutely nothing for the consumption of alcohol, which has fallen by 25% in the past 14 years but will put up the cost of doing business in Ireland.  In addition to the fact that we have the highest priced alcohol in the EU, it will lead to cross-Border trade.  That is very much a Brexit issue.  In the round, it comes back to the point that at a strategic level we are speaking to Europe about ways in which it needs to recognise our circumstances.  Our credibility in doing that is not enhanced if we are putting up our own costs or refusing to address them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2882" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400022#V00300"><p>I will start with the specific question about lay-offs and short time.  In our survey, the member companies said that 7% of companies indicated they were likely to put workers on short time and lay-off and 2% already had to make some staff redundant.  That is mainly in the manufacturing industry where one is running product lines and essentially if there is no demand for one's product, one simply scales back.  What we have found is that the food sector has been dramatically impacted because prepared consumer foods tend to be a low-margin business and that is where most of our indigenous exports to the UK are coming from.  That is a big issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of the knock-on effects in the broader sub-supply chain piece, I know from our own members how hard it has been to engage them on Brexit.  The ones who are directly impacted are all over it.  They have had to move and they have made decisions.  We have published toolkits and advice notes and we circulated the Enterprise Ireland, EI, material as well, but I am worried that many businesses have not thought about this at all.  As part of the education piece around the initiative, there is an onus on everybody to keep telling all of those businesses that they need to do it.  One should bear in mind that 90% of businesses are micro businesses that employ fewer than ten people and they are not necessarily members of the bodies that are present, or any other organisation.  In the rural economy in particular, we must get out the message that people need to start assessing.  I strongly advocate that those who are affected should be eligible for the funding that is only currently available to EI clients to do their Brexit plan.  That makes no sense to me.</p>  <p>  In terms of lobbying, Brexit has produced a huge workstream for us.  Yesterday, we met with the Federation of Small Businesses from the UK, which came over specifically to look at developing relations post-Brexit.  We have been working with the UK Embassy, UK trade people and directly with the British Government, and also with the European Commission and our counterpart business organisations across Europe.  Our initial reaction post the summer is that the further east one went in Europe, there was no engagement at all and people were not even talking about it.  Getting the issue on the agenda is something other countries are working towards and ensuring an understanding of our issues has been our biggest focus.  The big focus on the EU side has been on state aid because the Department is using that as a blocker and we have been trying to help it to come up with more innovative measures.</p>  <p>  In terms of specific tariffs and customs, we have already started practical work so I have sent members into workshops both with the Revenue but also with the British equivalent.  The member feedback has been very worrying.  On the British side, there has been a sense that people coming over to start practical workstreams have no idea because it is so long since people have had to think about customs and models and all of that, the expertise level is not there.  I heard the chartered accountants say exactly that this morning.  That was certainly the experience.  We are getting down to the nitty-gritty.  Yoghurt makers and water makers, among others, are describing how they produce product, how they ship it in trucks and how they get it across borders but if one thinks about the totality of Brexit, that is what one needs in every single product line in every single sector and for every single regulation.  It is not simply just one room with one group of people.  We need to have business people in at all levels in all of these really practical things as we progress through.  Our members have been very open and have participated in many Government workshops already around this.  However, a bit of Brexit fatigue is now setting in because, for example, our members have gone to workshops about finance and supports last November and they say they spent their time going and they did all of that but nothing happened so we have to keep up the momentum in terms of deliverables to keep people engaged.</p>  <p>  In terms of people suspending investment, that question was specifically around Brexit, so half the people did say that it was directly Brexit related.  Notwithstanding the negativity this morning, our economic story is still remarkable, our growth figures are outstanding, our employment figures are very good and we should not be talking ourselves into a recession, but at the same time we need to plan for the future.  Anyone exporting is directly thinking about this but it is the other people about whom I am a bit more worried.</p>  <p>  Going forward, we are a member of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation group that has all the agencies and most of the business organisations.  The group is chaired by the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.  We have had one meeting so far and we are viewing that as a very solid workstream.  Most of us have been all around the country on panels, at political party meetings, at local enterprise office meetings and we have had a lot of discussion.  That has been useful in terms of hearing what everyone is saying.  Now we would like to get into detailed work programmes and implementation and we are available to do that.</p></speech>

The first one was from Senator McDowell about solutions.  IBEC is a large organisation.  We have 7,500 members and IBEC is also the umbrella group for more than 40 sectoral associations.  Intense work is being conducted on where solutions can be found in the context of what is a very uncertain and difficult political backdrop.  There is increased scope for some of those solutions in specific areas, depending on the competencies.  In terms of the common travel area, there is potential for greater imaginative solutions.  Other areas may be somewhat more dependent on the future trade relationship and part of the work in that regard will include lobbying but also digging down to see if we can get more of a meeting of minds and bring the two parties to a closer position.  There will be technical, technological and regulatory solutions to try to make those future relationships as seamless as possible.</p> <p>They will create as much continuity as possible with the existing relationships and we will set out the details of those in due course.  Our members are actively engaged across all different sectors and policy headings.  <br/><br/>We were asked about lobbying in Europe.  IBEC and our sectoral associations have been incredibly active in Ireland and in Europe.  As the Government has been doing, we have been putting up in lights the unique Irish situation and our unique exposure.  This needs to be done before we can get traction on some of the other proposals and the EU guidelines reflect an appreciation of that.  Irish business has been ahead of the curve in this area and we have an office in Brussels for this purpose.  We are actively engaged on an ongoing basis with the EU institutions and there has been open engagement with Michel Barnier's task force, as well as that of the Council.  Solutions are now required and IBEC will be actively working on that basis.  We will engage with the institutions and through our umbrella group, BusinessEurope, with a lot of other European business federations.  We will not only do this in Brussels but will bring our ideas and the Irish perspective to the capitals of Europe and to key member states and influencers across the EU.<br/><br/>All-island institutions are a big priority for IBEC.  We have been working with the CBI in Northern Ireland on a joint business council for some time and from long before the peace process came to fruition.  It has been a forum where politics can be left at the door and progress can be made on issues of shared interest.  An enormous amount of development has happened in this area since the peace process came to fruition and there is now a massive danger that some of the positive developments will take a step backwards with Brexit.  The trade relationship could be affected by a customs border and regulatory issues.  EU funding streams may be affected and solutions will be needed at EU and UK level to ensure existing projects and vital future projects continue.  The economic element is a core part of the normalisation of politics on this island.<br/><br/>We were asked about the relocation of Irish companies into the UK and state aid issues.  I will touch on them briefly and Mr. Brady of the economics team will talk about state aids in particular.  The first thing is to decide what is under our control and Irish cost competitiveness is top of that list.  It is important not to take legislative decisions that increase the burden on employers, that our tax position is competitive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK and that we can be proud of our business tax offering.  Even long before Brexit, the UK was making its business tax offering more attractive and Ireland needs to be cognisant of that as it will be accentuated post-Brexit.  The investment agenda has been a priority for IBEC.  We are already seeing significant bottlenecks in the economy and a massive investment programme needs to be put in place to ensure that even if wider external threats cause us problems, our own economic limitations will not trip us up.<br/><br/>On state aids, Mr. Brady will talk about what is possible and feasible in terms of supports for Irish business in the context of Brexit.</p></speech>

They are not just thinking about it but are actively looking at it.  Diversification is difficult for markets into which a company is not used to selling.  They believe it might make sense for them to move and they are also being approached directly by part of the state apparatus in the UK, particularly the Welsh and UK Governments.  Market access is the key issue and if there are going to be tariffs for the beef industry there will be moves because it will be impossible to export to the UK, which is our major export market.</p>  <p>  We were asked about supports and this goes back to state aid.  There is an incredibly tight state aid regime at the moment, namely, a rescue and restructuring aid regime in which a company has to have gone through insolvency before a government can seriously help it.  On the question of specific supports, in 2009, as Ms Callan mentioned, the European Union suspended some of the provisions under Article 137 of the treaty in order that Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies could give better support to companies.  Companies moving from the UK market and trying to diversify will need support because it can take three or four years to get from A to B.  In between, there is a valley of death and this is the big issue for Irish companies.  We need to support them through it, particularly in diversification and marketing supports.  Some such supports are in place but they need to be ramped up significantly.  E-commerce supports are needed for domestic companies, particularly retailers.  In 2009, the last time cross-Border shopping was an issue, 20% of Irish people shopped online but that is up by 60% now.  The reach of cross-Border shopping was only 40 km from the Border in 2009 but, with e-commerce, it now stretches the length and breadth of the country.</p>  <p>  Product innovation is going to be massive in the areas of taste, marketing material and packaging.  It all needs to be re-innovated because it is currently targeted at a UK consumer and specific industries, the cheese industry being one, will have severe problems on account of their products being tailored to and only being consumed by the UK.  Food companies producing fresh products also will have trouble reaching markets because their produce will not survive longer distances.</p>  <p>  Tax is a big issue but that has been mentioned.  There will be job losses, no matter what happens and whether there is a soft or hard Brexit.  There is already a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support workers in Ireland and elsewhere who have become redundant because of the negative effects of globalisation and we think it should be extended to workers affected by Brexit, with retraining and enterprise supports etc. </p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome Mr. Paul McGarry, senior counsel, chairman of the Bar of Ireland, who also chairs its working group on Brexit, and Mr. Patrick Leonard, senior counsel.  Earlier today, the special committee had an extensive debate with representatives of a range of sectors who offered interesting insights into the economic impact of and solutions to some of the problems presented by Brexit.  Our engagement with the Bar of Ireland has focused thus far on the opportunities Brexit offers Ireland.  We appreciate the documentation circulated to members in advance of the meeting.  The doctoral thesis I received from the Bar of Ireland makes for heavy but very worthwhile reading and offers the types of ambitious solutions the special committee has been mandated to explore.</p> <p>We are grateful to Mr. McGarry and Mr. Leonard for coming before us this morning.  Before we begin, I will read the standard note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I welcome Mr. McGarry and ask him to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We are delighted that the committee is taking time to have us here today to outline some of our views on the issues that are for its consideration.<br/><br/>Our submissions are confined to certain issues that may arise in the field of civil justice as a result of Brexit.  Although media commentary has focused on the implications for financial services and insurance companies over the loss of passporting rights, the rights of citizens of the EU to remain in the United Kingdom after Brexit and <i>vice versa</i>, customs and tariffs issues, the Bar of Ireland wishes to highlight the wide range of civil justice issues that are raised by Brexit, particularly in a hard Brexit scenario.  As a country with deep personal and economic ties with the United Kingdom, the issues here have the potential to affect Ireland more than perhaps any other country in the European Union.  The Bar of Ireland also wishes to highlight some opportunities for Ireland in the context of marketing legal services.<br/><br/>We have identified a number of areas of concern.  In order to highlight these, I will explain briefly what they are.  The first relates to civil jurisdiction, and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  In order to ensure the smooth flow of commerce between the member states, it is essential that the judgments of one member state&rsquo;s courts are recognised in the other member states.  Similarly, it is important that companies and individuals know which courts will deal with disputes, and how court papers from one member state&rsquo;s court system may be served in another member state.  In the existing legal order, in civil and commercial matters, these issues are comprehensively dealt with by the recast Brussels regulation which deals with both the jurisdiction of courts and the recognition and enforcement on judgments across EU borders in civil and commercial matters.  That regulation which is directly effective as the force of law in all member states provides that judgments of courts of one state are enforced throughout the other member states as if they were the judgments of the court of that member state.  In general, if a person is domiciled in an EU state, he or she must be sued in that state.  Where parties choose in their contract that any disputes should be resolved in one member state, the courts of the other member states must abide by that choice.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a range of EU rules on the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents.  The benefit to such a system is, of course, self-evident.  If an Irish company obtains a judgment in Ireland, it will be entitled to enforce that judgment against a defendant in any other member state.  Similarly, the Irish company can be satisfied that it will only be sued in Ireland, unless the rules of the recast regulation permit it to be sued elsewhere.  In the context of a hard Brexit, none of these rules will apply so that European companies will find it difficult to enforce European judgments in the courts of the United Kingdom.  United Kingdom judgments may be unenforceable in certain member states, and their enforcement in Ireland will be rendered more difficult and more expensive.  These issues also affect multinational businesses based in Ireland, or those considering whether to relocate to Ireland.<br/><br/>Much of the regulation of the financial services and insurance sector in Europe derives from European Union regulation.  Part of that system allows what is known as passporting.  I am sure the committee will have heard about this from various other parties which have been before it.  Under that system, where a regulated entity is situated in one member state, it is, under certain conditions, entitled to provide services to businesses and consumers in other member states.  Many of the financial services and insurance businesses established in the City of London use those rights to provide services across the European Union.  Similarly, there are many financial services and insurance businesses across the European Union which use passporting to provide services to what is the very large United Kingdom market.  In the context of a hard Brexit, it is likely that the right of companies to passport either out of or into the United Kingdom will be removed.  This will give rise to significant disruption in the provision of financial services.  Whereas there may be a migration of some businesses to Ireland and, therefore, benefits, some Irish companies may lose the right to provide services to the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>There is a Europe-wide insolvency regime which is given effect by the insolvency regulation.  Under the rules established by this regulation, the courts of the member state where a company&rsquo;s centre of main interests is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company.  The clarity provided by the insolvency regulation is especially valuable where companies routinely trade across borders and have assets and operations across multiple jurisdictions.  In the scenario of a hard Brexit, the courts of EU member states are unlikely to recognise the United Kingdom and vice versa in an insolvency situation.<br/><br/>These are just headline issues.  There are a wide variety of other legal issues that affect citizens across the EU, particularly in Ireland.  There are many other areas where citizens&rsquo; rights could be affected, such as family law, immigration and employment law, consumer law, competition, tax and so on.  The effect of a hard Brexit will be seen in the application of legal provisions affecting ordinary people on a day-to-day basis.<br/><br/>What can be done about it?  In the absence of agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom in a range of areas relevant to civil justice, businesses and individuals will have to fall back on pre-existing international treaties, where they exist, or develop new ones, or on long-standing rules of public and private international law.  That is a very complex concept and is likely to give rise to increased cost and uncertainty in the conduct of commerce and in the movement of people between the European Union and the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Political considerations fall outside the remit of the Bar of Ireland, it is clearly in the interests of both the European Union and the United Kingdom to seek replacements for the Brussels recast regulation, the insolvency regulation, and the other rules which are currently in force across the European Union.  The Bar of Ireland notes the stated objective of the United Kingdom to remove its legal system fully from the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This stated desire may prevent agreement being reached in respect of many of the areas of civil justice where it is clearly desirable that there be the fullest possible co-operation.  It may be that some compromise can be reached whereby the United Kingdom would accept the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the type of procedural issues involved - for example, in the context of jurisdiction and enforcement and, perhaps, regarding the service of documents, now governed by Brussels' recast regulation as opposed to substantive private international and public international law.<br/><br/>These are the macro issues.  We also want to highlight the significant opportunities to expand the market for legal services in Ireland.  The provision of legal services increasingly has a prominent international dimension and regularly involves international issues.  The growth in international trade and investment has increased demand for cross-border legal advice and representation.  Over many years, the United Kingdom has consolidated efforts across a wide range of stakeholders to increase its share of the international legal services market and they have been hugely successful in so doing.  At present the United Kingdom is believed to account for 10% of global legal services fee revenue and 20% of European legal services fee revenue.<br/><br/>One of the factors that underpins the United Kingdom&rsquo;s position as the second largest market for legal services globally is parties to international commercial contracts choosing English law to govern their agreements.  This is borne out by the volume of litigation and arbitration involving non-UK parties that occurs in the United Kingdom.  For example, the data we have collated suggests that since 2010 around 80% of all London commercial court cases each year have involved at least one non-UK party.  In almost 50% of all cases, all parties are not UK-based or linked.<br/><br/>Brexit creates an opportunity for Ireland to increase trade in legal services from Ireland to the international sector.  First, Brexit creates considerable uncertainty among UK legal services providers concerning their ability post-Brexit to service their clients as before, given that they will no longer be part of the European legal order.  Second, Brexit has significantly lessened the attractiveness of English choice of law clauses in commercial contracts.  According to a survey conducted for the Bar Council of England and Wales, European clients are already considering moving away from English choice of law and jurisdiction clauses.  In addition, according to the same survey, some international parties have already chosen not to issue proceedings in England because there is a fear that final orders will have to be made after Brexit and there is great uncertainty about the enforcement of those orders.  Following Brexit, Ireland will be the only English-speaking common law jurisdiction fully integrated into the European legal order.  This should help to attract financial and other services industries into Ireland and provide an opportunity to increase the market for legal services in Ireland.</p> <p>We think it will encourage international clients and companies to incorporate Irish law as the governing law of contracts in place of English law, to designate Ireland as the forum for the resolution of disputes about those contracts by way of litigation or arbitration and to use Irish lawyers to advise on European law.  What is interesting about the statistics that we have come across is that London is the second-largest centre for the provision of advice about EU law outside Brussels, which is extraordinary when one thinks about it.  The reality is that that will have to change after a hard Brexit.  The availability of highly-skilled common law and English-speaking lawyers in Ireland is an important support for the international business that flows through Ireland.  Considerable expertise has been built up by the large firms in this country in areas like funds and aircraft leasing, for example.  Irish firms are able to rival the large international firms in these and other sectors.</p> <p> There is further potential for Irish solicitors&rsquo; firms and barristers to provide legal services from Ireland to clients outside Ireland.  Considerable work is required to take advantage of the opportunity to increase trade of legal services to the international sector.  Over time, and this is only going to happen over time, it ought to be possible to significantly increase trade in legal services from Ireland in Dublin, with increased business opportunities and revenue arising from ancillary support services and increased tax revenues for the State, both by way of income tax and VAT.  The potential rewards to the economy are very significant.  One of the figures that emerges from looking at the raw data is that, in 2015, the net export value of legal services in the UK, by which we really mean London, was about &euro;4 billion.  Not all of that is necessarily affected by the Brexit scenario, but that is a figure that we think significantly understates the export value of the English legal services market.  One does not have to be particularly ambitious to see how even taking a small chunk of that would involve a significant increase in revenues here and for the State.</p> <p> It is important to say, as we have said, that in common with many other sectors, we are not talking about competition between Ireland and the UK.  These are businesses, clients and firms that we know are actively considering moving because of Brexit, and therefore it is a question of them deciding whether they come to Dublin as opposed to Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam, not whether they stay in London or come to Dublin.  Over time, it is possible to increase the trade.  If Ireland becomes a place in which international litigation and arbitration is routinely carried out, it inevitably enhances the reputation of Ireland as a place to do business.  The circle, in essence, goes around, particularly for the type of financial service providers that are now considering a move.</p> <p> That is an outline of our position on it.  As the Chairman has noted, we have supplied the raw data behind that.  That is constantly being monitored and updated on our side, because all the reports are being prepared on a regular basis.</p></speech>

They highlighted potential opportunities based mainly on companies now based in London moving over here.  How much extra business may be available for indigenous businesses and practices here and how prepared are we to harvest whatever potential may show itself there?  While we have the witnesses here today, I have another question which I hope I word correctly - I am no legal eagle - about the legal rights of the citizens of Northern Ireland after a hard Brexit, which I am finding it hard to get my head around.  They are all entitled to an Irish passport on the back of the Good Friday Agreement.  In theory, they will all get Irish passports so in theory they are also members of the EU.  When it comes to legal issues, does the company law or whatever that they are tied to follow the individual or the locality?  What rights do they have under a new British justice system as citizens of the EU under the European Court of Justice, ECJ?  It is something that I have been trying to work my head around.  On the final day, when people say that Brexit has happened and to get on with it, is there the potential for a large number of cases, specifically in the North of Ireland?  I may not be explaining myself very well, but the rights of the people of Northern Ireland under the two different jurisdictions once this is over and done with have been preoccupying me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2895" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400026#FF00400"><p>I welcome the delegation.  I am sorry that other people are detained in other committees and that there are not more here.</p>  <p>  On the opportunities that will present themselves as we move closer to Brexit, has the Bar Council now got what may be termed a "marketing suite" in order to market its services to potential clients?  I recently attended a conference where the preparedness of the financial services industry in the UK was discussed and how it is ready to relocate part of its business to European capitals and other cities, to Dublin, to Frankfurt or wherever.  We then finish up with two separate legal systems, which is probably going to create enormous work for barristers and solicitors on all sides.  Is that a problem that the witnesses see coming down the line as well as an opportunity?  I wonder if they have any statistics on how many companies have sought advice about locating in Ireland and moving their operations here to avail of opportunities that they currently have in the European Union.</p>  <p>  Are the witnesses in discussion with the UK's Bar Council about sharing the spoils of whatever is going to come out of this?  As far as I know, and I might be wrong, we do not operate a chambers system like in the UK.  Is there any opportunity for a group of barristers to come together and form such an operation where they will be able to offer a one-stop shop of expertise for companies coming here?  If one is dealing with a chambers organisation in the UK, there would be a variety of expertise in the chambers, whereas here one has to go and find sole traders who are experts in specific areas.  How much of a problem do the witnesses see languages as being for members of the Bar Council?</p>  <p>  Finally, speaking about civic rights and justices, we have a number of UK citizens living in Ireland.  We have a number of Irish citizens living in the UK.  It is well-established that there is going to be a problem if we land ourselves in a hard Brexit scenario.  I said this morning and will say again that I do not see a hard or a soft Brexit, I see a totally disorganised Brexit where bits and pieces will come together.  In this country, we have 100,000 people living in the North of Ireland who are UK citizens and are not entitled under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement to carry Irish citizenship, whereas their children are.  These would mainly be expatriates who came into the medical profession, academia or the restaurant business in the North of Ireland.  There are 100,000 of them.  I have raised their unique situation with everybody that has come in so far.  It is a problem and I have no doubt that it is a problem that will ultimately finish at the desk of the witnesses or their colleagues somewhere along the line to try to establish those people's rights.  Have any approaches been made in that area to members of the Bar of Ireland?</p>  <p>  I apologise if the questions are too specific, but those are the matters of interest to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400026#FF00500"><p>I thank Senator Craughwell.  I note the presence of Senator Victor Boyhan, who is substituting on behalf of Senator Michael McDowell, who has given his apologies.</p>  <p>  A number of questions I hoped to ask were asked by Senator Craughwell.  I have one or two specific follow-up questions and they might tie in with some of the questions asked.  Senator Craughwell mentioned a marketing suite for the Council of the Bar in Ireland.  It goes beyond the Bar Council.  It goes to the entire sector, to the financial services sector and to the Law Society.  Who is selling Ireland in this area?  Is this a responsibility for a State agency?</p> <p>There might be a role for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, or the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, to sell this as a package, much like the bids we are putting in for the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland was here earlier and it is out there with IDA Ireland, day and night, selling Ireland as a place to invest and trade.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Breen and Dara Murphy, are traversing the globe, rightly, and it is really promising.  However, is that being done for the opportunities the witnesses have just mentioned and if not, why not?  What is the solution?  This is something we can say to the Government now.  We do not even have to wait to write our report at the end of June.  We can feed it in almost instantaneously.  How can we get a part of that &euro;4 billion export value?  We have said in respect of a number of areas that if we can get 10% of the exile from London, we will be doing great.  It would make a great difference to our economy in a year to get 10% of &euro;4 billion.<br/><br/>Tied into that is the need, as Senator Craughwell said, for language proficiency.  In a former life, I spent a great deal of time working with people to train them up to apply for posts as lawyer linguists within the European institutions.  It was a huge issue.  Notwithstanding that these were very promising and lucrative careers, the numbers applying from Ireland were a proportion of the <i>per capita</i>numbers from other member states where it was seen as something viable.  As Senator Craughwell asked, how do we encourage not only those with relevant language knowledge and experience, but more barristers and solicitors?  How do we prove to a second year devil at the bar who is looking forward to ten years of a slightly tougher experience that this is worth investing his or her time in?  Do we need to provide more supports for recently qualified solicitors and recently called barristers?<br/><br/>Before I move on from this topic, I ask if there has been any evidence of expansion by UK firms or chambers into the Irish legal system.  We have all read articles and various media pieces involving rumours about large London-based firms or London-origin firms seeking to set up offices in Dublin or to merge with Irish firms.  Is there any tangible evidence of this?  Moving away from the firms, are we seeing more barristers from London, Birmingham or Belfast, even, wondering whether to transfer?<br/><br/>Certain parties have chosen not to issue proceedings in England.  What happens there?  Is it the case that they have decided to sit on this for a year or two?  What else needs to happen in the meantime?  What happens to those proceedings?  It may be down to my ignorance of the legal system but do they just float in the ether?  What happens while that delay goes on?  We have asked a lot of questions.  Perhaps Mr. McGarry might answer some, with his colleagues coming in on others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2898" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Leonard" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400027#GG00200"><p>I will deal with some of those questions.  The Chairman asked about proceedings.  It is not that they would be delayed for two or three years.  Very often in cross-border disputes, the parties have a number of choices as to where they would begin the litigation.  That can depend on the contract and the parties who are going to be sued.  The suggestion is that some parties would be concerned that an English judgment received at the end of litigation and entered after a hard Brexit would be less easy to enforce in other European countries.  That might lead one to decide to issue those proceedings in another European country, including, potentially, Ireland, France or Germany.  One would then know that one's judgment could be enforced in other countries.</p>  <p>  To move from that legal strictly legal point to those raised by Senators Paul Daly and Craughwell, the opportunities which arise for the Irish legal sector present themselves in a number of areas.  We were asked about the opportunities for indigenous firms and people here.  In so far as large financial services or insurance firms move to Ireland, it is likely that they will use the services of existing firms in Ireland to provide some legal work.  In so far as the Government is successful in persuading businesses to come to Dublin, that is likely to increase the amount of work for existing solicitors firms here.  Obviously, if there are disputes in the long term, that is likely to produce extra litigation.  Similarly, if we can persuade international companies to use Irish law more than they have to date and in areas like commercial contracts between Irish and foreign companies in funds, aircraft leasing and bonds, it is likely to give more demand for Irish lawyers.  That is another area where, outside of people moving to the country, there can be an increase in business for Irish lawyers.  There is obvious potential, as one reads in the newspapers, that some foreign firms may decide to come to Ireland.  They may bring some employees from abroad, including English solicitors and New York attorneys, but, in truth, if some of the large firms from London or New York move to Dublin, it is likely to provide employment to the local market also.  All of those are areas where the local market can be increased without reference to work coming in from abroad, which is obviously a different point.</p>  <p>  We were also asked about a marketing suite and the engagement with other Government agencies.  The Bar Council of Ireland has, for a number of months, had extensive engagement with a large number of solicitors firms.  We have had extensive engagement with a number of Government Departments and IDA Ireland and we are in the process of putting together a formal strategy to market Irish lawyers and Irish law.   That is in hand but not yet complete.  It is something which can usefully be led at official level and we are hopeful the initiative will bear fruit over the next number of months.  We are beginning to work hand in glove with IDA Ireland, which is very supportive of our proposal to market Irish law and Irish lawyers.  Law is an ancillary service to the financial services sector but it will help to sell Ireland if IDA Ireland or any Department can go to London and New York and say that not only is the regulatory structure in Ireland good for setting up a financial services or insurance business, but we have the support structures in terms of good lawyers and accountants to support that business.  In so far as the Government's pitch to the international community is that Ireland is an English-speaking common law system and in so far as that is an advantage, the legal community of barristers and solicitors should be part of the drive to market Ireland and show that it is a good place to conduct legal business, get legal advice and resolve business disputes.</p></speech>

Since the 1960s, quite a number of firms have come to Ireland.  What has the practice been in general?  Have they used Irish firms and Irish barristers to deal with their legal questions?</p></speech>

The solicitors' sector has provided a very advanced service to those multinationals, particularly through the large and medium-sized firms in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I expect that it is the business provided by those large multinational firms which has allowed the legal sector in Ireland to develop in the way it has.  One would have to ask members of those firms about it in more detail, but our understanding is that the large multinationals in Ireland use the large firms in Dublin and some of the regional centres as a matter of routine.  It may be that there is some type of work that still goes to their London or New York departments, but they all certainly engage with the firms here.</p>  <p>  An issue I did not deal with was whether people had already moved here.  The perception of the Bar is that there has been an increase in the last five or ten years, in particular with English insurance firms moving to Dublin.  There are some larger international firms, in particular in the funds sector, and some transnational firms which have moved to Dublin, but this, in truth, has been in small numbers.</p></speech>

My query concerned actual practising barristers and law firms.  It might be too soon to tell, but has he seen an increase in, or is there evidence of, people practising at the Bar in the UK deciding that perhaps they should relocate to Dublin?  Will it be a little more lucrative, for want of a better word?</p></speech>

We have not yet seen a large influx of UK barristers who might seek, under the current equivalence regimes, to practise in Dublin.  Only time will tell whether that will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-04a.2903" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McGarry" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017050400028#HH00300"><p>It is probably too early to say how it will play out in that sense.  If the committee calls in the Law Society, it may need to ask its representatives a similar question.  Anecdotally, we understand there are English firms considering Ireland as a place to set up some form of office, whether big or small.  That can only be in circumstances in which they perceive the need to follow the client.  If their clients are saying to them that Dublin is where they are headed and if the clients are significant, the firms are likely to want to continue to provide the services.  If it means they must be in Dublin, they will be in Dublin.<br/><br/>Senators Daly and Craughwell raised a few other issues.  I am not certain I can answer the questions they asked, particularly the question about citizenship and Senator Craughwell's point about the situation of the 100,000 UK citizens who happen to live in Northern Ireland.  That area is extremely complex.  On the one level, there is the current position of people born on the island on foot of the Good Friday Agreement arrangements.  It remains to be seen what the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will be.  The fact those born on the island of Ireland are all entitled to be Irish citizens means that, as a matter of citizenship, they are entitled to benefit from certain rights and obligations <i>qua</i>Irish citizens.  However, if they move into other areas such as corporate structures, if they are involved in companies and the companies are domiciled or based in Northern Ireland post Brexit and Northern Ireland is part of the UK, there will be similar problems for them.  Similarly, one can see how there would be issues in areas such as family law if they are subject to domiciliary standing regimes in the EU.  However, I think it is the same for Irish citizens wherever they are in the UK, not just in Northern Ireland, in that sense.  I do not know the answer to the question Senator Craughwell raised about the 100,000 UK citizens in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Conversely, there are British citizens or UK citizens who will not be able to exercise their rights.  I see Mr. McGarry's point.  It will be a nightmare.</p></speech>

Even the identification of that one issue, which on one level might not seem to be very significant in the overall scheme of things, shows how complex the situation will be.  If one area like that can be identified, another can be.  I refer to the tax treatment of people resident in one state but domiciled in another, for example, the UK and France or the UK and Ireland.  One can imagine how complex things will get when one gets down to the nitty-gritty of the negotiations.  I think we are all hopeful we do not end up with a hard Brexit.  I do not think that would be any good for anyone, but I think the preparation we must make is one that assumes a hard Brexit.  Anything better than that would be a bonus or a benefit.  This is not really a political matter.  Rather, it is a legal matter.  The noises we are hearing are not encouraging.</p>  <p>  From the lawyer's point of view, we are considering Brexit from a few different perspectives.  We consider the macro constitutional issues affecting Northern Ireland, citizenship, the Border and the application of the Human Rights Act and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.  These are high principles of constitutional law and consideration.  Then there are the practical considerations we outlined earlier regarding enforcement of judgments and difficulties for companies and people trading in and out of the UK and the legal systems and legal advice they will have to get.  Then there is a third issue which we have been considering more specifically lately.  I refer to the notion that one can market Ireland and use, as Mr. Leonard said, the fact we have all these advantages - a legal system not too dissimilar to the UK's, an English-speaking population, a common law system and the certainty this provides, particularly for Americans who are used to thinking about these things - and that this can then be incorporated by agencies such as the IDA into the sales pitch for all the other clients.  As a result, we may end up with more lawyers coming here - we will certainly end up with more business here - and it will not be in anything like the short or medium term for barristers.  It will be for people involved in law firms but, ultimately, if businesses and law firms can get their clients to incorporate things such as Irish law into their contracts and transactional arrangements, there will be a benefit down the line for us.</p>  <p>  I do not see major problems with the capacity of the system as regards the legal advice at present.  Again, that is more a matter for the solicitors' firms but, in our experience, the Irish firms have a very strong track record of providing advice in areas of technical EU law and some of the specific areas that have been mentioned: aircraft leasing, funds, derivatives, and technical and financial services.  Similarly, regarding EU laws generally, they have very highly qualified people and there are plenty of very well-trained people coming through the system, so I do not really see there being a problem on a capacity level in providing that.  I do not see it as being very different in real terms from the current position in London.</p></speech>

Things will change in the coming weeks for the witnesses as well as for us, so I ask them to feed anything into the committee as it comes up.
