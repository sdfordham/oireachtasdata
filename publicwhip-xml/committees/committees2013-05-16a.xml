Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  No. 2 is matters arising from the minutes.  No matters have arisen.</p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday, 9 May 2013.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  There is correspondence dated 13 May 2013 from Ms Geraldine Tallon, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, forwarding information requested at our meeting on 2 May 2013 regarding the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  That is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3B is individual-----</p></speech>

At the same meeting, we talked about the allegations made to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, about a conflict of interest.  Has there been an update in this regard?  Members sought further information on it.</p></speech>

SIPO reported in its annual report that it did not consider there to be sufficient grounds to open an investigation.  It is publicly disclosed in its annual report for 2007 or 2008, I am unsure which.</p></speech>

I mean the details of the actual complaint and then SIPO's consideration of that complaint.</p></speech>

Perhaps the clerk could write to SIPO.</p></speech>

As someone had made an allegation at the time, it would be good to see exactly what was alleged and how SIPO responded, if at all possible.</p></speech>

No. 3B.1 is correspondence dated 8 May 2013 from Mr. Hugh Rance, Bantry, County Cork regarding County Cork VEC.  It is to be noted.  We have received previous correspondence from Mr. Rance regarding County Cork VEC which has been passed on to the Department, which has replied.  The level of correspondence on County Cork VEC is so large that perhaps we should get an overall note on accountability issues from the Department and we should also review the next audit report of that body.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B00400"><p>In the context of the 2011 financial statements of County Cork VEC I have asked for all of the issues that arise in the various correspondence to be examined from a current perspective.  I have not initiated an investigation of the history of each of the cases but anything that looked like a systemic issue is being addressed in the context of the 2011 audit.  As a result, the completion of the audit has been significantly delayed.  We are still awaiting certain explanations and further matters require investigation and to be finalised.  I expect at this stage that there will be a report on all those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B00500"><p>When is the report likely to appear?</p></speech>

We should complete the report in June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B00700"><p>Is that all right?  Agreed.  No. 3B. 2 is correspondence dated 10 May 2013, from the office of the Secretary General of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government re information previously requested regarding flooding in Ballinasloe, County Galway.  It is to be noted.  The correspondence has been forwarded to the OPW for a note on the matter.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 11 May 2013, from Mr. Matthew Merrigan re the committee&rsquo;s examination of special report No. 80 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the administration of national health and local authority levy fund.  It is to be noted.  Mr. Merrigan is claiming that he cannot give evidence as the subject matter of the committee's examination is also being examined by the Garda.  The clerk has been in contact with the HSE who did refer the matter to the Garda when it became clear that public moneys paid to SIPTU were claimed by the union not to have been lodged in an official account.  We now know a lot more about the payment and use of this public money and we should ask the HSE to review the complaint it made to the Garda so as to enable the Garda to make a decision on whether to continue its investigation.  I am anxious that we hear the evidence from Mr. Merrigan.  Any issue that we will deal with will not overlap with a Garda investigation.  The Garda was examining the possibility of fraud and we need to get the evidence directly from Mr. Merrigan.  I will ask the clerk to check with the HSE.  We will pursue the matter that way and move towards insisting on Mr. Merrigan appearing as a witness before the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence dated 14 May 2013, from Mr. Lar Bradshaw, former chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority re the committee&rsquo;s examination of special report No. 77 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  It is to be noted.  Mr. Bradshaw has indicated a willingness to help the committee and we will facilitate him.  We might, because of scheduling, have to hold a special meeting on Wednesday 19 June or Wednesday 26 June in order to deal with the matter.  We will try to accommodate Mr. Bradshaw.  We issued other invitations to the various persons concerned.  I understand Mr. Bradshaw was the only one to indicate his willingness to co-operate.  None of the others have replied as yet.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The next heading is 3C concerning documents relating to the committee meeting of 2 May 2013.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 14 May 2013 from Mr. Martin Callinan, Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, re briefing paper on matters to be considered today.  It is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received 14 May 2013 from Mr. Martin Callinan, Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, re his opening statement.  It is to be noted and published.</p><p>  The next heading relates to reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 9 May 2013.  No. 4.1 is the annual report Kerry County Enterprise Board 2011.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01200"><p>You asked last week, Chairman, about delays in the submission of the 2010 financial statements from two county enterprise boards.  They were south Dublin county and Galway city and county.  As I indicated last week they had been certified during 2011 and we did not receive a clear explanation for the delays in submitting them.  The process is that the county enterprise boards send their accounts, usually with the annual report on their activities to Enterprise Ireland, which then sends them on to the Department, which then submits them to the Oireachtas.  The practice in some of the county enterprise boards of submitting the two documents together &ndash; the financial statements and the performance report &ndash; is probably the main reason for delays.  As we understand it, Enterprise Ireland received those two sets of financial statements earlier this year, one set in January and one set in April and there has not been too much delay since they were received there in coming to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01300"><p>No. 5 is our work programme.  It is shown on the screen for members.  One outstanding matter relates to Waterford Institute of Technology and the ongoing investigation there by Mr. Quigley.  We had written to the Department of Education and Skills about it.  The clerk informs me the report was completed.  Could we ask the Department whether the report is available and for an update on the current position?  The clerk could also ask if we could then proceed with the completion of our investigations on the matter.  Is the work programme agreed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01400"><p>I seek to have the Central Bank come before the committee.  I have discussed the matter with the clerk.  It is proposed to invite the Central Bank to come before the committee to talk about supervision, as it is under that particular category that we can ask it to come.  Could we send a letter to the Central Bank to that effect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01500"><p>We can.  The accountability of the Central Bank is limited<i> vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the committee but there is a report from 2009 which deals with a number of issues.  The report was considered by the committee during the term of the previous D&aacute;il on 13 May 2010 and the issue remains open.  We should invite Mr. Elderfield back to update the committee on the new regime of regulation now in place, as the debate in 2010 preceded the legislation that reformed the operation of the Central Bank at the time.  The change is to regulation being contemplated, including extra staff and the fitness to practice provision for senior bank staff, which were not in place.  The committee is currently drafting a report on bank stabilisation measures which covers the period 2008 to 2013, and an updated account on regulation would feed into the report also.  I will ask the clerk to make arrangements to have the matter placed on the agenda.  We will send the letter and the invitation to attend the committee to discuss these matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01600"><p>Could we do it fairly soon before Mr. Elderfield departs to more prosperous pastures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01700"><p>Yes.  We are looking at our work programme and we will facilitate an early meeting.  Is there any other business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600003#B01800"><p>I wish to raise an issue on which I am aware people have corresponded with you, Chairman, and on which I have also spoken to the clerk.  There is a huge emphasis in the current climate on enterprise and doing everything we can within communities to help people create jobs, support jobs and job creation.  People would have read in the national media in recent weeks about the most disgusting possible example of the use of the word &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; to create a culture of junketeering, not just for members of a board but also their family relatives.  I refer to the Wicklow Enterprise Park in my constituency which had a board stuffed full of county managers, former county managers, councillors and F&Aacute;S executives.  They certainly like to travel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600004#C00200"><p>The letter from Pobal to the Department of Social Protection did not result in a referral to me.  We have no record of receiving any correspondence from the Department.  I only became aware of concerns around Wicklow Enterprise Park when there was a press inquiry asking if an investigation had started in my office on foot of the recommendation from Pobal.</p><p>  In a way this case raises some of the concerns we had looking at the SIPTU fund and the proliferation of funding from many sources to grant funded bodies.  If we follow the amount of grant funding down through any particular line, it does not look like a significant amount.  Wicklow Enterprise Park Limited is established as a company and will only come within my remit if over 50% of its income in a year is sourced from public sources.  That is the first thing I would have to establish.  It is something I will examine to see if I have a role to play.</p><p>  On the general point about the oversight of grant funded bodies, we made recommendations in the SIPTU report and the committee will have the opportunity to discuss those with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The SIPTU report is listed for hearing and the recommendations about the regime that is in place for oversight of grants will be outlined.  We have also agreed with the Department to engage with it on a process of reviewing the arrangements in place around oversight of grants.  One of the things that must be addressed in that context is understanding how much public funding goes into a grant funded body.  There must be a system in place to draw that information together if we are to get proper oversight of these bodies.</p></speech>

We will ask the clerk to write to the various accounting officers to get the information required.</p></speech>

The only other element is the new information the Comptroller and Auditor General has provided on the fact the referral was never made from the Department of Social Protection.  Pobal expressed concerns about this and wrote to the Department and asked that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office be alerted.  I would be interested to hear from the Department why that referral was not acted upon.</p></speech>

The Appropriation Account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.57 billion in 2011.  Payroll costs and pensions accounted for 86% of expenditure.  At the end of the year, 13,900 Garda members and more than 2,000 full-time equivalent civilian staff were employed.  This results in a ratio of one civilian for every seven sworn members.</p><p>  Total payroll costs consisted of slightly more than &euro;1 billion, including &euro;214 million on allowances and &euro;81 million on overtime.  The pay outturn for the year was marginally up on the 2010 level, despite the number of staff reducing by approximately 500 year on year.  Pension payments to retired members of the force in 2011 were more than &euro;307 million.  Spending on pension payments was &euro;61 million lower than originally budgeted because of reduced rates payable to existing pensioners and fewer retirements during 2011 than had been anticipated.</p><p>  Supplementary Estimate adjustments were made to all of the Vote subheads in 2011.  The largest increase was an extra &euro;52 million provided for spending on salaries, wages and allowances.  A factor in the increase was additional pay expenditure of &euro;28 million incurred in connection with the State visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama. </p><p>  Another spending area where there was a substantial supplementary provision in 2011 was subhead E, communications and other equipment.  The account records a 41% increase in spending compared to 2010, mainly as a result of the outsourcing of road safety speed cameras in November 2010.  This additional expenditure on the Vote was offset by a new category of appropriations-in-aid, namely, receipts of fixed charge penalties.  In the past, the full receipts of fixed charge penalty payments collected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were paid directly to the Central Fund.  In 2011, the overall receipts amounted to &euro;23.3 million, of which &euro;10.6 million was retained in the Vote as appropriations-in-aid and the balance of &euro;12.7 million was paid into the Central Fund.</p><p>  The committee is also considering Chapter 26 which reviews the systems in place for collecting motor tax and monitoring and deterring evasion of the tax.  As previously discussed, a number of bodies play a role in the collection, administration and enforcement of motor tax.  The committee has already examined the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on its role, which is mainly concerned with maintaining the register of vehicles and the collection of motor tax paid online.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility for motor tax policy and the local government fund, into which the proceeds of the tax are paid. </p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s responsibility is to enforce the requirement that vehicles publicly in use have and display a current motor tax disc.  The main focus of Garda activities in respect of motor tax is to detect cases of failure to display a current disc, levy fixed charge penalties and collect the payments and initiate prosecutions where these charges are not paid on time.  In addition, where a vehicle owner wishes to declare that his or her vehicle was off the road for a period and, therefore, not liable to motor tax, a member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must witness the declaration.  The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Bill 2013, currently before the Oireachtas, proposes changing to a system whereby such off-the-road declarations are made in advance, rather than the current retrospective declaration.</p><p>  The examination found evidence that around 5% of randomly sampled vehicles on the road in 2010 and 2011 did not have a current motor tax disc.  Based on the estimated number of vehicles in use nationally, this suggests that approximately 125,000 vehicles on public roads are untaxed.  The motor tax revenue foregone is estimated at approximately &euro;50 million.  This figure excludes cases where the tax disc is less than a month out of date, which is an allowed grace period.</p><p>  The examination included an analysis of approximately 240,000 fixed charge notices issued between 2008 and 2011.  In some cases, multiple penalty notices had been issued to vehicle owners.  The total number of vehicles involved was 185,000.  We found that around 40% of fixed penalty charges had not been paid.  We also found that motor tax had not been paid in respect of some 40,000 vehicles between the date the fixed penalty notice was issued and April 2012.  Of those that had paid tax after the fixed penalty notice issued, 35,000 had made false declarations &ndash; in the presence of a Garda witness &ndash; that the vehicle was not in use at the time the notice was issued.    </p><p>  In summary, the results of our analysis are that the fixed penalty notice system has not resulted in changed behaviour in respect of motor tax compliance in a significant number of cases.  The integrity of the off the road declaration system is also seriously undermined when registered vehicle owners, in front of a Garda witness, declare that their vehicle was off the road at a time when it was observed in a public place by another member of the force.  The report, therefore, recommends a formal review of the effectiveness of fixed penalty notices as a deterrent and for better procedures to be devised to ensure the tax is paid when non-compliant owners are detected.  </p></speech>

The strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of 30 April 2013 was 13,330 sworn members, inclusive of all ranks.  In total, since 31 December 2009, 1,218 garda&iacute; of all ranks have retired or left the organisation.  On 30 April 2013, there were 2,052 full-time equivalent civilian staff employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a ratio of civilian to sworn members of 1: 6.5.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to attaining a lower ratio, this is influenced by the current public sector recruitment moratorium.</p></speech>

I wish to start with the penalty points issue which has been raised recently.  I am sure other members will also wish to make reference to it.  As of now, I understand three garda&iacute; face disciplinary proceedings over the quashing of penalty points, that is, three out of the 113 officers involved.  The assistant commissioner has found no evidence of criminality, corruption, deception or falsification and that an average of 10,702 notices were terminated every year by garda&iacute; employing discretionary power.  He has found that notices were terminated for a good reason in many cases but for no good reasons in others.  When people look at this issue, they will come to the conclusion that there is less to this issue than meets the eye.  It has probably been overblown in some ways.  However, we must ask questions about basic administration and administrative procedures in the context of completing files and the audit procedures involved when a quashing of a notice occurs.  Is the Commissioner concerned that basic procedures have not been followed in some districts and divisions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600006#E00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  With the Chairman's permission, I would like, first, to outline the three main pillars under which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates, which are to be found in our corporate strategy and annual policing plans.  Our mission statement refers to working with communities to protect and serve them and to having excellent people delivering policing excellence.  The third pillar is something which will be very familiar to all members, namely, our national emblem of the harp.  We use the acronym HARP to remind our members that they are charged with the responsibility of enforcing the laws of this land and protecting communities and businesses, in the widest sense.  It stands for honesty, accountability, respect and professionalism.  Keeping these four values in mind pretty much takes care of the mission statement and the vision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The Deputy has raised an extremely important issue for us, that is, the enforcement of road traffic legislation and the powers of discretion that arise in that context.  As I see it, there are two issues involved.  One is the actual processes, procedures and policy involved and compliance with them.  The second is discretion.  Depending on which lens one uses to look at some of these decisions, one would have a particular view.  I can guarantee the committee that if all of us in this room took ten cases, we would probably come up with ten different views of how to process a particular instance.  What the administration of the system - the on-the-spot fines system - is all about is applying balance, equality and non-discrimination.  It is also about fair procedures and good practice.  </p><p>  I acknowledge the report from the assistant commissioner, Mr. John O'Mahony, and thank him for his assistance, through that very detailed report, in establishing the facts surrounding the allegations in this case.  It is very clear from the report that the assistant commissioner did not see any criminality <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the documents available to him and he studied many of them.  He did not see any fraudulent use of the system; nor did he find corruption or malpractice.  However, what he did find which is of particular concern to me was non-compliance, or rather, not full compliance with the policies and procedures in place.  In that context, he has made a number of recommendations to me which I fully intend to implement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600007#F00200"><p>One of the main criticisms is of senior garda&iacute; investigating senior garda&iacute;, which is a canard.  Many people who are not serving investigate garda&iacute; all the time.  As the Commissioner mentioned, others outside the force have taken a look at this issue and have made their recommendations.  What does the Commissioner say to people who say it would never be possible to have a fair or reasonable inquiry if a senior garda was investigating other senior garda&iacute;?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600007#F00300"><p>I have heard these criticisms of course.  What I can say to the Deputy is that Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony is someone who has been around for quite some time and his honesty, integrity and reputation, not just in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but in many legal circles and beyond, corroborate the fact that he is someone who is extremely thorough and committed to his work.  He picked a team to look at this very disturbing level of allegations made, who are experienced in their own right - experienced investigators.  I am very satisfied that he and his team will leave no stone unturned in digging out issues around criminality or beyond if they find them.  It should not escape anyone's notice that, like myself, he has done this in the past.  Unfortunately, we have had reason to investigate some of our own people for very serious matters.  We have brought some of our members before the courts in that respect and some of them have received custodial sentences.  It is a question of the people around the investigation wearing the t-shirt and walking the walk at the same time.  They are not afraid to take on any issue presented to them, be it on a criminal or procedural basis.  That, I suggest, is what Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony's report reflects.</p></speech>

What will the Commissioner instruct members of the force to do immediately, based on these recommendations?  How does he intend to tighten the procedures with regard to completing a file properly when it comes to quashing and discretion, as he has mentioned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600007#F00500"><p>It is the case, as one would expect, that all of the recommendations which are a matter of public record at this stage centre on procedural issues and the need to reinforce and inculcate in those charged with the responsibility of cancelling notices that they should do so for good and valid reasons and within the guidelines.  It is the case that when one is dealing with a discretionary issue, it is extremely hard to be absolutely either prescriptive or descriptive in legislating because people meet individual circumstances and have to deal with them as best they see fit using their professional judgment.  I have seen some of the product of the assistant commissioner's report and would not be entirely happy with some of the judgments made.  Nonetheless, the people who made these judgements made them for the reasons they made them, which is an entitlement.  What I can do now is reinforce the need to be very careful when one is dealing with these issues and ensure they are being done for all the right reasons.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the need to keep documentation which, of course, is vitally important.  There is criticism in the report that this did not happen in a number of cases and, of course, there are a number of people subject to a disciplinary investigation.  That has to be dealt with, of course.  We need greater oversight of the process and generally a tightening of the procedures in place.  What I have done in the interim and during the currency of the assistant commissioner's report is send a directive to all of the officers involved at a level where they are in a position to cancel notices to impress on them the need to adhere to the policies in place and to inform them that there will be a further recommendation coming down the road.  I have appointed an assistant commissioner and a small team to ensure implementation and monitoring of that process.</p></speech>

Last week the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission issued a report with regard to information as it related to a convicted drug dealer and the dealings of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in garnering information from that individual.  I have a general question to begin with.  What are the rules for dealing with people who give information?  Do we have a blanket ban, for example, on handing over money?  What are the rules with regard to prosecution when it comes to someone giving information?  Does the Commissioner have concerns that giving someone free rein in exchange for information is potentially very dangerous?  I ask the Commissioner to give the committee his thoughts on the report and the circumstances surrounding it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Callinan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013051600007#F00700"><p>First, there are clear rules of engagement in the context of the covert human intelligence source system that we have in place, referred to as CHIS, which came into being in April 2006.  Prior to that we had a slightly different system.  The CHIS system is the process by which we now handle informants.  It is very clear what the requirements are in relation to the handling of informants.  It has to be said these are extremely difficult people to handle because to have a very effective informant, they have to be quite close to the bone.  Therefore, our agent handlers who are all trained in these matters have to walk a very fine line, but the rules of engagement are very clear.</p><p>  No more than the other topic the Deputy was discussing earlier with me, there is a need to have contact logs with the people concerned.  They are told at the outset that under no circumstances can they become involved in criminality.  That is a given.  It is also the case that we do not use participating informants in this country.  I would expect that if a situation were to arise or develop where we did need to introduce an element of participation, it would be a matter of deferring to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would decide on its appropriateness or otherwise.  However, we do not give <i>carte blanche</i> to anyone to commit crime; I had very fixed views in relation to it.  I am trying not to get involved in specific cases.</p><p>  It is the case that a report is in the public domain.  It is the case that there were very heavy criticisms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the manner in which it approached the investigation.  I want to be clear and go on the record to say I am absolutely fully subscribed to the view that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, as a statutory body, is fully entitled to see all of the information we have available to us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the first point.</p></speech>

However, in response to the Deputy's question I have a clear view in regard to criminals providing information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being involved in crime.

I understand the relevant legislation is expected in June or July.  Perhaps the Commissioner would explain in practical terms what difference that type of database would make to the force and the importance he attaches to it.  The Department of Justice and Equality has cited European law issues as the reason for the delay in this regard.  Perhaps the Commissioner would set out those issues and outline the practical benefits of having such a database and the urgency in that regard.</p></speech>

I am a strong supporter of any instrument that would provide additional assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in bringing the perpetrators of crime to justice.  That is a given and would be first and foremost in the minds of those in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na charged with the responsibility of investigating and detecting crime.  I believe such a database would be of enormous benefit for a variety of reasons not alone on the prosecutorial side but in providing a clear indication of innocence, if at issue.  It would provide the type of balance that might be necessary in forming opinions, suspicions, grounding arrests and so on.  In short, I am a strong supporter of the need for the database.</p></speech>

Anything that assists us in lessening some of the burdens we carry would be of benefit.  As the national police service of this country and, given the diversity of the work we do, I believe we are well placed to enforce the road traffic laws.  Enforcement of motor taxation is one of those disciplines.  It is true that road traffic matters occupy a substantial portion of the business of the uniform section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Most if not all of the buildings concerned are the property of the OPW.  For my part, I have tried to encourage the OPW to, apart from providing for community service issues, generate interest in members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na moving into or buying the properties.  I believe this would be good for the communities.  I know there is an appetite for this because some members have indicated an interest in moving into those stations where accommodation is provided.  It would be a positive for local communities also.  However, I do not have control of the process.</p></speech>

It could be because there are now fewer vehicles on the road, greater compliance or a reduction in traffic corps numbers.  Any one of those issues might point towards a reduction.  As a result of the reduced resources available to us we have been changing slightly from traffic policing to roads policing, which means it is the responsibility of every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce the Road Traffic Act and any other matters that come to their attention, including the traffic corps.</p></speech>

I am on the record here and elsewhere in providing an indication that I felt that if the numbers dropped below 13,000, there could be difficulties in providing the type of service we want for the citizens of the country.  That is still my strong view and everybody is aware of it.  As we approach the coming months and towards the end of the year, the expectation is that we will drop below 13,000 so I would very much like to see recruitment starting again as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy raised the issue of penalty points and as mentioned, the report was clear that there was no criminality, corruption, deception or falsification of records.  We take that as a given.  The Commissioner indicated that he would have made some of the decisions that were taken or agreed with them.  How do we go forward to ensure this does not happen again and that discretion is used properly and not outside what the Commissioner would deem appropriate?</p></speech>

I am sure all of us in general experience have come across members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may have provided assistance in telling us not to be doing what we are doing or whatever.  It is very difficult to be either prescriptive or descriptive and that is the position, unfortunately.  The most we can do is provide guidance to members and when considering a particular set of circumstances, it is important to apply the principles of fairness, non-discrimination and impartiality, and garda&iacute; should be practical in what they do.  Beyond that we must consider corroboration of some of the issues we were being told, which is very good.  That will strengthen the discretionary element that exists, and I am a very strong proponent of discretion.  The citizens of this country have been very well served in the past having had those powers of discretion available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They should be reasonable, balanced and fair, and they should not favour one stratum of society above another.</p><p>  I have heard all the commentary about people being "in the right place or circle" and that things will happen in terms of cancellations, etc.  It is clearly the case, if one considers the number of cases dealt with by the assistant commissioner, the ordinary citizens of the country have benefited from that element of discretion.  I would ask that this should not be taken the wrong way or made into a headline tomorrow.  It is an area that is difficult to provide for but all we can do from a management perspective is ensure that the process is such that there is that type of oversight and audit trail available, with no fudging of documents by means of documents being lost or destroyed.</p></speech>

I have heard the commentary and it would fly in the face of logic to suggest that these are not serious matters.  There is a great degree of trust and responsibility placed on the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the basic garda rank.  As one moves up the ranks and sees the responsibility placed on superintendents, district officers and inspectors acting for them, one can see the type of responsibilities being imposed.  There is an onus on these people to behave in a manner commensurate with the position within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These are extremely serious matters and the Deputy can rest assured that they will be taken very seriously.</p><p>  We must be careful and I must stress that what we are dealing with is a recommendation from the assistant commissioner that these matters require to be investigated further in the context of disciplinary proceedings.  That is a very important distinction and the report of assistant Commissioner John O'Mahony's report examined the produced facts.  It is certainly the case that with the allegations and level of detail contained within them, the people reporting them could not possibly have seen the detail that the assistant commissioner and his team saw.  They were disenfranchised through not fault of their own and I do not make any criticism of the members for doing what they did.  That is the position.</p><p>  We must be careful when we speak about a disciplinary investigation.  The members at the centre of this should enjoy the same benefits as any other citizen of this State until the facts proven against them state otherwise.</p></speech>

The matter may come down to discretion again.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in his introductory statement that there have been cases where people would have received fixed charge notices for motor tax issues and would have been able to go to a Garda station for a certificate, witnessed by a garda, indicating that the vehicle has been off the road.  There may have been evidence that the vehicle was spotted on the road by another member of the force.  Is this again a factor of the discretionary aspect of Garda powers?  What is the view of the witness on that contradiction?</p></speech>

When somebody calls to the Garda station and asks a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to witness a signature on a declaration, that is all that is being done.  Unfortunately, there is no way of checking on a notice previously fixed to a vehicle.  The Deputy has figures indicating that approximately 78% of fixed charge notices had been paid, with motor tax being paid subsequently.  I have not gone into these figures but I assume that at some point, if the fixed charge notice connected to the vehicle is correct in the first instance, the vehicle would not have been taxed.  At some point thereafter it may have been taxed and some explanation must be given to the taxation authority in order to tax the car or pay the arrears.</p><p>  If it is the case that the notice has not been paid, it will automatically go to a summons stage.  It is at that point in court that the Garda or traffic warden would give evidence.</p></speech>

At the moment a person can walk into a Garda station and get his or her signature witnessed that his or her car was off the road and thereby avoid having to pay arrears for motor tax.  If and when the Bill becomes law, a person will be able to make a declaration directly, not involving the Garda or any other mechanism, if he or she wishes to keep his or her car off the road.  There could be reasons such as travelling abroad, illness, or the car needing to go in for repair, or it may be a vintage vehicle that is not used very often.  There could be dozens of reasons a person wants to keep a car off the road.  As long as a person gives that notification in advance he or she will not be liable for arrears.</p><p>  If a person does not give that notice in advance and presents to pay tax, the facility to go into a Garda station will be gone so that person will have to pay the arrears.  There will be no question of not paying arrears if the person has avoided paying the tax and avoided making a declaration that the car would be off the road.  Should a person be caught having made a declaration that his or her car would be off the road and it is subsequently found to be on the road, that will be a new offence.  In addition to driving the car without tax, he or she would be liable for a separate penalty.</p><p>  A person who has made an off-road declaration but decides to put the car back on the road within the period of the declaration, which could be up to a year, will be able to tax the car immediately.  There would be no difficulty with the person paying his or her tax and putting the car back on the road.  He or she would pay the tax from the start of the current month and would not be liable for arrears because of having made an off-road declaration, as required.  That is the system, in essence, and it excludes the Garda from the process and reduces the opportunity for people to evade paying their tax.  It is anticipated that the additional moneys to be collected will be approximately &euro;50 million to &euro;55 million per annum once the system is in use.</p></speech>

We have a role to play and a responsibility to enforce the law as it stands.  There may be opportunities for exploring further gantry cameras that could identify vehicles that are off the road.  I am sure that would involve additional back-up office equipment to flag those issues.  There is a whole raft of possible measures.  We discuss these from time to time with our colleagues in interdepartmental meetings, including ways and means of securing the types of compliance Deputy Nolan speaks about.</p></speech>

The enforcement of motor taxation is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners, although tax evasion is a breach of the law, but we do not see the two as being compatible.  The contract regulations and responsibilities expire in 2015 and maybe there will be an opportunity then to look at whether there is a multi-purpose element attaching to any future contract.  The cameras are well-documented.  There is no sneaky business here.  We are up-front in indicating where we are and that is based on surveys done regarding areas where a very high incidence of fatalities or serious injuries occur on our road network.  It is about compliance with road safety.  That is where we see the thrust of the Go-Safe cameras now.  There may be potential beyond that but those issues are explored, as I have said.</p></speech>

I find the answers he has given to the two main points Deputy Deasy raised - the two areas currently in the news - somewhat difficult to accept.  Maybe he could explain it to me.  Of the two inquiries we are discussing, one was held into the points system and the quashing of points, while the other was held by the Ombudsman into the activities of the Garda in the case of a drug trafficking informant.  They came up with staggeringly different results.  The inquiry the Garda held into the points system pretty well gives its guys a clean bill of health.  The inquiry held by the Ombudsman is a devastating indictment of the activities of the garda&iacute; in the drug trafficking informant case.  One was independent and the other was not.</p></speech>

There are two separate and distinct entities.  I have answered, I hope fulsomely, questions about the particular investigation that was conducted by the GSOC.  I have also indicated to the committee that I intend to respond fulsomely to the Minister regarding that report.  I certainly did not rubbish the report but that does not mean to say I have a contrary view as to the way matters should be handled.  It is extremely important to the citizens of this State when we are dealing with intelligence and the product that flows from individuals who are providing that type of intelligence that guarantees are available to the people who provide information in the first instance because, if not, we all know what are the consequences and we have witnessed over the past 48 hours the level of violence and difficulty we face on a daily basis out there.</p><p>  It is certainly the case in regard to the GSOC inquiry that the commission's file was sent to the DPP, an independent statutory body set up to adjudicate on wrongdoing and criminality.  We know the answer in regard to that.  The members of the commission have indicated that they are not pursuing the issue of discipline and, therefore, they moved towards the position we now find ourselves in with me responding to basically what are in essence allegations that we somehow or other prevented them from doing their business much more quickly than they did.  That is in essence where we are when one breaks it all down.  I have a difference of opinion in that context but I assure the Deputy - I have said this already and I do not mind going back on the record - that I absolutely subscribe to the view that the GSOC is a body with statutory powers that is entitled to see all the information and intelligence we have, sensitive and otherwise.  I have made this clear to the chairman of the commission on many occasions.  The issue is not whether the commission should or should not see the documentation; it is how that information is handled in the context of its responsibilities.  I have huge responsibilities in this area, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates.  I also have the reputation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to defend and uphold in the context of the other security services that we engage with both in Europe and beyond.  There are strict rules of engagement applying to the release of information and documents that are passed on from one jurisdiction to another and I must be careful how I approach these issues.</p><p>  There is no dispute with us there but I am not rubbishing the report.  The negotiations and the differences of opinion that we had as to how we should transact our business in this sensitive area were somewhat protracted.  There is no issue there but, equally, there is no issue that whatever needed to be shared was shared.  The commission has a view that it should been shared much earlier and so on but it would not serve the public for me to be involved in a spat with another statutory agency.  My clear view in public and private has been that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must assist the GSOC with its inquiries and investigations.  My colleagues are well aware of my views on this matter.</p></speech>

It is all very well for him to say the Garda was co-operating and there is no row.  The ombudsman commission stated that there was an absence of training in this area and a culture of non-adherence to the guidelines and that the release of papers was highly unsatisfactory.  The commission blames Mr. Callinan for the delay.  He has palmed it off and said the Garda is co-operating with the commission but it is quite obvious that the commission's officials found that garda&iacute; were uncooperative on this basis.  What will Mr. Callinan do about this?  I have reason to believe this is not only the case where they encountered this with the force.</p></speech>

There is co-operation for the Deputy.  He raised the issue of me being in a spat.  People are entitled to their opinion but the bottom line is the covert human intelligence system as we have it set up is as strong a system as we can have in place.  There is no such thing as a perfect system and we will all subscribe to that view but there are difficult areas and we have provided all the procedural guidelines and the procedures to be followed in the context of that.  I do not know where the culture of non-adherence is coming from.  There will be situations from time to time where members of the force are contacted quickly about particular issues and they have to be dealt with.  One would expect that would be the case but within all of this, there is independent judicial oversight.  The Deputy is right to raise the seriousness of this because it is an issue for all of us.  The importance of getting this right cannot be underestimated.  We are trying hard to ensure with the procedures, policy and regulations we have in place that this will happen.  It is not perfect but we have studied a few systems to arrive where we are now and we believe that, within reason, this is the appropriate system for handling informants and it is sufficiently robust to provide a level of reassurance both for our members and the people we are dealing with and their families that they can engage with us in confidence.  That will form part of my report to the Minister.  I am afraid that is where it is.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is entitled to come in and investigate any cases where it believes there is a breach of those guidelines.  That is how the Deputy will find out if matters are not the way they should be.  We must be fair here.  There is a judicial report which states that substantially - to be fair to the High Court judge who has looked at this, that is as much as he can do - the regulations are being complied with.  One will never ever get a system that is entirely bullet proof and I think that is a very reasonable point.

I am asking the Garda Commissioner if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is breaching its own guidelines and he says he cannot go there.

The empirical evidence, if one looks at the amount of detections we have had in recent times, is that one will see at a glance the evidence and product of that chase system and what it has done for the citizens of the State.  In the drugs area alone last year, over &euro;100 million was recovered and people were before the courts.  On the security side, this year alone, we have 20 people or so, before the Special Criminal Court charged with very serious offences.  None of these things come about by driving around in patrol cars and getting lucky.  That does not happen.  That is evidence of just how effective the use of the intelligence system is.  Of course, as the Deputy rightly points out, it is absolutely of critical importance that I, as Commissioner, and my senior management team and all the officers under my command do nothing that would offend against the rules of engagement in terms of handling informants.  That is as much as I can say on it.</p></speech>

Would the Commissioner consider asking GSOC to hold an inquiry into the penalty points?  Would it not be better if that body, which is independent, or an outside body, came in, in view of the fact that an independent body has been so critical of the Garda Commissioner and his carry on recently in a very sensitive area, instead of calling in assistant Commissioner O'Mahony, in whom the public may or may not have confidence but I suspect would have question marks about if the Commissioner said let us have GSOC in to investigate this issue?</p></speech>

I have already indicated my position in relation to assistant Commissioner O'Mahony, a very experienced man, a man of great integrity, a man who has been around the criminal justice for a long time, a man who has prosecuted not alone members with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but many serious criminals and a man who is now in charge of the crime and security section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the most sensitive area in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  His reputation is known far and wide, well beyond the boundaries of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its membership, and I think his reputation speaks for itself.  I have seen nothing to indicate to me that the integrity or character of Mr. O'Mahony has been tarnished or offended against in any way.  As far as I am concerned, he is a first class policeman, he is a first class officer and he produced a first class report establishing the facts around allegations that, to be fair, could not have been explored fully within the limited access that the people had in producing the allegations.  Had they been aware of the information, the further information that was available in so many of these cases, as is highlighted in the report, clearly people would come to a different view and would have to come to a different view.  Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony laid bare the facts of this case, warts and all.  That is the factual position whether we like it or not or whether we choose to have a different view.  That is the position, Deputy.</p></speech>

The problem is that the endorsement is coming from the Garda Commissioner.  That is the problem.  The Commissioner said that, as far as he is concerned, assistant Commissioner O'Mahony is a man of fantastic integrity, he is this and that and has got a tremendous record, etc.  You are the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is in your interest and in the interest of everybody sitting beside him that he produces a report which exonerates and is favourable to the Garda.  What we need is someone outside investigating it who does not have a pedigree in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not doubt for one moment anything the Commissioner has said and I do not doubt the Commissioner in any way but it is a principle involved.  For it to be a credible report, it has to come from an outsider.  What I do not understand is that the Garda Commissioner does not see that.</p></speech>

I clearly see the point the Deputy is making, but assistant Commissioner O'Mahony's report is credible and is factually correct.  It is based on fact.  Where we part company is where the Deputy says it would be better to have somebody else coming in.  There seems to be in implication that somebody else may have found the facts to be different.</p></speech>

With regard to the penalty points, it seems this is a dangerous area because, as Mr. Callinan stated, it is a matter of discretion.  It all is a matter of judgment.  Some persons will get off, some will have the points quashed and some will be prosecuted.  It will all be a matter of judgment by individual garda&iacute; and then there will be a judgment made by someone else from within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a dangerous area.</p><p>  I do not understand why there should be discretion here at all.  That is something that is incomprehensible to me.  I do not understand why these cases should not go to court so a decision can be made by a court, rather than by a garda, on whether the person is in the right, whether there are extenuating circumstances and what the penalty should be.  The idea that there should be a garda there stating, "We will let him off and we will let them off, but we will not let that one off," seems open to abuse.  There is too much discretion in that regard.  It is asking too much to rely on garda&iacute; to use the sort of discretion the Commissioner might use?</p><p>  Could the Commissioner answer my question?  Why were those making the allegations - certainly, the principal person - not interviewed in this inquiry?</p></speech>

It is the case that the allegations that were sent to me by the Department were anonymous.  We did not know who had made them.  That remained the position right up until some time in December, several weeks after the investigation had commenced.</p><p>  An incident arose in the Cavan-Monaghan division whereby one of those who were involved in this was in the station and was confronted by a sergeant.  This man was printing PULSE documents off the computer and he was asked what he was doing.  He indicated that he was printing information off the PULSE system to hand over to a political representative.  He was confronted on that and told he should not be doing it.  A discussion took place and it would not be appropriate to go into that.  Resulting from that, he indicated that he and another person were providing information to a politician with regard to the penalty points system.  The result of that was that I took advice, from both the Data Protection Commissioner and the Attorney General's office, and I issued a direction.  That is well publicised.  Unfortunately - but there you go - all of this has been out in the public domain.  I was somehow or other perceived as having put a gagging order on these persons.  In among the directions I sent down to the local command was one to ask these persons, if they had any information at all, that they provide that information to Assistant Commissioner John O'Mahoney, who was then investigating these allegations that are in the public domain, and, in addition, if they had any documents that they had obtained from the Garda PULSE system, that they hand them over.  They should not have those documents in their possession.  That is when we became aware of those persons, and those are the facts of the situation.  We did not become aware when these allegations manifested themselves in the first instance.</p><p>  Nothing of a criminal nature, as we now know, has been found by the assistant commissioner or his team.  Therefore, there was no need to approach the Director of Public Prosecutions for a view or a direction on this matter.  Had that been the case, the examination may have taken a different direction and there might then have been a necessity to go elsewhere.</p><p>  It is very clear from the report - this is an important point of which sight should not be lost - that the persons who were making those allegations did not have all of the information available to them, and one will have seen evidence of that throughout the report - for instance, where allegations were made about those involved in fatal traffic accidents.  All of that is laid bare in the report.  There are many inaccuracies.</p><p>  The other point Deputy Ross raised was the issue of discretion.  We have spoken about this <i>ad nauseam</i>.  One either accepts or does not accept that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is entitled to have discretion.  In certain cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has delegated his functions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to certain summary matters and is happy to do that, provides for a level of discretion.  As I stated earlier, how that discretion is used is key to all of this.  People will have a view as to whether that is a proper space to be in, but that is the reality.  My personal view is that I am a strong supporter of discretion.  It is a good thing to have in place, provided it is used correctly.  Without going over old ground, trying to be descriptive or prescriptive in terms of anything I can put out there to help my members towards that end is difficult beyond issuing guidelines that talk about first principles, non-discrimination, equality and practical application in dealing with a particular circumstance.  I think we would all have to agree that if a person is bringing a sick child to hospital or the tax on a car is out by a month in the case of a person who is unemployed or has lost his business, and for whom matters are absolutely going the wrong way, or whatever the situation is that confronts my members on the ground, they should have the power to deal with these matters in a humane way that is balanced and fair.  I am certainly not saying, where there are matters of such a serious nature that action is required to be taken, that we should pull back from doing our job and let others decide.  Where there are less serious offences of a summary nature coming to our attention, it is very important that the discretionary facility, based entirely on the circumstances of the case and with those principles that I have mentioned in play, continues in the future.  It has served the citizens of our country very well in the past.  With the proper use of that discretion, it will continue to be of service to the community.</p></speech>

Obviously, discretion is open to abuse.  I will leave it there.  I would have thought that was more a matter for the Judiciary than for the Garda.  An offence is an offence and I would have thought the Judiciary would be the body that should exercise that discretion.</p><p>  The Commissioner is here today answering questions, which is helpful.  It is difficult to get information out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as a body.  It appears to be fairly unaccountable.  Am I correct in saying that the Garda is not subject to the Freedom of Information Acts?</p></speech>

I have yet to receive an acknowledgement, reply or any recognition that these questions, which I can give to the Commissioner again, were legitimate or should have been asked.</p> <p>They were perfectly legitimate questions about the Commissioner's office, how much it cost to run and what sort of cars it had.

I will begin with a few points and some questions.  I acknowledge that of all the witnesses before the Committee of Public Accounts, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unique in that its members put at risk their personal safety while unarmed to keep our country safe.  I acknowledge all the great work the Commissioner and his colleagues do across all the stations throughout the country, which I see every day.</p><p>  In respect of discretion and the incentives behind producing the report that is the subject of discussion, I firmly believe the Garda should be allowed to maintain discretion in the implementation of certain parts of our law.  It would be a regressive step if we got to the point where the only people capable of implementing discretion in our country in respect of these issues were the judges and the only way of dealing with matters of discretion would be to go to court.  The issue concerns how we track that discretion and its visibility and accountability.  The incentives for the witnesses over there were to produce a report that laid out the facts in respect of the penalty points issue.  It is my judgement that this has been done.  It is up to other people to decide what they do with those facts.</p><p>  The two main issues I wish to focus on are the Garda roster, which was the subject of much discussion in previous hearings, and motor tax.  I will begin with my colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  What is the level of evasion with regard to motor tax?</p></speech>

Obviously, the way the system works is that the cameras on the M50 take an image of the registration plate of the vehicles passing the toll area.

In addition to that, it would include a very old stock of vehicles dating back to the 1970s that were recorded, had previously been or were in circulation, were taxed, ceased to be taxed over a number of years and were not re-taxed.  Some of them would have been recorded as being scrapped.  The Deputy knows the standards people applied in the past where vehicles were just dumped in lay-bys and would have gone back into landfill in some cases before the situation became much more regulated.</p></speech>

What strikes me is how high the figure is because out of the file of more than 5.8 million registrations, we are saying that 2.5 million of them are taxed and viable vehicles on the road.  Correct me if I am wrong, but this says there are 3.2 million vehicles on the file of whose taxation status we are not aware.</p></speech>

Of that residual number, one million in the grouping were over 20 years old.  Of those, 250,000 were over 30 years old, so it is safe to assume that they are not circulating vehicles.</p></speech>

For example, if one is due to renew the tax in April and does not do so by the end of April, one must make a declaration or pay the tax for the month of April in order to tax the vehicle for the month of May.

A person will be at liberty to make the declaration themselves to the licensing authority, ultimately online.  A person will not have to give a reason the car will be taken off the road.  We recognise there are many reasons.  I gave examples of reasons in my earlier contribution.  No doubt, Deputies will know of a dozen more reasons.  People will have an opportunity to make a declaration themselves.  There will be no Garda checking.  The person will not have to certify anything other than that he or she will be keeping the car off the road.  The corollary is that should they then be caught driving a car having made a declaration that the car would be kept off the road, they will be liable for an additional penalty for having made a false declaration in addition to the penalty for driving an untaxed car.  The facility will be available to people should their circumstances change, such as they are back in the country, their leg has healed quicker than anticipated, to enable them to get back on the road sooner.  They can then tax the car from an immediate date without having to wait until the expiry of the off the road declaration.</p></speech>

We think that gives a fairly robust picture of the level of evasion.  It reflects the experience of another jurisdiction which had a similar system.  We can certainly consider renewing that sort of survey when the transition period for the implementation of the legislation has passed.  We have monthly reports on the numbers of cars that are taxed, the period for which they are taxed and the amount of tax that is collected.  That is available on a monthly basis and we will be carefully reviewing the amount of tax collected to see if the Bill, when enacted, is successful in its task.</p></speech>

The degree of flexibility it affords to us on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays is something we think will address the work-life balance and at the same time satisfy supply with demands in terms of the commitments we have to policing the public.</p><p>  We believe it is satisfactory.  The feedback so far is quite positive.  There are some areas of concern, particularly in the plain-clothes departments where there are some issues arising.

There may be variations in the hours worked, of course, but the regime is still the same.

We were due to finish up but we had to extend it.  As the Deputy knows, further discussions are now taking place with the LRC and the associations.  Implicit in all of that is an agreement that the pilot will be further extended to straighten out some of the issues we have been speaking about.  Within reason, I would think that possibly towards the end of the year we should have some sort of resolution.  I hope we will.  There are areas that are causing us some difficulty.  They are things we have to iron out, but dialogue will get us there.  I am happy enough that will be the case.  I think the system we have in place will very much suit the policing of this country.</p><p>  I have to be careful again but there are discussions and it is part of the dialogue that is continuing within the confines of the LRC.

When is a pilot not a pilot?  The committee has had many different hearings in this session regarding the importance of this roster and the impact it will make in the policing of our country.  However, it is the first time I have heard it referred to as a pilot.  I thought it had all happened and was in operation at the moment.</p></speech>

That is where we sought to address the policing needs and the work-life balance and get a system in place, which is not an easy thing to achieve.  It took quite some time, over 18 months, to push that out.  Underpinning all of this, once we had the broad parameters in place, was the need for a working time agreement.  We had to go back to the associations, engage with them and work through that process.  That has had the effect of extending the pilot even further.  All of those things are in play as we speak.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge, as Deputy Donohoe also did, the co-operation that we, as public representatives, receive from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is generally of an exemplary level and if it could be replicated by other State agencies and bodies, both I and those whom I represent would be very grateful.  I thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that level of co-operation even in difficult and tense times.</p><p>  The Commissioner has addressed the penalty points issue at length.  It is regrettable that some people were in such a rush to refer to this investigation and report as a whitewash.  They could not possibly have read it at the time they were making such declarations because it was before the report was published.</p><p>  I fully agree with the Commissioner on the issue of discretion.  Deputy Ross is not here now.  If one were to adopt the approach of having to take everything through the courts, not only would it block up the courts system, one would also see some difficult and possibly emotional cases where people had genuine reasons.  Community policing has served this country well.</p><p>  I bet that when the Commissioner got up this morning, he probably did not realise he would be involved in so many spats.  I will add one more to his list, which concerns the ongoing engagement between himself and Garda management and the GRA and AGSI in the context of the LRC negotiations.  I know the Commissioner cannot read out the secret document for good reasons, but he might update the committee on where he currently believes the discussions are from the viewpoint of Garda management.</p></speech>

For quite some time, my members felt that I should be shouting from the rooftops about their pay and conditions at a time when the Government had clearly indicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and right across the Civil Service and public service what savings were required to facilitate and comply with agreements with the troika.  I had a full and frank discussion with all the associations because I was aware there are young members who are obviously struggling hard with the conditions and the circumstances they find themselves in.</p></speech>

Perhaps these limitations are historic but were not so apparent in good times when there were improvements in conditions.  They become much more real for garda&iacute; and their families in difficult times.  Bizarrely, we are now able to have face-to-face engagement with all representative bodies, Garda management and the LRC but the regret is that we could not have had it weeks previously.</p><p>  That leads me to my next point.  Many representative associations and public representatives have called for the establishment of a policing commission which would look not just at pay but at the overall structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does the Commissioner have a view on that?  Does he consider that there would be a benefit in the establishment of a such a body to carry out a review of the entire organisation?</p></speech>

I am in agreement with that.  It would be a very positive thing.  There is always an element of risk that people might wish for something to happen which does not work out entirely as they expect.  I value my membership greatly and have huge respect for the work being done and there is a real opportunity, as I have said to the Garda Representative Association's annual conference, given the level of change the Garda as an organisation has gone through.  We mentioned rosters and the change programme earlier.  They provide a very real and powerful negotiating tool.  I have no doubt that was helpful in the discussions, although I was not, rightly, privy to them.  The notion of some sort of commission is a positive one and it would be very helpful where people are reviewing allowances, some of which have been there since God's time.  There is a very real opportunity to facilitate or square off the pay elements from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who had been in receipt of these allowances.  There is greater acceptance now that these allowances were introduced at a time when successive Governments did not have the ability to provide for an increase for garda&iacute; as to do so would have had a domino effect in many other elements of the public service.  There is a real opportunity now to move the organisation and the conditions for its members forward.  I am a strong advocate of doing so.</p></speech>

I have spoken to garda&iacute; who seem to be of the view that crime is being incorrectly categorised.  For example, what might previously have been defined as a burglary is now defined as criminal damage or trespass or some other less serious offence.  I have no idea whether that is true but I am interested in the Commissioner's perspective.</p></speech>

The dimensions are there.  I do not like raking over coals but when I sought clarification from the president of the Garda Representative Association, he did not make any claim of any wrongdoing.  He was expressing a view.  I spoke to our head analyst, who interfaces with the Central Statistics Office to provide the figures.  While he indicated that the CSO has not seen any issue in terms of the information we are providing, they are, nevertheless, meeting to discuss the issue.  Days after this matter was brought to a head at the conference, I spoke to my senior management team and asked if they had any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, that this was happening.  "Absolutely not," was the unequivocal reply.  I do not know where the notion is coming from.  Perhaps it is the case that quality assurance must be addressed in the context of the material that is put on the PULSE system.</p><p>  The recategorisation of crimes occurs from time to time but the onus is on every district officer to look at offences and ensure they are being properly managed.  We have a regime in all Garda districts on crime and crime management and that is where the discussion should take place.  I am very clear and my senior officers are under no illusion that crimes should be reported and reported properly.</p></speech>

That ties in with earlier conversations to some degree.  Anecdotal evidence was given or suggestions were made that garda&iacute; were issuing cautions to motorists rather than fines as part of an unofficial work to rule or protest.  Does the Commissioner have any evidence that that happened and, if so, is he satisfied that with the ongoing LRC engagement, it is no longer the case?</p></speech>

Does the Commissioner agree with that assertion?  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very important job to do on road safety and the progress made is significant and important.  Are people sent out with a directive to bring in a certain amount of revenue?</p></speech>

Traffic people specialise in traffic matters; detectives also specialise.  They all have their particular roles.  We are very clear that we applied the law across the board, which is how it should be.  No one is bean counting.  That said, it would be naive of me to try to convince members that people do not judge us by the level of enforcement, detection and prosecution.  Generally speaking, that tangible evidence speaks to our effectiveness and it is a reasonable position to take.  That is why we always try our best to solve and prevent crime.

It refers to computer systems and technology talking to each other.  The Commissioner must excuse me as I am a layperson.  The AVPLS system tracks vehicles and personnel.  There is also a resource management software system and what is commonly called the command and control system.  I am not sure whether the three systems talk to each other.  Is the Commissioner satisfied the technology is where he wants it to be?  Are there plans to streamline or to be allocated the resources to have one overall system rather than three?</p></speech>

I am grateful to have what we have and would like to see greater integration.  However, this comes at a huge cost.  In one of the inspectorate's reports we were asked to examine regional control rooms and, within that paradigm, have vehicle location and ANPR systems joined up.  That is happening to a degree, but, because of the space we are in financially, we are not in a position to deliver on it.  Issues arise from the management perspective.  In a number of regions we have been bringing together control rooms in a division and joining up the dots in terms of resources and how they are responding and using the ANPR and other systems.  We will purchase an item of back office equipment for the ANPR system which will help us to deal with the situation when it flashes such as a car being stolen or an untaxed car.  We will then have the facility to get the information to someone fast in order that it can be dealt with.  That is the space we are trying to get to, but technology is notoriously expensive.  We have an ICT strategy group that includes Garda and non-Garda experts to examine the equipment we have and the possibility of joining some of the dots and advising us on the next step.  That is a work in progress, but financial resources are not what we would like them to be to improve our lot.  We are, however, grateful for what we have.</p></speech>

The Commissioner's opening statement refers to a reduction of 4.5% in the budget on the 2012 outturn.  The Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.272 billion.  We are five months of into the year and I presume people are projecting for the rest of the year.  There have been number of promotions which are to be welcomed, but this adds costs.

They have also said that their names were attached to this allegation.

That is forming a separate investigation.  In fact, the file has gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to that aspect.  That is there and it is a given.  That is not at variance with what I said earlier.  To assist the committee further, when this matter was brought to my attention first, I received two lists, if I can call them that, A and B.  They totalled approximately 400 allegations.  Many of them crossed, and there was duplication in some.  After the analysis of all of that we arrived at a situation where 189 separate allegations were made, and they related to 2,198 issues with tickets that were cancelled.  That is where the examination of the Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony's team led.  That was running separate to the other matter the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

Those two individuals clearly say that they brought this matter to the attention of the authorities in March 2012.  They went directly to the confidential recipient within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as per procedure, and they attached their names to this matter from the start.  The witness's earlier evidence suggests that he came upon this matter in December and that the matter was from an anonymous source.  That does not tally with what the two garda&iacute; in question, one of them a former garda, are saying.</p></speech>

To say that the complaint was made anonymously implies that the two garda&iacute; in some surreptitious manner forwarded these allegations and ran away from them.  That is not the case.  The two officers in question went through the appropriate procedure.  They went to the confidential recipient and made the allegation.  They are absolutely emphatic that at no stage did they wish to distance themselves or have a cloak of anonymity.  They were going by the book.  My concern is why the witness would appear before the committee and say these matters were anonymous.  Bear in mind, he offered that information in response to Deputy Ross's question as to why the two men in question had not been interviewed in the course of the Assistant Commissioner's investigation.  He offered the rationale that these matters had been brought forward anonymously.</p></speech>

While I do not have the precise date that the two individuals reported to the Assistant Commissioner for human resource management, it is clearly the case that a report of malpractice and corruption was made and a chief superintendent investigated those matters.  It is certainly the case that the file is now with the DPP.  Leaving that to one side, we then had a situation where I was presented with these anonymous allegations and I was asked to examine them and provide views.  I got the Assistant Commissioner and his team to look at these issues and provide the report that is now in the public domain.  That is the exact sequencing of this matter.  When I was responding to Deputy Ross, I did so in the context of whether these people had been interviewed.  The report from the Assistant Commissioner, having looked at the allegations and established the facts, did not see a need on the basis that the Assistant Commissioner had not uncovered criminality.  Therefore, there was no need to defer to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  However, had it been the case that he saw clear evidence, or even a suspicion, of corruption or malpractice within the allegations he had before him, I presume that would have triggered those people being interviewed.</p></speech>

This is to leave aside the independence of the report, or even the outcome, because that has been fully ventilated.  In Mr. Callinan's earlier contribution he painted a scenario in which a garda had been caught printing material that he says was being handed over to a D&aacute;il Deputy in a manner Mr. Callinan understands to be inappropriate.  Mr. Callinan stated the individuals concerned were not interviewed in the course of the independent inquiry because of an issue of anonymity.  I do not know whether it was by accident or design, but I presume it was accidental.  What occurred gave an entirely wrong impression of the sequence of events because, as far back as March, the two officers concerned in good faith went through the appropriate procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in making a disclosure.  They saw no response from the Commissioner and - I can only surmise - as a result of concern or frustration, they felt they had to bring these matters into the public domain.  Of course, as we now know, that is what triggered the public discussion and the inquiry into these matters.  I really do not believe it is fair at a meeting of the committee or elsewhere to suggest the two individuals in question acted in any way other than entirely properly and honourably and in good faith.  The Commissioner did not give that impression to the committee and the record needs to be corrected on that score.</p></speech>

If any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of any rank, feels there is an issue of impropriety, malpractice or corruption or another issue the Deputy wishes to name, he or she is perfectly entitled to report it, either through his or her authorities or via the confidential recipient route.  That is my clear position.  What I am saying is that if one has an issue, one should report it before going on the PULSE system, trawling records, pulling them off and handing them over.  Let us face it: we all have responsibilities when we see wrongdoing.  Every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is obligated to report any form of wrongdoing through the relevant channels or deal with it in whatever way he or she believes is best.  In this instance, if one is trawling through a policing system looking for matters that one feels are not right and produces them elsewhere, it is fundamentally wrong.</p></speech>

There was no response.  That is what triggered the public disclosure of the concern and the material to which the Commissioner referred.  That raises many questions, not least about the efficiency or effectiveness or the Garda system of whistleblowing or confidential disclosure.  How does the Commissioner account for the delay?  A serious allegation had been made through the appropriate procedural channels, yet there was no response or reaction.  I suppose the officers concerned felt they had no other option if they wished to have the matter addressed but to bring it into the public domain through whatever channel they chose.</p></speech>

I want to be very clear.  If somebody has an issue regarding criminality or impropriety of any description, he or she is at liberty to report that upwards to other channels through the confidential reporting system or straight to my office and I will have such allegations investigated.  There is no ambiguity at all.  That is my position.</p></speech>

The system clearly did not work for the individuals concerned.  They felt they made a disclosure, but that there was no action taken on foot of it.  They were clearly frustrated into a position whereby they brought matters, through a different route, into the public domain.  The response from management was an in-house investigation of the matter.  Can Mr. Callinan see how bizarre that looks to somebody on the outside looking in and how worrying that is?</p></speech>

It is my job to look at all angles.  All I can tell the Deputy is that when I was presented with these allegations they were taken extremely seriously by me, so much so that I appointed my senior investigator in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the assistant commissioner Mr. John O'Mahoney, who has tremendous experience in this area.  He put together a very senior team to look at this issue and deal with it.</p></speech>

They did, I am sure, what they felt was appropriate from their perspective.  I too did my job.

We all know that what goes through that account is, by definition, confidential.  It is the standard discussion we have every time it is discussed in the Estimates, and I accept that Mr. Callinan cannot tell us any of the details of what is involved.  Moreover, I support the Garda's intelligence processes and whatever must be done in the interests of protecting the citizens of this State.  I am coming at the issue from that perspective.</p><p>  I am wondering, however, whether Mr. Callinan has any jurisdiction in respect of the secret service account and the &euro;515,000 that was spent last year, which is a matter of public record.

We all saw an improvement last year in Templemore in Garda vetting when the time shrank from six months to three months and four weeks, but we are definitely seeing a deterioration in the waiting times again.  Why?  We are all getting complaints again in our constituency offices.</p></speech>

There is an issue.  If one goes back to the start of this process, the Garda vetting unit grew from a very small cadre of people based here in Dublin in the criminal records office and it happened around the time of decentralisation.  The vetting unit was born.  Efforts were made to increase numbers, but there were difficulties similar to those in which we now find ourselves.  The superintendent in charge of the unit put in place a system whereby organisations, authorised signatories, could verify a list of people.  For example, in the teaching profession, authorised signatories provided volumes of people who needed to be vetted such as teachers and career guidance counsellors.  The basic criterion was that anyone who had contact with children or vulnerable adults was listed.  That was purely a quality control issue and put in place in order that as best we could no one would usurp the system and claim, for example, to be Martin Callinan and ask for a clean bill of health.  That system works to a degree with limited resources.  As more and more people began to feed into the system and with the introduction of the legislation coming down the line and the need perhaps to share soft intelligence, this is becoming problematic for us.  We have managed to secure some resources.  I understand the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine-----</p></speech>

I have been handed a note which states that in 2013 to date 30% of applications are processed within three to four weeks.  They are processed on a prioritised basis and if we receive information that there is an absolute priority to process some applications more quickly than others, we have to give that serious consideration, not that one likes to differentiate one from the other because everyone is entitled to receuve clearance.  The rest, the other 70%, can take anything up to ten to 14 weeks to process.</p></speech>

We are always told it is done in chronological order.  I have one suggestion, although it may require legislation and the Commissioner can tell me if that is the case.  Some individuals have to be vetted three or four times simultaneously, for example, for employment, to be a trainer in the local sports club and be involved in a youth service organisation somewhere else.  There are multiple vettings of the same individual.  Can the Commissioner change this at an administrative level or does it require a change in the law?</p></speech>

In Vote 20, note 5.4, Settlement with the Revenue Commissioners, the Comptroller and Auditor General states:<blockquote>Included under the A.1. Subhead is a settlement of &euro;12.5m to the Revenue Commissioners in December 2011 in respect of a legacy liability covering taxes applicable to certain allowances and expense payments made to Garda members in the period 2009 to 2011.</blockquote>How did the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is supposed to uphold the law of the land get itself into such a situation?  How did that come to be uncovered?  Was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published as a tax defaulter like everyone else?  That would have been by far the biggest settlement.  How much was tax?  How much was interest?  How much was the penalty?  Given that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for detecting crime, does it show a slight ambivalence towards tax evasion and white collar crime in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it found itself in this position?  It was depriving the people of that &euro;12.5 million.  People will be alarmed to know how it came about.  Will the Commissioner talk me through the process and how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na found itself having to make a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

First, there are several allowances that date back to the foundation of the State, negotiated through the conciliation and arbitration scheme which is a statutory body for negotiating all of these things.  We made a declaration in respect of inspectors who were visiting various departments that we had X amount in allowances that were tax free.  Revenue took the view that we should have been paying tax on them.  We argued that these matters were dealt with through the conciliation and arbitration scheme and were, therefore, agreed there.</p></speech>

I am not creating an argument but indicating that we were faced with the prospect of a large tax bill because of all these tax-free allowances that had been negotiated successfully over time.

That is very current.  This is no legacy issue from the foundation of the force.  What change happened so that from 2009 onwards the allowances were taken into account?  Did the Revenue take a benign view and not go back prior to 2009?  What grade was involved?  The Commissioner spoke about inspectors going around the country.  There must be a breakdown of this allowance which the Commissioner can make available to the committee, because it cannot be in the report without his having a detailed note on it.

The banks should be paying the full price for security of their cash.  There was quite a battle over the years to get the price up.  Maybe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will make a note of that.  I hope we are not going soft on the banks.</p><p>  In the year in question, &euro;20.103 million was paid in compensation in 3,504 cases.  Of these cases, 2,595 were occupational injuries with an average settlement of only &euro;64, which we can discount, as these are very small.  The ones I am most interested in are the &euro;2.6 million paid out following car accidents to 373 people and the &euro;6.2 million paid out to 234 civilians who took actions against the State following actions of the Garda, as well as people receiving moneys for accidents in Garda stations.  In the year in question, 241 garda&iacute; rightly received payments under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Compensation Act, which came to &euro;9.756 million, an average of &euro;40,484 to each recipient.  There is a note in the report that at the end of the year 1,160 of these cases were still outstanding.  At a clearance rate of 241 per annum, it will take five years to clear this backlog, and it will bring the final figure to &euro;50 million.  When a garda is injured, why will it take up to five years to receive compensation?  I accept some of the cases in question may be in the courts, but, in fairness to the force&rsquo;s employees, most employers would try and get it expedited as far as possible.  From the figures, it appears that almost 10% of the force have cases pending that have been put on the long finger.  These members are still working while waiting years to be compensated.  This is unfair on the individual garda.</p><p>  How much of these figures are due on legal fees?  Would it be a third?  Will the Commissioner provide a breakdown of the amounts paid to the garda&iacute; injured, who deserve to be compensated for protecting us in the line of duty, and the role of the State Claims Agency in this?</p></speech>

We should change the legal process.  It is bad enough having an injury.  A car accident can be dealt with reasonably promptly without the need to go to the Circuit Court.  We are heaping stress and trauma on the member on whom we rely, as does the Commissioner, saying sorry for his or her troubles and that in five years time his or her case might come up in the High Court.

I record my deep appreciation of the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the constituency I represent, I am very conscious that many garda&iacute; go to great lengths to serve the public with courage and conviction.  It is very important to note this.  Perhaps it is because they are very visible and on the front line, but I particularly notice it with community garda&iacute; who do a great deal in liaising with the communities in which they work.</p><p>  Some time ago I asked the Commissioner at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence about white collar crime.  Looking at statistics from 2003 to 2011, I notice that there was a significant decrease in the number of convictions from 579 in 2003 to 308 in 2005.  The number increased to 352 in 2007 but decreased to 300 in 2009 and to its lowest level of 178 in 2010.  The conviction rate increased again to 223 in 2012.  I realise I am pointing to crude statistics, but there is huge concern among the general public about the slow pace of some of the investigations into the banking industry and the things which went awry in it.  Does the Garda have adequate resources to deal with white collar and, most particularly, the issue about which the general public is particularly concerned, namely, the misdemeanours in the banking industry?</p></speech>

We are trying to beef up all of the units undertaking major investigations.  For instance, if we have a major issue such as at Anglo Irish Bank, we draft people in who have previous experience in the area and other investigators to assist in dealing with some of the more mundane aspects of the investigation which need to be attended to.  Of course, we would all like to have more resources, but we just do not have that luxury with recruiting the way it is.</p><p>  There is a huge stream of work being done by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  This is a particularly complex area, as the Deputy knows.  Fraud is extraordinarily complex and it takes an awfully long time to get to the bottom of it.  One is in and out of court looking for court orders against companies and so on.  All of these things take time.  As confidentiality clauses are introduced, it is difficult.  However, we are aware that there has been an increase in more recent times and we are doing our best to deal with it.</p></speech>

In terms of strengthening democracy and respect for institutions in the country, it is important that the Commissioner and all those working under him have the resources they require.  Can he give any indication of the increase in resources or personnel involved or has he had to take them from elsewhere to work on what I accept are extremely complex fraud investigations?</p></speech>

I am concerned that those who go into Garda stations to discuss issues of concern to them are not always afforded sufficient privacy.  There have been some improvements in that regard in my own constituency.  Can anything more be done?  People are often very vulnerable when they approach the Garda desk to ask to see someone.  They sometimes find they have to wait for quite some time and, more worryingly, they have to speak about their problems in a relatively public area.</p></speech>

We would hope it can be dealt with practically.  If somebody comes to the counter to report a sensitive matter that needs to be discussed in private, they should be dealt with in that fashion.  They should not have to do their business in a waiting area where others are within sight and sound of them.  That is the practical way of dealing with such cases.  It is not always possible to have a facility adjacent to the reception area where they can be dealt with.</p></speech>

I have a final question for Mr. Callinan.  My constituents who come from less wealthy backgrounds - they may be unemployed, for example - sometimes perceive that they are not treated as fairly as people from more middle-class backgrounds.  Does the Garda have any training systems or other procedures in place to ensure its members treat people fairly at all times?  I can link this with the issue of community policing, which we have already discussed.  Some community garda&iacute; are particularly well adapted to dealing with people from all spheres of the public, but that might not be true right across the board.  I ask Mr. Callinan to keep an eye on that and to try to ensure garda&iacute; are able to deal with the public as sympathetically as possible.  Obviously, it is in everyone's interests for garda&iacute; to be respected right across society, rather than solely among those of us who may be more privileged than others.</p></speech>

We spoke earlier about the issue of discretion.  There is a need to apply the principles of equality and non-discrimination.  Those first principles, if I can use that term, should be of general application when we interact with members of the public.  That is how our people are trained.  That is what they should be doing.  I accept that we are not perfect.  People have off-days for different reasons.  That is when complaints arise.  Generally speaking, that is what should happen.  I hope it would happen.  I will convey the Deputy's thoughts to my management board when it assembles again shortly.</p></speech>

I would like to put one or two questions to Mr. Enright of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The question of off-road declarations has been well covered at this stage.  The local government fund is relevant in this regard because car tax receipts go into it before they are allocated to the various councils throughout the country.  There is a significant discrepancy between the amount of money that is given to each county on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  That is understandable because a county like Leitrim will need a great deal more support per head of population than the counties in the Dublin region.  South Dublin County Council receives the lowest <i>per capita</i> payment.  This has been a matter of ongoing dispute between the council and those responsible for the local government fund.  The most comparable county council is Fingal County Council, which received over &euro;3 million more than South Dublin County Council when the 2012 allocation was made.  The manner in which these decisions are arrived at is a source of frustration for those of us who study these issues.  I can understand why the counties in the Dublin region receive much smaller <i>per capita</i> payments than some of the smaller rural counties.  Given that there is a heavy demand for these moneys in the South Dublin County Council area, it is really frustrating that we always seem to come out worse than similar counties when these decisions are made.  Like many other areas, our commercial base has been seriously undermined in recent years because of the economic downturn.</p></speech>

I think it started in 2000.  It is based on detailed annual returns from local authorities.  It was used up to 2007.  The principle of equalisation has continued to be used for general purpose grant allocations since 2008.  As the equalisation process continues, the amount is consolidated into the baseline so that the changes made are continued through in future years.  This means local authorities will gradually move towards a position of greater equity in the amount of money they have.  At a time when funds are tight and things are generally difficult, the process used to make allocations to local authorities must ensure they have the resources they need, compared to each other, to provide a reasonable level of service.  That is possibly not what the Deputy-----</p></speech>

There was a need to look at our estate and how we manage it.</p><p>  I sent down, centrally, a request to regional commanders, the assistant commissioners, who in turn spoke to their chief superintendents and superintendents in an effort to provide a listing of stations that could be closed while still maintaining an appropriate policing service in those areas.

When a challenge was being brought to the courts to extend the age limit in what was, admittedly, a different time, I was asked to provide evidence because the advice was that someone at a very senior level needed to give it.  I was a deputy commissioner at the time.  I did not say in evidence at the time that it was my earnest belief - this is all a matter of record and is on the transcript - that 60 years of age was the not appropriate age, rather I said there had to be an age in order to provide for movement within the ranks.</p></speech>

I do not share the view on retiring at 60 years, but that is neither here nor there.  The Commissioner stated at the time that allowing people to remain would block promotions elsewhere.  Is he not doing exactly the same by remaining in his position?</p></speech>

I presume, however, that the reason I was granted an extension was that there was an age profile gap in terms of a successor.  I do not know and do not have the franchise over this.  It is the case that the current retirement age of 60 years for the various ranks all the way up to deputy commissioner provides for flexibility and movement within these ranks.</p></speech>

My second query relates to the imprisonment of people for the non-payment of fines and the cost to which this gives rise for the State.  Perhaps it might be more appropriate to allow people to pay fines over a period.  What is the Commissioner's opinion?  Is he of the view that there should be a legislative response to it?  What is the cost to the State of implementing such a costly process?  Perhaps a process that is less costly might be put in place.</p></speech>

What I am really inquiring about is the numbers.  In effect, the Commissioner is stating the answer to my question lies in the introduction of new legislation in respect of the Courts Service and how it processes payments.  The other question which arises relates to the number of people who are imprisoned for the non-payment of fines and the number who are jailed not because they will not pay but because they cannot do so.  Is there a figure and a cost available in that regard?</p></speech>

The current half and quarter year duty rates are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual rate, which rates have remained constant since 1960.  The annual income from the increased charge for half year and quarter year discs was over &euro;50 million last year.  While costs may have reduced for those paying on-line at three and six month intervals, they are not measurable as such.  I take the point, however, that because people have a smaller income, it is more difficult for them.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Donohoe who, unfortunately, cannot be with us today.  The first item on the agenda is a discussion with Amnesty International on its recommendations for the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. Colm O'Gorman, executive director, and Ms Iverna McGowan, policy and strategy co-ordinator, from Amnesty International.  As everyone is aware, Ireland has a proud record of advancing human rights internationally.  At the beginning of Ireland's Presidency, Amnesty International submitted recommendations in this area.  As the Presidency has now passed the halfway point, the organisation has reviewed what has been done to date and has made some suggestions with regard to what needs to be done during the remaining months of the Presidency.  We are looking forward to hearing their ideas.</p><p>  Before we begin, I ask all of those present to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely.  I am informed that those with iPads will also need to turn them off because they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I ask Mr. O'Gorman to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We have circulated copies of these comments and of the recommendations to members.  As the committee will be aware, we met the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the launch of these recommendations in January.  The T&aacute;naiste welcomed them and noted the Presidency's firm commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in Ireland, Europe and globally.  I am happy to state that we have had a great deal of engagement with several Ministers and key officials to date.  We take this opportunity to indicate our gratitude in respect of debriefing sessions we have been able to have with the Irish Permanent Representative to the EU.  Those sessions have been extremely useful during the Presidency thus far.</p><p>  Our specific recommendations, contained in our mid-term review, covered a range of issues including the implementation of the EU action plan on human rights and democracy, the fair treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, Roma rights, corporate accountability, violence against women, fighting discrimination, the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and criminal justice in the EU.  Our priority issues for the Presidency have been violence against women and Roma issues.  Copies of our recommendations and the mid-term review we published have been circulated to members for their attention.</p><p>  As we passed the halfway point of the Presidency, we noted some important progress that had been made, including the role Ireland is playing at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the prioritisation by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, of the protection of fundamental rights and the rule of law in Europe during Ireland's Presidency.  Unfortunately, however, there are two areas in respect of which we felt the Presidency might have been stronger.  To date, there has been the regrettable lack of engagement on EU action to combat female genital mutilation, FGM.  We were very heartened, however, by the T&aacute;naiste's comments in Brussels last month to the effect that this issue is now on the Presidency's agenda and will be brought forward.  We hope this commitment will translate to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, placing an item on the agenda for the upcoming Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in June.  In our view, this would confirm the presidency's support for the European Commission's initiative of a consultation on EU action to end FGM.  The Commission is very clear in its desire to move this matter forward and we are of the opinion that it is incredibly important that the Presidency should make a clear statement on and take action to support that intention.</p><p>  On the issue of discrimination against Roma, we hope the important political message in the Irish Presidency's statement on International Roma Day will be matched by action during the remainder of its term.  No discussion on human rights in the EU can credibly take place without serious consideration of the plight of the 12 million Roma people across Europe - 6 million of whom live in the EU - who suffer pervasive and systemic discrimination.  We welcome the invitation extended by the Chairman to Oona Mihalache to attend the plenary session of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, and give an address during the session on '"A Future for Young Europeans".  It is very important that the human rights issues faced by Roma be discussed at this event.</p><p>  As members will be aware, we came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in February.  We have also asked to come before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I wish to stress why we were so keen to come before this committee in particular.  The Lisbon treaty has increased the role national parliaments play in EU decision-making processes.  Earlier this year we met with the Chairman, Deputy Hannigan, to discuss - among other things - the Irish presidency's role in chairing COSAC.  Together with the European Parliament, the committee plays a vital role in overseeing and scrutinising EU policy.  In particular, it plays a role in strategic planning dialogues with the European Commission.  Amnesty International also engages in discussions around the state of the Union address each year, and last September we forwarded our letter to Commission President Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso on this subject to the committee for its attention.  In his 2012 state of the Union address, President Barroso called for better means of tackling the EU's internal human rights problems.  Members will be aware that the need for a new EU mechanism on human rights was also discussed at the General Affairs Council on 22 April.</p><p>  There has been much discussion in Brussels recently about the so-called Copenhagen dilemma, whereby the conditions with which we demand states should comply before accession to the Union during the enlargement process are never spoken of once any state becomes a member of the club.  This constitutes a refusal to analyse human rights issues within the European Union.  In our view there is a need for the European Union to take collective responsibility for this.  The committee has a vital role to play in this regard because it can ensure that debates on these issues take place not only at meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality but also at its own meetings in the context of the need for an EU response in respect of such issues.  Of particular note in this debate has been the Minister for Justice and Equality's prioritisation of protection of fundamental rights and promotion of the rule of law in Europe during Ireland's Presidency.  EU-level political support for such initiatives is vital if the EU is to defend its credibility as an entity founded on respect for human rights.  We were very glad also to have had the opportunity to participate at in the Presidency conference last week on the issue of "A Europe of Equal Citizens: Equality, Fundamental Rights and the Rule of Law".</p><p>  I wish to make some comments on enlargement, which will be an item on the agenda for the COSAC meeting in June.  We appreciate that the enlargement process has been a key part of the Irish Presidency programme.  We met the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Creighton, and officials from the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU to discuss these matters in more detail.  Enlargement negotiations should be engaged with constructively in order to maximise the potential to improve the human rights situation in the countries concerned.  Croatia will accede to the European Union this summer.  While progress has occurred in that country domestically in recent years, further attention will have to be paid to the position there post-accession in order to ensure that victims and their families are provided with access to truth, justice and reparations for human rights violations committed during the 1991 to 1995 war.  With regard to other countries in the Balkans, we are highly concerned about reports that continued impunity for war crimes and failings in domestic accountability could be given less prominence - as currently appears to be the case with Montenegro - during future negotiations.  We will be discussing this further with the relevant officials before the end of the Presidency in order to ensure that the accession process is used to its full potential to deliver human rights change across the Balkans.  We are of the view that it is important that these points should also be raised at the COSAC meeting in June.</p></speech>

Before asking my colleagues to contribute, I will make a few comments on the presentation.  We were delighted to receive Mr. O'Gorman's comments on the EU Presidency to date, as well as his thoughts on what we should be doing for the remaining few months of the Presidency.  Mr. O'Gorman is absolutely right concerning the need to talk further about the Copenhagen dilemma.  It would certainly be a concern of many that some of the countries that joined the EU in the last ten years have failed to live up to their commitments.  This is particularly so in the case of LGBT rights in some countries.  I have a question on that matter.  I wonder what Amnesty, as an international organisation is doing within these countries.  It is important to make that point to us and other committees so that we can put pressure on from outside those countries.  However, what is Amnesty International doing within some of these member states, not just on LGBT rights but also other rights that Amnesty International feels are not being respected?</p><p>  I wish to inform members of the committee and the Amnesty International representatives that we will be having a session on enlargement at the COSAC plenary session.  We have two speakers so far, one of which is Mr. Valentin Inzko, who is the UN's High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Sarajevo.   The other speaker is Mr. Erwan Fou&eacute;r&eacute; who was the EU's special representative in Macedonia.  He was also the OSCE's representative in Transnistria.  I am sure that both of them will be able to give us very enlightening views on the current state of play regarding enlargement from the Balkans region.  I have no doubt that the suggested questions will be raised by members of this committee, some of whom will be attending that conference.  It may also be appropriate for Amnesty International to invite people from other member states to make these comments through Amnesty's contacts there.  It is nonetheless important that these matters are raised.  Organisations such as Amnesty International are needed to educate the attendees from member states as to what questions they should be raising during that session.</p><p>  I now call Senator Leyden who wanted to make a point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1140" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013051600004#C00300"><p>First of all, I would like to welcome the former Senator, Colm O'Gorman as well as his colleague, Ms Iverna McGowan.  I served with Mr. O'Gorman for a short time in the Seanad.  It was a short time as far as he was concerned, although I have been there somewhat longer.  He played a very good role in the Seanad in that period and I am sorry that he did not continue.  I congratulate him on his appointment with Amnesty International.  The organisation made a very good choice.</p><p>  Mr. O'Gorman referred in particular to the plight of the 10 million or 12 million Roma people.  Our former committee Chairman, Deputy Bernard Durkan, commissioned a report of which I was the <i>rapporteur</i>.  The report was accepted by the Chairman and adopted by the committee, but I got all the abuse.  I never got more abuse for adopting any report before in my life.  The amount of e-mails I received was absolutely unbelievable, not one of which was positive.  I was even banned from a local pub not too far away from where I live, because I mentioned the Roma and there had been an alleged robbery in a particular location.</p><p>  The Roma do not do much for themselves, quite frankly.  Let us be honest, they do not have a good reputation.  They will have to get their own act together and there needs to be a bit more leadership within the Roma community.  I know a lot about them since I undertook work on that report.  They are certainly the most oppressed people in Europe, if not in the world.  Their numbers are enormous and they are an Indian race, not Romanians.  The Romanians are blamed because people equate Roma with Romanians.  I wish Mr. O'Gorman well in his work in that regard but, nevertheless, there is enormous discrimination against the Roma.  Each country has to take action to try to assist them to integrate.  Education is particularly important in this regard.  Some countries in Europe are very negative towards the Roma.  </p><p>  I also noted the good point on post-accession monitoring.  In the Council of Europe we have decided to monitor Hungary, which I have voted for, because Hungary has taken particular actions concerning the constitution.  We decided that we would monitor Hungary even though it is well regarded and part of the EU and the Council of Europe.  I wanted to make that point to members who are going to Europe that there should be a form of post-membership monitoring.  Therefore when a country joins the EU, we should not ignore everything it does.  A monitoring group needs to go out there to see that it complies with the highest standards of the European Union.</p></speech>

We have two pink documents - one dealing with Ireland and the other with Romania.  A set of figures is given, one of which is the Roma population.  The estimate for the number of Roma in Ireland is 3,000.  The Council of Europe estimate, however, refers to approximately 37,500.  I cannot figure out these two charts, so could someone explain them later?</p></speech>

It is a noble cause to integrate the Roma.  I have had a lot of experience of the Roma in Budapest, Hungary.  I am also familiar with some of them here in Ireland.  It is right that they, no more than Travellers, should not be discriminated against.  We have legislation to prevent discrimination against Travellers and the days of throwing a Traveller out of a pub are over.</p><p>  Is Mr. O'Gorman aware of the extreme difficulties, even today in Ireland, in attracting Traveller children into the educational system at primary and secondary level, and retaining them there?  I am speaking about schools that are most accommodating, including St. Dominic's in Ballyfermot, where they are trying to provide a wonderful education system for the Labr&eacute; Park Traveller children.  However, the most recent statistics from that school show that the retention rate is slipping because of socio-economic problems on the site and the attitudes of the Traveller community.  The school is extremely worried, although it has the yellow flag for accommodating them.</p><p>  The Roma community here has many more additional problems than Travellers.  The State is trying to accommodate them, but is Mr. O'Gorman familiar with the difficulties we are having?  There seems to be an increase in problems, perhaps because of conditions on sites where they are living, as well as the abuse of drugs and alcohol, hopelessness and suicide.  Mr. O'Gorman might give us his opinion on those matters.</p><p>  Mr. O'Gorman used the term "human rights defenders" and he has chosen nine.  How did he pick nine from all the human rights defenders in the world?  I was at the Front Line Defenders event in Dublin City Hall where a Mauritanian was awarded the Front Line Defenders award for exposing slavery in Mauritania.  I get confused about who picks these people.  We have been fighting the human rights issue of Nijinsky in Russia.  In addition, there are others imprisoned in Siberia and elsewhere in Russia but we do not hear them being mentioned.  How, therefore, does the international community decide which ones will be exposed in the headlines?</p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in enacting legislation to outlaw female genital mutilation.  Perhaps we should also be giving leadership on that in Europe.  As a white Irish man speaking to Africans and challenging them on why FGM exists in their communities, I am conscious that it is almost a rite of passage in rural parts of Africa.  Nonetheless, we do not condone it.  I saw children in villages in Sierra Leone recently and it was like their holy communion or confirmation; it was a cultural event involving the whole village.  In Europe, if there are any signs of female genital mutilation being pursued by parents or jujus on behalf of some communities, it has to be outlawed. </p></speech>

As a global organisation, we also work on them - both globally and regionally - through our European institutions office.  A priority for us in recent years has been discrimination in the EU context, with a focus on that which relates to Roma people, LGBTI individuals, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.  That has been a strong focus for us in the past number of years and it will continue to be so in the future.  At national level within member states, the organisation works on those issues where they are particularly relevant.  As part of a European and global organisation, we also feed in to the work that is happening in other countries.</p><p>  Senator Leyden raised the issue of Roma rights.  He referred to the response the committee received when it adopted an important item of work a number of years ago in respect of which Deputy Durkan took the lead.  That response speaks to the level of prejudice that exists within Irish society towards Roma people and towards members of the Traveller community in general.  When we talk about a group of people in terms of that fact that its members do not help themselves or when we make an entire group responsible for the conduct of members of a particular community, that is discriminatory.  We do not assess Irish people within our society, for obvious reasons, and neither do we assess the position in terms of how certain members of society might operate.</p></speech>

It speaks to the reasons why we have a great deal more work to do in order to challenge that level of prejudice.  However, we must also name it as such.  If we ever decide that we can discuss an entire group or class of people within society as some kind of homogenous entity which, therefore, can be held responsible for everything within that group or class, then perhaps that is where we need to start.  That is all I will say about the matter.</p><p>  A couple of comments were made about the fact that, post-accession, we must pay particular attention to what is happening within new member states.  When we refer to discrimination, we are not necessarily talking about new member states but just EU states.  In the context of the Roma issue, we have been pushing for infringement proceedings against both Italy and France with regard to forced evictions and other grave violations against Roma people.  There are very particular issues which arise in the context of Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and some of the newer member states.  However, this problem is not one which comes down to old versus new member states; it is, rather, one which exists at EU level.  In the context of Traveller integration, I would encourage the committee to engage as much as possible with the development of the national Roma strategy and its implementation.  Pavee Point, with which we engage directly, does a great deal of work on Roma rights in Ireland.  If the committee has a particular interest in this matter, I encourage it to bring representatives from Pavee Point before it in order to hear their views on the development and implementation of the national traveller and Roma strategy.</p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne answered many of his own questions, particularly when he referred to the reasons why members of certain groups - in this case, Traveller children - find it difficult to remain in education.  It is not just about schools being willing, able or positive with regard to encouraging Traveller participation.  Communities and society need to facilitate this and make it possible.  If conditions in terms of accommodation are so poor and if the socioeconomic experience of families and marginalised groups is so significant, then undoubtedly we are going to see less participation in formal education.</p><p>  The Deputy inquired as to how we will pick nine human rights defenders.  The answer is that this will be done with very great difficulty.  Ms McGowan will comment further on that matter.  In any of the work we do, we are often involved with cases in respect of which we believe there is evidence of even greater issues.  This means that if we can resolve issues relating to a particular case, we will also be dealing with more systemic difficulties.  That is one of the ways in which we prioritise campaigns, not to mention individual cases.  The term "human rights defenders" has a basis in international law.  It is a well-identified concept which the international community has established.  We select cases through a careful analysis of the degree of influence any particular group can bring to bear in respect of a certain case and what will be the likely impact - both on and beyond said case - of highlighting it.</p></speech>

The cases are adopted by our movement.  These are the cases we have highlighted via our European institutions office and in co-operation with our movement across Europe.</p><p>  Female genital mutilation is a particularly barbaric practice.  To somehow try to use the defence that it is a traditional practice does not stand up.  A harmful tradition or practice can be a human rights violation and can be clearly identified as such.  We are working, not just at European but also at global level, to address the issue of female genital mutilation as part of our work on maternal mortality and women's rights in general.  We have a very particular campaign across all 27 member states of the EU which is co-ordinated by the Irish section of Amnesty through our European institutions office.  The aim of this campaign is to try to ensure that the kind of legislation that was thankfully introduced in Ireland in recent years will be forthcoming elsewhere.  That is the type of legislation we want to see being put in place.  However, there is also a need for clear action on the part of the EU in order to address female genital mutilation within Europe.  This is a good example of why we believe there is a need for clear coherence between EU foreign policy and internal policy.  This is, perhaps, a very obvious area in which that is necessary.  If we are going to talk about female genital mutilation - and other issues - in countries where it is a traditional practice, we also need to take seriously the impact of that practice on EU citizens and people living within the Union.</p></speech>

Amnesty International is involved in a broad body of work across EU member states in respect of torture, monitoring police behaviour, Roma issues, etc.</p><p>  I will comment somewhat more specifically on our work in respect of Roma, a matter which was highlighted as a priority for this meeting.  The most important thing to realise about Roma people in the EU is that states are carrying out forced evictions in respect of them.  Roma children are being segregated in schools in EU member states.  That is the burning issue which must be addressed at European level with regard to the broader context of how serious we are about human rights policy.</p><p>  Reference was made to Hungary.  The situation there has highlighted a structural issue that exists within the European Union, namely, that if a human rights issue or crisis arises, people are left scrambling around trying to decide how to respond.  It should not be a case of considering the matter in the context of east or west.  As the Roma issue demonstrates very strongly, there are human rights issues across all member states.</p></speech>

I will be concrete with the example of the Roma people.  There is a race equality directive.  The Commission could bring infringement procedures against certain states which are blatantly in violation of those directives.  There is also political dialogue and it is working together with the Council of Europe in this regard.  However, at the moment certain situations come outside the EU box and that is where the difficulty arises.</p><p>  It is somewhat easier in external relations.  There are still inconsistences and double standards in the application of European Union foreign policy but the guidelines are clear.  This is what we request in the case of torture in a third country.  There are guidelines on violence against women.  That is one obvious example.  There are guidelines on what we ask of a third country but within the European Union we do not have a coherent European-wide policy.  There are practical steps we could take.  The 27 member states could all agree to sign and ratify the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  We have been advocating for some time for a strategy on violence against women throughout European Union member states.  The idea is that when there is a human rights dialogue with a third country and a third country asks about the European Union position on violence against women there is a coherent response.</p><p>  Reference was made to the Syria crisis.  The best thing that could be done at the moment by member states is to ensure it does not happen again that the European Union is somewhat unsure about what it will say.  There is great momentum at the moment.  This was something for which we had been advocating for approximately 15 years at European level.  It was always said that it was not the right forum and that there was no competency.  During President Barroso's state of the Union 2012 speech he referred to the need for some kind of internal response.  It is now being brought to the General Affairs Council.  We hope to see it on the Justice and Home Affairs Council as well.  At EU level there is already thinking about what an internal strategy on human rights might be.  We have the external action plan that we have talked about implementing but the question is what the internal mechanism are.</p><p>  There are 27 member states which all have other external human rights obligations under international treaties and their constitutions and obligations that arise directly from membership of the European Union.  Frankly, to say we do not have the competence to do that does not really hold.  In a concrete sense, it is important to have a serious look at ourselves, to be critical and to ensure that there is a place at EU level even within the club where these discussions are taken seriously.  That would be a great step forward and something we would be keen to see with some momentum coming out of the Irish Presidency.</p></speech>

I am a great admirer of the work that Amnesty International is doing.  It is outstanding.  In particular, I commend its work in the areas of female genital mutilation and Roma rights.  They are important projects and I am pleased that Amnesty International is putting them forward.  It was good to see that the Seanad and the D&aacute;il passed a Bill on female genital mutilation, FGM.  It was given full support by all sides.</p><p>  Ms McGowan referred to the Istanbul convention.  We held a considerable discussion on the issue last week because there was a lengthy debate about domestic violence.  It is a considerable problem at the moment in the State.  I note that the convention must be signed by ten states and we are not to the fore in that regard.  We are not leading the charge.  Does Amnesty International have an opinion on that?  Should it be one of our priorities before the end of the Presidency that this State should sign up and lead by example?  Instead of simply talking about human rights we need to practice them ourselves at home.  We tend to be good at talking about these things but when it comes to implementing legislation at home we are seriously lacking.</p><p>  I note Amnesty International's recommendations on treating migrants and asylum seekers fairly.  I contend that they are somewhat mild-mannered, to put it mildly.  We are seriously lacking in Ireland, especially in the area of direct provision, in which I have a specific interest.  We should opt in to the EU reception conditions directive.  I gather we are the only EU state that has not done so, apart from Denmark, whose reasoning was that it brought in legislation that went further than the directive.  I would have thought that this measure could have been added to the list of actions in the review card which we could have taken during the Presidency to show how serious we are on that issue.</p><p>  Where does Amnesty International stand on direct provision?  Is the organisation concerned that there is a serious violation of human rights in the direct provision system in Ireland?  Some of the organisations which campaign on behalf of people in asylum believe this is the case and they are concerned especially with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and contraventions of the convention relating to direct provision.  Specifically, there is concern about Article 8 which relates to the right to privacy and family life.  I note the statement in the Amnesty International report that there are legal and political issues hampering the implementation or development of the EU Convention on Human Rights.  Will the deputation expand on that and explain what exactly they mean and perhaps put it into lay parlance?  Who is holding it up and why?</p><p>  Amnesty International has made an important statement on corporate human rights.  Since that was put together we have heard of the tragedy in Bangladesh and the people who died there.  That focuses the mind on the necessity of working on corporate human rights.  Has that event affected the dialogue on these issues?</p><p>  Another important EU directive raised with us by the Immigrant Council of Ireland is the EU directive on the right to family reunification.   There are particular difficulties in this regard.  A study was done by the council relating to EU citizens having difficulty being reunited with family members or partners and so on.</p><p>  Most of the groups who work as advocates on behalf of these people have been affected by austerity.  What is the opinion of Amnesty International on the effects of austerity in the EU in respect of all the issued raised?</p></speech>

To follow on from Senator Terry Leyden's introductory remarks, I remember well the particular occasion which the Senator courageously and generously shared with the rest of the committee.</p><p>  Two important points have emerged.  Prejudice is something that grows if not challenged.  It grows in all societies, in developing societies and in developed and sophisticated countries.  There is a considerable amount of prejudice throughout many European countries, some of which are established citadels of democracy, and it is growing as time goes on.  It grows simply because it is accepted and it meets a situation that arises from time to time, particularly at times of economic stringency.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I hugely admire the work and objectives of Amnesty International and its notable successes around the world.  One shudders to think of what might happen in the absence of Amnesty International.  I apologise for not being present to hear the presentation but I was making a Second Stage contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I believed it was important to attend the meeting to register my support for Amnesty International and my admiration for what it does and its objectives.  I have a couple of reasons for doing so.  As a citizen, member of this committee, public representative and leader of the Irish delegation of the Council of Europe, I am aware of the clear overlap between what Amnesty International does and what the Council of Europe does.  Obviously, we have shared objectives.  I take this opportunity to affirm the work of Amnesty International and, in particular, Mr. O'Gorman.</p><p>  There is much work being done at Council of Europe level on the issue of violence against women.  I have taken part in plenary sessions in that regard.  Considerable work is being done, as should be the case.  I agree with Mr. O'Gorman that a subset of violence against women is FGM.  It is an issue much discussed at the Council of Europe.  Perhaps Mr. O'Gorman would in his response be prescriptive in terms of what he believes can be done by particular countries.  It is difficult to enact legislation that reaches into sub-cultures.  I agree without question about the barbarity of the practice and so on.  However, how one polices such practices in communities and so on is difficult.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. O'Gorman's response in this regard.</p><p>  I am also interested in hearing with Mr. O'Gorman's response to my question on domestic violence.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's fundamental point that we should sign up to all international charters on the matter.  Perhaps the Chairman will enlighten us in this regard.  I am interested in hearing Mr. O'Gorman's response to the following.  In my view, our record in dealing with domestic violence here is good.  Perhaps I am wrong but I believe that to be the case given the various levels of intervention here in that regard.  The Women's Aid charm campaign is running in my constituency and is hugely successful.  There is also a great free legal aid support system in my constituency and a shelter in Navan.  My personal experience has been that our response to domestic violence is very good.  However, I am open correction.</p><p>  Islamophobia is an issue that often comes up for discussion.  At the last plenary session of the Council of Europe I spoke about the issue of discrimination against religious groups, in particular the Coptic Christians in Egypt and Tunisia.  I also spoke about Islamophobia, which is currently a huge problem in Europe.  It arises out of the current economic position we are in and particular events, including 9/11.  All of those events have had an adverse effect on the lives of ordinary people and feed into Islamophobia.  We need to do something about this.  I accept it is not within the remit of Amnesty International or us to comment on the politics of a neighbouring country.  The local election results in the UK are disturbing and alarming in terms of one-quarter of all votes going to one particular political grouping with links to Islamophobia and so on.</p></speech>

How much of that resistance would the witnesses ascribe to institutional Islamophobia and is Amnesty International doing anything to combat that on a pan-European basis?</p></speech>

I would be interested in hearing Amnesty International's perspective on this.  I would think we deal very well with cases and provide a reasonable level of sustenance and accommodation.  We cannot do much more in these circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013051600008#G00400"><p>I will begin answering questions and Ms McGowan will follow up on the Council of Europe and EU context.  Our European institutions office covers the European region, including both the Council of Europe and the EU.</p><p>  One of our recommendations is that Ireland should set out its own timeline for signing and ratifying the Istanbul convention but the Presidency should also encourage other EU member states to ratify it.  We are back to the question of leadership.  We can speak about the role Ireland needs to play as a country that claims to champion human rights issues, quite rightly in the international context in particular, but we need to demonstrate that leadership within the EU and at national level.  If one of the founding principles of the EU is human rights, it needs to demonstrate a commitment to that principle.  This means advancing, promoting and protecting the human rights of those who live in the EU.  It cannot be limited to a dialogue around accession that is dropped from the table the moment a state becomes a member of the club.  This is a huge ongoing issue.</p><p>  We have serious concerns about conditions in direct provision centres, mainly because of the length of time people spend in them.  The major difficulty is that children are growing up in direct provision centres and we are concerned about the impact on family life, child development and mental health for those who are forced to live in one room in a contained environment.  These people are not able to live freely as families and individuals.  Although we regard this area as a pressing concern, we are not actively working in it because we do not have the capacity to do so alongside everything else we need to do.  A range of highly credible and effective organisations are focused on the treatment of people in direct provision and the conditions such people experience.  At our most recent annual conference our membership adopted a motion calling on the Government to review conditions in direct provision but we regard the timely adoption of a single protection procedure as a core solution to this difficulty.  Single protection has been a stated commitment of Governments over many years but we still do not have a procedure.  Previous Governments have proposed procedures that would allow all cases to be fully processed within six months.  When asylum seekers or refugees come to the State to seek protection it might be appropriate or reasonable to accommodate them in direct provision for a period of six months while the State discharges its responsibilities but to fail to process applications for multiple years, and permit children to grow up in direct provision, is a matter we take very seriously.</p><p>  On the effects of austerity, when the Government of the day was in negotiations with the troika over the obligations it would be required to sign up to in regard to bank debt, it would have been interesting if it had on hand a counterbalancing set of legally binding obligations to the people who live in this State.  The Government could have accepted the need to take on its obligations in the context of the crisis it faced while also asserting legally binding obligations in areas of health, education, social care, protection of humans and other human rights areas.  That is why Amnesty International views the incorporation of economic, social and cultural rights into our Constitution as a priority.  We need the added strength such protections would give to human rights accountability.  They would also give Governments a tool in making difficult decisions around how they use the people's resources to best effect in the interest of the people living in the State.  We are concerned about the impact of the economic crisis on human rights.  There is no doubt that human rights standards have declined in key areas as a result of austerity.  This is similarly evident in several European states.  We intend to do more to examine this issue more closely.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan used powerful language in speaking about guidelines and standards beyond which we should not allow ourselves to go.  We would love to reach that point but we are still discussing minimum standards.  When I speak to legislators and policy makers about economic, social and cultural rights, I sometimes get the response that these are not real rights.  When we advocate the advancement of human rights international law, we do not refer to laws we might have written as an NGO but to laws that were agreed and adopted by states.  Deputy Durkan was usefully involved in the development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  These are not aspirational standards; they are core obligations to which states willingly and voluntarily agreed.  We are asking states to respect the laws they wrote and to make them meaningful.  We ask Ireland to protect and promote the laws it developed in the international context by observing them at home and showing leadership at EU level and beyond in advancing these core minimum standards.  We are gravely concerned about the erosion of human rights standards in a number of areas.</p><p>  When we speak about a practice as barbaric as FGM, we are not adopting some distant position or sitting here as white Europeans to talk about practices in certain cultures.  Many practices in our own recent history would be viewed as equally barbaric by other societies.  We live in a State where the gravest human rights violations one can imagine were visited on marginalised groups in the interest of prescribed morality.  That might have been explained away through the norms of religious or traditional belief.  Our work on FGM, particularly at European level, is driven by rights holder participation.  We have a strong voice from women who are directly affected by the experience of FGM and who can guide our work.  Rather than speaking as outsiders looking in, we are developing our position based on our engagement with rights holders and trying to find effective solutions based on their experience and what they tell us.  We can share more information about these models with the committee if members so wish.</p></speech>

We are a human rights organisation and therefore we cannot get overly involved in the politics of this but it is an issue when we hear European leaders and other leaders, and not even political leaders, talking about resistance to Turkey based on Turkey's religious profile.  If Europe intends to be inclusive it must not constantly define "other" and exclude people, for instance, on the basis of a belief that they come from a different religious profile.</p><p>  In Turkey, and I believe it is flagged in the recommendations on accession, we have concerns, as we do about many states.  For instance, the issue of LGBTI rights in Turkey is something we believe must be addressed as a priority in discussions with Turkey about its accession.</p></speech>

Regarding female genital mutilation, FGM, when the witnesses, or we as a State, campaign against that practice do we see it as a problem within Europe or are we conscious of the victims of FGM, some of whom we might have met, who came to live in countries in Europe?  Are our consciences disturbed by what is happening in, say, Africa when we campaign or is it happening to substantial numbers of people within the European Union?</p></speech>

The Deputy will know that in the context of the Irish legislation there was a strong focus on the need for the principle of extra-territoriality to be included in that legislation because in our experience of talking to affected communities we know it is important to empower parents in particular with those principles.  This is to ensure that if they are returning to a community where they are under significant pressure to allow their children be subject to FGM they will say they cannot because when they return to whatever European country they are living in it is a criminal offence.  That is an important principle.  There is concern about the return of women and girls to practising communities, the practice within the EU but also how we respond to EU citizens and people living within the EU who have been subjected to FGM.  There is a broad range of concerns.</p></speech>

It is about it happening in Europe but also about European neighbourhood policy in that respect going beyond the borders.  It is also about strengthening the calls at the United Nations for concrete policy and legislation.  A question was asked about what we can do in concrete terms to fight against FGM.  Amnesty International has an e-learning tool for health care providers which goes into detail on the practical steps because all too often legislation is adopted but not implemented on the ground or dealt with.</p><p>  With regard to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, our office is called the European Institutions Office because we deal with both the European Union and the Council of Europe.  Members will find in the mid-term review of our evaluation that we welcomed that finally, the draft agreement for EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights has been agreed.  The challenge now is the so-called internal rules.  One of the actions we called for in the mid-term review is a more transparent dialogue on what these internal reviews will entail.  Will they serve to limit what ultimately will be the consequences of EU accession or will they be in line with the purpose and cause of that convention, namely, to protect and promote human rights in the European Union?  That is a pertinent question.</p><p>  In terms of corporate accountability, the incident in Bangladesh brought that to the forefront again.  We have found working on corporate accountability at the EU level that progress has been slow.  We are involved in a number of negotiations on more technical issues.  However, we believe there is a need for a broader discussion on what we can do in terms of implementing the UN guiding principles on business corporate accountability at EU level.  We can provide the committee with a more detailed response on that at a later date.</p><p>  With regard to Islamophobia, last year Amnesty International released a report on discrimination against Muslims in Europe, to which I would invite any interested members to refer.</p></speech>

To some extent the problems can be institutional in that even if they are protected by law there is not proper follow-up or there is impunity for crimes committed at the time.</p><p>  At EU level Amnesty International is engaging with the European Commission progress reports and also the European Parliament progress reports on enlargement and insisting that LGBTI rights should be included in those.</p><p>  Within the European Union we engage at EU level on legislation on hate crime. <b></b>We are also due to have a regional briefing released in September or October on the thematic report on LGBTI issues.<b></b>We also offer a good<b></b>deal of support and are working with LGBTI prides.  Members will be aware that Baltic Pride is coming from Vilnius and therefore in the context of the Lithuanian Presidency, we will be combining those two efforts and working in concrete terms on that.</p><p>  On the more technical questions, we could send a follow-up submission to the committee.

We have a number of local representatives to discuss the proposed and, as far as this committee is concerned, infamous Narrow Water Bridge.  The issue has been on the committee's agenda for a long period.  I acknowledge the members for keeping this high on the agenda.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Jim Boylan, president of Warrenpoint Chamber of Commerce, who is joined by Mr. Mark Kelly and Ms Olga Fitzpatrick.  We extend a warm welcome to them and we look forward to their contributions.  I also welcome Mr. Paddy Malone, outgoing president of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, who is joined by the incoming president, Mr. Paddy Matthews.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.

In our area, Mourne, Louth and Carlingford Lough, it is not working for us.  Narrow Water Bridge ticks so many boxes in the Good Friday Agreement, which refers to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity in section 6.  There is a lack of economic growth and we have pursued the Narrow Water Bridge project as a means of increasing economic growth in our area.  Aspects of the business case put forward by Louth County Council show that employment growth potential after the completion of the bridge will be upwards of 270 jobs.  With such spending power in our local economy, we see further potential for growth.  Our emphasis is not only on tourism, but also local commerce.</p><p>  The project also ticks boxes in respect of social cohesion in urban, rural and Border areas.  We live in a Border area that has become, in recent years, inaccessible.  The documentation we have provided shows we have had contact with our neighbours from the earliest times.  When we lost the Warrenpoint-Omeath ferry, communities on both sides of the lough suffered.  The tourism industry died and the Narrow Water Bridge is our means of regeneration.  Not only have we rekindled cross-Border relationships in pursuit of the project, it has brought both communities along the Mourne coastal region much closer.  We see our future as being dependent on one another.  Warrenpoint, Kilkeel, Newcastle, Omeath and Carlingford cannot survive on their own.  We must co-operate along the coast and across the Border to survive.  Relationships between the communities in the Mourne coastal communities have improved beyond recognition in pursuit of this project.  One of our members said that creating employment, retaining employment, putting food on the table, filling oil tanks, and keeping the doors of our businesses open surmounts any divisions.  Divisions remain but constant conversations have been breaking down the barriers between ourselves and our neighbours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Malone" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013051600003#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  Over recent years, we have worked together with Newry and Mourne District Council and the various chambers of commerce to try to build economic stability in the region.  The memorandum of understanding signed by Louth County Council, Newry and Mourne District Council and the various organisations, including Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and Warrenpoint Chamber of Commerce, has been a catalyst in creating both an environment in which we can all work together and a network, which is allowing this area to develop.  That MOU is unique in Europe and is recognised as such because the original documentation was signed in Brussels.  The memorandum addresses a number of issues of mutual interest but it is primarily aimed at regenerating the area.  The tourism potential is enormous and that is what makes it so important.</p><p>  A report published by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government ten days ago indicated that Dundalk is the weakest gateway town of the nine gateways in the country.  Our unemployment rate is 25% above the national average.  We were well aware of these figures because the two chambers of commerce, Louth County Council and Newry and Mourne District Council commissioned a report three years ago which highlighted this.  The Department's report reinforces the message.  We have nine gateways in the South, and Dundalk has the joint lowest score, together with Letterkenny.  This indicates that the Border area is a major problem, not just in County Louth.  The fact that both towns with the lowest score are on the Border is an interesting factor.</p><p>  We need to get those in the area to work together as a unit.  Members of Newry and Mourne District Council sit on the Louth Economic Forum and one of its major recommendations is that when we address the infrastructure of County Louth, we should automatically think of Newry and Mourne at the same time.  That is the thinking that is going on within the various organisations and we need this bridge, which will give a physical dimension to what people want on the ground.  It is for that reason that we believe strongly that because our unemployment rate is so high, the unskilled and semi-skilled jobs which are needed will be provided by the tourism and construction industries.  As Mr. Boylan said, construction alone would generate 200 jobs.  That is what makes this so important.  The PayPal jobs and other jobs we have attracted to the town over the past 12 months have had an impact on one aspect of our economy but not on the other.  PayPal is employing as many people from the North as it is from the South.  When we talk about major industries going into the area, we do not stop at the Border.</p><p>  One of the first calls I received when we were looking at PayPal was from a councillor based in Newry who is a member of Newry Chamber of Commerce, and his first question was: "How do I get into PayPal?"  We have set up that relationship in order that we work together all the time.  This bridge will be a physical manifestation of what we in the chambers of commerce have been seeking for several years.  I first met Mr. Boylan about this project four years ago.  We believe strongly in its economic impact on the area, which is needed.  This is an area of major deprivation.  Newry is ranked the second worst area in the North after Strabane, and it includes the greater Warrenpoint area.  It is an economic blackspot both north and south of the Border.</p></speech>

As Mr. Boylan outlined, it could have tremendous economic and tourism benefits for the area with the potential for 270 jobs.  That would only be the tip of the iceberg because it would be like opening up a Brigadoon to the rest of the country and tourists from abroad.  It is a unique area which could attract many thousands of visitors annually.  Having attended one of the meetings in Warrenpoint, we stopped at the Carrickdale Hotel on the way home, and I met two people from Navan, County Meath, who had spent five nights in Carlingford.  They said if the bridge had been in place, they would have spent two weeks in the area.  That is an example of the potential benefit to the region.</p><p>  Mr. Boylan said the project would create and maintain employment.  Mr. Malone was too modest to say he commissioned the McCardle report which had all the results for Dundalk two years before the gateway report.  He has his finger on the button regarding economics in the Dundalk area.  Mr. Boylan was passionate in his delivery but all of us in all parties are passionate about this project.  It is not a political project for us anymore.  We want to support Mr. Boylan in his quest to have this delivered and that is why it is important that this be promoted by everyone as a business project.</p><p>  What are Mr. Boylan's fears?  The project is at the stage where the bridge order has been advertised and the decision will be made by 15 June.  The letter of offer from the Finance Ministry in the North will then issue.  Are there fears that this might not happen?  Has he information on the response to the bridge order advertisement?</p></speech>

It seems I have been working with them collectively for a lifetime to deliver this most important project that will link Cooley in County Louth with my constituency of South Down, particularly Warrenpoint and the Mourne Mountains.</p><p>  I am in no doubt about the economic and social benefits this will bring to south Down in terms of opening up an avenue of investment that has not been available to us until now for visitors, tourism, investment and new business.  In Warrenpoint, planning permission has been granted for vacant buildings in the square to be converted to retail businesses.  That would not have happened without the good news about the bridge.  The planning authorities on both sides of the Border have provided planning approval, marine consents have been provided, along with funding from SEUPB  to the tune of &euro;17.4 million and the Irish Government has provided matched funding of up to &euro;4 million.  The only outstanding elements are the bridge order to facilitate navigation, which is currently out to consultation.  The committee will recall that Newry and Mourne Council, Louth County Council and the DRD have provided the funding that will adjust the mussel boats, allowing navigation under the bridge when it opens.  That impediment will be removed.</p><p>  The remaining impediment is the outstanding funding, about &euro;2 million for the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Northern Ireland Assembly has already approved a motion on a majority vote in November indicating this project would have major economic and social implications for the whole of the area between south Down and County Louth.  I ask both chambers of commerce what they foresee as the forthcoming economic and social implications once the bridge is complete.  How will it transform our landscape and economy?</p></speech>

I am sure there are many who have had long-standing relations arising from this project.  The argument over its benefits is not an issue, those are accepted by all but a small minority.  I was up Slieve Martin a few weeks ago and passed the new bicycle trail.  The majority of cars parked there were from Waterford, Kilkenny and similar areas, with people coming on a Sunday morning because it is easier to get through Newry to access the Warrenpoint side of the lough.  We can see the potential investments for the Mourne Mountains area by both councils to attract visitors and have an exchange up and down the east coast.</p><p>   I know from my experience as the Minister for Regional Development for four years that there is no technical or environmental issue that could not be addressed; it is down to the Department of Finance and Personnel giving the go-ahead.  If officials are not given political direction to move, they have a habit of allowing things to stagnate.  It is clearly a matter of political direction being given at senior level in the Department of Finance and Personnel to get this over the last hurdle.  A huge amount has been done, particularly by Louth County Council, which has carried the project.  There was a time when many people thought this was pie in the sky but it carried it right through and brought it to the point where it secured the crucial funding from Europe.  It is a matter of the Department of Finance and Personnel in the North stepping up to the plate on this.</p><p>  I assume the two chambers want elected representatives on both sides of the Border to use this committee's influence to apply pressure.  We will ask the Taoiseach to raise this directly with the First and Deputy First Ministers and will ask the Minister for Finance to raise it with his counterpart in the North.  The committee should apply whatever pressure it can on this because the economic benefits are clear.  The great pity would be if this is missed because of some bureaucratic stagnation.  It is not just the loss of the benefit but the loss of the funding for the area from the EU would be massive and the reputation of both Administrations when it comes to accessing EU money would be damaged, which would have implications for funding for Ireland as a whole.  We are happy to hear from the chambers of commerce about what they would like the committee to do to press support for this case.</p></speech>

This project must go ahead.  Almost 90% of the funding is in place, sourced from the European Union and our own Government, and the case has been well made.  There is huge potential in the Carlingford Lough area, north and south of the Border, for the tourism industry.  It is on the east coast and is a short distance from both Dublin and Belfast.  With the road network now both cities are easily reachable, which gives that added benefit when attracting visitors.  It is an area with massive potential that I have visited many times.</p><p>  I was involved in the early 1990s with the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which is now the Erne-Shannon waterway.  That project was announced in 1989 and completed by 1992, at a time when there was no political co-operation on this island or between east and west.  We were going through very difficult times politically and the cost of the project at the time was &pound;30 million, well in excess of &euro;40 million now.  That was at a time when there were challenging economic problems facing the country both North and South.  At that time, the leadership and commitment was there to restore a canal and it has added tremendously to the tourism potential of Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim, and to the broader inland waterway network.  That was a time when the project did not have full political support North or South.  Senator Jim D'Arcy mentioned this commmittee has total political support and my colleague Deputy Kirk has tabled questions to the T&aacute;naiste today on the issue.  It will add considerably to the tourism product for all of the Ireland.</p><p>  When we think that marketing the country as a tourism destination comes under the remit of one of the all-Ireland implementation bodies, it would be a disgrace if this project is not brought to fruition at an early date.  It merits the full support of everyone with an interest in the future of this island, North and South.  I commend those representatives in the local area who have in more difficult times championed this cause, along with other groups like the chambers of commerce.  I do not doubt that this will be of great benefit, not just for Louth and south Down, but for a much greater area and for the Irish tourism product.</p></speech>

This is a very serious matter, as previous speakers have said.  This project must be completed in the short term.  It is of significance to the whole island of Ireland.  The objective is to ensure that two communities can integrate with one another in as short a period of time as possible, across what is a very short bridge.  The economic gains to be had from the completion of this project, as stressed by Mr. Malone and Mr. Boylan, cannot be overstated.  It is imperative that this committee provide whatever assistance is needed to bring this project to completion as soon as possible.  The Labour Party members of this committee have been raising this issue with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, for some time and will continue to do so.  We must ensure that the North-South, east-west political aspect of this issue is at the top of the agenda.  We must ensure this project is given priority because it will reinvigorate Counties Louth and Down, drawing tourists to those areas from all over the country.  The bridge will shorten trips for the local community by 40 minutes, which is a significant amount of time, particularly for business people.  The bridge will also enable the development of a new empathy between the communities on both sides of the Border, as well as improving employment and economic prospects in the area.  It is a wonderful area to visit from a tourism perspective and has enormous potential for further development.  We should not let that potential go untapped for the sake of what is, in today's terms, a small amount of money.  In terms of investment, the sum involved really is quite small.  It is disappointing that the project is being delayed.  There is enormous potential here and this committee must continue to press this issue and prioritise it.</p></speech>

The submission given to the committee refers to the bridge and its potential to become a symbol of reconciliation and peace.  Bridges unite communities and bring people together, negating divisions.  In that sense, it is a very positive project.</p><p>  I read media reports recently concerning Mr. Jim Wells, one the MLAs for the area.  He was asked about the delays and said that it was a very important project, involving a lot of money from the EU.  He said it was necessary to make sure everything is kosher with regard to the project.  That seems very reasonable.  The witnesses made the point that the project ticks all of the relevant boxes.  However, part of the problem is that this is a North-South project, which may not tick the correct box in terms of finance for Mr. Sammy Wilson, MLA.  It may not tick the box for many of his colleagues.  The witnesses may not want to go into the political issues here, but are they concerned about a dead hand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> this project because it does not tick the boxes for certain people?  Are they worried that the project will not go ahead?  What is the timescale for the completion of this project?  Are the witnesses concerned that this will be investigated to death?  How wide is the window of opportunity here in terms of this project actually going ahead?</p></speech>

This is a wonderful project that will be hugely beneficial to the local and national economy.  Mr. Malone made reference to the fact that unemployment in the Dundalk area is 25% above the national average, which equates to an unemployment rate of 17% or 18%.</p></speech>

The amount of money required to complete the project is small.  Have the witnesses been given any indications that the project will go ahead?  It is important to stress that this committee is 100% behind this project.  We will do everything in our power to influence the people who will be making the decisions.  I wish the witnesses well in their endeavours.</p></speech>

It is good to see so many local representatives at this meeting, including Deputies, Senators and Members of Parliament, which demonstrates the high level of interest in the Narrow Water Bridge.  A lot of hard work has been done so far.  We are close to the end and it is very important that we seal the deal.  A lot of money has already been spent on this project.  In that context, I wish to commend Louth County Council on its investment of more than &euro;2 million in this project to date.</p><p>  The bridge is an appropriate symbol of peace between North and South.  There has been a lot of conflict between the North and South for many years but this will help to bridge any gap that remains between the communities on both sides of the Border.  In recent years, a tremendous amount of friendship has built up between Border communities.  The bridge also has the potential to create many jobs North and South and to enhance the development of tourism in the area.  </p><p>  I thank all of those involved for their work on the project so far.   It is good so see so much cross-Border and cross-party co-operation, which demonstrates how, when people put their heads together, much can be achieved.  Much of what has been said this morning has been positive in tone.  We must remain positive in order to reach the finishing line.  As a new Deputy in the House, I am delighted to have had the opportunity to meet so many public representatives from Northern Ireland.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.</p></speech>

Is there a letter the committee could write or a representation we could make on behalf of the project?  Who should such a letter or representation be made to?  I am interested in the practical steps that could be taken to move the process forward.  Everyone here believes in the validity of the project and is supportive of it.

It is a great example for everyone to see them here today, working together for the good of their community.  I wrote a letter about the bridge to various newspapers on April 10.  I said that it was clear that the communities on both sides of Carlingford Lough are excited about the golden opportunities the Narrow Water Bridge could bring in boosting the local economy and tourism in the strikingly beautiful Cooley Peninsula and Mourne Mountains.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.694" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/945" speakername="S&eacute;amus Kirk" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013051600006#E00200"><p>I join the Chairman and previous speakers in welcoming the joint delegation from chambers of commerce in the North and South.  It is entirely appropriate that the group should attend a meeting of this committee to advocate for a worthy and worthwhile project in the north east.  It goes without saying that the Narrow Water Bridge project has been a long time in gestation.  I have vivid memories of attending meetings in the Park Hotel in Omeath long before the peace process commenced.  At the time, a number of people on the southern side of Carlingford Lough were strongly advocating exploring the potential of the project, with a view to progressing a bridge across the lough.  The proposal was met with considerable scepticism.  People did not see merit in the project when it was first proposed in the 1980s, a period of significant economic difficulty.  The peace process has created a powerful dynamic for those pursuing the project.</p><p>  A bridge across Carlingford Lough would have clear economic benefits.  Anyone who is familiar with the geography of the Mourne Mountains and Cooley Peninsula will acknowledge that the area is largely undiscovered by tourism interests and remains undeveloped in many respects.  This key infrastructure project would make a major difference.  Apart from bridging the Newry River at Narrow Water, it would act as a powerful symbol and send a message that the peace process is working.  It would be a sign that the Stormont Executive is willing to flex its muscles and proceed with worthwhile, cross-Border projects where they provide clear and tangible economic benefits for both the North and South.</p><p>  The benefits of the project would be felt not only on the Cooley Peninsula, in Dundalk and around the general north County Louth region but also in south County Down and further afield, including County Armagh.  I have long advocated development of the tourism industry in the three counties in question.  Tourism development in the region has lagged somewhat for reasons those present will fully understand.  I know a number of the older sages in the Omeath area who used to tell tales of people, mainly from Belfast, travelling to Warrenpoint in the 1940s and 1950s, before crossing to Omeath by ferry.  While there was a considerable demand for private transport to Carlingford, the village of Omeath was the tourism Mecca in the Cooley Peninsula at that point, with Carlingford regarded as something of a backwater.  I can say this now because Senator Terry Brennan has left the meeting, although I accept that the status and standing of Carlingford has changed considerably in the intervening period.  The caravan park at Cranfield on the northern side of Carlingford shows that the gravitational pull of the lough is also strong on the northern side.</p><p>  As I stated, public meetings on a proposed bridge were held at the Park Hotel and other venues in the 1980s.  At that time, the Oireachtas Members in north County Louth were the former Deputies Dermot Ahern and Brendan McGahan and myself.  We did our best to progress the project and keep it on the political agenda, and I am pleased it is still on the political agenda.  Of all the projects to come onto our radar, it will be of major benefit to north Louth and south Down.  Let us get on with the project.  Anyone who has any influence with the finance Minister in Stormont should nudge him gently towards accepting the merits of the proposal.  A financial package has been put together by the special EU programmes body, Louth County Council and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The missing link is the Northern Executive, which must also provide funding.  I hope the project can be progressed.  A delegation met the Taoiseach when he visited Dundalk recently and made a strong case for making direct contact with Mr. Wilson in an effort to move the project forward.  Anybody else in the political arena who has influence on the Minister should exercise that influence.</p><p>  Is there any merit in seeking a meeting with the Minister?  Perhaps a representative group could sit down with him to discuss the benefits of the project and identify any perceived hitches that may arise.  At this point, I do not envisage any problems as the proposal has been thoroughly examined from a technical, economic and political point of view.  Let us hope, therefore, that the project can be progressed.  It may not be appropriate to arrange a meeting with Mr. Wilson.  Others may be in a better position to decide whether it would be a worthwhile to do so.</p></speech>

It is great to have before us people with vision who have been able to keep the proposal for a bridge over Carlingford Lough on the political agenda for so long.  I am positively disposed towards the project because north County Louth and south County Down are beautiful areas.  Building the bridge would be an important symbolic gesture of the progress that is being made.  What practical steps can the joint committee take to advance the proposal?  Should we arrange a meeting with or write to the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the North?  Members must decide at the conclusion of this meeting on the course of action we will take.  We should do something tangible to try to advance the project.  I wish the delegation well in its efforts.  Everyone present is positively disposed the project, which I hope will be advanced shortly.</p><p>  Cross-Border tourism projects that have proceeded in the past have promoted development along the Border and helped attract visitors to the region from home and abroad.  As a frequent visit to north Louth and Carlingford, I am aware of the hassle one has in trying to visit Warrenpoint or Rostrevor on the northern side of the lough as one must travel through Newry first.  People from either side of the lough would definitely travel to the other side much more frequently if a bridge were in place.  The project would also develop the economic potential of the area. </p></speech>

Fair play to them.  This is how things work.  Notionally, the final decision on the project rests with the northern Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr. Sammy Wilson.  One needs to give careful consideration to whether it would be of benefit for the committee to write to Mr. Wilson given that the DUP's position is one of opposition to the Good Friday Agreement.  While it is clearly not opposed to the Agreement, which it is working, it may be a bridge too for Sammy to receive correspondence in the name of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Committee.  I have been in touch with the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Danny Kennedy.  It would be preferable for people to try to have a word with Mr. Wilson in a corridor, rather than in a formal setting.</p><p>  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il.  There may be merit in the joint committee writing to the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste requesting that they intervene with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</p></speech>

It is great to see them here.  I must congratulate my brother and acknowledge his contribution.  There is obviously no conflict of interests because we are all on the same page.  </p><p>  I highly commend Mr. Malone for the tremendous work he has done in this area in conjunction with Mr. Mathews, the other members of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and the members of the Warrenpoint Chamber of Commerce from across the Border.  It was a fantastic achievement to even get that far.  As Mr. Boylan stated, it is symbolic gesture.  In the context of the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the bridge would be a symbolic and physical manifestation of unity and how far we have come, North and South.  Several of us spoke about this matter at the recent chamber of commerce lunch relating to the announcement of PayPal's expansion, which was attended by the Taoiseach.  Ms Margaret Richie was particularly passionate in her comments on the matter that day.  We all know that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are on our side in respect of this project and are very much in favour of it.  I had a lengthy meeting with the T&aacute;naiste on the matter ten days ago and assure those present that he is doing everything possible to ensure the project will proceed.</p><p>  Deputy Conlan inquired as to what we could do.  At our meeting in the Carrickdale Hotel we all agreed that we could talk but that action was required to keep matters moving.  I hope there will be progress in the coming weeks.  The bridge will open up the entire eastern region in the context of economic progression and tourism.  Reference was made to construction jobs.  I am aware that there are EU directives which obtain in this regard, but I hope that, in so far as is possible, such construction jobs will be geared towards and benefit local firms and people.</p><p>  It is great that everyone is on the same page in this matter and that there is full cross-Border support for it.  I, for one, am dying to cross the bridge.</p></speech>

However, there might be merit in also sending the letter - with the names of all the individuals present at this meeting attached - to Mr. Sammy Wilson.  I accept that he might be irritated by our raising the issue, but there is no doubt that it must be done.  Whether it is a gentle nudge or a kick in the arse, Sammy needs to wake up to the fact that this project must proceed.  I apologise for the language.</p></speech>

The two Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  We have already spoken to the Taoiseach and representations have been made on an individual basis to Prime Minister Cameron.  The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister must act together to bring pressure to bear on the Northern Ireland Executive in order that the remaining funding will be released.  This would allow for the construction of the bridge within the short timeframe for delivery.  If the project is not delivered in time, there could be consequences.  We would appear pretty damn foolish in the eyes of the European Commission and the European Union if money had to be returned.  That cannot happen.  We must approach the two Prime Ministers to put pressure on the Northern Ireland Executive.  By all means, we should write to the Executive to outline why the bridge needs to be delivered.  I would send a copy of the letter to every Minister in the Executive.</p></speech>

I represent a small, family-run construction firm.  The construction industry has been decimated.  If the project goes ahead, it will ensure some people will be able to remain at home rather than emigrating.  The jobs relating to the project would be of assistance in helping to end the recession which I have no doubt will end.  Those involved in the construction industry, North and South, have highlighted the fact that there is a great economic multiplier to be gained from construction projects.  For every &pound;1 or &euro;1 spent, there is a multiplier of 2.85 in the wider economy.  That would mean more jobs just by getting the construction project off the ground.  My colleagues will comment further on the economic benefits that will accrue beyond this.  I thank the joint committee for its time.</p></speech>

There is no point in reiterating what has been said.  We are all on the same page when it comes to supporting the bridge project, but I wish to make two points which have not been made.  The first relates to the historical implications of the bridge.  This will be the first bridge to be built between southern Ireland and Northern Ireland since the formation of the State.  That is a momentous development which will help to increase tourism.  People will come to see the bridge because of its historical implications.  The second point is that tourists who arrive in Dublin or Belfast usually stay on the motorway and do not come off it to visit our area.  However, the bridge will provide an incentive for them to come and visit.  This will increase the level of tourism in the area.</p></speech>

As far as we are concerned, tourists do not venture as far as the Border because the infrastructures are not linked in the way they could be.  As the owner of a transport company which regularly operates on both sides of the Border to accommodate day-long and extended tours, I see the benefits of the new markets which could be opened up.  My company brings the message on cross-Border tourism to trade shows all across the United States.  There are five American tours travelling around the area.  We will be on a further trade mission from 5 to 17 June which will target states on the west coast of America such as Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, etc.</p><p>  It is important to highlight the peace dimension of this matter.  Three of the tours to which I refer are from the University of Georgia, Allegheny College and the University of Pittsburgh.  Those on the tours are studying the effects of the Good Friday Agreement on our shared history in the Border area, the undiscovered jewel in the crown of Irish tourism.  We need to encourage as many people as possible to experience both sides of it.  The tourism potential is huge.  These two beautiful areas which span County Louth and south County Down bring an additional focus on Carlingford Lough and its environs.  The bridge would improve connectivity between the new Boyne Valley drive in counties Louth and Meath and the Mourne coastal drive, as well as being an attraction in its own right.  We have invested heavily in this project and hope it will go ahead.</p></speech>

Someone inquired as to what we were seeking the joint committee to do.  This is part of the Good Friday Agreement which, as we see it, is between the two Governments.  In that context, pressure should be brought to bear on them.</p></speech>

Effectively, the region stretches as far north as the Giant's Causeway and as far south as Glendalough.  Some 3.1 million people live within 90 minutes of Dundalk, Newry and Warrenpoint.  That is the size we are talking about.</p><p>  The Louth Economic Forum operates under the chairmanship of Padraic White, and I wish to acknowledge his work.  The forum has strongly recommended that we include the Slieve Gullion area of Armagh as part of this.  It is critical to understand that the area cannot sell by itself.  The Cooley Peninsula will not work by itself, the Mourne district might work but Slieve Gullion by itself will not.  However, the three areas combined offer a genuine alternative to the Cork-Kerry axis, with all due respect.</p></speech>

I propose we write to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and include a full transcript of the contributions today.  Each member is reported in the transcript.  I propose to encourage the Taoiseach, who has regular contact with the British Prime Minister, to use his influence to highlight the importance of this project and to press for a decision.

We should write to Westminster and Dublin with the ultimate objective of getting a decision from the Executive.  I thank members for their contributions and I thank the witnesses for the presentations today, which we welcome.  Mr. Boylan put it in a nutshell when he said that it is not about politics but people.</p><p>  If the witnesses want to do some research, there is a bridge in Donegal from the Fanad Peninsula to the Rosguill Peninsula.  Prior to the bridge being built, all the talk was of the bridge, but no one mentions the bridge any more.  Now, people there talk about being able to go to the post office, going to get a pint of milk and going to mass.  The whole dynamic of the communities and their interaction has changed.  At one stage, like Warrenpoint, south Down and County Louth, there were ferry boats, but there are no ferry boats there anymore.  Mr. Boylan put it well when he said it is about people, not politics.  We support him and thank him for coming today.</p></speech>

Ms Jo Corcoran is here as well.  No doubt they made the trip down this morning from Derry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Brown" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013051600009#H00200"><p>Much that has been spoken, in terms of the armed conflict in the North, primarily centred around paramilitary and State violence.  Victims have spoken movingly of their stories, their quest for justice and justice denied.  Horrific as this violence was, and continues to be in some cases, there is another masked and hidden violence.  Thousands of victims have gone to Rape Crisis Centres, counselling, Women's Aid and other organisations because they suffered horrendous domestic and sexual abuse.  They are victims of hidden crimes or what the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 refers to as a political crime.</p><p>  We refer to this type of violence as being hidden.  It is generally and inadequately reflected in the reporting of crime statistic figures in the North.  Over the years piecemeal research has been conducted in the North.  Some years ago the National Women's Council, in conjunction with Foyle Women's Aid, held public conferences on the issue and called it the "other violence".  There was little support or awareness of what these women and children had to go through.</p><p>  Today, I sent the committee a presentation on the family justice centre and Foyle Women's Aid is keen to commence the project on the island of Ireland.  I supplied as much information as I could in the presentation and I am happy to answer questions.  We want to open a Family Justice Centre because there are still many barriers to justice for women, children and men in the North.  The proposed family justice centre would also cater for men.</p><p>  We have a legacy of policing being housed in large buildings that are inaccessible or intimidating and are under threat of attack by dissident groups.  There is no normality of services and the buildings can prevent families from approaching them.  Sometimes people are intimidated and threatened by communities if they seek justice or take their cases through the natural processes that take place anywhere else.  Sometimes the politics of the North takes precedence over domestic violence services.  For example, a dissident threat or something that happens at a political level leads to all of the domestic violence services disappearing on those days.  </p><p>  Domestic violence impacts on young people and families.  Domestic violence can lead to certain behaviour in many young people that needs support.  They need help to deal with the matter.  Unfortunately, some of these young people are dealt with in a very violent fashion within communities.  It has become common for some of our young people to be led up lanes and shot in their knees.  People accept that as being okay and view it as normal.  We need to address some of the issues of anti-social behaviour in other ways and get rid of such violent behaviour.  </p><p>  All services provided to all victims must be professional and all of the professionals must sing off the same hymn sheet.  Sexual violence also needs to be addressed.  There has been a gap in services throughout the 30 years of violence.  Women have told Women's Aid about sexual violence that they could not speak about before.  We need to examine how to provide them with a service.  Many of the cases in the courts are historical ones that happened 30 years ago.  </p><p>  All family violence damages individuals, families and communities.  Investing in communities without tackling domestic terrorism, which in itself destroys communities and families, means that we do not have peace.  We cannot have peace without tackling the matter.  My group seeks the support of the committee to develop the first family justice centre in Ireland and to work in partnership with the South.  I hope that we can further develop the project.  We have already signed up with the European Alliance and I shall visit the US at the end of June.  We have also signed up with the US Alliance and hope that Ireland will be included in the provision of services that will be developed in Europe and the US.  </p><p>  I thank the committee and hope that it will support me in starting to address the violent culture in Ireland, to stop it flourishing any further and to achieve some meaningful peace in the North.  I am open to answering any questions.  </p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge that he was our point of contact for the group attending today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.725" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013051600009#H00600"><p>Like the Chairman, I welcome Ms Brown and Ms Corcoran and compliment them on their work in their local communities.  Their presence today has helped to create a greater awareness of very difficult issues among public representatives and, hopefully, the wider society.  Ms Brown mentioned issues that confront many individuals and families.  She also mentioned that "hidden" violence is not adequately reported.  If issues are not adequately reported or there is a lack of awareness then they will not be tackled.  Therefore, it is important that the delegation had this opportunity, and has the same opportunity at other fora, to outline the difficulties, challenges and the need to provide adequate services for people.</p><p>  I accept the excellent point made by Ms Brown that sometimes people who are vulnerable or in difficult circumstances are reluctant to go to an institutional building that is associated with a major State and statutory organisation.  I presume that when she talked about a family justice centre that she was talking about services being provided in a more supportive environment.  Did she mean that there should be a service for the community, not just a State imposed service?  Does she want a family justice centre to be in one building and providing a number of services ranging from health to other supports?  Does she want it modelled on another family justice centre?  Having read the presentation I understood that the family justice centre would be the first of its kind in Europe?  Did she model it on another centre?  Is it a greenfield idea by the group?  </p><p>  Obviously adequate funding should be provided.  I presume that some services are already being provided by the State.  Does Ms Brown hope to bring them in under the family justice centre umbrella?  If so, there would be better co-ordination and outturn from the point of view of the service provider and the service recipient.  Another tranche of funding will be available from PEACE IV programme to deal with issues and legacy issues.  Ms Brown mentioned legacy cases and that some of the incidents were 30 years old or older.  Has the group sought funding for new facilities or whatever from the special European Union programme?  I have listened to the presentation. </p></speech>

It is disturbing to hear them talking about violent activities in such terms.  Presumably, however, levels have reduced, although it still happens.  Has there been a reduction or a recent increase?  That is a real concern.</p><p>  I am not up to speed on the situation in Northern Ireland but I presume there is mandatory reporting so if people approach the organisation, it must report to the police.  How does that affect the group's work?  I remember the principal of a small primary school saying to me once that if she started mandatory reporting in her area, she would have to close the school because everyone is related.  The culture has changed since I had that conversation but I wonder how it works now.</p><p>  How would the centre function?  Is it a therapeutic space and how would people access it?  Would it be similar to a citizens' advice clinic?</p><p>  Again, I welcome the witnesses.  It is good they are here and that this work is progressing.</p></speech>

I too would like to hear other examples of what the group wants for this family justice centre.  Are there similar examples in other jurisdictions?  What services would it offer?  Would it be a law centre or would broader services be available?  In Australia at one stage there were proposals for family relationship centres but the idea was to move some family law out of the courts for mediation.  I do no know how they transpired but I was very interested at the time.  When it is possible to negotiate, that is the way forward.</p></speech>

Deputy Smith mentioned this perhaps being more common in urban areas but I do not know if that is the case, although I am certainly aware of it.  I recently dealt with a family where the partner had a serious crack cocaine drug problem.  The house was being turned into a crack house, there were children there, domestic violence, and people were coming in to intimidate others and to look for money for drugs, and guns were being produced.  It is similar to some of the worst cases the group has dealt with in its own centre.  There was a difficulty, however, in trying to rehouse the woman in a refuge and after a time she wanted to move back into the house.  There were no support services and she was literally moving back into a tip with young children and very little support for basic services like having the door fixed.  If these support services were in place it would be a massive help, with a one-stop-shop for services that would give people more confidence to escape this situation.  It is a visionary idea in that sense.  How would it impact on existing services and how would they be complementary?  Would it pull the services into the centre or would it be additional to them?</p><p>  How can connections be made for training on a North-South basis?  Funding is the difficult area.  The centre will be based in a relatively old building so I presume that could cause some problems.  Is it a safe and secure area?  We are talking about figures of up to 1,000 cases per month but would that be for throughout the North?  Would they all be directed to this centre?</p></speech>

Will there be accommodation and will it be on a long-term or short-term basis?</p><p>  I am on a committee that is looking at human trafficking and the North is no different from the South on this issue, with young vulnerable women being exploited.  Would the centre be a safe location for them?  This could help to secure resources for the centre.  The committee is looking at relations between Ireland and Britain and how to maximise resources and services to help overcome the difficulties these women and their families are facing.</p></speech>

The family justice centre will offer existing services, so it does not displace any services, but they will be collocated in the old convent building.  The idea is that everyone will be trained and while they will have different professions, we will all have the same approach.  Research has shown that families must make as many as 23 visits to other agencies when domestic or sexual violence first occurs.  They get worn out and that is a barrier to their coming forward.  Having the agencies in place and making the agencies do the work instead of the victims has been shown to be more successful.</p><p>  I first saw that model seven years ago in New York.</p></speech>

We have a special domestic violence listing and we are now working towards the development of a specialist domestic violence court.  This is why our location is the best one for the centre.  As a result of the fact that we have developed so much and we have the treatment centre with inter-agency involvement already in place - the investment in this regard was &pound;4 million and the project has just been completed - the justice centre will be the front-line service.  This will enable those on the front line to come up to speed.  Any agency can refer people on to any or all of the facilities we have managed to put in place.  We just received &pound;500,000 from the lottery in order to examine the position with regard to anti-social behaviour and acting out among ten to 18 year olds.  That anti-social behaviour stems from children living with violence and also from the fact that there is a perception about an acceptable level of violence in the street.  These children know nothing else.  We are really starting to look at helping them cope with some of the violence with which they have grown up.  We are also examining different ways of approaching how they behave and considering other anti-violence work.</p><p>  The treatment centre will be completed in June and will open in September.  We are going to open it as part of changing the culture in Derry because domestic and other violence have been a large part of our culture.  They were present before the Troubles and they certainly flourished during the latter.  They could flourish again if we do not take action now.  I would love the members of the committee to visit the centre while Derry is UK City of Culture.</p></speech>

The work her organisation is doing is amazing.  I would love to visit the centre in order to see what is being done there.  Is the problem of domestic violence across all social classes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-16a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Brown" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013051600012#L01200"><p>Absolutely.  Sometimes we tend to think of those affected as women who experience social deprivation.  That is not the case.  We have outreach workers who go out into the community and into family homes.  It can happen to women from every walk of life.  We also take referrals in respect of men and then signpost them.  In the past couple of weeks we received referrals in respect of three gay men who suffered domestic violence in their relationships and we were able to signpost these forward.</p><p>  The justice centre will be inclusive of everybody.  If someone walks in and we do not have a service for them, then we will learn to provide it.  The centre will be an evolving one.  The services are already in place but we are just not working as effectively as we could.  If we house them all together, it will be a build-to-save project because we can cut down on the resources required and then redistribute them where they are needed - by the people.  We provide social economy training.  The social economy business managed to give &pound;30,000 to Foyle Women's Aid last year and this money was put towards building a cr&egrave;che and child care facility.</p><p>  Another thing we are doing is looking at breaking the cycle.  In that context, we are examining the position with regard to young people and babies.  We need to intervene in this regard in order to break the cycles to which I refer.  We provide massage facilities and health visitors come in to the centre.  We are using and sharing our resources.  I am currently working with social services to put a manager in place.  Instead of money, social services is going to give me a person.  It is about being creative in how we share and it is also about not trying to own it ourselves.  The focus must be on the victims.</p></speech>

She has provided us with tremendous insight, which is important.  Perhaps this is the start of the conversation.  If we are in the north west, we will take up her very kind invitation.  I commend our guests on their work.  They are strong advocates not just for women but also in respect of other matters, such as supporting families and communities.</p></speech>
