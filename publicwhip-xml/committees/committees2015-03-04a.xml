Good morning and I would like to welcome you to the joint public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Later this morning we will hear from Professor Alan Ahearne but in our first session of this morning's discussion we will hear from Dr. Peter Bacon on the Bacon report on the housing market in Ireland and the development of the proposals to establish NAMA.</p><p>Dr. Peter Bacon is a well known economist.  He holds primary and postgraduate qualifications in economics including a PhD from Trinity College Dublin.  Since September 1994 he has built and developed an economic consultancy practice.  During his career Dr. Bacon has held a wide range of positions in Ireland and overseas.  He has worked in the public and private sectors in Ireland, for some years as a stockbroker.  In the public sector he has worked as an executive and as a ministerial adviser.  Dr. Bacon's overseas experience include working in developing economies with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Paris, and working in developing and transitioning economies with the World Bank, Washington DC, and the EU TACIS programme.  His main areas of interest are in macro-economic and financial policy issues and evaluations of policies and projects at sector level.  He has published widely over the years in these areas.  Dr. Bacon you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As you have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I make this statement on foot of your invitation to attend this morning, to assist you in your deliberations.  You have requested that I address all or some of the following matters in my evidence: the development of the proposal to establish NAMA, including the options assessed and the conclusions reached; tax policy towards housing and property development; planning and development during the boom; Ireland's housing market in the late 1990s; debate about housing policy prior to the crisis; Ireland&rsquo;s housing market in the international context; and recommendations made by me in respect of the residential property market in Ireland and their implementation.<br/><br/>I am happy to endeavour to assist you and the committee in relation to these issues on the basis of certain consultancy assignments carried out by me and which have been published or placed in the public domain as follows: An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments, a report submitted to the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal (April 1998); The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment, a report submitted to the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal (March 1999); The Housing Market in Ireland: An Economic Evaluation of Trends and Prospects, a report submitted to the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal (June 2000); and Evaluation of Options for Resolving Property Loan Impairments and Associated Capital Adequacy of Irish Credit Institutions: Proposal for a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Abridged Summary of Report (8 April 2009). <br/><br/>I will start with the housing market.  Developments in Ireland&rsquo;s housing market in the late 1990s, in the Dublin region in particular, were symptomatic of fundamental change in housing patterns.  House price inflation, especially in Dublin, began accelerating from 1993, reaching 14% per annum in the four years to 1997 and 25% in 1997. <br/><br/>These trends were the result of favourable macro-economic developments in Ireland including lowering interest rates, reinforced by demographic factors and changing social patterns.  For example, gross immigration was occurring at an annual rate of 44,000 and concentrated in household formation ages, almost half being aged between 25 and 44 years.  By contrast, emigration was concentrated in the younger age of 15 to 25 years, about 62% being of that age.  Changing social patterns were reflected in a rise of one and two person households from 41.9% of the total in 1988 to 46.8% in 1997.  While housing output increased 80% between 1993 and 1997, the share of completions in Dublin fell. <br/><br/><b></b>The recommended policy response contained in the reports considered that, to be effective, a policy response would need to: achieve a better balance between demand and supply in the short term; improve the potential supply of housing in the short to medium term; engage in infrastructure developments; and improve medium and long term planning of development of the east region.  The April 1998 report proposed specific policy initiatives under each of these headings, although most debate and commentary focused on the fiscal measures which comprised the following: the repeal of section 23 relief from investment in residential property; the removal of deductibility of interest on borrowings undertaken for investment in residential property against personal income for taxation purposes; and the reforms to the stamp duty code and changes to capital gains tax as it applied to serviced zoned land.  <br/><br/>The two subsequent reports of March 1999 and June 2000 contained more detailed proposals directed mainly at improving the supply side response.  These latter recommendations were framed in the context of achieving credibility, clarity and certainty.  In support of these criteria specific recommendations were made to: achieve higher residential densities; carry out key strategic infrastructure investments to overcome bottlenecks such as the northern fringe interceptor sewer; accelerate the process of securing required planning consents on significant sites in Dublin city and county through the use of strategic development zones (SDZs); improve the deployment of existing planning resources; increase the resources available to the planning system; impose fiscal penalties for non-realisation of potential of SDZs; propose revisions to the stamp duty regime; establish an anti-speculation property tax; establish measures to secure improvements in the quality and availability of rented accommodation; and to strengthen the institutional framework for securing a more effective housing response in the greater Dublin area.</p><p> I will turn now to the outcome.  Rates of increase in prices of new and existing houses in Dublin and nationally slowed sharply from the middle of 1998.  The peak rate of inflation in the new house market was 24.6% in the first quarter of 1998 country wide and 33.8% in the first quarter of 1998 in Dublin.  By the first quarter of 2000, these rates had halved to 12.9% and 16.2% respectively.  In the existing house market the peak rate was 36.9% in the third quarter of 1998 country wide and 41.7% in the third quarter of 1998 in Dublin.  These rates too more than halved to 17.4% and 20% respectively in the first quarter of 2000.  At the same time, the annual rate of new house completions increased about 10%, to approximately 46,500 units, the highest annual rate of completions ever recorded to that time.  However, in 2001 the measure to exclude interest deductibility was reversed.  Thereafter prices re-accelerated, despite a supply response rising to almost 90,000 units annually, as speculative forces gathered increasing momentum. </p><p> I will move now to the development of the proposal to establish NAMA.  At the heart of the banking crisis was a concern of capital markets with regard to the adequacy of banks capital to meet future loan impairments and institutions&rsquo; capacity to obtain additional capital externally.  Future impairments were of concern because for the previous decade Ireland had experienced rapid inflation in property values and lending to the property sector had become an increasingly important component in credit institutions&rsquo; lending.  In addition, there was heightened international concern about the health of the financial sector. </p><p> Irish banks were facing an extremely unstable outlook in respect of international wholesale deposits upon which they had become significantly dependent in the previous decade to fund expansion of their assets or lending.  They were experiencing major withdrawals of these deposits, a shortening of the average duration of deposits and substantial recourse to the Central Bank for short-term liquidity support.  This was not a sustainable trend.  In addition, the initiatives taken by Government to that date were considered to be insufficient to achieve rates of capital adequacy that would encourage investors to hold and invest further equity in Irish credit institutions when prospective impairments were considered.  As long as this remained the case, it could be expected that share values would remain depressed and deposit liabilities would be likely to experience continued attrition and foreshortening in duration.  Such a prospect would hinder economic recovery, complicate further the required adjustment of the public finances and leave Ireland&rsquo;s international credit rating subject to downward pressures and speculative attacks.  Therefore, it was concluded that additional and far reaching measures needed to be undertaken as soon as possible to place the banking system on a sound footing. </p><p> Deterioration in the Government debt to GDP ratio was under way as the general Government deficit widened.  A significant part of this deterioration arose from the effects of cyclical downturn.  Moreover, discretionary budgetary adjustments to curtail the widening deficit would be partially undone by the deflationary impact of the discretionary measures themselves.  To some degree, in the absence of international recovery and-or gains in competitiveness and productivity in Ireland, the domestic fiscal adjustment process had the characteristics of a vicious spiral comprising weakening economic activity leading to widening of the Government deficit and indebtedness leading to discretionary adjustments leading to further erosion of economic activity and so on. </p><p> The deterioration in Ireland&rsquo;s credit terms associated with a worsening fiscal position was compounded by the additional contingent liabilities assumed by Government by virtue of the guarantee of the deposits of credit institutions from the previous September.  Capital markets were uncertain how to value the additional liability of the Government on foot of the guarantee and the resulting confusion was causing Irish bond spreads to widen unfavourably.  Against this backdrop, it was considered imperative that initiatives should be undertaken that would lead to stability in banks' deposits and term debt liabilities and eliminate the need for a renewal of the guarantee in place at the time.  To achieve this required removing all doubts about capital adequacy of the credit institutions and their capacity to deal with prospective loan impairments.</p><p> There are a number of broad approaches, which are not mutually exclusive, to bank capital support schemes.  These revolve around recapitalisation programmes involving stress testing against expected losses, asset guarantee schemes and asset management arrangements.  The key features of recapitalisation programmes are future capital shortage is anticipated by testing adequacy of current capital in stress scenarios; the adequacy of capital to absorb losses is assessed; and the regulatory authority may then require more capital, which may be raised from the market, for example, by way of a rights issue or attraction of new shareholders, which may be either private or State.  This approach needs to take account of implications of market conditions for cost of capital to bank, dilutive implications for existing shareholders and protection of State capital if the external shareholder is the Government.  There have been many recapitalisation programmes put in place in the US and the EU in the current crisis, including in Ireland. </p><p> The key characteristics of the asset guaranteed or risks insured by the State approach are troubled assets remain on the balance sheet of the banking system; troubled assets are not subject to upfront mark-to-market write downs; the bank usually is liable to a relatively small first loss tranche and the State covers elevated losses for a fee; equity capital is not affected as assets do not have to be sold at the current marked-down levels; no initial outlay is required from the State and a fee, premium or compensation arrangement is paid for the guarantee; compensation to the State in the form of convertible preferred shares or warrants is dilutive, of existing shareholders; and such schemes have been implemented at ING, Citigroup, Bank of America and RBS.</p><p> The key features of the asset management arrangements approach are troubled assets are transferred from the balance sheet of the banks at an agreed price; mandatory participation is required; the banks take the impairment loss to profit and loss account now; the bank is cleansed of troubled assets making valuation of the remaining part of the bank less complicated; the removal of impaired loans reduces the risk weighted assets of the bank and releases capital or reduces the shortfall in capital required; a discounted sale of assets may result in a significant reduction in the equity of the seller; and significant financing may be required from the State for the asset management company, impacting negatively on the fiscal position.  Examples at the time included UBS and Securum-Nordbanken in the Swedish crisis of the 1990s.</p><p> Nationalisation was explicitly considered in the context of the report.  Where a bank&rsquo;s net worth has already been wiped out or would be by future impending losses or where Government are or will become dominant shareholders as a result of recapitalisation or other initiatives, nationalisation may be the most effective means of protecting the interests of all of the stakeholders &ndash; Government, equity and bondholders, depositors and the business franchise owned by the bank &ndash; and carrying out the required restructuring to enable the bank to stabilise its business in support of the wider economy in the future.  For example, nationalisation could be used to facilitate mergers of operations and improve efficiencies of scale in accessing wholesale credit markets so as to bring about required strengthening of management or corporate governance.  In effect where taxpayers are liable for guaranteeing the deposit liabilities of banks and also guaranteeing the bank against losses in the value of assets, in whole or substantial part, by any arrangement, such as those described above, nationalisation may be considered necessary to overcome issues of moral hazard.  These situations are mostly likely to arise with respect to shareholders, who may be seen to be bailed out or gifted as a result of initiatives to support bank capital.</p><p>Another such concern may be the additional cost to the taxpayer in terms of deteriorations of the market's rating of sovereign debt instruments and the premium paid to bondholders in respect of this.</p><p> A number of nationalisations were made in the course of the current crisis in the UK, notably Northern Rock and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, and of course here in Ireland Anglo Irish Bank Corporation was nationalised in January 2009.  A summary comparison of the general attributes of these approaches is contained in a table.  I do not propose to go through the table because the committee has it.</p><p> The very features which make the asset guarantee approach intuitively attractive - no money upfront from Government and no write down in banks&rsquo; balance sheet assets - contain also inherent fundamental weaknesses, namely, that a contingent liability is created in the balance sheet of the Exchequer.  The situation would have significant parallels with the bank guarantee of the six credit institutions.  It too was adopted on the basis that it involved no up-front outlay on the part of the Exchequer and on the basis that it would not be "called" and therefore the premium payments by banks would be a net receipt to the Exchequer.  In the event, capital markets did not grapple well with the contingent liability created by the deposit guarantee.  The tendency was to price Irish sovereign debt unfavourably, reflecting a view that more issuance of Government debt would be required.  Indeed, an argument developed that if any part of the guarantee came to be called, in effect all would be called and that would lead to extreme problems for the Exchequer.  The point of relevance here is that contingent liabilities are inherently uncertain in nature, are often evaluated in an ill-informed way with resulting errors and the potential for further adverse speculation against Ireland.  As a result of the decision to guarantee the debt liabilities of Irish credit institutions the credit rating of sovereign, Ireland became inextricably bound up with the issue of Irish banks&rsquo; capital adequacy.  A further guarantee approach, this time in respect of banks&rsquo; property-related loan assets, would create a further layer of uncertainty through the creation of another contingent liability on the Exchequer.  This would further entwine the sovereign rating with Irish banks' capital adequacy problems without actually providing any clarity as to how capital adequacy would be achieved, other than through a calling of the contingent liability.</p><p> By contrast, the asset sales approach, while involving the recognition of "pain" at the outset contained the merit of certainty and clarity, provided of course the projection of the extent of impairment was accurate in the first place.  In the particular circumstances prevailing it was considered that there was much to be said for recognising and crystallising prospective property-related loan losses explicitly, rather than allowing them to remain on banks&rsquo; balance sheets with a concomitant additional contingent liability on the Exchequer.</p><p> A feature of the guarantee approach is that assets remain on the balance sheets where they have been created.  Another side to this is that they continue to be managed by the officers and executives of banks which created the problem assets in the first place.  In the case where assets are complex financial instruments, such as many of the assets acquired by banks that were originated in the US and based on sub-prime borrowers, their valuation and resolution may best be undertaken in the banks which acquired them and which have the financial skills appropriate to this task.  The nature of impaired property loan assets simply was not of this character.  They were loans created and secured by property assets, development land, work in progress, completed but unsold residential stock and under-performing property investments, which are now worth significantly less than was envisaged by the loan.  There is not a great deal banking skills can do to resolve this dilemma.  Moreover, the property development companies involved in these transactions are almost entirely privately owned, championed by entrepreneurial characters and mostly without equity or recourse to equity markets, and in many cases do not have the depth of management skills to engage in the kind of portfolio sales and work-outs which ultimately are required to resolve the impairment issue.</p><p> Asset management companies, AMCs, offer prospects for avoiding many of the shortcomings associated with a continuation of the existing bank, property developer relationship.  Potential advantages include: economies of scale in administering work-outs and in forming and selling portfolios of assets; benefits from the granting of special powers to the government agency to expedite loan resolution; and the interposing of a disinterested third party between bankers and clients, which might break connections that otherwise could impede efficient transfers of assets from powerful enterprises.</p><p> Sweden&rsquo;s AMCs provide examples of some of these potential advantages, but other countries have found it difficult to realise them.  First, government agents may lack the information and skills of private market participants.  Second, government agencies do not operate in a vacuum.  They, too, are creatures of the societies that create them, and government agents must negotiate, rather than dictate, solutions, just as private market participants must do.  In negotiations with government agencies and private participants alike, the strength of one&rsquo;s position depends on one&rsquo;s &ldquo;threat point&rdquo;, the ability to credibly threaten adverse consequences for one&rsquo;s bargaining opponent, if agreement is not reached.</p><p> Notwithstanding these shortcomings, it was considered that AMCs, by virtue of the potential advantages they contain, that I have noted, have the potential to bring about better economic resolution of the impaired loans of Irish property developers than relying on existing bank management and banker, developer relations, which brought about the problems in the first place.</p><p> The point I am about to make is one I made extensively at the time.  It was never picked up and I considered at the time and still consider that it is one of the most important points.  A further important consideration relates to the future financing requirement of impaired assets.  Many of the impaired assets will be capable of achieving higher values if they can be worked out rather than disposed of.  A key issue for successful work-out will be access to additional capital, equity and debt required for the work-out.  It is extremely difficult to see how existing property developers will be able to access capital markets effectively for such equity and banks&rsquo; capacity to extend credit will be limited by the absence of collateral available from most of them.  Potentially the amounts involved are large and a feature of Irish property developers is they are not publicly quoted companies and have not had a history of recourse to equity markets for their funding.  I made the point when the crash occurred, that the first thing that happened in the London market was that British Land, Land Securities and Hammerson, and some others, went straight to the market and raised capital to bolster their balance sheets because they were quoted companies.  There was not a single one in Ireland then or now.  Instead, they have relied on retained earnings for equity and bank lending for the balance.  This shortcoming cannot be put right now and it represents a significant impediment looking forward to resolution of the impairment issue, at least cost.  There has been a development in the past two years in the sense that there are now three publicly quoted real estate investment trusts, which is certainly a welcome development to absorb very fine commercial property assets from the resolution process. </p><p> An AMC, however, does have the potential to at least mitigate this issue in two respects.  First, it has the potential to achieve scale and overview of developments and projects.  Banks will be concerned about the security they hold and how that can be maximised and realised.  In many instances more than one bank will be involved in the security and their individual interests may not correspond.  An AMC would be able to achieve project oversight.  Second, if properly structured and resourced with relevant property-related skills, such an entity would have the potential to attract long-term capital in a manner that individual development companies would not.</p><p> In conclusion, it appeared to me that the asset management approach had the potential to offer greater assistance in achieving resolution of the impairment issue upfront and maximising taxpayer returns, over the long term.</p></speech>

You wrote three reports in 1998, 1999 and 2000.  In the 2000 report you noted house prices were rising rapidly despite a strong response of housing supply, the law of supply and demand.  The report recommended new measures including further proposals to discourage investors and another reform of stamp duty.</p><p>Maybe you could outline these measures to the committee, how many of the key recommendations were implemented by the Government and what impact they had on the housing market.</p></speech>

There is a finance Bill or supplementary finance Bill.  There is a piece of a legislation and the event either happens or it does not.  All the tax and fiscal recommendations that were made in the reports were implemented.  I highlighted one of them being reversed in 2000 or 2001.  With regard to the supply-side enhancement measures, the 1999 and 2000 reports contained sections which assess the extent to which measures proposed in the previous report were implemented and what the impact was under four headings.  Those headings were price and price stability, affordability and supply-side response.  In the latter two reports, there was consideration of impact on the rented sector, which was something not considered at all in the first report.</p> <p>  In trying to answer the question of whether those supply measures were implemented, I point out that these were not an event.  They form a process.  The principal recommendation on the supply side related to the policies relating to residential densities.  Members are either Deputies or Senators, and they will know from constituency work that densities are not an easy subject.  It is easy for economists and planners to make recommendations but there are major issues with that topic.  What I can state factually is there was a tendency over the period and subsequently for residential densities to rise.  Did they rise enough and could they have risen more?  Did they rise fast enough?  These are judgments and some of these issues are still ongoing.</p></speech>

In 2001, the Government reversed a number of measures that Dr. Bacon suggested and were introduced.  Stamp duty for investors was cut, tax on second homes was eliminated and interest relief was restored as a deductible expense when calculating tax on residential income.  What was your view on the reversal of the recommendations implemented on foot of your report?</p></speech>

Was that Dr. Bacon's understanding of why the Government commissioned his succession of three reports?  He has just told us of his belief that the recommendations put into effect from the first report had a significant impact on house prices.  Which measures specifically does he think were effective in reducing house prices?</p></speech>

The terms of reference to the first report did not contain or express, in my memory, any concern about speculation.  We are talking about late 1997 for these terms of reference for the report.  The terms of reference were about concerns that prices were accelerating.  The concern of the Department of the Environment and Local Government at the time was to get a handle on why this was happening.  People did not know.  I do not think there was a preconceived view or belief at that time that speculative forces were strong.  At the time, I do not think they were.  From 1998 onwards, during the course of this work and as noted explicitly in the second and third reports, the significance of speculative demand was rising and ultimately driving the market.  On the question of specific measures, it is very difficult to isolate one measure.  Certainly, in the short term and in the sense of bringing down the rate of increase in prices, the measure that bit hardest was the tax deductibility of interest.</p></speech>

Although the rate of increase did reduce in 2001, for second-hand houses, for example, prices still increased at approximately two thirds of the average industrial wage in that year alone.  An ordinary person would see that as an inordinate increase.  Would Dr. Bacon's proposed measures have been enough to have an ongoing effect in bringing the prices down to much lower levels than this?</p></speech>

Mainly, this would relate to a shortage of accommodation in the rented sector.  The first report was about house prices and there was no part of the terms of reference regarding the rental sector.  The report was on why house prices were accelerating and raising headlines.  That is basically the content of the terms of reference.  They also asked for recommendations to stabilise the issue.  That is what the report contained.  I have always acknowledged that a side consequence of curtailing investment demand, as the measures did and which led to a levelling of prices, is to reduce the supply of rented accommodation.  That is what happened.</p></speech>

My interpretation, which Dr. Bacon can correct if I am wrong, is that he saw affordability more for the ability to pay a mortgage.  One of Dr. Bacon's recommendations was to increase the length of mortgage time.  I think he may have put out a figure of 35 years on one occasion.</p><p>I am keen to explore with Dr. Bacon a different take, as it were, on affordability and ask for his opinion.  Dr. Conor McCabe, from the UCD school of social justice, in an article, Irish Housing and Wages, 1977 to 2006: Portrait of a Scam, published on 8 June 2010 stated:<blockquote>Best practise has house prices at 2.5 to 4 times the average industrial wage...apart from the recession years of the mid-1980s, housing in Ireland has been overpriced for the past 33 years...The figures belie the current myth of the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; Celtic Tiger which ran up to around 2002, and the &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; Celtic tiger which ran from 2002 to 2007...In 1997, house prices once again breached 5.0, and just kept on climbing...By the time the &lsquo;Good&rsquo; Tiger ended in 2002, the affordability ratio stood at 8.17.</blockquote>Why did Dr. Bacon not measure affordability in regard to the absolute cost of a house, rather than projecting a period of 35 or 40 years for repayment?</p></speech>

The average industrial wage is not representative of the average wage within the economy.  Most people in Ireland now work in the services sector.  I am sure Deputy Higgins has a better handle on it than me.  The proportion of the labour force which earns the average industrial wage is very small.  In respect of the proportion of the labour force engaged in industry, as measured by the average industrial wage, a figure of 25% or 30% sticks in my mind, although I stand to be corrected on that number.  The use of the term "average industrial wage" is always, to my mind, a misleading term.  It is an official term but it is misleading in the sense of providing a measure of average incomes of would-be house purchasers.  I am sure the numbers that Deputy Higgins quoted are arithmetically correct but they are the result of the fact that a significant number of people earn more than the average industrial wage.</p> <p>  The second question Deputy Higgins asked me was why I measured the analysis in terms of mortgages.  That is how most people and most first-time buyers finance the purchase of homes.  It is the element most relevant to them.</p></speech>

In fact, from 1996 to 2006, they maintain that the price of an average home increased 400%, an average each year of equivalent or greater than the average industrial wage.  The result was that the increase in house prices created significant opportunities for investors to make large profits in housing development.  Does the range of what were massive price increases by any standards indicate a serious level of profiteering and speculation in the housing market?</p></speech>

It is not a defined term.  People will make a profit if they sell a house or if they buy it at one price and sell it at another price.

The level of impairment that I estimated was not done on a loan-by-loan basis.  It was done at an aggregate level.  I was working from published data.  Certainly, NAMA was acquiring loans from financial institutions and the level of write-downs seemed to me on average to be greater.  However, one would expect when one gets into the guts of something for it to be either greater or smaller.  If Deputy Higgins is asking whether I underestimated it, the answer is that I did not try to estimate it in the first place.  I gave an indication at a macro level for the system as a whole of what the degree of impairment would be.

Through a mutual acquaintance he asked if I would meet him for a chat about the situation.  I think that was in November or December 2008.  I met him in Government Buildings; he was present with a second secretary.  The meeting happened.  The meeting ended.  I walked away scratching my head and I got a phone call in late January inviting me to have another chat.  It was a chat about: "You know, look, the situation is deteriorating; I am canvassing views about what ought to be done, what needs to be done, what the options are."  I met him again and I felt that it was a similar discussion to the previous one but he did at the end of it say to me: "You seem to have developed your thoughts significantly more than the last time we spoke.  Would you do some work?  Would you commit these thoughts to paper and carry out some work?"  That was what happened.</p></speech>

There would have been all kinds of cross-guarantees at an individual level, which, working from macro data, one would not have had access to or knowledge of.</p></speech>

We all know what is happening at the moment in the property market.  It goes through cycles.  Ireland went through a particularly vicious one.  I think the criticisms that I have made of NAMA have not been about the general approach.  It is more about the ethos.</p><p>My personal opinion, based on what I see - no greater than that - is that it has acted more as a debt collection agency than as a property value maximising entity.</p></speech>

If one asks me from an economic point of view what is wrong with the Irish property sector and where it looks funny compared with property sectors in other jurisdictions, I would say it is the capital structure.  They do not have access to long-term funds, which is equity.  The property sector, more than any other sector, requires long-term capital.  NAMA has brought some of that to bear, but there is no quoted entity collecting equity investment from investors to develop residential or commercial property in Ireland.</p></speech>

It was widely said in 2009 that it would provide banks with additional collateral that could be used to borrow from the ECB.  Given that excessive borrowing from the ECB played a key role in triggering Ireland's bailout, what is Dr. Bacon's assessment of the 2009 solution, which related to liquidity problems as opposed to assessing the size of the solvency problems?</p></speech>

The fundamental problem was a solvency problem.  It was masked for some considerable time to some people who were looking at it as a liquidity problem, but there was a liquidity issue.  I do not think there was anything wrong.  The Irish banking system, not unlike some other European banking systems at the moment which are subject to notice, did need liquidity.  I do not think there is any difficulty with that, provided that one did not confuse that with the underlying problem of insolvency.  It was not misdiagnosed in the end.</p></speech>

Deputy Phelan referenced the first page of the NAMA report, which states: <blockquote><br /><br />As regards their property loan portfolios the six guaranteed credit institutions face cumulative economic impairment on their land and development loan exposures and associated property investment loans of around &euro;<b>X</b>Bn [Figure deleted.  Market sensitive] on loans outstanding of about &euro;80-90Bn.</blockquote>An X has been inserted, as the figure was considered too market-sensitive to be put into the public domain at the time.

The full report is now in the public domain.  In the abridged version, as was mentioned by previous Deputies, it is stated that the X figure was based on outstanding loans of &euro;80 billion to &euro;90 billion.  The actual report states that this is based on the total value of property loans outstanding in September 2008 of &euro;158 billion.  This paragraph is one of the main conclusions of the report.  Can Dr. Bacon explain to the committee why the abridged version which was in the public domain for many years contained a loan amount of &euro;90 billion and the actual full report suggests it was higher, at &euro;158 billion?</p></speech>

It is associated investments.  I mentioned in passing that there was a question about cross-guaranteeing.  NAMA was only taking on the development loans and associated investments - that is to say, investments that were associated with the development loans.  There was another tranche of loans called investment loans which were not included.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

Paragraph 13 of the full version of the report suggests that the &euro;34 billion of losses in the six institutions would require further capital injections of &euro;9.2 billion in core tier 1 capital ratios in certain institutions.

There is a question of legal requirement and adequacy from the point of view of the markets.  I do not know what the final figure was as I stopped looking at this when I stopped getting paid for it.

Dr. Bacon's report came out on 20 March 2009, just a number of months after the guarantee was brought in.  Paragraph 26 deals with revising the credit guarantee.  It states:<blockquote><br /><br />A restructuring of the guarantee consistent with the introduction of the NAMA initiative should be seen as an integral element of a comprehensive strategy.  In summary, the aim should be to enhance the credibility of the guarantee by simultaneously reducing the contingent liability under it and by extending its temporal scope in relation to the sort of long-term bond issuance which is critical to ensuring the covered institutions' survival.</blockquote>How could the guarantee, which had a legal underpinning, be restructured at that time, just a number of months after the guarantee was introduced?</p></speech>

We must remember the circumstances of the time.  It was 1998-99 and a time of Ireland's near-term accession to the euro.  Markets were anticipating that, upon Ireland joining the euro, there would be no currency risk between the Irish punt and the euro.  This meant that Irish interest rates would converge to euro rates, by which was meant German interest rates.  That assumed there would then be capital inflows and arbitrages, which there were.  There was increased competition between financial institutions to gain a share of the housing market and, with the undoubted slippage in the application of income criteria, there was a reversal of the slamming of the brakes on investment demand and when that occurred Ireland was in the euro.  There was no exchange risk, there were European banks with surplus funds and Irish banks with an opportunity to lend funds.  Guess what happened.  The brake on speculative and genuine investment demand was removed.</p></speech>

I am aware, as is the Senator, of what it is saying at the moment but at that time two and a half-three plus one was not being adhered to in all cases and as competitive pressure on the banks intensified the tendency to move outside those criteria increased.  It was a one-way bet.  There was no exchange rate risk and, in effect, quantitative easing was taking place in an Irish economy that was expanding rapidly, meaning we got a bubble.</p></speech>

I do not think there was anything wrong with the original assessment.  I do not think in the present circumstances there is a basis of a bubble in the Irish market.  For one thing one does not yet have a normally functioning banking sector in relation to mortgage finance.  If there were a Bacon report, what would it be focusing on at the moment?  It would be saying, "Why in heaven's name, seven or eight years after the collapse are we still dealing with a mortgage arrears problem?"</p> <p>  To be fair to the Government, it took a calculated risk with NAMA.  The principle had been applied, but never on the scale on which NAMA was done.  So that problem was removed and I think wisely so because on the basis of the way in which the arrears problem has failed to get resolved, what would have happened if one had left all of the stuff that went to NAMA with the banks to resolve?</p> <p>  So there was a residual left with the banks to resolve themselves.  They have not resolved it.  A result of that is that the supply of housing to the second-hand market in the current circumstances is constrained.</p></speech>

In terms of the figure X that Deputy Pearse Doherty has just put on the record - that is &euro;34 billion - there is some confusion whether the amount was &euro;34 billion out of &euro;80 billion or &euro;90 billion, or &euro;158 billion.</p></speech>

That is a big leap from an average of 22%.  The question is how we got to that point.  Dr. Bacon's report that was presented to Government on 20 March 2009 is a very detailed report that specifically goes down through each bank and Dr. Bacon specifically indicates how the &euro;158 billion of loans is made up for each of the individual banks.  That gave rise to a write-off of the order of &euro;34.4 billion, which was a 22% average discount.  We then come to a situation where, when the abridged version was published on 8 April, Dr. Bacon was looking at &euro;74 billion of loans with a write-off of &euro;42.2 billion, which is about 57% of a discount.  When Dr. Bacon was writing his report for 20 March, if he had known that the discounts were going to be of the order of nearly 60%, would he have recommended the establishment of NAMA?</p></speech>

He suggested that short-term debt recovery versus the realisation of the long-term value to the taxpayer may be debated.  Is he of the view that if more capital had been available to NAMA in respect of work-outs rather than disposals, it could have given rise to better results for the taxpayer?  Does he feel that the accelerated winding down of NAMA is in the best interests of the taxpayer?  Should disposals and work-outs have been staggered and should there have been a focus on obtaining a better return for the taxpayer?  Have the optimum results been achieved?</p></speech>

To be fair, however, I was careful to use the phrase "all other things being equal".  The truth is that they were not equal.  One went to the bailout programme and that programme contained the requirement to accelerate disposals.  Ireland needed that bailout programme so it is not a question of what was best for the taxpayer.  It would have been a bad decision to say "Look, we are not going to go for this bailout programme because there is this requirement in it and we need to work out NAMA for longer".  Other things being equal, the difference between a good investment and a bad investment is often time.</p></speech>

Can I make sure that we are connecting the numbers correctly here?  Many numbers have been thrown around during the course of different questioning?  NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion for loans with a book value of &euro;74 billion, an overall impairment of about &euro;42 billion.  Are we correct in relating that back to the broad estimates, made by Dr. Bacon on a macro basis, of &euro;34 billion potential impairment facing the banks?  When Dr. Bacon was preparing the report in 2009 which informed the establishment of NAMA, he said to Senator D'Arcy that he did not have access to the PricewaterhouseCoopers' reports compiled at that time.  Was Dr. Bacon aware that they existed or were being prepared?</p></speech>

I am trying to think when it commenced, I know I met the Minister in late January, so it was shortly after that.  It was the most intensive piece of work I have done in a 40 year career.  It was done within the National Treasury Management Agency building - they kindly provided me with a room and coffee.  Both were required.  In terms of what was available to me, effectively that was Central Bank bulletins.</p></speech>

For a number of months, PwC was actually in the banks examining those very issues.  PwC gave a report to the Minister for Finance on Friday, 20 February 2009, a  month before Dr. Bacon's report.  It comprised a detailed loan review of Anglo Irish Bank's top 70 land and development exposures, which accounted for 63% of the bank's total land and development loan book.  Was Dr. Bacon not aware of that or given access to any of those records or documents?</p></speech>

There was a standing committee, chaired by the Minister, comprising the suspects one would expect - finance, Central Bank and NTMA.  I was invited to attend one of those and the Minister asked how my work was going and had I any numbers.  I gave the meeting a work in progress account.

They were the ingredients which increasingly fed speculative demand.  There are very few laws in economics, but demand and supply is one of them.  If  supply goes up and prices go up then something funny is going on.  That was happening in the Irish housing market.  Supply was accelerating, there is no doubt - in one year 90,000 houses were built - yet prices were accelerating.  One looks at the population dynamics, that is a bubble.</p><p>Supply was accelerating - there is no doubt about that.

I will put an alternative view that has been expressed to me by a mortgage holder who is having a loan transferred to one of these trusts.  It was put to me that these trusts are vulture capitalists and these transfers make mortgage holders' position very vulnerable.  Will Dr. Bacon comment on that alternative view?</p><p>I asked Dr. Bacon a question on the affordability of homes in which I noted that the price of a home increased in each year in the ten-year period from 1996 to 2006 by an amount equivalent to the average industrial wage.  Dr. Bacon appeared to minimise the apparent severity of these increases by stating that many people earned more than the average industrial wage.  While that is true, in 2006, when the average industrial wage was &euro;30,000, two thirds of all incomes were less than &euro;30,000 and the median annual income was &euro;25,000 per annum.  In light of these figures, will Dr. Bacon reconsider his view on whether these price increases were inordinate?</p><p>In the mid-2000s, it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>and many other newspapers that 11 acres of residential development land in Stillorgan had been bought in 2000 for &euro;32 million and sold four years later for &euro;85 million before any building had taken place.  Given that permission had been granted for 478 apartments on the site, the speculative gain in this transaction would have added &euro;100,000 to the price of each apartment.  As a long-time consultant on property issues, does Dr. Bacon consider it was moral or immoral to allow this level of profit-taking - some might describe it as profiteering - in land for what is a basic human need of a home?</p></speech>

As to what are the characteristics of these investors, they could include the Deputy, me or an institution.  I do not think there is a particular type of investor - a "vulture", to use the Deputy's word - involved in real estate investment trusts.  There is a diversity of investors.  The attraction of the real estate investment trust - or the benefit, as I see it - is that it is a quoted vehicle that enables anyone to invest in its shares.</p> <p>  Will the Deputy briefly remind me of his second question?</p></speech>

The second and third reports recognised what was happening was at the bottom of the market.  The market had raced away and there was a yawning gap for people on lower incomes trying to get on to the first step of the ladder.  The reports contained specific measures to try to address that, such as shared ownership schemes and partial equity.  There were specific measures contained in both the second and third reports to try to deal with that.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's third point, I can remember being asked by a commentator in an RTE programme, which I believe was broadcast on 9 April, how I could morally stand over something.  The reason I remember the answer I gave at the time was that I got an awful lot of stick for it.  I answered that I was an economist, not a moralist.  I cannot give an answer on a moral issue and the morality of something; I can only deal with the economics of it.</p></speech>

Several members, including me, have quoted media reports from 2010, 2011 and 2012 in which Dr. Bacon gave strong opinions and comments on the workings of NAMA.  If he no longer had such an interest in the agency, on what did he base his comments?  Did Dr. Bacon work for property development companies in the post-2009 period?</p></speech>

To deal with the question before that, I think I said that any of the comments I have made about NAMA have largely been in relation to the point that I have re-emphasised here, namely, ethos and debt collection.  That is the only point I have made and it is based purely on impression.</p></speech>

To return to a number of responses Dr. Bacon gave to Deputies Joe Higgins, Michael McGrath and other speakers, his reports focused extensively on the need to increase supply in the housing market to dampen house prices.  Is that a fair conclusion?  They did not really examine the commercial and retail property sector but were focused strictly on residential and investment property.</p></speech>

Loan-to-value rules were not properly implemented and, by Dr. Bacon's own terms, income ratios began to drift out of sync.  In addition, in the buy-to-let sector, 100% mortgages, interest-only payments and so forth were provided.  Mortgages terms were also extended to 35 years.  This is a summary of the behaviour in the residential property sector at the time.  Are housing markets somewhat different from other markets in that normal rules of supply and demand often do not explain how they work?  David McWilliams, in his testimony to the inquiry last week, stated that the crisis was very much credit-fuelled and was not an issue of supply and demand.</p></speech>

The housing market is different from buying a banana.  The stock is effectively fixed and adjustments to the stock take place very slowly.  That is in the nature of it, and land acquisition, planning and all the rest can take five or six years.  Once speculative forces start to take off in the housing market, it is a pretty safe bet that the trend will not be reversed.</p></speech>

I welcome to the meeting Professor Alan Ahearne, NUI Galway, on issues relating to early warnings, and divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  Professor Alan Ahearne is a professor and head of economics at the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He is chairman of the steering committee governing the newly launched Economic and Social Research Institute, the ESRI, and Department of Finance Joint Research Programme on the Macroeconomy and Taxation.  He has served as external adviser to the Strategy, Practice and Review Department of the International Monetary Fund.  He is a member of the Commission of the Central Bank of Ireland.  He is also a member of the Central Bank's audit and risk committees.  Prior to coming to Galway in 2005, Professor Ahearne was senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C, where he worked for seven years.  There he advised Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and other Federal Reserve governors on developments in the global economy.  He was principal economist at the Federal Reserve covering the Japanese and Chinese economies.  He served as a special adviser to former Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, from March 2009 to March 2011.  Professor Ahearne's areas of expertise are macroeconomics and international finance.  His research includes studies on property markets in Ireland and other industrial countries, global current account imbalances and exchange rates and the economic performance of the euro area.  Professor Ahearne is very welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before I begin, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If he is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and he continues to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As he has been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>I now invite Professor Ahearne to make his opening remarks to the inquiry please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015030400002#Q00200"><p>Chairman and members of the joint committee, I thank you for inviting me here to testify today.  In the invitation to appear before the committee, I was asked to discuss issues relating to early warnings, divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  In my opening statement, I will focus on the views that I expressed during the bubble years about house prices, the potential effect on the economy and the financial system of a reversal in property prices, and the evidence on which those views were based.<br/><br/>My own perspective on the Irish housing market during the bubble years was informed in large part by research on the international experience with housing booms and busts that I had done when I worked for the US Federal Reserve.  In a study I wrote with several of my former colleagues, which was published on the Federal Reserve's website in September 2005, we identified no fewer than 44 episodes of house price booms and busts in 18 advanced countries since 1970.  I have provided a copy of this paper to the members of the committee. <br/><br/>It struck me at the time that paper was published that given developments in the housing market in this country, the analysis contained in the paper could be relevant for Ireland.  As I wrote in articles in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in October 2005, shortly after I left the Federal Reserve to move back to live in Ireland, &quot;Given the eye-popping gains in house prices in Ireland over the past decade, the foreign experience is particularly relevant&quot;.  What the foreign experience analysed in the paper shows is that periods of prolonged rises followed by protracted falls are a surprisingly common feature of house prices in advanced countries.  The study shows that certain financial conditions, such as low interest rates, ample liquidity, and financial deregulation, are usually present in past house price surges, though other factors such as demographics and buoyant income growth also help explain these booms. <br/><br/>At the time, interest rates in Ireland were at very low levels, with the European Central Bank&rsquo;s main policy interest rate at 2%, having been cut from a peak of 4.75% in 2000.  It was clear at the time that such low interest rates were not appropriate for Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly growing economy. <br/><br/>A common feature of housing booms and busts is that around six to eight quarters before the peak in house prices, interest rates begin to move up.  The ECB began to hike interest rates in December 2005, and within 18 months the ECB&rsquo;s policy rate had doubled.  Writing in 2007, I pointed out that, &quot;The blow to affordability from rising interest rates and the knock-on effect on house prices should be obvious&quot;.  The 2005 Federal Reserve study of the international experience of booms and busts shows that, after reaching a peak, real house prices subsequently fall for about five years, on average, and their previous run-up was largely reversed.  Put simply, the bigger the boom, the bigger the bust. <br/><br/>The study found that swings in house prices can have important implications for both economic activity and financial stability.  We found that in the past, major declines in house prices were often associated with economic downturns, slumps in consumer and investment spending, and at times contributed to financial distress, particularly when nominal collateral values also declined significantly. <br/><br/>Looking across countries, we noted that a historically high number of countries at that time were experiencing abnormally rapid rises in house prices.  We warned that, &quot;If these prices follow the same patterns as before, house prices in a large number of these countries are likely to decline in real terms at some point in the not-too-distant future&quot;.  One question that arises is whether there exist indicators that can act as reliable telltale signs that housing is overvalued.  The evidence suggests that comparing house prices and rents provides a useful, but by no means infallible, benchmark for valuing houses, in the same way that the ratio of stock prices to dividends is commonly used to measure valuation in the stock market.  Rents are a key determinant of the value of housing and as such should not move too far out of line with prices.</p><p>House prices that are unusually high relative to rents may indicate that housing is overvalued. <br/><br/>Writing in October 2005, I noted: &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s price-rent ratio is currently higher than at any time for which we have reliable data, having soared since early 2002 as rents began to decline.  In the first quarter of 2005, the average price paid for a house nationally was about &euro;256,000 and the average annual rent was &euro;8,800.  The resulting price-rent ratio of 29 stood roughly 2&frac12; times above its level in 1996.&rdquo; <br/><br/>I concluded that this unusually high level of house prices relative to rents was mainly supported by large expected increases in house prices.  The property market was pulling itself up by its own bootstraps.  Property investors, for example, were not too bothered that rents were low, since they anticipated hefty capital gains on property.  Once investors came to realise, however, that those rosy expectations were going to disappoint, it became clear that house prices were badly misaligned with rents and the market went into reverse. <br/><br/>Another question we address in the Fed paper is how house price reversals affect different sectors of the economy.  We found that home buyers appear to be the most affected by fluctuations in house prices, especially if they lose their jobs in a downturn.  We did note that low initial loan to value, LTV, ratios offered some protection to home owners.  From that perspective, I expressed concern in 2006 and 2007 about rising loan to value ratios for mortgages.  Data showed that one in three new home buyers in 2006 took out a 100% mortgage.  Moreover, the number of first-time buyers taking out loans with little or no deposit doubled in 2006 from the year before.  In an interview for <i>Irish Property Buyer</i>in July 2006 I said: &quot;What we should be seeing are moves to restrict the loan to value ratios for mortgages, for instance.  That would be a good start.  Giving people 100% mortgages is a move in completely the wrong direction.  It brought in people on the margins and in the event of a downturn they are going to be very exposed.&quot;  Worryingly, the data also shows that nearly two thirds of all new home mortgages taken out in 2006 had amortisation periods of 31-35 years or longer.  Such heavy borrowing rendered many households very vulnerable to a downturn.<br/><br/>Mortgage lenders are also affected by swings in house prices, though we found that their exposure to house prices does not, in and of itself, pose a significant risk to financial stability.  We identified three factors that generally limit the prospects of credit losses on mortgage loans.  First, loans are not typically made for the full value of the property, that is, loan to value ratios are usually low.  Second, mortgage lenders can substantially reduce exposure by securitising a significant portion of the loans that they originate.  A third factor is that nominal house prices are less volatile than commercial property prices.  In the case of Ireland&rsquo;s banks, these three potential mitigating factors were of limited help in containing credit losses.  As I mentioned earlier, loan to value ratios were high, a significant portion of loans were not securitised but rather stayed on the banks&rsquo; books, and the banks were heavily exposed to commercial property, including speculative property development. <br/><br/>In the Fed paper, we also examined the recent historical experiences with banking system stress associated with declines in property prices.  In particular, Japan, Sweden and Norway experienced significant financial system stress in the early 1990s, including, at least <i>de facto</i>, major bank insolvencies.  Although declines in the value of commercial property collateral were a factor in these episodes, residential mortgage lending was not.  As I put in a piece I wrote in July 2007: &ldquo;The most important point, however, is that the banking crises in Scandinavia was more directly linked to drops in the value of commercial property rather than to the decline in house prices.  A struggling homeowner that hands back the keys of the house causes a mild sting to a bank; a property developer that folds owing the bank a packet inflicts a terrible pain.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Finally, we pointed out that typically the residential construction sector, home building, is very vulnerable to corrections in house prices.  The evidence suggests that booms and busts in residential investment can be pronounced. <br/><br/>To conclude, I would like to note that, notwithstanding the patterns that we observe in the data, we did note in the paper that housing bubbles are intrinsically hard to identify, especially when they are occurring.  This is because it is very difficult to differentiate between price changes coming from underlying economic fundamentals, some of which are unknown, unobservable, or unquantifiable, and those based on so-called &ldquo;irrational exuberance&rdquo;.  That concludes my prepared remarks.</p></speech>

Perhaps I can deal with two matters before I move to the lead questioners.  This relates to pre the crisis of property and the banks.  As discussed in his opening statement, in a newspaper article in October 2005, Professor Alan Ahearne warned of the likelihood of a hard landing in the Irish property sector where he cited evidence from research he conducted with former colleagues of his at the US Fed board.  Did Professor Ahearne get an opportunity to present or discuss this research with officials at either the Central Bank or the Department of Finance and, more generally, did he get any feedback on this research from Government officials?</p></speech>

I was invited to give a seminar at which I presented this data.  There was some feedback at that presentation in the sense that there would have been some questions about the study we had done.  I was not invited to present it to the Department of Finance</p></speech>

I did not say, "Here is my forecast, here is what is going to happen".  I did not do it that way; I presented it in much the same way as I presented today.  I presented the evidence, "Here is what we found when we looked at the international experience".  Most of the questions at that seminar, if I remember rightly, were about some of the technicalities.  Nobody said, "This is nonsense", and nobody said, "We are all doomed", and stormed out of the room.  It was not like that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015030400002#R00700"><p>That was very difficult for me to tell just from that seminar.  If one looks at the stuff that was being the commentary in newspapers and in the media, there were very few predictions of a hard landing and very little was discussed about the risks of a hard landing.  It did seem to me at the time that the overall consensus was certainly that there was going to be a soft landing.</p></speech>

He also featured in the &quot;Futureshock&quot; documentary that was broadcast in April 2007, making a remark of stark warnings.  For example, he said he could name 30 or 40 hard landings after studying booms and busts in other countries but could not name one instance of a soft landing.  He said housing markets just do not work that way.  It was about a seven-minute piece in which he was involved.  Did Professor Ahearne get any reaction to these comments from people in property related sectors or from Government officials or politicians following that programme?</p></speech>

I assume it was on the back of that programme.  I spoke about the international experience of house price booms and busts at that meeting.  I did not speak with any officials.  In regard to the property market, I did not get any calls from people in the industry.  I would have socially bumped into people who worked in that industry and I remember somebody saying to me shortly afterwards, "There are a lot of guys gunning for you after what you have said" - jokingly, I take it.</p><p>I think this was in April 2007.  Somebody on the ground was saying to me that the bubble burst last summer, and that this had been the best kept secret in Ireland for the past nine months.</p></speech>

In November 2008, <i>The Irish Times </i>called Professor Ahearne &quot;the economist who told you so&quot;.  That area of his work is very important, and I want to go into it today, but another area of his work that was also very important was when he was working for the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, as an adviser.  He wrote about that in a chapter of a book published recently.  With Professor Ahearne's agreement, I was hoping to get some facts on the record about that period that could help us better prepare for the next stage of the inquiry in mapping out the work we would like to do.</p></speech>

To be honest, I would have to look up my records if we are dealing with some other issues.  This is the context phase, and I was invited in that context.  I know the committee will move on to the nexus phase when it will deal with subsequent issues.  I would be delighted to come back, if I am invited, and discuss those issues.  I am happy to deal with the issues when I was working for Brian Lenihan but, in fairness, in order to give accurate answers, if the Deputy wants to ask me about some of the details, I would need to have a look back at my records.</p></speech>

I did say to him that it would be important that he would have a very accurate picture of what these banks are like, and what their loan books really look like.

We were talking about the property market and we may have got on to Anglo and Irish Nationwide because those were the two most exposed to the property market.  I must say I did not know much about Irish Nationwide.  I remember him saying that this bank was extremely exposed, or something along those lines, and that was news to me.  I knew very little about that bank.  I had known anecdotally that Anglo was very exposed.</p> <p>  On that discussion, he mentioned that Anglo was highly exposed and therefore troubled but that it also had some good stuff.  He said something like that, which surprised me because all the rumours I was hearing at the time was that it was a complete basket case, but he mentioned that.  He may well have been talking about the fact that it had some properties in New York or London, or some in Dublin.  He did not have any such comments about Irish Nationwide.  He seemed to think that it was even worse.</p></speech>

There have been times, as I wrote about, where it has put the entire banking system, or large parts of it, into insolvency, for example, in Scandinavia.  There have been times where although the property market has crashed, the banking system has got through that without that much damage.  Hong Kong is an example.  I covered that economy at the Fed.  It had a 50% decline, peak to trough, in property prices.  It was a really bad crash in the property market but it did not burst the banks.  The banks more or less sailed through that.  I did not have information to make predictions about what the crash in the property market would do to the banks.  It depended on many factors.</p></speech>

They were just that, anecdotes and rumours one would hear socially.  I had always tried to base my commentary on evidence and facts.  Perhaps occasionally I did write commentary in terms of when I talked about anecdotes but what I had been hearing was that the property market had stalled in mid-2006 into 2007.  The price index was not falling but there were very few houses being transacted.  Developers had finished projects.  They might have been able to sell a couple of houses at the asking price.  That meant that the index did not fall.  It looked like the prices were not falling but they were selling very few.  That meant that these developers were not able to pay back their loans.  What happened was they were getting loans.  They would sell off all these properties.  They would then use the money from the properties to pay off their loans, but they must have been stuck at that stage.  What I was hearing was that the some of the banks may have been rolling over these loans.  They were not getting repaid by the developer, and that was a problem, but rather than a developer formally defaulting, they were making a new loan to the developer.  The developer would use the money from the new loan to pay back the old one, and the developer would therefore not be in default.  It would look on the bank's books that the loans were fine, but there was a big problem because the developer was not selling the properties.  That is the sort of rumour I picked up on, and that worried me.  It reminded me of the Japanese experience where the banks kept rolling over the property developers even though they were de facto bust, and that worried me a little bit.</p></speech>

I said at the time that it was important not to let the banks go into a disorderly failure.  It was important that people did not walk into an Irish bank next morning to withdraw money only to be told there was no money.  That would have been chaotic.  That is a disorderly failure.  The Government was absolutely right to make sure that did not happen.  I mentioned how important it was to safeguard deposits.  A few weeks earlier there was some panic around and people saying on radio programmes that they were withdrawing money.  I had written an article saying that people should not panic, deposits would be safe, that I was sure the Government would do everything to protect deposits.</p> <p>  I did raise the issue of subordinated debt in that article.

If it deemed the guarantee to be an appropriate, proportionate and not excessive response in approving it, how could it then be a mistake?

That was quite dramatic in the Irish case.  For example, when the IMF was here in 2006 and 2007 for its annual estimate of the Irish economy, it made estimates of things like the structural deficits and the underlying budget position in which it tried to look through the cyclical factors.  At the same time it considers what economists call the output gap which is a measure of whether the Irish economy is overheating or going along about where one would expect it to be.</p> <p>  In 2006 and 2007 it said the output gap was zero, the economy was exactly where it thought it should be, there was no overheating.  It thought the structural balance was in surplus so it said even if one went deeply into it and took out the cycle, the public finances looked fine.  That was published in its Article IV reports.  I presume at the time that must have been taken as a sign.  Here was an experienced international organisation giving the green light to the Irish economy.</p> <p>  When it reworked that, using the same methods but with more data now, and everybody is wiser after the fact, it estimates that the Irish economy was greatly overheated to the tune of almost 7% of GDP in 2007 and there was an enormous underlying structural deficit of 9% of GDP.  It is now saying that the public finances were greatly boosted by the property bubble but the techniques they had did not identify that.  Now it sees the bust and that changes everything but at the time it issued its report and other economists were making similar calculations it did not have the benefit of seeing the bust and those techniques produced what looked like benign results. </p></speech>

It is an international organisation that had seen these booms and busts all over the world in advanced countries and developing countries many times.  Part of what happened is that when the EMU was formed the view was that now there is a currency union in Europe, exactly the same as in the United States and therefore we will think about it the same way.  For example, Ireland had a big current account deficit but in 2006 and 2007 it was borrowing huge sums of money from other countries, through the banks.</p></speech>

The sovereign position was fine but it was Ireland as a whole.  Usually that would ring alarm bells for the IMF, but the IMF does not care if, for example, Pennsylvania or California have a current account deficit.  It does not even measure it because it is part of a currency union.  Therefore, the whole issue of current account deficits, which would normally trigger alarms in the IMF and other observers, because we were now part of the euro area, one would no more look at Ireland's current account than one would look at Pennsylvania's.</p></speech>

What I do know is this - as I mentioned in my statement, they are surprisingly common.  Some countries have booms and busts every couple of decades.  That has to tell us something about how popular they are and how difficult it is to stop them.  If we only had one or two and did not have another one in 40 years, we would say: "We learnt the lessons and now it is easy to stop booms and busts."  However, the fact that they repeat so often and there are so many of them, tells us that when they get going there must be something in the system that makes it very difficult, even though we know they are devastating if one gets hard landings.  We know they do terrible things to society and to people's standard of living.</p></speech>

That was a very general consensus, including, I think, across the political system.  I did not move back until 2005 so I cannot speak of what happened before then in terms of the politics.  I do remember noting in the run-up to the general election in 2007 that none of the political parties was recommending the sort of policies that one would have needed to stop the bubble, which were to get rid of tax deductibility of mortgages; force much higher loan-to-value ratios, perhaps with new regulations; and increase income tax.  I presume that if a political party wrote down those policies as an election manifesto, it would not get elected.  However, that is what it would have taken in those days to try to stop the bubble.</p></speech>

It is fantastic.  The amount of money coming into people's pockets is just brilliant.  I remember that, in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the boom, people were complaining about the price of houses but, boy, there were a lot of people employed and wages were rising fast.  The amount of cash coming into people's pockets because of what was going on - this money was being borrowed by the banks from abroad and put into cash in people's pockets - it was extremely popular.</p></speech>

It is not so much the structure of it, or whether one has a financial regulator separated from the Central Bank, or whether they merge together.  I do not think that is particularly important.  What is important is that the regulator does good regulation and acts like a referee in a football match.</p></speech>

The regulator could have done all that stuff, but they had a certain interpretation of principle-based regulation which meant that they really just looked at whether the banks had certain governance systems in place, including having an audit committee.  They put a lot of trust in the senior management of the banks.  That is the very opposite of intrusive, proper regulation and so the implementation of regulation failed dismally.</p></speech>

As an economist, can he give his view of the scale of the fiscal adjustment here if we had allowed banks to fail or if we did not pay bondholders?  Would there have been an adjustment in the fiscal adjustment we had to undertake and what would that be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015030400002#U02400"><p>As regards the vast bulk of the fiscal adjustment we have had to undertake, the &euro;30 billion since 2008, very little of that has to do with the banks.  People often look at the &euro;30 billion put into Anglo and the &euro;30 billion of fiscal adjustment and say that every single penny that was taken out in terms of fiscal adjustment, all the tax increases and all the reductions in wages, all that money has just gone into Anglo.  That is simply wrong, however, and it is an inaccurate way to think about this.</p> <p>  In terms of the banks, the headline number is &euro;64 billion.  Anglo or IBRC is &euro;35 billion.  One really needs to think about the financing cost of those.  If one can finance a bank recapitalisation at a very cheap interest rate, the actual burden of that is much lower than the headline number.  For example, with Anglo and IBRC the vast bulk of that capital being put in by the State has been financed via the Irish Central Bank.  It is the Central Bank which initially owned the promissory notes and now owns the bonds.  They are only now selling debt into the markets.</p> <p>  Interest rates are extremely low at the moment.  They are less than 1% which means that although the headline number looks huge, it is being financed at a really low cost.  If one looked through all the payments from one arm of the State to the other, the annual cost of Anglo is probably somewhere like a couple of hundred million euro.  That is not a small amount of money but it is small relative to the &euro;30 billion adjustment, or relative to the total amount of Government expenditure.</p></speech>

First, can Professor Ahearne clarify whether or not, in his view, the fiscal adjustment that had to be made would have been close to the same?  Second, in testimony here, Governor Honohan has said that the cost of saving the banks is &euro;40 billion.  Is he right or wrong with that figure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015030400002#V00100"><p>The net cost would be a lot less than &euro;40 billion I think.  The problem is that the cost is changing all the time.  As long-term interest rates have fallen dramatically over the last 12 months, the cost of the burden of recapitalising the banks has been reduced.  The &euro;64 billion is a particular number, it is the headline number, but the actual cost, the burden in terms of the Irish people paying out, has fallen quite dramatically over the last 12 months because long-term interest rates have fallen because of the ECB's OMT programme that it announced, and more recently the quantitative easing.  The cost is determined by when the State issues the debt into the market that it is using to recapitalise.  The debt that was used to recapitalise Anglo was not issued into the market.  It was given to Anglo and given to the Irish Central Bank.  That has not gone into the market.  It is still within the system.  It is only now that the Irish Central Bank is issuing that debt to the market.  That is the key time period.  At the moment ten-year money is less than 1%.</p></speech>

It comes back to that article on 14 September 2008 which I think was in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Professor Ahearne said:<blockquote><br /><br />The rumour mill concerning the health of Irish banks kicked into overdrive last week.  Frankly, I find some of the more alarmist statements unhelpful.  Still, banks must take their share of the blame for the heightened sense of uncertainty.  The information that they have been releasing about the quality of their loan books does not always square with the anecdotes about potentially huge losses associated with land purchases and unsold developments.</blockquote>Can Professor Ahearne expand upon this point?  What is his assessment, if any, of the quality and reliability of the information contained in the published accounts of the Irish banks at this point and were there any indications that the Irish banks were insolvent at that time?</p></speech>

I did not have any details.

He responded to that by saying that such comments were an attack on democracy.  I am just wondering what was going on at that time, if you like, for ordinary people looking on and seeing economists at odds with each other, many people at odds with each other, and the Taoiseach making inappropriate comments about naysayers.  Why does Professor Ahearne think all that was going on?  It seems extraordinary looking back.</p></speech>

If one thinks of a property boom there are many different stakeholders who are getting a lot of money out of it, from people selling land, some professionals, the banks themselves.  The property sector, if one defines it broadly, includes not only construction workers, but a huge number of people, all of whom were benefitting personally from what was going on.  Then I think in a wider dimension the Government was a stakeholder in the sense that the Exchequer was taking a huge amount of money from the property bubble in the form of capital gains tax and stamp duty and all that, and was then dishing that money out left, right and centre.  So it was great.  It felt great at the time.  People were saying, "There's something wrong here, there's a large imbalance, and there are risks and this thing could all go pear shaped".  However, people just did not want to hear that.</p></speech>

Most graduates getting PhDs in economics would have worked with extremely complicated models on computers, and they look very sophisticated, but they would not have had a banking sector.  There was no credit in those models.  They started to develop some models with money in them but not credit.  So the profession went down a certain path in which credit, certainly for advanced economies, was completely ignored.  So it does not surprise me, in a way, that economists here, working with the models and the techniques they were working with, would not have paid enough attention to a banking sector.</p></speech>

I had come from a central bank and I had worked on countries like the emerging Asian countries and Japan and Hong Kong and these countries, which in the real world had banking crises and stuff like that, so I had seen it, but to publish a paper in a top journal one would not put a banking sector into one's model.</p></speech>

One of the things that was said a lot is that interest rates were low.  The ECB's interest rates were 2%.  They had doubled to 4%.  People point out that 4% is still low.  That is true but they had doubled and I think people forgot the last part of it, namely, that they had actually doubled.  If one had an interest-only mortgage one's interest payments would have doubled, even though they had gone to what one might think is a low rate of 4%.  If one is extremely stretched, if one has borrowed a lot of money, one would be very sensitive to that.  So if I said the interest rate went from 10% to 20% one would say that was disastrous, but that is a doubling as well.  So I think it was that point that people may not have appreciated fully.</p></speech>

Was it understood that the risks that were being built up through dramatic property price increases could potentially have a major impact on the banks and the banking system?  Does he think that was sufficiently understood by the authorities?</p></speech>

There have been examples in which even a very large decline in property prices did not create an outright banking crisis.  The example I gave was Hong Kong, where property prices in the late 1990s, at the time of the Asian financial crisis, fell by 50%, but they did not have a banking crisis.  What happened there was that they had very low loan-to-value ratios, which protected them.  The banks also had huge amounts of capital and they may well have been more exposed to residential rather than commercial property.  So it is not automatic that if there is a property boom and bust the banks are all going to go bust.  It depends on the extent of it: how bad is the boom and bust, what is the wider context and what happens to the economy.  If the economy goes into recession, does it go into a depression?  One has to take all of that into account and then see what the banks are like and what is their ability to withstand that bust in terms of capital.  That is extremely complicated.  One would have to have the details.</p></speech>

I used the term but perhaps I should not have.  I do not think anybody described it to me as a complete basket case, but there were worries that this was a bank that was deeply exposed to property and the property market was in trouble, and so the logic was that there had to be risks and worries about that particular entity, perhaps more so than for the other banks.</p></speech>

Does Professor Ahearne think, given the loose talk that was going around at that time, that it was credible that people in authority - the Central Bank, the regulator, the executives of the banks themselves - would have been of the view that it was a liquidity crisis?  Is that credible or not credible in Professor Ahearne's view?</p></speech>

I do not know.  It is difficult to really know whether the bank was insolvent.  First, one does not have the data.  One does not know exactly what is going to happen over the next couple of years and one does not have the information on when the economy went into such a deep recession.  One would really have to know the bank's books.  One could say &euro;100 million was lent to a certain developer against collateral, but is it real collateral or is it unrealised capital gained from some other property project that has been used as collateral?  One would have to know that and know the loan-to-value ratios.  One would have to know whether the developer has a different income stream on which to draw or dividends from some shares he or she has bought in order to make good on the loan.  The amount of detail one would have to know to make that assessment is huge.</p></speech>

That rate had doubled from the year before.  Two thirds of all new home mortgages taken out in 2006 were 31 to 35 years or longer.  Is Professor Ahearne satisfied that the tools were there within the legislative powers that the regulator and the Central Bank had to deal with that issue?  Why does he think those risks were not identified and action was not taken?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015030400002#W01900"><p>I am satisfied that the regulator could have done something about that.  The 100% mortgages in particular were extremely dangerous instruments.  They were being used by people who clearly could not afford a property, and they were used to get them into the property market.  I remember, when I lived in the United States, hearing guys talking at half time during a football match about buying houses using these exotic mortgage products in which they got very low interest rates for a few years and then they were restructured.  The point is that one must refinance before the interest rate is reset, or one sells the property before it resets, so the higher interest rate is irrelevant.  That is an instrument that allows people to get into the property market, but boy, is it dangerous, because if the property market falls you are caught.  These seem to me the same sort of thing.  Loan-to-value rates of 100% seem fine if prices are rising, because if house prices go up by 20% the following year a house will have generated equity, so as long as the market is going up it is fine, but the problem is that if the market goes down one is in negative equity.  I was very concerned about that particular development.</p></speech>

Earlier in his testimony, Professor Ahearne discussed how the traditional model of valuing residential property was through rental income.  I think it is ten to 12 times the annual rental income that determines what the price of a house should be, and so forth.  Given that in the buy-to-let sector there were100% mortgages and interest-only payments, and the rent was required to justify the repayments back to the banks, even though no capital was being paid back due to the interest-only payments, did that in any way distort the valuation process?

One could value a house in terms of affordability, at three times the income of the purchaser and his or her partner.  Another way to value it is to consider the rental income it would accrue annually and multiply it by ten or 12.  In terms of prices increasing, and given that there were investors in the market as well as people buying homes, for the purchasers of buy-to-let properties who were paying interest only, spread over 35 years with a balloon payment at the end, the loan-to-value ratio was very low but because the rent serviced the interest no capital was paid down.  Was that distorting the value of rents and therefore distorting the value of the property?</p></speech>

It was an issue.  Some investors had no rents coming in.  The 2006 census found a large quantity of empty properties.  They were buying up property but not even bothering to rent it out.</p></speech>

If they waited two years they expected to have a 30% capital gain and therefore they would sell it.  The gains were capital gains, not rent.

If they had been told the capital gain would be zero they would not have bought these properties because the rents would not have made it worth their while relative to the interest they had to pay.

I was a little surprised at how broad it was.  I had thought the Government would eventually do something to safeguard deposits.  In early September a deposit of &euro;20,000 was guaranteed but one could lose 10% of it, which I wrote at the time invited a run.  That was increased to &euro;100,000, but I was pretty sure that if push came to shove the Government would increase it again, as many countries had done, and make it unlimited to secure deposits.</p> <p>  As I wrote, the wholesale funding was a little more puzzling, particularly the subordinated debt part of it.  I had not appreciated how intense the funding pressure was.  When I wrote that article I was writing about money flowing out of some of the banks and into AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It turned out that those banks were under pressure as well but not quite as much pressure.  I had not appreciated that this was not just a couple of banks but a system problem. </p> <p>  Referring to the earlier discussion about dominos, this guarantee included all the institutions, so there were no two dominos separated from the other four, and I concluded that the Government had decided it was not possible to knock down two dominos without knocking the other four.  I assumed it had considered it carefully and determined that that was the outcome.</p></speech>

Somebody was getting it.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, the people who got it were the depositors and senior bondholders.  If the Government had not recapitalised those banks there would probably have been a 50% discount on all deposits and all senior bonds.  The fact that the money went in made the deposits good and kept them whole.  If the failed banks had not been recapitalised the guarantee would have been triggered.  They were recapitalised to prevent the guarantee from being triggered.</p></speech>

The fact that the Irish State had to recapitalise the banks was an element of that.  It was expensive.  The headline figure was &euro;64 billion.  There was uncertainty around that period about how much extra funds would have to be put in.  That uncertainty was an element, but only one element.  If the Irish economy had grown strongly - if the growth prospects were strong - the markets would have been less worried.  If, for example, outright monetary transaction or the ECB&rsquo;s quantitative easing had been introduced in mid-2010, presumably that would have calmed the sovereign debt market and the market would have continued to lend to the Irish Government at low interest rates and Ireland would not have needed official assistance.  There were many components.</p></speech>

It means that a large chunk of tax revenue will only come in if the bubble keeps going.</p><p>At the time, perhaps in 2006-07, I talked about Norway, which had huge budget surpluses.  This is, of course, because the country has oil and is squirrelling away all the oil revenues.  The oil will eventually run out in 50 years or so, and revenues are therefore being squirrelled away.  I said at the time that if one has a temporary source of revenue, it is a good idea to squirrel it away and not spend it.  In retrospect, that did not happen in Ireland.  There was a temporary source of revenue, the one to which the Senator referred, but it was spent because it was given out in higher public sector pay, welfare payments and Government expenditure.  When the bubble burst the revenues disappeared but the expenditure remained, and fiscal adjustment was required.</p></speech>

I did not have a crystal ball.  All I could do, and it was what I did, was to look at other countries' experiences and say there was a risk.  I tried very reluctantly to put some numbers on over-valuation.  I think I mentioned, possibly on the "Future Shock" programme, a figure of 30% and I gave a figure of 20% to other people.  It was very difficult to put a number on it but it was a significant risk.  The problem I saw with it was that even if one thought there was only a 30% chance of a crash and a 70% chance of a soft landing, the effect - that is, the devastation caused by the crash - would be so large that one would have to take that into account.  One cannot always make policy based on what one expects to happen.  One has to look at the distribution of risks.</p></speech>

I think the talk at the time was that the Government was going to put capital into Anglo, which was going to continue running as a functioning bank.  We were going to have Bank of Ireland, AIB and Anglo Irish Bank and they were just going to continue.  What I was not convinced about was whether Anglo Irish Bank really had a future in the sense that it was a monoline bank.  Where was it going to make its money in the future?  Running Anglo Irish Bank as a going concern into the indefinite future was the part I was unconvinced about.  That was different from saying it should have been shut down there and then, because that was not possible in the sense that Anglo was a very big bank with &euro;70 billion or &euro;80 billion of funding.  If one shut it down there and then, one would have to pay back all the guaranteed funders because it was covered in the guarantee.

One could lend a lot of money to an individual and the loan would be perfectly fine if he or she was able to make the repayment.  The question is whether there was genuine collateral behind the loan or whether these developers were completely exposed to the property market without any sort of diversification.  What we know now is that the latter scenario was the case and, therefore, the loan losses were colossal.  There was not much genuine collateral there and the developers in question had not diversified.  The loan-to-value ratios, even on commercial property lending, were extremely high.  All of those risky bank practices were in place.</p></speech>

Will Professor Ahearne clarify the matter by indicating which parties he was referring to?  Did he mean all the parties?  I am only familiar with the 2007 election manifesto of the party I represent, which referred to high-risk 100% mortgages, ending property tax incentives and intervening in a market that was in crisis.  I am wondering, therefore, to which parties Professor Ahearne was referring.  Does he include the Socialist Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Green Party and others?

This issue was raised by Senator O'Keeffe.  It appears to be a glaring omission, even if I accept that we have the benefit of hindsight.  Why was banking omitted from economic modelling?</p></speech>

The literature suggested the booms and busts were driven by different factors, either by productivity shocks that hit our economy or, at a later stage, by monetary policy, but that there was no need for credit cycles <i>per se.</i><br/><br/>In addition, modelling for this was different technically, as the more elements put into a model, the more difficult it gets.  Therefore, when one added in credit markets - although critical - the model got very complicated.  Deputy McGrath asked me earlier what we would see differently if we added extra countries and their experience over the past six or seven years into a study like ours.  What we see that is different - the IMF has done this type of study - is that the relationship between the credit and property is now very clear.  However, it was far less clear when we were doing our study.  We had some property booms where credit had not expanded that much.  The finding we all talk about now is that we should get worried about property booms if there is an accompanying credit boom.  This is a more recent finding, which benefits from the fact we have far more observations in the current experience.</p></speech>

We had recommended, for example, that in its annual surveillance of a country, the IMF should look for evidence of what we call "rent seeking" where there are distortions.  The IMF does not do that, but we believe it would be a useful thing to do.  We also talked about regulation of State owned enterprises, such as energy, as something that should be included in the IMF's surveillance.  We also mentioned negative findings, but the IMF does not have the expertise to add value in the surveillance of the labour market.  That was the purpose of the study.</p></speech>

This was because they had now lost control of their interest rate and exchange rate, two of the most powerful economic tools an economy has.  Having lost control of those, everything else needed to adjust, but nothing adjusted.  That was not just true in Ireland, but all across the euro area.  I think governments had been exhausted by the effort to join the euro and from meeting the Maastricht treaty requirements and so on and had kind of relaxed.  They seemed to believe that now that the euro was up and running, that was good, without recognising that now they had to be cognisant and very careful of other aspects of economic policy.  They were not.  They took the benefits, in Ireland and other peripheral euro countries, of the very low interest rates, which was good, but that also created risks and the risks were ignored.</p></speech>

He was an adviser to the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, in October 2010 when he said, controversially, "Let us be fair about it, we all partied."  Is the professor re-echoing that sentiment in regard to the bubble?</p><p>Does that tally with the fact that a substantial number of people felt they did not party?  Many people were excluded from the housing market because of the huge price increases.  The generation that managed to get on the property ladder were  saddled with 35-year or 40-year mortgages pitched at unsustainable levels.

With the huge increase in unemployment and huge declines in employment, added to the fact that people had borrowed huge amounts, many ended up in huge financial distress.  People have lost a lot of money because the Government had to raise taxes and cut expenditure to restore order to public finances.  All of these things are terrible.</p></speech>

It finished up at 11 times the average industrial wage, when the normal value was considered to be two and half to four times that amount.</p> <p>  Professor Ahearne said it was difficult for the Government to intervene in the bubble while this stuff was happening, with policies such as income tax increases and loan-to-value ratio adjustments.  There was also what many people would call an incredible, breathtaking, increase in house prices.  What about radical policies to outlaw profiteering in building land and housing, which many felt was underpinning what went on?</p></speech>

One of the things that added to this situation was the reduction in capital gains tax.  That meant the profits for people buying and selling land were taxed at 20%, which was extremely low.  That situation added to the incentive to speculate in property and, therefore, was extremely damaging.  If land is going to be used for buildings then it should be used to build houses at a reasonable cost.  In terms of policy, that was certainly a contributory factor and a problem.</p></speech>

It is not true to say that we had to either set up NAMA or carry out nationalisation and burn bondholders.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised, but it sold a lot of property to NAMA.  There was a bit of a debate at the time that these were alternatives.  That was just flawed thinking, because they are not alternatives.  I think the system we have now has done very well.  The pricing was fair and it gave a big discount on the loans it bought.  I do not think one can be too precise about these things.  Sometimes we suffer from false precision.  The discount was 57%.  If somebody is going to argue that it should have been 59%, 55% or 60% I would wonder how he or she could be so precise.</p></speech>

NAMA followed EU regulations.  It presented a formula for calculating things, and an allowance of 8% was given for long-term economic value.  If one looks at what property prices have done over the past 12 months, that allowance looks modest.  Let us remember that the formula, although it looked complicated, came from the European Commission.  I can understand why the European Commission would want every country to follow the same formula.  The formula is still just an estimate, and that is all.  One is trying to value a piece of land in Leitrim, for example, but there are no sales going on.  How can one possibly value land with accuracy in that case?  The best one can do is talk about a range or margin of error.  I think what NAMA did, in terms of pricing, is that it got the price approximately right.  It is better to get things approximately right than precisely wrong.</p></speech>

I just do not know.  I might be able to come to a better opinion at the end of the inquiry when more information has come in.  I just do not know.</p> <p>  I heard that Governor Honohan had a footnote in his report in which he talked about an alternative scenario in which Anglo Irish Bank was not included in the guarantee but was put under some sort of administration.  That is an interesting hypothesis, but it was only a footnote in a report.  I have not seen a ten- or 20-page paper that goes through that in a counterfactual manner explaining how it would have worked - that the next morning the Government would have announced this, that excluding Anglo Irish Bank would have affected things in a particular way or that it would have worked in a particular way.  Without seeing a worked-out scenario and a detailed paper, it is just a hypothesis at the moment.  It is a footnote in a report, so I do not know.</p></speech>

Anglo Irish Bank was recapitalised to the tune of &euro;30 billion, as I have said.  If I remember rightly, it had, on the night of the guarantee, about &euro;50 billion of deposits and about &euro;10 billion of senior bonds.  Again, I am talking a hypothesis or a counterfactual scenario.  If one considers the counterfactual scenario in which the Government says it is not going to put a cent into Anglo, the &euro;30 billion of losses that the State covered would have fallen on its creditors.  Then, one had &euro;60 billion of senior creditors - &euro;50 billion in deposits and the &euro;10 billion - and one would have discounted them by 50%, which is the number I gave earlier.  That measure would have saved the State &euro;30 billion, if that is what the Deputy asked.  On the other hand, one is talking about depositors, small businesses and individuals with their life savings getting back 50 cent in the euro.  That means that if an elderly person had &euro;200,000 saved with Anglo Irish Bank, he or she would have got &euro;100,000 back.  If one were a small or medium-sized enterprise with the wages for the next few months on deposit then one would have got half of them back.</p></speech>

What if the bank had been liquidated?  In a liquidation all unsecured creditors must be treated equally.</p><p>The liquidator could not have told bondholders he was going to give them nothing back but give all the revenues from selling the assets to the depositors.  Maybe the State could have made good all the depositors but we would still have diluted the losses that could be forced onto senior bondholders by the fact that there were depositors.  It may have saved 50% or &euro;5 billion of the total of &euro;10 billion.</p></speech>

Dr. Bacon, who was before the committee this morning, was the architect of NAMA and he said there were &euro;34 billion in impairments on &euro;80 billion of loans, a write-off of between 50% and 60%.  When the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, introduced the legislation in the D&aacute;il, he said NAMA was being put forward on the basis of a discount of 30%, which would have been some &euro;23 billion rather than the &euro;42 million it transpired to be.  Did the design of NAMA, and the fact that it was based on a 30% discount rather than a discount of nearly 60%, feed into the need for the banks to be recapitalised?  If the eventual level of discount was known at the early stages of setting up NAMA, would the professor have proceeded with setting up the agency?</p></speech>

The Minister did not put forward NAMA on the basis of a certain discount but gave an estimate of the figure.  The actual discount could only be determined by European Commission rules after they had calculated it loan by loan.  The extent to which the property market fell mattered as to the discount but NAMA would have been a good idea irrespective of whether the discount was going to be 20%, 50% or 80%.  The arguments put forward for an asset management company never depend on there being a certain discount as the argument for an asset management company stands on its own two feet.</p> <p>  I was struck by what Professor Dirk Schoenmaker from the Duisenberg School of Finance said at a conference last month.  He is one of the world's leading experts in banking.  He is an independent and highly regarded individual who has also written a paper about the Irish banking crisis.  On page two he writes: "The establishment of the bad asset agency, NAMA, serves as an international example of the successful management of bad assets."  On page 24, he states: "The establishment of NAMA was instrumental in the successful management of the Irish banking crisis."  That is his assessment</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Professor Ahearne talked about the price-rent ratio as an indicator of a bubble.  How important an indicator is it?  Does it rank in the top three indicators?  Is it something that needs to be scrutinised continuously?</p></speech>

We looked at this in a 2005 paper and we found examples of price-rent ratios which suggested a boom or a bust but where a boom or bust did not materialise.  There is no infallible tell-tale sign.  It is useful but it has to be supplemented with other types of information.</p></speech>

Professor Ahearne wrote in <i>The Sunday Independent</i>that the housing market began to turn sour around the middle of 2006, a full year before the global credit crisis erupted in August 2007.

If the bubble had burst here but the global economy was still flying, we would still have had trouble here but not as much, and the recovery would have been much faster.  The first sign of trouble in 2006 was some failed auctions in Dublin's high-end market.  The market had been flying as the overall market rose but some failures in 2006 represented the start of trouble for developers and sellers.</p></speech>

I put a question to the Governor of the Irish Central Bank, Professor Honohan, about the costs of recapitalisation.  He said it would amount to some &euro;40 billion but Professor Ahearne said it would be much less than that.  How much does he think it will be?</p> <p>  I asked earlier if the fiscal adjustment would have been less or more had we allowed Anglo Irish Bank or another bank to fail.  The professor said that, as of today, the saving would be just a couple of hundred million euro.  Can he clarify those two points?</p> <p>  Dr. Peter Bacon said in his closing remarks that the main causes were interest rate deductibility for investors, low interest rates, capital inflows and interbank lending.  If that were true and a Government could see there was going to be a boom in, say, six years' time, what kind of lead-in time would it need to act to alleviate the difficulties coming down the line?</p></speech>

It depends how quickly the Central Bank sell these bonds into the market.  These are all factors.</p></speech>

He answered it by stating that it was probably a lot less than some people would have us believe and that the housing market here began to turn sour around the middle of 2006, a full year before the global credit crisis erupted in August 2007.  With the benefit of hindsight, what is his assessment now of the roles played by the domestic and international factors in regard to Ireland's banking crisis?</p></speech>

There was always going to be deep problems in the Irish economy as a result of the domestic bubble.  The international factors contributed to the bubble, for example, the inappropriately low interest rates in the economic and monetary union.  It intensified the downturn and made it worse because the external environment was so poor.  There was a global recession, the worst downturn in the global economy since the Great Depression.  All that deepened the downturn here.</p></speech>

That is the problem.  Consistent with the evidence I proffered earlier, one really gets worried about housing booms when they are associated with credit booms.  So far we have not seen a credit boom accompanying the recent increase in house prices, but that does not mean that it would not morph into that.  It may well morph into that and that is why it was very important for the Central Bank to introduce the loan-to-value rules that it did.  That will help to keep people safer.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Minister of State with responsibility for skills, research and innovation, Deputy Damien English, and the Department officials.  We are here to consider the 2015 Revised Estimates for Public Services at the Department of Education and Skills - Vote 26.  The timetable for the meeting has been circulated.  It allows for a very brief opening statement by the Minister followed by a discussion of each programme listed in the Estimate with 20 minutes allocated for the discussion of each programme.  Is the timetable agreed?  Agreed.  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement and ask her to try to keep it under the ten minutes allocated, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.668" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12015030400002#B00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the 2015 Estimate with the committee.  My officials provided some background briefing material for the committee, so I propose to keep this opening statement brief.  However, I am happy, together with Minister of State, Deputy English, to provide further details as we work our way through the various programmes that make up the Estimate.</p> <p>  Expenditure in 2015 is set against the background of an improving overall economic situation.  I fully appreciate the sacrifices that all education partners have made in recent years and their commitment to provide quality education against a very difficult financial backdrop and continuing upward demographic pressures.  It is my intention that the improving economic situation will pay a very real dividend to education, an investment that has enormous economic and social benefits.</p> <p>  The 2015 Estimate for my Department is a start in that process.  The net voted sum proposed for the Department for 2015 is just over &euro;8,012 million, made up of current expenditure of &euro;7,447 million and capital expenditure of &euro;565 million.  This is a 0.8% increase compared to 2014.  In addition to voted expenditure, there is a non-voted allocation in 2015 of &euro;362 million in current expenditure under the national training fund.  The fund is financed by a national training fund levy paid by employers.</p> <p>  Gross current expenditure for my Department in 2015 will represent 17% of total gross Government spending.  Of this, &euro;6.44 billion, or over 80% of my Department's gross current allocation, will be spent on pay and superannuation costs.  This is not surprising given that some 96,000, or one third of all public service employees, are found in the education sector.  The superannuation bill, which covers retirement lump sum payments as well as ongoing pension costs, will provide for a total of some 44,200 pensioners by the end of 2015.</p> <p>  My priority in 2015 was to secure additional funding to maintain class sizes, ensure that the education system can recruit more permanent teachers, and provide the expanding numbers of children at school with the education they deserve.  To this end, an additional &euro;57 million over the 2014 gross allocation is being invested to meet growing numbers of children starting school in 2015.  It is projected that an additional 13,000 pupils will be enrolled in schools next year.  This additional funding will go towards providing for approximately 900 new classroom teachers, 480 new resource teachers and 220 new special needs assistant, SNA, posts.  This is a total of some 1,700 new posts.  These additional posts will mean that, by the end of 2015, there will be some 63,600 teachers and 11,330 SNAs in our schools.</p> <p>  I am also providing funding to continue the important reform agenda in education.  An additional &euro;13 million is being provided in 2015 to continue with the literacy and numeracy strategy, junior cycle reform, music generation and the recruitment of ten new preschool inspectors.  A further &euro;3 million is also being made available to fund the provision of high-speed broadband in post-primary schools.  I am also providing, from the capital budget, the second tranche of &euro;5 million in a three-year additional investment in school book funding for primary schools.</p> <p>  Our investment in the literacy and numeracy strategy 2011-2020 is beginning to bear fruit, as evidenced by the significant improvements announced in the recent report on the 2014 National Assessments of English Reading and Mathematics.  This report was prepared by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra.  The report found that overall performance in reading and mathematics in second and sixth classes was significantly higher in these assessments than in the 2009 assessments.  These are the first significant improvements recorded by the national assessments in over 30 years.  In 2014, there was a reduction in the proportion of lower-achieving pupils and an increase in the proportion of higher-achieving pupils in both English reading and mathematics compared to 2009.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that the 2015 financial allocation will allow for the immediate recruitment of a new team of early childhood education inspectors.  This new team will work with the early childhood sector to promote and enhance good educational practice.  This initiative is being driven in partnership with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, and I appreciate his support for this reforming measure.</p> <p>  I will also be restoring &euro;25 million in funding to the higher education institutions which previously had been withheld in 2013 and 2014.  </p> <p>  Changes have been made to the tranching of payments under the student grant scheme.  Students who are entitled to grants will, from 2015-16, receive four months of maintenance payments before the end of December and the balance of five months payments in the following year.  This is a change to the current arrangement whereby only three months payments are made before the end of December and six months payments are made the following year.  The change takes account of requests to alleviate financial difficulties being experienced by students due to the fact that the academic year now starts earlier in many higher education institutions.</p> <p>  From the 2015-16 academic year, payments to the higher education institutions, in respect of the student contribution for those students receiving student grants, will be paid in two instalments, in December 2015 and January 2016, rather than in one single instalment in December, as was previously the case.  This arrangement will mirror the arrangement for payments to the higher education institutions under the free fees initiative.  There will, however, be no change to the total amount of student contribution payments in respect of the 2015-16 year, nor in any subsequent year.</p> <p>  The Government is fully committed to renewing and significantly expanding the apprenticeship system in Ireland.  SOLAS is projecting nearly 3,000 new apprentices this year, more than double the rate seen in 2012.  An additional &euro;10 million is being allocated through the national training fund to ensure that our current apprentices get the most up-to-date training in their specialist areas.  By the summer, I am also looking forward to receiving the report of the recently established Apprenticeship Council, chaired by Pat O'Doherty.</p><p>This report will pave the way for new types of apprenticeship to be developed by the end of the year.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is working in that area.</p><p> Savings measures from previous budgets will impact in 2015.  This year will see the implementation of the final phase of three savings measures from previous budgets, including a &euro;250 increase in the student contribution to &euro;3,000 per annum, the final 1% reduction in pay and non-pay funding for the third-level sector and a 1% reduction in capitation payments in schools and further education.</p><p> My Department's &euro;568 million gross capital expenditure allocation for 2015 will be used mainly in the ongoing delivery of the five-year 2012-16 school building programme.  This involves 275 major school building projects and an additional 80,000 school places to meet continuing demographic increases.  Moreover, to maintain the necessary infrastructure in existing schools, 28 school building projects were included under the 2013 stimulus package and a further 16 projects have been included in the 2015 building programme.  A total of 70 school projects are scheduled to commence construction this year as part of the five-year plan.  This will deliver 27,800 permanent school places, of which 23,700 are additional places.  The projects will support 3,000 direct jobs and 500 indirect jobs.  These projects include 44 new schools and 11 extensions at primary level, five new schools and eight extensions at second level and two new special schools.  Including these 70 school projects, a total of 196 major school projects now have approval to advance to construction, representing a significant investment by any measure.</p><p> Funding is contained in the capital allocation for investment in the devolved additional accommodation scheme as well.  Under this scheme, my Department considers applications on an ongoing basis from individual schools for funding to meet an immediate accommodation requirement because of increased enrolments and where an additional teacher is being appointed.  Under the Department's prefab replacement initiative, approval has been given for 209 primary schools and eight post-primary schools to replace 614 prefab units with permanent accommodation.  Of the total 217 approved school projects, 155 have been completed and a further 21 are on site.  In addition to the prefab replacement initiatives, prefab accommodation continues to be replaced with permanent structures on an ongoing basis as part of the Department's large-scale school building programme.</p><p> Spending of more than &euro;70 million was approved for the 2014 summer works scheme.  This allowed more than 770 schools throughout the country to undertake improvement works to improve their physical infrastructure.  The spending has allowed for the funding of applications received under categories 1 to 6.  Schools that applied under categories 7 to 10 were advised that their applications would be retained for prioritisation if funding for further summer works projects could be secured for 2015.  The feasibility of making further funding available to facilitate consideration of these applications is currently being considered.</p><p> Primary schools are also benefitting in the 2014-15 school year from the payment of the minor works grant.  The &euro;28.5 million made available to schools in December will enable these schools to undertake small-scale repair works without the need to interact with the Department.</p><p> Within the higher education sector, projects are under way at DIT Grangegorman, University of Limerick and NUI Galway as well as minor works funding for the institutes of technology.</p><p> I do not intend to go into any further detail of my Department's Estimate at this stage but I would be happy, together with the Minister of State, Deputy English, to respond to any matters raised by committee members.  I commend the Revised Estimates to the committee.</p></speech>

We expect a further 1% reduction this year in the capitation grant.  This was announced previously.  I understand this will cost in the region of &euro;2.1 million.  There has been an increase in the demographic and I understand 14,000 extra students will come into the system this year.  Is it possible to ascertain what the figure would be if the 1% reduction had not taken place, in the light of an increased student population?  I am trying to get that figure.  I gather from reading the Estimates that providing for the extra 14,000 students will cost approximately &euro;6.4 million in increased capitation costs.  However, we are offsetting that with the 1% reduction of &euro;2.1 million.  Does this suggest that if we were not reducing the capitation grant by 1% there would be a cost of &euro;8.5 million, given the increase in the demographics?  Is that correct?</p></speech>

This is something I raised with the Minister yesterday.  I recognise that under this Government the number of NEPS psychologists has increased, and that is to be welcomed.  The Department set out a target in the region of 273 NEPS psychologists, if I recall correctly.  I am trying to ascertain how many NEPS psychologists are actually in the system.  I know several are out on maternity leave and some are out sick, but they are not replaced.  What is the exact number of NEPS psychologists currently available to schools?  The target is to ensure that every school will have access to a NEPS psychologist.  Will we actually meet that target in 2015?  I know that in 2014 not every school had access to a NEPS psychologist.</p></speech>

He indicated, as did I, that there was an increase in numbers.  He asked about the position for people who were out sick and so on.

Where does that fit in?  One of the biggest criticisms I hear from principals arises when they have several children who they believe are in need of an assessment by a NEPS psychologist.  Some schools with limited access to a psychologist are being forced to limit the number of children they can put forward for assessment.</p><p>There could be a number of students within a school who the teacher might feel would benefit from an assessment that would provide a diagnosis that would allow them get resources, but because the school does not have access to a NEPS psychologist, it can only put forward one or two students rather than an unlimited number.  How are we going to address this issue?  One school I am dealing with in Cork would like to be able to send six or seven students who it feels have a learning difficulty for assessment by a NEPS psychologist, but because the school has limited access to a psychologist, it will probably only succeed in getting assessments for two, or possibly three, this year.  This means three or four students will not have an assessment, leading to a delay in diagnosis and in targeting resources at those students.  How can we overcome this situation?  Some parents will have to get private assessments done, but these cost approximately &euro;400.  Will the new model and the pilot project to be rolled out address some of those issues?</p></speech>

The target number of psychologists is 173, and there are currently 168 employed.  A panel is in place and the Public Appointments Service is currently working through the appointment process to bring the number employed to 173.</p></speech>

We have seconded a number of teachers to NEPS recently, to cover maternity leave absences.  These teachers have the necessary qualifications and expertise to deliver the service.  Obviously, they are teachers rather than psychologists, but we are doing something to fill that gap.</p> <p>  On the new model, we are working currently on how to design the pilot and are engaged with the National Council for Special Education, education research centres and so on to design a meaningful pilot.  As soon as that is done, we will publish the information and invite schools to participate.  I felt it was not appropriate to introduce the new model for September because we did not have the information on complex needs from the HSE and did not have enough time to respond to the concerns of schools.  That is the reason we are introducing a pilot, and we will have the information on that as soon as the work is completed.</p></speech>

Recent reports indicate that we are seeing an improvement in that area.  This is money well spent, but how much is being provided for next year in terms of rolling out that strategy?  Also, the evaluation of DEIS schools is due to be completed and reported to the Department this year.  If the implementation of recommendations in that report requires increased funding or resources, will that be made available?</p> <p>  I do not know if the Minister has the answer to my final question, but if not she can come back to me on it.

As a result, and because we have already reached the targets for 2020, I have brought forward the review of the strategy, and that will happen this year.  I want to focus on areas in which we need to make further progress, particularly DEIS schools.  While DEIS schools did improve, the gap between such schools and regular schools has not narrowed sufficiently.  Therefore, the review of the strategy will focus on DEIS schools.</p> <p>  In regard to the DEIS report, I was speaking to the official working on that report this morning when I met with youngballymun in the Department.  We were looking at what youngballymun is doing in regard to literacy and numeracy.  The report is nearly ready, but it has not yet come to me.  I assume we will have to make a case for increased funding when we receive the report, but I have not seen it yet.</p></speech>

I suppose we cannot move away from this programme without talking about junior cycle reform.  We are looking at the roll-out of the science programme in 2015 and there is obviously a funding issue in that regard.  I know money has been set aside by the Department for the roll-out of junior cycle reform.  Does the Minister want to make a general comment on the current position?  We are well aware of the report that has been put forward but has not been accepted by the teaching unions and of the Minister's stance on it.  Does she want to say anything in regard to how we make progress from here?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the roll-out of the science programme.  One of recommendations made by Mr. Travers was that we should delay the roll-out of that programme.  I am willing to accept that recommendation as part of the totality of his report.  Elements of his report were challenging to me as well as to the teaching unions.  We are going to go ahead with the reform of the junior cycle and I hope there will be re-engagement on behalf of the unions, but it must be on the basis of Mr. Travers's recommendations.  There are other issues and we can engage on them if and when the unions come back into discussions.</p> <p>  My officials have already met with the other partners in education and we are going to have an information session towards the end of March to explain how the roll-out will happen and what the next steps will be.  We have also put online the continuous professional development for teachers.  We want to engage with teachers on the implementation of the reforms.  The English teachers are those who are directly involved currently, since the English programme has started.  I am anxious to engage with teachers of English to ensure they get the continuous professional development available to them so that they are confident, when the time comes, to make assessments.  That will not come for another year, so we have a good period of time still in which to work with teachers and all of the partners in education.  I hope to see some consideration from the teaching unions in regard to what is on the table.</p></speech>

I am happy to do that, but it must be on the basis that the central recommendations, such as the suspension of industrial action and some element of assessment in the classroom, are on the table.  Elements I would not necessarily have proposed are also part of it.  The recommendations cannot be the basis of further negotiations and must be the basis of agreement.</p></speech>

We have seen some progressive legislation in terms of the establishment of SOLAS and the ETBs by the Minister of State's predecessor.  I do not expect to see the benefits of those three pieces of legislation to establish QQI, the education and training boards and SOLAS for a number of years.  There is no doubt it was radical and reforming legislation which will benefit this whole area.  In 2015, we will see the roll-out of the national strategy for SOLAS and apprenticeships coming on board.  I presume the Department will put in place the necessary funding and resources to ensure we can maximise on the establishment of SOLAS.  I do not know if the Minister of State wants to speak about the number of people SOLAS is hoping to take on.  I think we are talking in terms of 70,000.</p></speech>

I would appreciate an update on the implementation of that strategy.  Perhaps he would speak about each of the individual programmes such as MOMENTUM, Skillnets and Springboard and the targets for those schemes in 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Damian English" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12015030400002#E00400"><p>I agree with the Deputy that there has been a major reform in this area in the past couple of years.  There is no doubt about the long-term benefits.  We should try to move as quickly as we can to benefit from them now.  Much reform also took place in 2014 and there were budget changes because of all the reallocations to the different centres.  It is important to use the reform structures as quickly as possible and benefit from them.  We hope to use all the reform structures and I think we are in a position to do that and introduce the changes needed.  We must become, at ETB level, enterprise based and engage with enterprise when it comes to skills development.  That is what we are trying to do as best we can.</p> <p>  The number of people who will benefit from all the formal education and training through SOLAS is about 340,000 but the total number of places is about 270,000.  The number of people in training in SOLAS is 72,000.  We are matching demand but we must ensure they acquire the skills they need.  We are trying to link with the full education and training strategy and the service plans with the ETBs to ensure it is relevant and all the courses and the training are relevant and will lead to a further career or further education. </p> <p>  There are 6,000 places on the MOMENTUM programme this year, including 2,000 places for those under 25 years of age.  The Skillnets programme will support 8,000 education and training places for the unemployed.  Skillnets made another call recently.  I attended its launch and likewise it is trying to engage in a partnership with enterprise.  Springboard made its call a few weeks ago to close at the end of March, if I remember correctly, to provide 5,200 places and 900 full-time ICT skills conversion courses.  The pressure is on to increase the number of people coming through with ICT qualifications.  Skillnets will also support an additional 32,000 training places for those in employment and will continue to increase the number of training days.  We are seeking to provide longer courses.  Given the increase in the number of days, courses are generally longer.  Skillnets is in charge of ManagementWorks.  The training network programme will ensure a wider target market is reached by the programme.  Given that we are using the national training fund which has been contributed to by employers, we are trying to ensure the management training works scheme reflects their needs also.  </p> <p>  It is estimated that there were up to 3,000 new registrations for 2015 for the existing apprenticeships.  As the Deputy is aware, we are reforming the existing apprenticeship scheme.  There is an agreed mechanism to speed up the review and progress is being made in that area</p> <p>  We are in ongoing engagement with CIF around the whole construction sector because the shortage of skills will be an issue for this year as well.  There is much interaction with SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  We are working with CIF to bring about changes in JobsPlus which will help the situation.  At all times the apprenticeships have to be employer driven.  In respect of the next apprenticeship models, the call is open until the end of March.  There has been a lot of what we would call beating the bushes, to the Departments of Education and Science, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection to try to engage with all the providers of education, both private and public, the education and training boards, employers and employer organisations and industry representative bodies to try to ensure we get the proposals.  There are many conversations around this issue and everywhere I go around the country, everyone is talking about it but we need to ensure they come forward and step up with their proposals.  We are prepared to assist those who need help to design or implement them.  Certainly, some are ready with their proposals.  We hope to have all the proposals on the table by the end of March.  The Apprenticeship Council of Ireland will review them and make recommendations to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, following which decisions will be made.  It is hoped to have the new versions ready to be implemented by autumn 2015 but certainly by early 2016.  That will require additional funding but the Cabinet is well aware of that.  We have been at Cabinet on this issue on a couple of occasions.  We will seek the funding required when we know exactly what we can do.  I was asked about the apprenticeship legislation, again this will be designed to match the proposals.  Money is ring-fenced for the uptake of existing apprenticeships this year.  That is probably the short version.</p></speech>

It is critical that the new apprenticeship model is not just for a particular skill.  For example, when the construction industry went bust, the workers' skills could not be transferred directly.  Therefore, when developing a new apprenticeship model it must be geared towards the workforce.  We need to look at what skills will be needed in the next ten, 15 and 20 years and if there is a fall in a particular sector that people who have gone through an apprenticeship model can quickly sidestep into something else and upskill.  It is also important to ensure that all apprenticeships have some level of literacy and numeracy skills built into the programmes.</p> <p>  In respect of the cuts in the capitation grants, the savings that will accrue to the Department amount to &euro;1 million.  I am aware that an increased number of students will enter that sector but I cannot ascertain what the figure would be if we did not have the &euro;1 million cutback.  I was able to get the figure for primary and post-primary but not for this particular programme.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could provide that figure either now or at a later date.</p> <p>  In regard to the education and training boards, some concern has been expressed to me by a number of people from around the country at the level of overdrafts that some ETBs are currently applying.  Some of the ETBs have not accessed those overdrafts but I am getting reports that some have overdraft facilities in place up to nearly &euro;5 million.  While they have not availed of those overdraft facilities, what safeguards are being put in place to ensure that overdraft facilities which have been applied are not used?  I presume this is a safety mechanism and that ETBs will not get to a position where they end up being in significant debt.  What oversight is the Department looking at in that particular area?</p></speech>

In addition, SOLAS is carefully watching the numbers applying in each sector because there has been an oversupply in the past.  Part of the job of SOLAS will be to monitor that supply to ensure that there is not over-concentration in a certain area or a certain apprenticeship, because that will not achieve anything for the country.</p> <p>  Each new proposal will involve numeracy and literacy, but the skills will be very much transferable and, as Deputy O'Brien stated, updatable.  In addition, it is part of a continuous education.  It does not just stop with apprenticeship.  We want to show a career path in which one can continuously add to the apprenticeship as one goes.  The idea of the skills passport is that one can add to one's career.</p> <p>  We are being careful on this occasion not to end up in a position in two or three years' time in which there are workers who are well qualified in a certain area but who cannot get a job.  That is being monitored carefully and will be part of the changes.</p> <p>  When the proposals come in, they will be quite clear.  Some might not suit the apprenticeship model.  There might be a different method, maybe a traineeship or a different kind of in-house course with employers, that could achieve that.  We are trying to ensure that the area of further education and training is flexible enough to adapt and match the needs of employers at both local and national levels.  We are covering that.</p> <p>  There will be no reduction in the number of places on PLCs, VTOS and Youthreach.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred to the capitation grants.</p></speech>

The number of places was the same in 2013 and 2014.  The number of PLC students is 37,318, and the numbers are predicted to be the same.  There will be a review of PLCs at the back end of this year.  It will feed into future decisions on this area.  On the division of the PLC places around the country, in some places the number might seem a little high.  There is pressure on numbers as well.  That will all be looked at in the review to be carried out towards the end of this year.  That will feed into further decisions in that sector.</p> <p>  On the ETBs' overdraft facilities, I will get a proper analysis for Deputy O'Brien.  I do not have the information to hand.  It is being monitored through SOLAS - there is a link - but I will get the Deputy the proper information rather than giving him information now.  It is something that we are anxious to keep an eye on as well.</p></speech>

The Minister of State might comment on the level of guidance available at different levels within the further education and skills development sector.  The ETBs and various bodies such as Intreo would provide some level of guidance, but it is not sufficient.  Attention is not given to this by the Department.  We must ensure there is a comprehensive service so that applicants are advised of the best course to suit their talents and they take up something that will be suitable for them when they come out of their courses.  Where applicants do not make the best decisions or the ones that are appropriate to them, it means they are not making the best use of their time and the State is not making the best use of its fund.  The Minister of State might comment on the level of guidance available in the further education and skills development area and what plans, if any, the Government has to further enhance that.</p></speech>

The problem we can see with it is that there is guidance in a number of areas.  There is guidance in the education and training boards.  There is guidance if one goes into the Intreo office.  There is guidance in schools.  We need an integrated approach.  Part of the strategy is that there is a proper integrated guidance service so we can ensure that at the right stages of one's life, and in each area, one gets enough guidance.  For example, case workers in the Intreo offices were working on the basis of one case worker to 800 clients, and it is now down to one to 500 clients.  Under the planned changes, with the private operators coming in, there will be one case officer to 200 applicants.  One will move from having only five or ten minutes of career guidance or advice to being able to get the optimal offer of 30 or 40 minutes.  This is an issue we recognise in both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  It must be co-ordinated much better.  The integrated guidance strategy, which is down for next year and which is being worked on, will probably address the concerns of the Deputy, and of us all, as to whether people are getting enough guidance at the key time of intervention.</p> <p>  Guidance covers a lot.  As I stated at the guidance counsellors' conference at the weekend, it is a difficult job because it is not only picking a career for a person but giving him or her the tools to rebuild his or her life and pick the correct pathway, be it a career or education, for himself or herself.  It takes a lot of time with the client to understand where he or she is coming from.  It is probably important that we get a community approach to this through all the Departments and ensure we tick the box properly.  The matter is getting the attention it needs.  Naturally, as always, we would like to have as many hours of resources as we can, but we are trying also to balance the books as best we can.  The integrated strategy is the correct way to go.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, is correct in stating that we need to look at an overall strategy in that regard.  I have stated in various forums that there are many demands in the education sector in terms of what we will do with more funding when we have it.  It is one of the areas that needs to be considered in terms of an overall strategy.</p> <p>  On the funding for the ETBs, as raised by Deputy O'Brien, we were able to give them a little extra funding at the end of 2014, which helped with their situation, and we will be monitoring it in 2015.  It slightly reduced the pressure for them at the end of the year.</p></speech>

It is an annual call.  Any provider of Springboard courses is not guaranteed to get funding this year or next year.  Each provider must compete every year.  At present, the proposals are out.  There is a proposal at present that involves evaluating the courses of the past couple of years.  In some cases we probably should be considering two-year funding, because some of it is successful.</p></speech>

I must get the figures for the Chairman.  It is quite high.  I have the MOMENTUM figures, but the Springboard figures are quite high.  I remember reading the report.  I do not have the figures in my head but I will send them on to the Chairman.  There is a good report on that.  The rates of placement and job creation are quite high, and there are some who get a job while in the middle of a Springboard course.</p> <p>  Returning to what Deputy McConalogue mentioned, there are some cases in which we see an applicant taking on a Springboard course, thinking it is the course that he or she wanted.  It goes back to having the correct guidance at that intervention before the applicant picks the conversion course through Springboard.  Some people drop out because they thought the course was something else.  It goes back to the question of career guidance.  That is why it is important that we have career guidance at every stage.  However, Springboard is quite successful.  It is well evaluated.  There is a proper report, which I will send on to the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is being worked on.  It is to ensure there is joined-up thinking across the sector of further education and training.  There is a lot of adult guidance in the ETBs.  Then they go down the road to the Intreo office and there is a crossover there.  It is to ensure we get the best use of resources, but also that the client gets the best service, with enough time with a guidance officer, be it in the Intreo office or in the ETB.  We will have that strategy for 2016 and we will implement it then.  It is to close the gap identified by Deputy McConalogue.  In some cases, applicants take the wrong course.  We can see it at all levels of education.  For some reason, an applicant might end up on the wrong course, or a course that does not suit him or her, and that is a waste of time and also a loss to the State.  The aim is to correct that.  It also recognises that there is a significant need for the service, and a demand.  It is to ensure that we can best manage our resources to deliver that service where and when it is needed.</p></speech>

The increase in student contributions was the main means by which the Government increased income to the third level sector in the past four years.  There are growing pressures on third level institutions from the demographics to maintain quality and meet their responsibilities to students.  How does the Minister plan to fund the third level sector, considering the fact that she has drawn a line underneath increasing the student contribution charges?  Is it correct that as the student contribution fee has increased, the extra funding derived from that increase has not been allocated to third level institutions?  Does she have any plans to change that situation?</p> <p>  I note the Minister's proposals to change the way maintenance grants will be paid.  It was mentioned to me on a number of occasions that the student registration fee must be paid upfront at the start of the academic year, yet the State does not pay it for students on a grant.  That puts particular pressure on students and families who already find the cost of going to college very difficult.  Would the Minister be in a position to engage with institutions to provide a staggered payment option in order that the registration fee, which has now risen to &euro;3,000, could be spread over the course of the year?</p></speech>

I think the Department is taking a hands-off approach.  I know the Higher Education Authority is the body responsible for overseeing and implementing that policy, but the proposal in regard to Carlow Institute of Technology is pretty much dead in the water.  I do not think it will happen.</p> <p>  There is growing concern in regard to the merger of the ITs in Cork and Tralee as there is a difference of opinion between the governing bodies and the staff.  The Labour Relations Commission is now coming into play.  The members are about to balloted on the issue of a technological university.  There is a major flaw in respect of the whole process.  The proposal for the merger of Cork and Tralee is now heading into stage four on the back of an expert panel report that made a number of recommendations.  A number of concerns were raised about the financing model, advising the governing bodies to give further consideration to their income streams, because in the period between the merged entity being established and the awarding of technological university status by the HEA, they would need funding.  There is work to be done on that.</p> <p>  The expert panel also identified the work to be done on the governance structure which is being proposed by the governing bodies of both Cork and Tralee ITs.  My concern is that there seems to be an impression that the governing bodies will press ahead with what they originally proposed, in spite of a number of recommendations being put forward by the expert panel.  Mr. Tom Boland, the chief executive of the HEA, set out clearly in a letter to the governing bodies that the recommendations in the report of the expert panel are an integral part of the process.  He said in a roundabout way that unless the recommendations were taken on board, incorporated and implemented, it would be very difficult for the status of technological university to be granted to the new merged entity.</p> <p>  I do not know if the proposed merger of Carlow IT and Waterford IT can progress.  There is an impression that Waterford will pull out of the process.  The proposed merger of Cork IT and Tralee IT is heading in a similar way and there is even a possibility of industrial action.  I do not know how to resolve the issue but I do know that the Department must focus on it.  The policy on the proposed mergers is crumbling.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, established an expert group under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Cassells to look at the future funding of higher education, and I expect the expert group to report to me some time this year.  That group is working on the options for the future funding of higher education, an issue on which we have to make decisions.  I need to get that report before we can make those broader decisions.  Everybody has strong views on that issue, as I know the Chairman has.</p> <p>  We have asked the higher education institutions to put arrangements in place to allow students to pay the student contribution in two instalments in order that they would not be asked for the full contribution upfront.  I asked the institutions directly to put that arrangement in place because clearly it is difficult for people to come up with the money</p></speech>

The &euro;25 million has been restored to the HEA.  We expect the higher education institutions to live within the framework for the next year.</p> <p>  The expert group's report will arrive, and as I have said, there are serious issues to look at in terms of the growing demographics and what we expect our higher education institutions to do in terms of their contribution to individual students as well as the economic and social prosperity of the country.

He is due to report to me by the end of March, so I would hope to get that report very soon.  I will not deny that there have been difficulties in the south east.  There have been difficulties in the relationship between the two institutions.  I want to see this succeed.  I think the region deserves to have everybody make every effort to ensure it succeeds.  The region has difficulties but if it can achieve technological university status, there is a very strong belief that it will help the region generally and I support that.  I want to do everything I can to make it happen.  That is why I have appointed Mr. Kelly.  I would encourage the two institutions to engage fully in the process.  I know that Mr. Kelly will make recommendations to me and I will certainly do everything I can to ensure that it proceeds to the next phase.</p></speech>

This is a very useful and welcome debate.  I cannot help but being struck by the improvements that have taken place and the increased allocation to education.  We have come a long way in the past four years.</p> <p>  I want to make a general point on the capital programme but I do not want to get too parochial because each of us will have issues in our constituencies.  As a Deputy, I have often gone through the experience over the past four years that when it comes to the allocation of capital funding for school development programmes, the age issue is forgotten.  I have tabled parliamentary questions about two schools in my constituency, St. Thomas's and St. Anne's.  There has been a considerable level of development in my constituency and other Deputies will have experienced it as well in theirs.  Sometimes, however, when there is an application for an extension that was submitted more than 14 years ago, people cannot help but feel that they have been overlooked and completely forgotten, especially when newer schools that have come on stream in the interim have applied for extensions and have been given priority.  I wish to make that general point on the criteria for examining schools that require extensions or development in terms of the age profile of the applications.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

There has been great progress and I can see it in my constituency but an issue I was wondering about is that some schools are left with a significant number of prefab buildings.  When I go to the school, I can see that the conditions of the prefabs are not acceptable but these schools are not getting onto the five-year building programme because it is not considered that they fit in within the developing area, even though they are taking students from a developing area.  Has the issue of school buildings that are not up to scratch been looked at?</p> <p>  On programme D3, which is to do with building in primary and post primary schools, what is the reason that the current expenditure is reducing?</p><p>Is that because the capital is going up?  Are the two related?  Deputy O'Brien might want to come in on that.</p></speech>

It was to make sure that every child had a classroom to go to.  That is why the vast majority of the last five year programme was spent on building schools and classrooms for demographics.  However, money was spent on some of the older schools as well and in the building programme we are working on now, and which we will be announcing in the middle of this year - the next five year programme - I hope to be able to spend more money on the school that has been established a long time, has not had new buildings, etc., and is looking at getting new buildings.  I hope to ensure we would have more funding for that particular purpose.  Obviously, we will have to include the demographics as well.</p> <p>  When we got some stimulus money for the current 2015 programme and the 70 major buildings that were announced, some of those were for older schools that needed to be replaced, renovated and expanded.  However, I take the point that most of the funding in the previous programme had to go for demographics.</p></speech>

We are always looking for money so if there is any stimulus money we will look for more funding for capital for this year.  We have announced our current capital programme for this year, which included those 70 schools, but we will always chase after any money that might become available.  If we do get money, we will certainly look at schools that are anticipating that they might be ready for the start of the next programme.</p> <p>  There is a positive answer to the Chairman's question on the reason the current spending has decreased.  It is because there are fewer rentals of prefabricated buildings because of the prefab programme.  On the Department's prefab initiative, approval has been given to 209 primary schools and eight post-primary schools, as I said at the outset, to replace 614 prefab units with permanent accommodation.  </p> <p>  I have more information generally on the replacement prefab programme.  Phase 1 of the initiative was launched in 2012, with &euro;42 million in funding to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation at 167 primary schools and four post-primary schools.  To date, 157 of these projects have been completed, with eight currently in train.</p> <p>  Phase 2 of the initiative was announced in June 2013 to allow 46 schools replace 119 mainstream classrooms and 37 resource rooms.  Approval has been given to 42 primary schools with an allocation of &euro;14 million and to four post-primary schools with an allocation of &euro;1.6 million.  Nine of the projects are currently under construction, with seven projects completed at a cost of &euro;3.5 million to date.  The total estimated costs are &euro;15 million, with the majority spend in 2015 of &euro;12 million.  If any member wants that in writing, I can give it to him or her later.</p> <p>  In the new programme to which I referred, we will continue the programme of replacing prefabs because we would all agree it is not ideal, but sometimes prefabs are needed in urgent situations.  One of the significant achievements of my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, was to get that programme under way, and I certainly intend to continue with it.</p></speech>

If so, what will be the latest date by which it could be announced?  It is my understanding that if there was to be one for this current year, applications would already have been sought and received.</p> <p>  On the minor works grant, is there funding in the Estimates for the payment of the minor works grant at the back end of this year?  Is there a specific allocation for that?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned prefab replacement.  Does the Department have an average calculation for the length of time it takes to pay for the capital funding of a prefab based on the average rentals?  Is it five or six years?  It will vary in some cases but is there an overall calculation of the number of years replacing a prefab would take in terms of forgone rents?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-04a.803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1031" speakername="Michael Conaghan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED12015030400002#J04000"><p>I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials.  I commend the Minister on her dedication, work and enthusiasm.  She is a natural in that job.  I want to refer to two or three items.</p><p>I wish to refer to her support and enthusiasm for things that are sometimes not given the impetus and notice they ought to get.  These include apprenticeships, literacy, SNAs, school buildings and the pupil-teacher ratio.  Once funding has become available, both the Minister and Minister of State have been good at not waiting around but getting it done.  Teachers are delighted that the ball has been firmly grasped and that someone is again running towards the line in their direction.</p><p> I know the Minister has an interest in the arts in education.  The primary school curriculum has an emphasis, and rightly so, on the value of the arts in education.  Dance, drama, mime and music have a capacity and potential for children in terms of development, discovery and creativity.  Through such artistic pursuits children can discover new things about themselves deep down, which even their parents did not think about.  These pursuits can become a central plank in human development and discovery.</p><p> Unfortunately, however, the arts generally get a poor showing in primary school education.  Unlike history, geography and mathematics, these subjects are not taught in that kind of way.  Much of that has to do with resources.  One does not find a drama teacher, ballet teacher or a grand piano around every corner.  We need to tackle the matter.</p><p> I want to draw attention to a successful experiment that was undertaken in west Dublin.  They clustered a dozen primary schools together and drew on key resources in Ballyfermot College of Music, Inchicore College of Drama and elsewhere, including one of the leading ballet teachers in the country.  Those children received an induction into the arts such as they or their teachers had never anticipated or experienced.  It was done most inexpensively with no great cost to anyone.  It was just done through existing resources but it was done cleverly.  We must tackle the arts in education.  Rather than waiting for national lottery resources, it can be done in that way.  I will forward to the Minister a document I have drawn up on that experience.</p><p> The further education sector is reasonably new, comprising old technical schools in the vocational sector.  The strength of the latter sector has always been there with one foot in the classroom and one in the workplace.  The vocational sector's deep-seated value and attraction concerns the relevance of education to work, training and advancement.  As the Minister knows, that is also marked in further education.  The city is surrounded by colleges of further education such as those in Ballyfermot, Finglas and Coolock.  </p><p> One of the most important developments in education in Dublin city involves participation rates among young working class men and women, which have sky-rocketed.  Those colleges are on their doorsteps and they see exciting things happening, including music, drama and plays.  The sector also caters for other aspects of the new economy such as child care, computers, legal and social studies.  It is a renewal of the old VEC philosophy of education and training with an eye on the workplace and the marketplace.</p><p> The further education sector is not really recognised, although it is so inexpensive.  When I read reports I expect to see a chapter on further education but I do not.  That is failing to recognise those who are involved in the sector.  They expect to see that their initiatives are getting some recognition but, sadly, they are often disappointed.  I would therefore like to see something being done about that.  I would like to see the arts in education being tackled.  It can be done inexpensively but without any loss of value in tuition and the intervention in young people's lives.  </p><p> The idea of having universities of technology has become something of a fetish.  Everyone wants them but what is the big deal?  One of the most prestigious educational establishments in the world is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  It is a leader and no other university has that kind of status in America where MIT stands out.  However, the idea of universities of technology is a fetish, a competition and a fashion.  I am not saying people are neglecting the educational side of things but it is not the name, title or label; it is what one does.  What kind of intervention does that amount to?  That is what is valuable.  We need to read about that in the newspapers, rather than reading about Carlow wanting this and somewhere else wanting that, which is peripheral.</p><p> I admire the Minister's work.  It is exciting to have her as the Minister for Education and Skills.  I also know the Minister of State, Deputy English, very well from sitting around committee tables.  I know he is a person of action in work and training.  It is a good mix.</p></speech>

I suggest that we group them together with any general questions and try to finish by 12.30 p.m.</p> <p>  I have one point to add to what Deputy Conaghan was saying.  The HEA recently did a study on participation rates but it was not a full study like the Clancy reports, it was much more partial.  The HEA report had low participation rates for Ballyfermot, while the Clancy report showed that areas like Clondalkin had increased participation.  I reckon part of the problem was that in areas like Ballyfermot people would go to Ballyfermot College of Further Education and would not be counted by the HEA.  They should be, however, because people do courses up to degree level in that college.</p></speech>

There is a problem in that the HEA is not recognising the progress in those areas.  It is because it might not fit into what categories the HEA is examining.</p> <p>  I will now call on the Minister to respond to the various points that have been made.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I are working closely on all these issues.  We would both agree with the last point that we need to value further education because it does not receive the recognition it should.  That is part of the work we are doing at the moment.  Ballyfermot is a good example of a college of further education whose work has been widely recognised.</p> <p>  We all feel strongly about participation rates and want to ensure they grow.  Equally, we are valuing apprenticeships as a model.  It is not just about who goes to a higher education institution, it is about who has the opportunity to progress to their own future career choice.  We must give them those pathways as well as providing opportunities to move from one area to another.  That is a big part of our job.  </p> <p>  Deputy Conaghan made a general point about the arts in education. The Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I have signed a charter between our Departments on the arts and their relationship to education.  There are specific areas that we need to work on in that respect.  I personally want to ensure that that happens because it is so invigorating.  Such activity brings out a lot in young people.  If they do not have an opportunity to engage with the arts, they are really missing out on a hugely important area of life.</p> <p>  This year, I have been able to provide extra funding for music generation.  Recently I was in Portlaoise where, through the ETB, I met people working on music generation programmes.  It is great to see young people getting an opportunity to learn to play musical instruments.  The music in the classroom programme is also being strongly supported.</p><p>There is a film festival for schools called the F&Iacute;S Film Festival, and I recently attended the presentations thereon in the Helix.  There is a lot going on, but what the Department really needs to do is to ensure no people are left out and that there are no schools that do not offer opportunities.  Every time I visit a school, a choir sings or people play musical instruments as I enter, and there is art all over the walls.  The work is being done, but our job is to ensure that it is co-ordinated-----</p></speech>

He taught me well in his couple of years here.  He always raises the wider view on what we are trying to achieve.  To add to what the Minister said about the further education and training sector, we recognise very strongly the sector's importance and the fact that it must become a major pillar of our education system.  We are spending over &euro;800 million in the sector, so any issues that arise are not because of a lack of money; it is a question of people's perception.  During the boom years, people turned their backs on further education and training, for whatever reason.  There has been much reform in the sector, and much is delivered in it.  The sector has given very many people the opportunity to engage in further education and training, right up to master's level and beyond, and develop a career path.  There are great opportunities.  There is a need for more crossover between the further education and training sector and the higher education sector.  If we are to address the skills shortage, it will be done through the two sectors equally, and through a combination of both.  We face a skills problem and a mismatch of talents regarding the jobs we are to have this year, next year and later as we recover.  Therefore, the talent drive identified in the Action Plan for Jobs demonstrates that it is necessary to up the game in the further education and training sector and the higher education sector.  There is no doubt about that.</p> <p>  One of the main parts of the five-year strategy that SOLAS has produced concerns the standing of further education and training.  Both the Minister and I are part of this and are going to try to address it.  What the sector is doing and the services it provides need proper recognition.</p></speech>
