He would have loved to have been here today.  I know the committee has much business to do so we will get through the opening statement and then be open to questions that arise.</p> <p>  We are grateful to have the opportunity to address the committee on the important topic of the draft strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development.  Inland Fisheries Ireland was established on 1 July 2010, following the amalgamation of the central and regional fisheries boards.  The agency was established under the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, with many of its powers deriving from the principal Act governing the sector, the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  The main functions of Inland Fisheries Ireland as identified in the 2010 Act are "to promote, support, facilitate and advise the Minister on the conservation, protection, management, marketing, development and improvement of inland fisheries, including sea angling".</p> <p>  It is important to note that protection and conservation of the inland fisheries resource includes the important migratory species in the sea, in particular the Atlantic salmon and sea trout.  These responsibilities were also part of the primary functions of the central and regional fisheries boards, established in 1980, and the boards of conservators and the Inland Fisheries Trust before that.  Salmon fisheries in the marine, estuaries and fresh water are an important asset of the State that yield considerable revenue through angling in particular.</p><p>Inland Fisheries Ireland will, in the course of the next week, be making its own submission in respect of this consultation but it is important for us to identify the key areas where we believe the committee may find it useful in making observations on the documents currently proposed by the Minister or in clarifying the areas where Inland Fisheries Ireland has concern and the reasons for this concern.<br/><br/>The angling resource in the country has long been undervalued - a recent economic assessment identified that this industry is worth some &euro;755 million annually to the national economy and supports approximately 10,000 jobs.  The impact of this socio-economic dividend is largely of benefit to peripheral and rural communities, often where alternative income-earning opportunities can be limited, and the safeguarding of these areas in terms of their earning potential from angling tourism should be a priority.  Rural communities benefit most from small labour-intensive ventures rather than large industrial-sized operations.  The current consultation is specifically about the sustainable development of aquaculture and this opening statement attempts to identify the key issues of interest and concern to Inland Fisheries Ireland that may assist the committee.<br/><br/><b></b>Licensing is a key issue.  The current licensing system has proven problematic but Inland Fisheries Ireland is conscious of the environmental issues that must be considered by the licensing authority in developing a sustainable industry.  Inland Fisheries Ireland supports the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry; the word &quot;sustainable&quot; is key and specifically encompasses sustainability of the development from an ecological as well as financial point of view.  The area of particular concern to Inland Fisheries Ireland is the need to ensure that any aquaculture development does not have a deleterious effect on other industries, such as the valuable salmon and sea trout tourist angling industries.  Inland Fisheries Ireland would welcome reform to the aquaculture licensing process.  Where existing licences are in place and where these have an effect on the wild fisheries, the licence process must be capable of phasing out these sites and selecting alternative sites that do not impact on wild fisheries.<br/><br/>A second important consideration in the reformation of the licensing system is to separate the processes of licensing and regulation.  It would be preferable if these responsibilities were not within the same Department.  The licensing section should remain under the parent Department and the regulation or enforcement remit should be under a different State agency.  The regulatory agency should be appropriately mandated to transparently enforce the licence conditions.  This would also help the licence operators and wild fish interests know the rules within which the industry operates.  Similarly, in the view of Inland Fisheries Ireland, it is unwise for the State to be the licence applicant in a commercial aquaculture venture.<br/><br/>Inland Fisheries Ireland is aware that escapes from salmon farms into the wild are primarily the consequence of an unplanned catastrophe.  The licensing system should include the creation of an emergency fund to facilitate the recovery or clean-up of the consequences of any such events.  This could include the recovery or removal of escapees from local rivers by the competent authority, as well as any other environmental clean-up, such as removal of mortalities from the sea bed.  The current system of licensing includes a series of protocols.  The code of practice for pest control is not, in the view of Inland Fisheries Ireland, adequately robust to ensure the protection of wild sea trout and salmon smolts from lice from marine salmon farms.  This will be dealt with later by my colleague.  It is recommended that the enforcement regime should include a series of incremental penalties for persistent breaches of licence conditions.<br/><br/>Inland Fisheries Ireland favours the development of closed containment recirculatory land-based systems for the farming of Atlantic salmon, as this ensures all outputs can be managed and controlled.  Inland Fisheries Ireland acknowledges that the technology may not yet be at a sufficiently commercial scale but recommends that adequate funding should be provided to assist in developing this aspect of the industry.  Over time, Inland Fisheries Ireland would welcome a gradual move towards onshore recirculation sites and a phasing out of open pen facilities to ensure the protection of the wild salmonid stocks.<br/><br/>On the mollusc side, Inland Fisheries Ireland believes that small-scale mollusc aquaculture activities best suit rural communities that have farming and fishing as part of their existing core skills.  The development of these activities still have very significant potential and these are both low-impact and labour-intensive.  With oysters, Inland Fisheries Ireland notes that disease in the wild oysters has reduced the wild oyster stock in many bays around the country.  The development of farming the Pacific oyster has unexpectedly led to this non-native species becoming feral in Lough Swilly.  Acknowledging that the wild oyster stocks in most parts of the country remain in trouble, Inland Fisheries Ireland recommends that any farming of the Pacific oyster is done in an enclosed regime, with bags and trestles, using triploid stock.</p><p>This will prevent it becoming established elsewhere in the wild.  In areas such as Lough Swilly where they have already become established in the wild, provision should be made to remove the Pacific oysters.  This must be done in line with the requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p><p> The issuing of aquaculture licences in areas where established wild mollusc fisheries exist has also raised concern.  Any plan for the sustainable development of the industry should include provision for the surrender of aquaculture licences where they conflict with wild mollusc beds and their replacement by a licence on a different, new unlicensed site.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Gargan. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paddy Gargan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#G00200"><p>Inland Fisheries Ireland has been concerned about the negative impact of salmon farming on wild sea trout and salmon stocks since the 1980s.  Sea lice derived from local marine salmon farms causing lice infestation on sea trout stocks have been a particular concern.  Many of the sites chosen in the early days of salmon farming were in shallow bays, close to river mouths.  These were not suitable locations for farming salmon from a wild fish perspective.  While there has been some improvement in sea lice control recently, some existing locations remain a threat to wild salmonid stocks owing to their proximity to rivers.</p> <p>  The best documented sea trout angling fisheries were in the Connemara area.  Salmon aquaculture began to develop in bays in the mid-west in the early 1980s and approximately 7,000 tonnes of farmed salmon were being produced annually by the end of the decade.  At the same time as the development of salmon farming in western bays, heavy sea lice infestation was observed on sea trout returning to rivers.  This has been linked to the development of marine salmon farming in the west at that time, with sea trout stock collapses recorded in these rivers in the late 1980s.  I refer to the graph of sea trout rod catches for the Connemara area for the years from 1974 until 2014, which shows a catastrophic collapse in the catch by anglers in the late 1980s.  The stock has never recovered to the levels seen before it collapsed and angling tourism for sea trout is now only a fraction of what it was before the collapse. </p> <p>  With regard to scientific evidence of the impact of sea lice on wild stocks, scientific studies have demonstrated that sea lice from marine salmon farms, when not adequately controlled, can have a serious impact on local sea trout stocks.  Sea trout are especially vulnerable to salmon lice infestation because, in the sea, they remain feeding and growing in coastal waters where salmon farms are located.  A major review of more than 300 scientific publications was published by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, NINA, in 2014 on the effects of sea lice on sea trout stocks.  Scientists concluded that sea lice have negatively impacted wild sea trout stocks in salmon farming areas in Ireland, Scotland and Norway.  The report noted that in farm-intensive areas, lice levels on wild sea trout are higher and elevated lice levels on wild sea trout are found, in particular, within 30 km of the nearest farms, although the distance can also extend further. </p> <p>  The NINA report also examined the potential effect of sea lice on salmon.  Results show that mortality due to sea lice on juvenile salmon at sea can, on average, lead to a decline of between 12% and 29% in the number of salmon spawning in rivers.  It is clear from this report that sea lice from marine salmon farms can have a serious impact on the survival of both wild sea trout and salmon.</p> <p>  The Marine Institute monitors sea lice levels on marine salmon farms on a monthly basis.  According to the 2014 report on sea lice monitoring, sea lice levels on farmed salmon increased in 2014 compared to 2013.  In 2014, some 29% of sea lice inspections were above the treatment trigger level compared to 18% in 2013.  According to the 2014 report, many factors have contributed to these increases.  These include challenges to fish health, husbandry practices and treatment efficacy.  From a wild fishery perspective, the current control of sea lice levels on marine salmon farms is not adequate at some sites and trigger treatment levels need to be based on total salmon farm production in the relevant areas.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has consistently called for the introduction of a total bay sea lice cap, which sets a limit on the lice production level in a bay.  This concept should be introduced in the new proposed strategy for sustainable aquaculture development. </p> <p>  Protracted harvesting of salmon has also been identified by Inland Fisheries Ireland as a factor militating against effective sea lice control as sea lice treatment is generally not undertaken during harvesting.</p><p> With regard to scientific evidence of the impact of escaped farm salmon on wild stocks, there is a large body of published literature on the negative interaction of farmed and wild stocks.  Large-scale experiments showed highly reduced survival of salmon which have interbred with escapees when compared to wild salmon.  In Ireland, official statistics indicate that approximately 415,000 salmon were reported to have escaped from salmon farms in coastal waters in the period between 1996 and 2004, with an annual range of between zero and 160,000 fish.  In February 2014, some 230,000 salmon were reported to have escaped from a single salmon farm in Bantry Bay.  Therefore, the proposal in the strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture to increase farmed salmon production, with maximum biomass on individual farms of 7,000 tonnes, poses a potential threat to wild salmon populations.  This threat is particularly great when the small number of wild salmon in rivers - in some cases as low as a few hundred - is compared to the potential level of salmon farm escapes, which could reach hundreds of thousands. </p><p> I will now refer to the guiding principles for the sustainable development of aquaculture in the draft national strategic plan.  Inland Fisheries Ireland supports the six guiding principles recommended by the Marine Institute for the sustainable development of aquaculture.  Responsible planning to ensure that the overall development of aquaculture and the siting of individual farms are compatible with other uses and the responsible management of the marine environment, as set out in Principle 1, is an important guiding principle for the proposed future expansion of the salmon aquaculture industry.  However, a number of existing sites, which were licensed during the 1980s, were located too close to river mouths and these sites should also be subject to assessment under the guiding principles to ensure the sustainable development of aquaculture. </p><p> It is intended that under Principle 2 - Ecosystem Protection - licensing and ongoing regulation of aquaculture operations will ensure compatibility with the goal of maintaining healthy, productive and resilient marine ecosystems.  The aspiration is that this will ensure maintenance of good water quality and healthy populations of wild species, prevent escapes and avoid harmful interactions with wild fish stocks, protected habitats and species.  Inadequate control of sea lice is a harmful interaction with wild salmon and sea trout stocks.  Under the current licensing and regulation of salmon aquaculture, this guiding principle for sustainable development of aquaculture is not being met with regard to control of sea lice, particularly at sites in the west. </p><p> Under the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's Strategy for Improved Pest Control in Irish Salmon Farms 2008, which is still in place, it was proposed that a feature of the strategy to enhance the control of sea lice infestations on Irish salmon farms should be the creation of a real time management regime.  This regime was intended to deal vigorously with failures to control sea lice infestations on a case-by-case basis.  It was designed to bring progressively tougher actions to bear on sea lice infestation to ensure the highest possible level of compliance.  Actions available include accelerated harvesting of salmon, followed by extended fallowing post-harvesting.  In recent years, there have been examples of individual salmon farms failing to control sea lice below the sea lice treatment trigger level over long periods.  The sanctions available under the real time management cell approach have not be enacted in these cases.  Guiding Principle 2 will need to take account of the inadequacies in the current regulation of sea lice levels on salmon farms. </p><p> Under Principle 3 - Science-based Approach - planning, licensing and regulation of the sector are founded on the best available, impartial and objective science, as delivered by the national and international science community.  This provides the highest level of confidence in the decision-making process and allows for the adoption of a risk and evidence-based approach to determining monitoring requirements that are subject to continuous improvement.  This is an important guiding principle with regard to the proposed future development of marine salmon farms as there have been significant advances in our understanding of the potential negative impacts of sea lice and escapes from marine salmon farms on wild salmonid stocks in recent years.</p><p> Taking account of the best available science with regard to wild fish interactions with farmed fish will be important in ensuring the sustainable development of salmon aquaculture.  Inland Fisheries Ireland is the statutory agency tasked with the protection and conservation of wild salmonids.  These management responsibilities are supported by best scientific advice and it is important that IFI's scientific expertise is fully integrated into any science-based approach for the planning, licensing and regulation of the sector.</p><p>On the scaling and phasing of development of offshore salmon farms, use of the concept of carrying capacity in the national strategic plan, which considers environmental limits aimed at avoiding unacceptable change to the natural ecosystem, is important in ensuring sustainability of aquaculture.  The concept of scale limits and phasing, as proposed, are important for the development of offshore salmon farms and are consistent with the recommendations made by IFI with regard to the proposed offshore salmon farm in Galway Bay.  IFI commented that in any such project, a significantly lower smolt input should be licensed initially, with a gradual build up of smolt numbers only taking place following further rigorous review and consent processes.  IFI believes that intensification should be treated as a totally separate application, with all of the associated statutory consultations and reviews.  This would allow an assessment of any impact of the salmon farm on the environment, flora and fauna and allow mitigation measures to be developed in a more sustainable manner.<br/><br/>While the general concept of scale limits and a gradual phased build-up of production as set out in Chapter 6 are consistent with the approach proposed by IFI, the proposed appropriate maximum for new individual offshore salmon farms of 5,000 tonnes peak biomass is too large as an initial maximum production, particularly as existing salmon farms in Ireland have considerably lower licensed production limits.  There is need to assess the environmental sustainability of offshore salmon farms at individual locations on a trial basis and only after monitoring has shown that no adverse impacts are evident should a gradual build-up of production be licensed.  It will take a number of years and generations of salmon to adequately assess the sustainability of individual sites.  It is, therefore, important that the initial licensed production tonnage be set at a lower level to demonstrate environmental sustainability.  With regard to licensing additional tonnage beyond the initial licensed peak biomass, the recommendation in Chapter 6 that approval to increase the capacity above the initial allowable biomass should only be considered following a rigorous assessment of monitoring outcomes is consistent with this view.<b></b><br/><br/>On biodiversity and sustainable development, the strategic plan notes that Ireland&rsquo;s second national biodiversity plan includes a programme of measures aimed at meeting Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity obligations, including a commitment to halt biodiversity loss by 2020.  Sea trout are listed in Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity plan and the commitments in this national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development must include maintaining biodiversity with regard to sea trout populations.<br/><br/><b></b>On organic salmon production<b>,</b>the strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development identifies the opportunity for increased production of organic salmon.  While organic salmon production may be more profitable, there may be unforeseen environmental consequences.  The Irish Organic Farmers &amp;amp; Growers Association, IOFGA, standards for organic aquaculture state that, regarding sea lice control, in-feed treatments and bath treatments can only be used twice in a 12 month period and not within one month of harvesting.  The standards also note that if it becomes necessary to exceed the restricted treatments, the treated fish lose their organic status.  Therefore, application of organic status to salmon production may hamper the ability to control sea lice on farms and directly impact on wild salmonids, contrary to the guiding principles for sustainable aquaculture.<br/><br/><b></b>On a risk-based approach to licensing, there is a large body of scientific evidence to the effect that the production of farmed salmon in Ireland has had a serious impact on wild sea trout and this impact continues to occur at a number of sites where sea lice are not adequately controlled.  IFI proposes the development of a risk-based approach, using best national and international scientific information to analyse potential impacts on wild salmonids.  This approach should not be confined to new developments but should also review existing fish farm locations.  This risk-based approach is currently being undertaken in the Norwegian salmon farming industry.  Consideration could also be given to designating areas free of aquaculture development, similar to the concept of national salmon fjords in Norway and the existing salmon farm free zone in Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#J00300"><p>I thank Dr. Forde and Dr. Gargan for their submissions.  Of all the issues arising in this area, the salmon issue is the most controversial.</p><p>The concern of the IFI, in terms of the aquaculture issues with which it is most familiar, appears to be around imported species, particularly oysters.  Am I correct that the IFI is of the view that we should not be importing shellfish for farming in our waters for aquaculture and that we should try to develop a native industry that obviously would have a natural in-built resilience to diseases?  In regard to oyster imports, my understanding is that oysters imported from France in particular have caused severe damage to our native stock and that this is a particular challenge.  Perhaps the witnesses would address that issue and outline their view on the importation of seed from places outside this island.</p><p> The main issue of focus today for the IFI is finfish farming.  I get the impression from what the witnesses had to say that finfish farming has damaged the wild salmon stocks and that they are fairly unequivocal about that.  I am sure Dr. Forde and Dr. Gargan are aware that what has been puzzling some of us for some considerable time is the fact that while the IFI has been very strong on this case, and has backed that up with scientific evidence, other State agencies are of the view that the huge expansion of this industry is of major benefit to the country.  From a scientific point of view, somebody is right and somebody is wrong.  Am I correct that the view of the IFI is that finfish farming has been damaging to the wild salmon stock?  Also, if we had never had any farming of salmon in cages around our coast, would the IFI be recommending today that we would be better off at this stage not developing any such farms?</p><p> I also got a particular impression from the witnesses on a second issue, although I may be incorrect.  It was stated that while the IFI believes that finfish farming has caused severe damage, it recognises that people have licences and, as such, this practice could be better facilitated by way of resettlement or re-siting of existing fish farms to more suitable sites as licences come up for renewal, thus removing them from river mouths and so on.  Is the IFI opposed in principle to the setting up of new finfish farms where currently there are none and proposing the relocation of those already in existence when it comes to renewal of licences?</p><p> The next issue raised was the contention that the Department should not be the licence giver.  That makes sense.  I have argued for a long time for reform of licensing, because it is not right that the developer also be the gatekeeper.  The Department's role is to develop aquaculture.  I mean that in the widest sense.  I believe the IFI proposal is an interesting one.  The witnesses also spoke of the need for better monitoring and graded penalties and sanctions.  On that issue, I was recently told - the witnesses might confirm whether this correct - that in situations in which licences for fish farms have expired and those farms do not comply with the various environmental requirements, it is virtually impossible to sue the operators because, as they do not hold a valid licence, they are therefore not bound by the terms of any licence.</p><p>As the fish farms are on an extension of a licence, they are exempt from having a licence, in the strict legal sense.  In other words, one cannot stop them fish farming but they do not have a licence.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that because if that is correct, that would create an emergency.</p><p> In regard to the policy proposal of a maximum limit, and the witnesses seem to be fairly negative on fish farms, they appear to say that the maximum proposed is far too high but even if there were a maximum, it would be totally subject to site specific requirements and we need to be conscious of this.</p><p> Since drift netting was stopped on the coast, did the wild salmon stock recover?  The fishermen were talking salmon from the sea but they were not causing pollution, spreading infections or causing cross-breeding.  Is it the case the salmon stock has not recovered and that other factors, such as municipal waste, finfish farming and trawlers sweeping everything out of the sea have had much greater impact on the wild salmon than the drift net fishermen, particularly the fishermen in a currach ?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#L00200"><p>I thank both Dr. Gregory Forde and Dr. Paddy Gargan for their presentation.  It seems easier to control shellfish farming, be it mussels, scallops or oysters.  It does not have the same impact as finfish farming on salmon and trout.  Mention was made of the effects of farmed Pacific oyster in Lough Swilly contaminating the natural oyster.  I come from an area where we have one of the finest natural oyster beds in Europe and we are lucky that there are no farmed oysters that near to them, as Kenmare Bay is the nearest place where there are farmed oysters.  We have been free of contamination.</p> <p>  I refer to the number of oyster beds around the coast going back 100 years to 120 years which have been wiped out.  Only a few remain - the few that are sustainable.  That was long before we had farmed shellfish or whatever.  There were other factors at work - perhaps over-fishing could be part of it as well as infected waters.</p> <p>  Finfish farming is highly controversial, in particular the proposed salmon farm in Galway Bay.  The size of the proposed Galway Bay project is a cause of concern in terms of fears of cross-contamination with sea lice, fish escapes and the damage this will do to the wild salmon.  I concur that the size and location of the proposed fishfarm will have a detrimental effect, particularly near the mouth of a river as has been said, and the effect on trout and wild salmon of the infected farmed fish escaping from their cages.</p> <p> Dr Gargan mentioned that it may be practical in deeper water and I would like him to elaborate on that.  When he refers to deeper water, is he proposing that the farms be located further out to sea, because the further out one goes, the more exposed one is to weather conditions and so forth?  Mention was made of the significant escape in west Cork, which came about, if my recollection is correct, in the eye of one of the worst storms in my memory.  These escapes have a detrimental effect.</p><p>I have looked at reports from 2009 to 2012 dealing with the damage to Donegal, in particular.  I assume the Marine Institute carried out investigations at that time.  I know the Marine Institute was involved in looking into the reason, cause and extent of the damage in 2011.  Have the major companies been sanctioned or have the reports from the Marine Institute been supported by the Department or the political side?  With proper regulation and proper scrutiny, we can get this right.  However, if the body charged with investigating the effects of bad practices, notwithstanding the inappropriate locations, which is outside all of our control, and the information is not dealt with, it does not auger well for the future.  It makes things an awful lot worse.</p><p> Has political influence been used to curtail in any way the working of the Marine Institute in trying to do the right thing?  The Galway Bay project is being driven politically and that certainly neutralises people who have concerns about the long-term well-being of the wild salmon.  That would certainly be the case up to now, unless there was a U-turn or some way to claw back from the Galway Bay project. </p><p> It was mentioned in the presentation that the development of a closed containment land based system for the farming of salmon would be welcome if the companies were prepared to go down that road.  I have been of the opinion that fish farms could be created on land. I think one would be able to control contamination from lice infestations and escapes.  I understand that there would be a higher cost factor.  Obviously, the consideration of companies investing in fish farming is all about profit and not about the environment.  Profit is the motivation.  Energy costs are another consideration.  Could we have a joined up approach and consider using green energy, availing of tidal wave or wind energy in such projects?</p><p> I think we all want to get it right but we also want to create enterprises in our bays that will contribute to rural areas.  Rural Ireland has been decimated and we need to ensure that people can make a viable living in their area and sustain the local economy.  There are aspects of aquaculture that can be located in areas that would be beneficial to local communities.  It is about getting the right locations.  As it was made quite clear in the presentations, the mouth of a river is not the place to locate fish farms as it has an adverse effect on salmon and trout stocks.</p></speech>

I would agree with the comments on the need to separate licensing from regulation.  Let me put the same question as I have put to previous witnesses.  Do the witnesses see a situation where one can have the angling fraternity and the aquaculture fraternity living within the marine environment we have?</p><p>Are there ways in which they can be mutually supportive, so that one is not to the detriment of the other?  If there were to be a separation of licensing from regulation, would the witnesses add other regulations - for example, on the size of farms, proximity to estuaries and distance of extension out into to sea - and would there be certain no-go areas?  If the witnesses were given<i>carte blanche</i>to lay down the regulations that should be put in place to ensure both a thriving angling industry with adequate stock and aquaculture side-by-side with it, what regulations would need to be put in place?<br/><br/>On the matter of closed containment onshore aquaculture, it seems like a no-brainer that we need to develop that part of the industry, and it would seem to solve a great many problems, but the counter-argument is cost efficiency.  When will this be viable?  Where is the technology being developed?  Do the witnesses know how long it will take for the technology to be applied to commercial production?  Could we in Ireland be industry leaders in that area if we put the proper investment into it?  We are talking about salmon and trout, but are there other species that we should be looking at?<br/><br/>In regard to the potential for growth in the industry, we had a presentation on the potential for hatcheries as a very viable and vibrant part of the industry.  Do the witnesses see the potential of developing hatcheries that would support the industry?  <br/><br/>Multi-trophic farms are being mentioned by the Marine Institute as the way forward.  Could the witnesses advise on the potential pros and cons of these?<br/><br/>Do I sense a change of policy from IFI on the proposed Galway Bay project?  I felt there was a stronger resistance to the Galway Bay fish farm in previous statements I have heard from IFI, but it seems from its statement today that if the Galway Bay project were to be started as a small-scale operation and monitored and expanded gradually, it would not be totally opposed to it.  Previously, I sensed much greater opposition from IFI, based on some of the scientific data, towards the proposed mega fish farm in Galway Bay .</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Gargan and Dr. Forde for their presentations.  I apologise for being late, but I have gone through their opening statements as quickly as I could.</p><p>It seems that they are looking at the testimony from both sides.  Many of the submissions we have heard, be it from IFI or from the Marine Institute, will quote different pieces of research that quite often collide.  I have not got it in front of me, but I think the Marine Institute has quoted Jackson <i>et al</i>., and it would not be exactly what the witnesses have said in their submission.  That makes it even more difficult for members of this committee to make a reasonable and balanced evaluation of what research is out there, particularly with respect to sea lice.  We are trying to bear in mind also the value, particularly in rural peripheral areas, of both the angling industry and the aquaculture industry.  Trying to get the interests of those industries aligned is a hugely problematic exercise and one in which the evidence of both the IFI, the Marine Institute and other stakeholders is very important.</p><p>I agree with the submission on the separation of licensing and regulation, which would seem to be fundamental to good practice.  I suggest that the Department retain the licensing side and that the EPA or the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, might have a role in the regulation of the industry.</p><p>I am pleased to note that they support the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry.  They also mention the creation of an emergency fund to facilitate the clean up after storms, such as the storm in Bantry Bay that Deputy Ferris remembers as the worst in his lifetime.  While that release of farmed fish was significant, it practically put the fish farm out of business as well.  They do want to have their stock released inadvertently.</p><p> In my view, providing an emergency fund to deal with events after they happen does not make a whole pile of sense, particularly with respect to what happened in Bantry Bay.  I submit that under the new Common Fisheries Policy those involved in aquaculture ventures or those who are considering them would get better grant aid for ensuring there are better controls, husbandry and more efficient management of those sites and to beef up controls under a regulatory regime.  Instead of providing public money to assess the damage, we should provide funding to prevent future occurrences.</p><p> Sea lice occurs naturally.  Have Dr. Forde and Dr. Gargan base figures on the natural occurrence of sea lice and the increased occurrences of sea lice in the vicinity of aquaculture ventures?  The document states that in 2014, some 29% of sea lice inspections were above the treatment trigger level compared to 18% in 2013.  However, it does not state how much higher the levels were over the treatment trigger levels.  Were they significantly higher or were they just a couple of base points over the treatment trigger levels?  Were there just one or two incidences of sea lice that were of major concern?  If one looks at all the incidences together, one might get a picture, but if they are looked at individually, how is the regulatory regime enforced?  I believe sea lice are reasonable easy to treat, but what is the view of the witnesses on that?</p><p> One of the problems we have is the significant increase in the seal population.  Is there a report on the impact that an increased seal population has on wild salmon stocks?  Have the representatives formed a view on what action should be taken?</p></speech>

I also apologise if my questions have been asked by other speakers already.</p><p>IFI favours the development of closed containment salmon farms, and that we should move to land based closed containment.  What role will it play in making that happen?  Will the IFI have an input into making this happen?  I would like to tease out what its role will be in that development?</p><p>The Pacific oysters, <i>crassostrea gigas</i>, in Lough Swilly have become invasive and the IFI states that provision should be made to remove the Pacific oysters from the Swilly.  Does the IFI have an active role in making that happen or is it something that it aspires to happening?</p><p>In regard to aquaculture licensing of established wild mollusc fisheries that are causing concern, is the IFI proposal that these licences be withdrawn and replaced with licences in respect of areas that are not affected an aspiration or something that can be done?</p></speech>

There was a real problem when there was no regulation around the importation of oysters from other locations and the movement of oysters.  The preservation of the few bays that are not suffering from binemia to the same extent as others must be tightly controlled.  It would be great if we had a flat oyster that is tolerant of binemia and can still survive.  What often happens is that just as the oysters reach marketable size, they open and die.  A lot of this is regulated through the Marine Institute.  IFI has a specific role around licensing for the harvest of the species.  I do not see this issue being a big problem, provided all of the required controls are put in place and any seed imported comes from disease-free stock and so on.  The big problem in Ireland was that product was being imported, left in one bay for a while and then moved and spread elsewhere.  This no longer happens.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's second question related to finfish and the re-siting of licences for farms.  Dr. Gargan will elaborate further on this point later.  Dr. Gargan and I referred in our opening submissions to problems with the siting of salmon aquaculture sites.  Deputy Pringle asked about aquaculture licensing in areas where wild mollusc fisheries exist.  IFI is in favour of all of these issues being unravelled as part of the new process.  This is about sustainability of aquaculture operations and sustainability of wild fish.  In both respects, we would prefer that the new licensing regime would enable identification of problem areas and the re-siting of operations to non-affected areas, such that people can continue to operate a site but in a place where it has less affect on the wild fishery.  Dr. Gargan will respond now to some of the other questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paddy Gargan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#P00300"><p>On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point regarding the availability of information which suggests that finfish farming has damaged wild salmon stocks, most of the information we have suggests it definitely damages sea trout stocks because sea trout live in the sea close to the shore and in the estuaries.  This information, which is based on experiments involving one batch of salmon going to sea being treated with a chemical to protect them against sea lice and another batch not being treated, points to serious impacts on salmon in particular years.  Most of the research carried out in Ireland is based on the impact on sea trout.  In regard to the point about Jackson et al, a number of studies have been carried out in Ireland and Norway on the treatment of hatchery fish going to sea, with one batch being treated and another batch not being treated.  These fish are examined when they return the following year as adults to determine whether having gone through a salmon farming area they were impacted or not by the salmon farm.  The evidence from all of those studies, including the Jackson study, shows that there is some impact, which in some years may be 10% or 20%.  Dr. Jackson concluded that the impact was minor and that there was a 1% loss in marine survival.</p><p>We believe that, generally, only 5% of salmon return.  If that is reduced to 4%, it equates to a 20% reduction.  All of the studies have found varying degrees of impact, with the impact in some years being greater, which is understandable.  Not all salmon smolts migrating to sea will face the same level of potential lice infestation, as farms may have their lice under control, there may only be smolts on the farm, or there may be a big freshwater influence in some years.  All of the studies reviewed in the document to which we made reference indicate that, on average, the impact on salmon returning is between 12% and 29%.  It may be lower in certain circumstances but it has been higher.  Those studies show that salmon, as well as sea trout, need to be considered.  There is a large amount of information to support this.  In some areas, there is no impact because of the location of farms and the control of lice.  However, this is not the case in all areas, particularly on the west coast.  </p><p> Juvenile salmon are put into the bays in March each year.  As these fish are quite small, they do not have sea lice, which means there will be good survival of salmon and sea trout that year.  It is in the following year, when those fish have increased in size to approximately two or three kilos and lice are difficult to control, that a problem arises.  Generally, the problem arises in the second year.  This is the biggest issue that we believe needs to be addressed.  As the fish in many of the bays are small in year one, it is possible to predict that we will not have a problem that year.  However, the following year, if the lice are not brought under control at the time when the wild fish are going to sea in late March, April and May, there will be a problem.  The challenge is to ensure that the bigger fish do not catch lice.  Quite often, fish are harvested over the May-June period, at which time they may not have been treated for lice and, therefore, it is difficult to control the lice.</p><p> The other issue is resistance to the chemical used to treat sea lice.  There are what is known as treatment failures, which is when fish are treated but it does not have the desired effect.</p></speech>

As set out in our submission, we agree on the need for a split of the licensing and regulatory functions.  As most people operate their farms properly, the industry must be appropriately policed, such that there is not a perception that the industry is not appropriately regulated.  Penalties should be incremental, such that people who continuously breach lice levels are faced with higher penalties.</p> <p>  On the legal question, whether a person operating under a lapsed licence can be found to be in breach of licence conditions is an interesting question and a matter for the courts.  On the question of whether the proposal for the Galway Bay farm is too high, as stated by Dr. Gargan, IFI wants to see every site assessed for what it can sustainably produce.  Without assessments, it will not be possible to identify what level of farming can take place at a particular site.  From my experience in aquaculture - I am sure the committee will be aware of my involvement in the area in the past - I know that when production is ramped up, husbandry issues increase much more quickly.  In other words, one ends up with problems sooner.  Smaller farms had less intense problems. </p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Gargan to address the question on the cessation of drift netting.</p></speech>

The fact that drift netting ceased in 2006 means a lot more fish will have returned.  The Deputy asked whether there were other factors involved.</p></speech>

The biggest issue is marine survival.  In the 1980s, when salmon went to sea, approximately 15% of them returned.  In recent years, approximately 5% return.  Marine survival is approximately a third of what it was 20 years ago.  Generally, salmon smolts are being produced in rivers, as they always were.  There are no major high seas fisheries and there is small subsistence fishery in Greenland for food.  There is no fishery in the Faroe Islands like there used to be.  There is practically no exploitation of salmon at sea.  The issue of them surviving is down to what happens in the sea and marine survival.  The rate has been declining since 2007 but there is some indication this year that it has started to increase again.  It is a bit early to say as it is still in the middle of the season but there are indications that this year may be better than recent years.</p> <p>  To put this in perspective, if we were still drift netting, the position would be much worse as up to half of the fish that were returning would not be reaching rivers.  The policy in place for ensuring that enough salmon get to spawn, with rivers close or only open for "catch and release" if there are not enough spawners, will safeguard vulnerable stocks.</p></speech>

I am not making a case for or against drift netting.  The witness is saying that despite the fact we have banned drift netting, which is seen to be the primary cause of declining fish stocks, the actual returns are reducing.</p></speech>

We attend the annual meetings and there is much discussion about problems at sea.  There was a major research project over four years called the SALSEA project.  Ireland was involved with that and it considered problems in the sea with regard to marine survival.  There was some evidence that large mackerel and herring fisheries were catching juvenile salmon as a by-catch.  That is being investigated.  The SALSEA programme was not able to pinpoint the exact reason salmon are not surviving at sea to the extent that they were 25 years ago.  Fish were captured at sea by trawling and Marine Institute vessels were involved with that.  It is difficult to take in the entire ecosystem, as the salmon go to Greenland, the Faroes and the north Norwegian Sea.  There are changes in the oceans and sea temperatures.  With all the dynamics in the sea, it is very difficult to pinpoint exactly what is causing reduced marine survival.</p></speech>

Our clear preference is that sites deemed to be too close to existing wild fisheries for salmon and sea trout - wild salmonid fisheries - should be relocated to a more suitable location further from an important river.  The Deputy mentioned deeper water as possibly being more practicable but there are issues relating to exposure.  The technology has moved on considerably in the past number of years and there are more sites being developed in deeper water.  There are significant wave heights and that is why the site in Galway Bay is sited inside the Aran Islands.  Another one is proposed off Mayo in the lee of an island.  Dr. Gargan would possibly have experience of international developments, such as deeper water sites in Norway.</p></speech>

With the Galway Bay submission, we stated that the scale of the project was too large and we have not changed our view or policy since.  We argued that it should start small and there was not sufficient information in the environment impact statement regarding the migration route of salmon.  The impact of sea lice and potential for escape of 6 million or 8 million fish to local rivers with just a few hundred fish had not been adequately addressed.  Our main point was that any proposal should start small and be monitored, with any environmental issues addressed.  Only after it was shown that the process was sustainable should there have been incremental increases.  That is what we noted in our observations and what we are saying today.</p> <p>  The guiding principles in the sustainability document point to the fact that there must be environmental sustainability and monitoring is key.  Only after monitoring has shown no impact should there be progression.  We still make the point that the initial amount referenced of 5,000 tonnes is too large, as most Irish aquaculture is 1,000 tonnes, more or less.  To start with 5,000 tonnes as a trial is too large until we know if it is sustainable.</p></speech>

There is a new institute in Norway that has been established with funding from the Norwegian Government to consider specifically how sustainable aquaculture closed containment can be done in an economically viable way.  There is quite a bit of information coming and the institute has dedicated expertise solely examining how closed containment can be pursued.  Norway would now be seen as the industry leader.  There is also economically viable closed containment operating in Canada, with others beginning a number of years of production in Scotland.  Norway is certainly considering closed containment as another means of developing the industry.</p></speech>

This is about a sustainable aquaculture industry and sustainable wild sea trout and salmon fisheries, along with rural communities, as mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  These must absolutely work together.  One should not be given undue preference over the other, and we take that point on board from a wild fisheries perspective.</p> <p>  The issue of segregation of powers was also raised and we have come to that.  There is also the matter of closed containment and cost.  This plan includes financial grant aid systems, which should give greater financial reward in the percentage of funding in order to try to find a workable solution.  Members also mentioned hatcheries and I would have to step away from my specific remit in addressing this.  That issue exists for lobsters in particular but that is outside our specific remit.

As a corollary to this, given IFI's international contacts and experience, do the witnesses believe that most of the fish farming in Scotland and Norway, with their significant at-sea industries, will have moved from open sea cages to land-based sites 20 or 30 years from now?  This is where the major policy agenda lies.  Is this where we should put our money?  What will be the position in 20 or 30 years?

From our point of view, we have seen impacts over the past 25 years, even in the small-scale industry in this country.  We are keen to ensure that any future operations are sustainable, meaning they should start small and prove themselves to be sustainable and not to have an impact.  However, we also see an opportunity for land-based projects because there will be no effluent, escapes or, I hope, sea lice and the projects could be very sustainable.  We argue that if the industry in this country is looking forward and given that production here is relatively small, perhaps the policy should be to focus more on land-based industry and have some initiatives to investigate the development of a fish farming on land.</p></speech>

It has developed a risk-based assessment and is providing figures every year on the likely mortality of wild stocks from existing farms.  In a significant number of locations, the risk of mortality to local stocks is high.  This allows managers to predict where the impact will be and future plan the industry.  Norway is now running with this risk-based assessment and has put in what are known as national salmon fjords in areas where there is a serious problem.  Restrictions have been placed on aquaculture and all fish farms must co-ordinate and treat simultaneously.  Norway is taking the issue seriously because the official state agencies acknowledge aquaculture has had impacts.  It is a very large industry and the country is trying to plan using a risk-based strategy.</p></speech>

The industry should be required to ensure it uses the best available equipment.  The idea of having a fund to recover costs is that, as with all of these types of issues, when something goes wrong in a private industry, the State ends up carrying the can.  Perhaps the fund could be a portion of the licence fee or something like that, although the licence fees are not substantial.</p> <p>  We are aware that there were significant concerns that the 200,000 fish which escaped in Bantry Bay would end up in local rivers.  As to whether we were in a position to go out and ensure they did not run the rivers, we were not in a position to do so.  Luckily for the time of the life cycle, the fish probably dispersed in the sea or were crushed by the nets during the catastrophic collapse of the cages.  We got out of jail, as it were, but who is to say it will not happen again?  For many years, farmed fish have been turning up in the wild, which is not good from a genetic or stock resilience point of view.  </p></speech>

There should be a mechanism for ensuring that this species, which has become invasive, is removed.  Other witnesses who appeared before the joint committee last week hold a similar view to us on that matter.</p><p>It is complicated.  Fishermen were collecting them but the oysters that were too large to be marketable were disposed of over the side of the vessel.  Instead they should have been incentivised to bring the wrong sized oysters ashore to ensure the wild fish could feed.  The food source is wild.  They are filter feeders so they have to be able to feed from the water column.  It is of no use to feed an invasive species.  Let us be honest, the fishermen made significant money from the marketable sized <i>Crassostrea gigas </i>that were harvested at the time.</p></speech>

On an average female with egg strings, the range is from 0.3 to 0.5 as opposed to 2.0 for the rest of the year.  In the critical period in the spring, there were farms that were ten times over the treatment trigger.  The issue we have is that they may have been breaching the trigger for four or five months in a row.  The sanctions that are available were not being brought in.</p> <p>  There are particular locations with repeat offenders who are not maintaining lice levels below the trigger in the protocol, which is a condition of the licence.

There is no relevance to the number of fish on the farm.  We would argue that a large farm has more potential to produce lice even at the trigger level than a small farm and it has more potential to damage wild stocks.  We have been calling for more than a decade that the level should apply to the whole bay and should not be breached, so that fish farming is not impacting on the local wild salmon and sea trout in the bay.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a handle on the issue.  If the level of sea lice could be kept as close to the natural level, one would be doing very well.  Using the natural level as a base, how far off that level are the treatment trigger levels?</p></speech>

We have done many studies over the years to show that sea trout will have an average of three to five sea lice when there is no salmon farming nearly.  In salmon farming areas, they will have 30 or 40 sea lice, or perhaps ten times more.  Those levels are not comparable to the level one wants to keep on the salmon farm because there are hundreds of thousands of fish on the farm.  At present, ensuring that each fish on the farm has only half of an adult female lice cannot be compared to a level that is normal on a sea trout because of the number of sea trout eggs that are produced from the farm that have the potential to get on to wild salmon and sea trout in the locality.</p> <p>  This is back to the risk based approach that the Norwegians use.  They monitor their salmon and sea trout.</p><p>If the number of lice per gram is above a certain threshold, there is a high risk of mortality among wild fish.  They advise that if the lice level on the sea trout and salmon they monitor is at a certain level they will be happy.  If it is at a certain low threshold there is no impact, but the higher it gets, the more potential there is for mortality among wild fish.  That is the risk-based approach they are taking in Norway.</p><p> Rather than set a trigger level regardless of the size of the fish farm, it would be better to ensure the level set is one at which there is no impact on the local wild stock.</p></speech>

The general conclusion were that in rivers where there is a healthy population, seal predation is not of great concern.  It is where stocks are small that there is a problem.  One of the study areas was the River Slaney, where there are valuable multi-sea-winter salmon - that is, spring fish - coming in.

The conclusion was that seals will have more potential impact on vulnerable salmon stocks.  The other site we investigated was the River Moy, and because of the large salmon population, the same level of seal predation would not have the same impact on the salmon population on the Moy as it might on the Slaney.</p> <p>  This study was undertaken to see what had happened since drift netting ceased and whether there had been an increase in seal predation on inshore stocks.  It is difficult to arrive at definitive answers, but the conclusion was that the risk was much greater where the salmon population is more vulnerable.</p></speech>

It is fair to say the joint committee has taken the views of a cross-section of all stakeholders involved in aquaculture, inshore and inland fishing, considering the issue from the perspective of both the industry and statutory agencies such as the IFI.

I welcome from the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, Mr. Derek Iceton, chairman and Mr. Shane O'Dwyer, manager; and from the County and City Managers Association, Mr. Brendan McGrath, chairman of the association's environment, climate change and emergency planning committee and chief executive of Galway County Council; Mr. Joe Boland, director of services, environment, Kildare County Council; Mr. Garrett  Shine, Louth county veterinary officer; Mr. John McCarthy, Limerick veterinary officer; and from the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, Ms Jane Myerscough, chairperson; Ms Sharon Power, co-founder and Ms Claire Owens, welfare officer; from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr. Andrew Kelly, chief executive officer and Ms Barbara Bent, chair of the ISPCA board of directors.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  As they are aware the committee is looking at the wider horse industry in Ireland where policy can be optimised to further develop the sector as a whole.  Last week Horse Sport Ireland and the Irish Bookmakers Association appeared before the committee.   Today, by the nature of the witnesses, we have a particular emphasis on animal welfare issues.  I am sure the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association are equally interested in animal welfare issues.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members have already been reminded of their responsibility with regard to privilege at the earlier session.</p> <p>  I will invite one representative from each group to make an opening statement.

I am chairman of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, an association which looks after the interests of thoroughbred breeders both nationally and internationally.</p> <p>  The thoroughbred breeding industry is unique in that worldwide we are self-regulating and set structures so that we can trade and race with each other.  On behalf of breeders, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association will represent Irish breeders to make sure that they are not compromised in this export-driven business.  This year every country that breeds thoroughbreds will come to Ireland in September where we will collectively agree on principles for equine genome testing for binding international agreements.</p><p>Such undertakings cannot be taken on by Horse Racing Ireland or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> We are very active on behalf of breeders nationally and I will mention a few things we have achieved recently.  We have led the discussions on the implementation of the new EU VAT rules on behalf of the breeding and racing industry, at great expense to our association.  We also led the alliance for racing, where owners, breeders, trainers, jockeys, stable staff and so on came together to lobby the Government.  We continue to have seminars and meetings to keep breeders fully up to date on issues and to help them run their enterprises profitably.  We run winter workshops for veterinarians and breeders to ensure the latest best practice is upheld.  These workshops are responsive to current issues as well as for informing about new practices.  We represent our members on the boards of Horse Racing Ireland, Weatherbys Ireland, Goods, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, veterinary liaison committees, European Federation of Thoroughbred Breeders' Associations and so on.  We continually strive to improve the fortunes of the National Hunt breeding sector, and the recent introduction of a proper series of races for National Hunt fillies has been very successful.  The youth section of our association, the YITBA, runs apprenticeships, career advice and workshops.  It is the fastest growing part of our association.</p><p> The Irish thoroughbred industry is a world leader.  Indeed the description of "bred in Ireland" has the same cache as "made in Germany" for manufactured goods.  It reminds me of a speech made by the former President Mary McAleese when she said no matter where she went  in the world there were the three M's - monks, music and mares.  The Irish thoroughbred industry employs 17,000  people with an incredible percentage of added Irish value.  Not only are our horses renowned, so are our horsemen and horsewomen.  We have been very fortunate that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has always been open to us.  I look forward to future co-operation.</p><p> There are issues of concern.  There is a significant lack of profitability in the industry.  The number of breeders and the number of mares are down 40% on the figures of some years ago.  The market has not increased enough to justify a great expansion in foal numbers, but the loss of so many breeders is an issue, as is the increasing age profile of the national brood mare band.  There is just not enough investment in young breeding stock.  Those who have seen the production of thoroughbred foals as another source of farm income are walking away, as are their sons and daughters, simply because the cost of replacement breeding stock is hard to justify at the lower end of the market.  While the world industry screams for first class quality, the returns to the average commercial breeder often make it a business that is difficult to justify.  For the smaller breeder to replenish breeding stock, they have to compete actively on a world price basis to improve their standard.</p><p> The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, in its budget submission, has asked for an enhanced depreciation scheme to maintain profits being ploughed back into the stud, while at the same time seeking only to improve the quality in our main markets.  We have significant issues with both German and Italian racing, both of which are in steep decline.  Previously, Italy had been a most significant customer not only for the Irish bloodstock but also as great users of Irish stallions and livery, but now that business is now down to a trickle.  British racing, while it is a world leader, offers prize money that is far too low and this in turn leads to a poor return for breeders.  France is the best funded racing nation in Europe through its very lucrative incentives to French owners and breeders.  That makes it very difficult for us to trade in France.  When one trades in France, it will be at a significant discount.  I will elaborate on this when I come to deal with the National Hunt.  There are some great opportunities.  The Middle East, Asia and North America are great markets and the returns are significant.  However in the Middle Eastern and Asia markets we are head to head against the Australian bloodstock and racing industry which is incredibly well-resourced.</p><p> Health issues are paramount and we need to demonstrate the health status of our industry worldwide.  To that end, the industry has set up the Irish Equine Centre based in Kill.  This is a world centre of excellence in equine veterinary diagnostics.  It provides an exceptional horse-based focus in maintaining our health status and it is proactive in dealing with any challenges.  The breeding industry itself provides &euro;800,000 per annum from the foal levy to fund this centre.  This is many times what the racing industry donates directly, but to me the issue is that the non-thoroughbred industry gets away scot free.  If the State were to provide a similar service, it would cost many timers its current funding.  I ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make a promise of significant ongoing funding to the Irish Equine Centre.</p><p>With regard to the non-thoroughbred industry, we have very serious concerns about the low percentage of horses being registered.  My chief worry is that disease does not discriminate between thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred horses, and an outbreak of disease in the country would be a significant issue for us and our export market.  Furthermore, although I realise we live in a single market, I encourage the Department to have more spot checks on horses being imported through our ports.  We have an issue with some overly zealous implementation of veterinary medication rules set down by the EU but implemented by the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In each of the last two seasons, manufacturers have run out of stocks but similar products freely available in Europe for horses have not been allowed to be imported to Ireland.</p><p> With regard to the National Hunt breeding industry, we are again under serious competitive pressure from the French.  That country has a myriad of incentives such as breeder bonuses, and it channels a significant amount of money back to breeders.  We are in open competition with them and getting squeezed.  I instance the derby sale in Fairyhouse, where the number of French animals has risen exponentially over the past number of years.</p><p> We have a wonderful industry and we are world leaders in the area, but there are challenges that need to be addressed now.  The breeding industry is basically self-funded, with little input from Horse Racing Ireland, except in the contribution to Irish thoroughbred marketing, which we co-fund with the body.  The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association is a 32-county body democratically elected among its members and responsive to the needs of Irish breeders.</p></speech>

Our statement is a summary of two detailed submissions we have made to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 27 April 2014 and 25 February 2015.  We acknowledge that this is a very complex area of activity and it is very important, as the horse is very important to the status of Ireland both nationally and internationally.  We understand completely that there are reputational issues arising from horse welfare.</p> <p>  The role of local authorities relates largely to the implementation of the Control of Horses Act 1996.  In this context, the problem of stray and unwanted horses has become particularly pronounced in the post-Celtic tiger period.  Regrettably, the number of horses seized and euthanised in recent years speaks for itself, rising from 2,936 in 2011 to a current high, as of 2014, of 4,923.  Sadly, included in the above is an increasing number of dead horses, which clearly heightens animal welfare concerns, and some of these instances have featured in the media.  In addition, there is a perception on the part of some members of the public, as well as animal welfare groups, that local authorities are wilfully putting down horses and dogs that could be rehomed elsewhere.  This is not the case.  There is also some evidence to suggest that the sector is being used as a rather expensive disposal service.  Many of the horses seized are in poor condition and few are microchipped.</p> <p>  The main reason for such seizures arise from public safety concerns.  There are obvious dangers associated with unsupervised horses in public areas and, in particular, straying on public roads.  This task is carried out by impounding contractors, following a number of tender competitions.  The costs involved are considerable and cover such aspects as call-out, seizure, transport, delivery, microchipping, veterinary inspections, etc.  The spectrum of costs will generally range from &euro;500 to &euro;1,100 per equine.  The problem arises in particular in urban and peri-urban areas.  There is also evidence to suggest that there can be links with criminality.  Until recent years, costs were recouped in full from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, the level of subvention has been gradually eroded to the extent that much of the cost is now borne by the local government sector.</p> <p>  In truth, local authorities do not have the sufficient professional and technical resources to deal with the increasing incidence of horse welfare issues.</p><p>It is noted that, consequent to the passing of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the primary Department with responsibility for all aspects of animal health.  It also has the capacity, particularly with agricultural welfare officers, to deal with such matters.  However, addressing welfare issues in certain urban areas can be very challenging.  We should bear in mind that ensuring animal welfare can be a particularly labour-intensive activity in the context of investigations, veterinary interventions, follow-up inspections, etc.  Council staff respond to welfare issues from time to time, but the broader role of the local government sector in terms of the Animal Health and Welfare Act needs to be better defined.  Most local authorities have one permanent veterinary officer whose primary duties which take more than 90% of the time relate to a service level agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Dog control represents another significant duty.<br/><br/>Despite vigorous enforcement of the Control of Horses Act, it is clear that the problem of stray or unwanted horses, as well as associated welfare issues, have not abated, despite all efforts, and it seems that the problem is growing.  Also, we should bear in mind the considerable expenditure incurred to date.  It is the strong view of the County and City Managers Association that there should be a greater focus on the fundamental causes rather than the symptoms of the problem.  In this context, it would be particularly worthwhile to carry out independent research rather than rely fully on an anecdotal approach to the matter.  In all likelihood, the reasons relate to a combination of the following factors: cultural or status issues attaching to horse ownership; indiscriminate breeding or a refusal to castrate stallions; supplying the food chain, an activity which is now highly regulated; the breeding lifespan; development lands and adverse possession; a culture of carelessness; anticipation of a national cull and association with potential criminality.  There may be other reasons also.  Current arrangements are far too reactive and a more considered and collaborative approach is required.  In turn, this would likely involve smarter use of legislative interventions, possible introduction of a voluntary surrender scheme, new initiatives in the area of education and awareness, as well as an enhanced role for the voluntary sector.<br/><br/>There are a range of stakeholders involved, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the local authority sector, the Garda, the Irish and Dublin societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, other welfare groups, representatives of horse owners, the farming community and, possibly, NAMA.  In this context, our association wishes to emphasise the importance of a collaborative and co-ordinated approach, as no one entity is able to deal fully with the overall problem, having regard, in particular, to different roles and responsibilities assigned to the various agencies under legislation.  There is also a need for a rigorous assessment of current arrangements, better analysis of the extent of the problem and some innovative thinking in addressing the complex issues involved.  Our association, being representative of the local authority sector, is wholeheartedly willing to participate in this process.<br/><br/>In the past two years or so the County and City Managers Association has been engaging actively both at a national and strategic level, as well as locally, with key stakeholders.  In this context, we have provided copies of two submissions, dated 27 April 2014 and 25 February 2015, for the Department in the context of the ongoing review of the Control of Horses Act.  These documents are drawn, in particular, from interaction with the Department, the Garda and local groups, and summarise the position of the local government sector.  In addition, our association would be more than pleased to offer further assistance both to the Department and the joint committee.  We hope the committee will find the accompanying presentation helpful.<br/><br/>Specifically, with regard to the four areas of interest to the joint committee, I will set out our summary position.  The first is the policy on horse welfare and how it is implemented.  The local authority sector does not have a specific policy on horse welfare as the primary focus has always been on control.  However, horses dealt with under the Control of Horses Act are frequently welfare-compromised.  The local authorities have focused on their specific duties relating to control, dealing mainly with nuisance, stray and unwanted horses and, therefore, will mainly encounter welfare issues by default.  The Department, typically, deals with animals in a farm environment, whereas local authorities have more experience of operating in an urban environment which, regrettably, is where much of the abuse takes place.  The animal charities and other welfare groups do, however, often become involved with welfare matters in the urban setting, which is to be welcomed<font color="#0082BF">, </font>provided it is properly structured.  The Department has formalised this arrangement, to some extent, by entering into a service level agreement with the Irish and Dublin societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals.<br/><br/>The second aspect is legislative underpinning.</p><p>Key legislation in this area includes (a) the<font color="#4F4F4F"></font>Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act 1935, as amended, (b) the Control of Horses Act 1996, sections 33 and 37, (c) the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, (d) the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014 and the Control Of Places Where Horses Are Kept Regulations 2014.  The chief executive of each local authority may authorise staff in accordance with the legislation listed at (a), (b) (c) and (d).<br/><br/>The third aspect is how taxpayers' money is spent.  Depending on the number of horses seized in a given year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine annual subvention will range between &euro;2 million and  &euro;3 million, with individual local authorities covering the balance.  Seizing and impounding horses are time consuming and resource intensive tasks.  It is a high risk activity that often requires Garda assistance.  Overall costs will vary from &euro;500 to &euro;1,100 per horse, with the Department granting a maximum subvention of &euro;375 per equine, leaving a substantial deficit to be made up by the local authority sector.  Most local authorities use contractors for the purposes of seizing horses and providing pound facilities.  A national tender is being formulated, although there are a limited number of contractors entering the market.  This relates to a number of factors, including, in particular, the skills required to deal with fractious horses, potentially volatile owners, as well as the requirement to provide secure pounds for the mandatory holding periods.  There are also significant health and safety risks and, accordingly, insurance can be very costly.<br/><br/><b></b>The fourth aspect is proposals for improvement.  The following approaches should be prioritised: address the causes rather than symptoms of the problem; vigorous enforcement, which could involve, for example, a task force for each county or area made up of the local authorities, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Garda to target groups of horses in unsuitable settings such as urban lands, etc. to ensure enforcement of all the new regulations; greater recourse to local by-laws, particularly the designation of exclusion zones; and review of the Control of Horses Act, as outlined in the CCMA submission.  In this context, attached to our most recent submission was a series of recommendations to the Department for consideration in the event of future legislative changes.<br/><br/>On the Animal Health and Welfare Act, there is a need for a service level agreement between the Department and the local authority sector to complement arrangements between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the ISPCA and the DSPCA.  In this regard, each entity would be clear regarding its roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication or omission.  Current arrangements between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authorities in terms of cross-compliance on environmental issues might be cited as a very worthwhile precedent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Power" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#CC00400"><p>On behalf of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, IHWT, I thank the joint committee for inviting us to participate in this meeting.  I will start by providing some background information on the IHWT.  <br/><br/>The Irish Horse Welfare Trust was established in 1989 and is the largest and leading equine charity in Ireland.  It operates from a farm in County Wicklow and is recognised and supported to some degree by the horse industry.  It is also supported annually by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine by way of<i>ex gratia </i>funding.<br/><br/>Approximately 80 horses and ponies are cared for at any one time at the centre.  The trust is largely involved in rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing, but in the past ten years it has also been involved in education and equine welfare horse projects, mainly targeted at the 15 to 22 year age group.  For example, in Limerick we have put 84 young people who are an urban horse-owning community through FETAC accredited qualifications, three of whom have gone on to be jockeys, one of whom is a successful jockey in Kentucky.  We also work in areas of Dublin, including Finglas, Darndale and Clondalkin.  The Finglas project, also known as the Dunsink project, has been referred to by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, as a model of best practice.  Fingal County Council has significantly decreased its annual costs associated with stray and wandering horses in the past few years and been commended for its progressive approach in this regard.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provided funding this year to Irish Horse Welfare Trust in respect of the operation of five micro-chipping clinics to encourage compliance with the new legislation.  These clinics were located in Wicklow, Cork, Offaly and Tipperary.  We also have a follow-up plan to operate castration clinics in those areas.  Unfortunately, many of the local authorities in those counties do not have a designated staff member with whom we can deal directly.  This is a matter on which the local authorities need to be more proactive.  </p><p> The next slide is a photograph of some of the boys who have attended courses at our farm.  The next issue for Irish Horse Welfare Trust is responsibility for horses.  Obviously, the local councils have responsibility for the enforcement of the Control of Horses Act.  We all know there are significant costs involved in the seizure, detention and destruction of hundreds, if not thousands, of equines annually.  There is a never-ending cycle of production of mainly poor quality stock, which is often then mistreated or neglected and picked up by Irish Horse Welfare Trust and other charities.  The seizure and destruction of equines incurs huge costs year-on-year, with an ever-ending circle of breeding, impounding and destruction.  This has been ongoing now for more than 20 years.  </p><p> Managed horse projects and education have proven successful in reducing the numbers of stray and unwanted horses in the areas in which we have worked and in increasing welfare standards.  The Irish Horse Welfare Trust is prepared to engage with all local authorities to find solutions and in this regard has already approached some local authorities around the country.  We have also been contacted by some local authorities seeking help but we are unable to work with all councils unless provided with the resources to do so.  </p><p> The Irish Horse Welfare Trust plans to roll out a national equine welfare education programme through which it will work with local authorities interested in providing education and training for young people in the area of equine care and welfare.  If this is to be successful, it will require buy-in by all local authorities in the problem areas.  This project would require financial support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the provision of a training facility at our farm and to help meet the cost of courses, which could also be part-funded by other stakeholders in education, health and community agencies.</p><p> The next slide shows the types of horses and cases with which we deal that would otherwise be picked up by the pound.  In regard to the last picture, which is of a stray horse that was injured behind a factory, many people were involved in this case, including a local volunteer, who monitored the horse until such time as it reached an area where it could be caught, staff from IHWT, two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a veterinary surgeon.  This operation also took a whole day because, as the horse was injured, the situation was critical.  The next slide is a photograph of a horse in a river, which appears to be dead but made a full recovery.  It had been ridden around by young fellows, following which it collapsed in a river.  The next slide is a photograph of a horse that had a broken leg, probably for almost a year.    </p><p> The Irish Horse Welfare Trust currently runs an equine care and welfare course.  Leaving aside all of the available formal training, including the BHS, it is well recognised that there is a lack of education at a lower level, a need that is currently being met by IHWT.  We also provide accredited education in association with FETAC in the area of stable and yard routines, courses levels 3 and 4 and have also conducted FETAC horse sport riding courses.  All of this training is provided in areas of Dublin and Limerick.  We have established links with RACE and the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners.  Further links on education could be formed with Horse Sport Ireland.  We have a huge population of young people in urban areas that have a genuine passion for horses but a lack of education in terms of how to care for them.  They are also interested in working within our horse industry, if given the necessary training.</p><p> There is no classroom facility at the Irish Horse Welfare Trust farm.  As our classroom sessions are currently run in the hay barn, this means they are confined to being held during the summer months.  We also have a farmhouse that requires renovation, in respect of which plans have been drawn up and the estimated cost is &euro;90,000 to &euro;100,000.  This project was previously deemed eligible for Leader funding.</p><p>We will make a submission to the Department, probably in the next week, seeking funding to proceed with the building project.  This will avoid wasting further time in rolling out our education programmes for urban communities. <br/><br/>On the Dunsink horse project, worldwide negative publicity followed an article carried on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i>which showed a photograph of an injured horse at Dunsink.  This resulted in the Irish Horse Welfare Trust engaging with Fingal County Council and horse owners in the area.  Members of the Dunsink horse project must follow membership rules and a code of conduct.  Each equine is microchipped and allocated a passport and the premises is registered.  Members may not own stallions - the IHWT castrated 13 stallions as part of the project - and breeding is prohibited.  Each member has access to grazing, water and fodder storage, as well as a stable when required.  Manure is removed regularly and each member pays a weekly subscription of &euro;10 for hay.  Educational courses are held on site and at the IHWT farm in Woodenbridge where examinations are also held.  Twenty-two young men have completed FETAC level 4 qualifications as part of the project.  Unfortunately, the examinations were held in the IHWT hay barn because we do not have classrooms.  Our welfare officer, Ms Claire Owens, is involved in weekly management of the project. <br/><br/>Education, training and horse projects offer the only long-term solution to the issues surrounding horses in urban environments.  They also reduce the number of illegally kept equines and promote compliance with legislation.  The projects also reduce the number of horses seized and destroyed, increase welfare standards, reduce costs for local authorities and provide education and training for young people, with a view to securing careers in the horse industry.  <br/><br/>As a County Wicklow based equine welfare charity working across Ireland, the Irish Horse Welfare Trust is actively seeking to establish a national equine education and training programme aimed primarily at educating and training young people within urban horse-owning communities.  The trust needs to refurbish its farmhouse to do this and has developed a project to achieve this objective, for which it will request the Department's support.  We ask the joint committee to support the project. <br/><br/>In recent years we have been experiencing an equine welfare crisis, with thousands of horses put down each year and thousands more suffering as a result.  Ireland has experienced significant reputational damage as a result of negative publicity about horse welfare.  As the land of the horse, we must pull together and address these problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Andrew Kelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#EE00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the joint committee.  <br/><br/>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, is recognised as Ireland's national animal welfare organisation.  It has been providing front-line animal welfare services for more than 65 years.  It is the umbrella organisation for 20 local animal welfare organisations across Ireland.  I am also representing these bodies today.<br/><br/>The ISPCA is concerned about the welfare of all animals in all circumstances.  We recognise that animals will be used for a wide range of purposes in society and strive to ensure the welfare of these animals is protected.  The society operates two rescue centres, the National Animal Centre in Keenagh, County Longford and an equine rescue centre in Mallow, County Cork.  Both facilities deal with animals that are most in need, primarily those that have been seized or surrendered to our inspectors, abandoned, neglected or cruelly treated.  The National Animal Centre deals with horses, donkeys, dogs, cats and other species, while the equine centre in County Cork deals mostly with equines, although it also has holding facilities for a small number of dogs.  The centre has capacity for approximately 20 equines, while the equine centre in County Cork has capacity for around 50 equines.  As such, the ISPCA can only deal with a small number of equines at any given time.  Our role is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home, where possible, but we also take difficult decisions to euthanise animals that cannot be re-homed responsibly. <br/><br/>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is funded mainly by public donations, although we also receive an <i>ex gratia</i>grant from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We do not receive any funding from the equine industry.  <br/><br/>The ISPCA operates a national cruelty helpline which accepts calls from members of the public reporting incidences of animal cruelty, abandonment or neglect.  Such occurrences can also be reported via the ISPCA website.  In 2014 the helpline received more than 21,000 calls, of which approximately 10% related to equines.</p><p> As some members will be aware, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a team of only six uniformed animal welfare inspectors, who cover only 14 counties.  We are in the process of recruiting two more inspectors, one for Limerick and a second for Waterford and south Tipperary, which will increase our team to eight inspectors covering 17 counties.  Our ambition is to cover all 26 counties in due course.  </p><p> In May 2014, following the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, the ISPCA entered into a service agreement with the Minister which resulted in ISPCA inspectors becoming authorised officers under the Act.  This gives ISPCA inspectors certain statutory powers, including the power to enter land and seize animals under some circumstances and issue animal welfare and improvement notices, the latter being a highly useful tool for inspectors.  There are exceptions to our authorisation and it is important to list these.  ISPCA inspectors do not exercise a function in respect of farms that rear animals for commercial food consumption or any horse on such a farm; horse racing events; stud farms; premises of horse trainers; or greyhound racing establishments.  Other authorised officers deal with these areas.  Since becoming authorised officers in May 2014, ISPCA inspectors have initiated more than 45 prosecutions under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, three of which have been finalised in court with positive outcomes.  We may have wished for higher penalties but that is another issue.  Our inspectors, who are on the front line, have an impact.  This year, we published our first inspectorate report detailing the cases initiated by us and finalised in court in 2014.  We will publish an annual report on the cases finalised in court in future years.  </p><p> The ISPCA has dealt with significant equine welfare issues over the years.  Between 2008 and 2014, the ISPCA national cruelty helpline received 10,374 complaints regarding equine welfare, giving an average of 1,729 per annum.  The written submission features a graph showing a sharp increase in the number of calls between 2008 and 2010.  While this appears to have reached a plateau, we continue to receive a large number of calls.  </p><p> Over the same period - 2008 to 2014 - ISPCA inspectors seized or had surrendered to them 401 equines, ranging from donkeys to ponies and thoroughbreds, and covering both rural and urban areas.  The numbers seized or surrendered increased from 13 in 2008 to 103 in 2014, a significant increase.  By the end of May 2015, the ISPCA had already seized 51 equines.  While the number of calls received has declined slightly, the calls appear to be more serious, as are their welfare implications, and we are seizing more animals.  As such, the trend is continuing.</p><p> Many of the equines we deal with had been abandoned and the owners could not be traced either because they were not microchipped or because the last known owner, when traced, claimed the animal had been sold on.  Less than 10% of the equines seized by the ISPCA are thoroughbred or ex-racehorses.  The horses we see are suffering from a range of problems, including starvation, hoof problems and injuries.  </p><p> The ISPCA welcomes and supports the raft of legislation now available, including the Animal Health and Welfare Act, the Control of Horses Act and legislation on the registration of equine premises, microchipping, passporting and transfer of ownership regulations.  However, we are concerned that a lack of enforcement by the Department has resulted in widespread non-compliance. </p><p> The ISPCA has long called for transfer of ownership regulations, which placed a responsibility on both the vendor and the buyer of an equine, to update the passport details held by the passport issuing office.  We were pleased last July when the passport regulations were upgraded.  SI 189 of 2014 placed responsibility on both the vendor and owner to update the record in the passport.</p><p>However, this statutory instrument was replaced in December 2014 by SI No. 601 which came into force on 1 January 2015 and returned responsibility to the buyer only.  Although the vendor has to retain records, he or she does not have to pass them on to the passport issuing office.  This was a large step backwards in the ISPCA&rsquo;s opinion.  Now, when we find a horse that has been microchipped, the last known owners simply say they sold on the animal and that it is no longer their responsibility.  That is a big problem for us.  We queried this with the Department which informed us that the statutory instrument had been replaced following consultation with stakeholders.  We were certainly not consulted on this very important change and, as far as I am aware, neither was any other animal welfare organisation.  For equine legislation to have the desired impact, it must be effectively enforced and all equines must be fully traceable throughout their lifetime.  From our perspective, traceability equals responsibility.  If horses can be traced back to their owners, owners will take responsibility for them.  Unfortunately, it is our experience that the level of enforcement varies both between and within counties.  There seems to be a lack of consistency between some departmental and local authority veterinary inspectors.  It has already been mentioned that local authorities have the power to appoint authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  My understanding is that very few have done so, which is not particularly helpful.</p><p> I would like to mention three case studies of ex-racehorses, as we are talking about that industry.  The first horse was abandoned in County Westmeath in 2013.  We were able to trace the last known owner who claimed that the horse had been sold on but could not supply details of the buyer.  We subsequently re-homed the horse and there are pictures of it in the document we have submitted to the committee.  The second ex-racehorse was abandoned in County Donegal in 2013.  We traced the owner who said the horse had been sold on.  We subsequently re-homed the horse.  The third ex-racehorse was seized in County Carlow in April 2015.  Sadly, we had to euthanise this horse to prevent further suffering.  In that instance we were able to trace the current owner and I believe a case is being prepared.  The ISPCA deals with over 1,700 equine-related calls each year and seized 401 horses between 2008 and 2014, around 10% of which were thoroughbred or ex-racers.  In most cases, the last known owners claimed that they had sold on the horse but were unable to provide information on the new owners.</p><p> We recommend enforcing existing legislation effectively, which is not happening and not consistent across counties.  We would like to see consistency between Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authority veterinary inspectors.  We would also like to see veterinary inspectors being more proactive.  We would further like to see a review of the transfer of ownership regulations.  Let us put responsibility on both the vendor and the buyer to update details with the passport issuing office.  We would like to see a review of all equine legislation and full consultation, including with animal welfare organisations.</p><p> I would like to raise a concern about 2,500 donkeys around the country included in disadvantaged area schemes.  We are concerned about what will happen should these schemes be disbanded or scrapped.  We anticipate that in time there will be a large welfare problem with these donkeys.  </p><p> We would like to see more co-operation between the industry and animal welfare organisations.  We would like to see the industry support animal welfare organisations and, as I keep saying, to make sure all equines are traceable.  We will only be able to do this if the legislation is fully enforced and there is full compliance.</p></speech>

We have heard four very comprehensive contributions.  Our focus is on the entire horse industry, not just thoroughbreds.  Although it so happens that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association is represented today, we had representatives of Horse Board Ireland here last week.  As Ms Power said, the reputational damage caused by cruelty and animal welfare issues affects the entire industry and the reputation of the country.  That is the issue on which we want to focus and work.  The recommendations that have come from all of the representative organisations are very relevant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#HH00100"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  We need to stand back and look at what the joint committee is trying to do.  As the Chairman said, we are trying to figure out how to develop the horse industry from top to bottom, while also dealing with what we know is a major issue, namely, that of the urban horse, stray horses, etc.</p> <p>  We should start at the beginning.  In life very few things happen without money.  A suggestion made to me some time ago which I think is common knowledge was that betting tax could be increased.  While the likelihood of getting more Exchequer funding is relatively slight, betting tax might be put back up.  A figure of 3% has been mentioned, but we need not become fixated on the figure.  We would then have a funding stream which we could use not just for one type of horse but also to resolve issues concerning all horses.  Although the horse industry is massive and has massive potential, we have, unfortunately, slipped in recent years owing to changes in European income tax rules, stallion coverings and so on.  We live in a very competitive world. </p> <p>  My question to the thoroughbred society is this.  Let us suppose there was money available to do it.  How would it develop the thoroughbred industry to make it more profitable and competitive worldwide?  How would it create more employment?  Would extra funding make any difference in that regard or is that not the issue?  I ask the same question of the national hunt, special breed, sport horse industry, etc.  We are going through every sector, from racehorses down.  At times, investing in the horse industry may be more beneficial than investing in multinationals, although I am not setting one against the other.  Are there things we could do a lot better to get better economic returns were we to make the required investment and if we had a steady stream of money?</p> <p>  It would be crazy for us not to deal with a problem that causes huge reputational damage and which is also going to take money to solve.  Can Mr. McGrath tell me if we have any idea of how many urban horses belong to members of the Traveller community?  I remember talking on the telephone to a Galway City Council manager, while I had a Kilkenny man sitting beside me in the car.  I said mischievously to the official that taking horses from Travellers was akin to taking hurleys from Kilkenny men.  I know that Mr. McGrath is not from Kilkenny but from the neighbouring county of Tipperary and that it might hurt him that I still think Kilkenny is the premier hurling county.  There is, however, no point in trying to solve this problem by confiscation after confiscation without dealing with the underlying issue that has been outlined.  Members of the Traveller community have an affinity with horses and rather than try to solve the problem by sanctions, we should provide ways by which they could legally access horses in properly supervised conditions.</p><p>I have a question for the ISPCA, the Irish Horse Welfare Trust and the local authority managers.  If there was a proper funding mechanism and not just a project in Fettercairn or Dunsink and if we were to set up well-managed and well-run horse projects in, or adjacent to, urban communities, which would retain access for these communities which have traditionally been associated with urban horses, do they think it would have a major effect in helping us to allow these communities to enjoy horses in a controlled and positive environment, to reduce criminality and to make it easier to go after the remaining illegal horses and remove them because there would be no support for them?  Do we have any idea of the kind of funding that would be needed if we were to set up a string of these horse projects in urban communities?  I was involved in trying to set one up in Tralee.  There is one in Fettercairn and Finglas was mentioned.  Would the groups see that as being a positive plan?  In the long term, would it save the State money because we would not spend so much time impounding horses?</p><p> I was very interested to hear about the change in the statutory instrument.  Certain things happen unbeknownst to us and I am shocked the statutory instrument was changed.  The same conditions need to apply to horses that apply to cattle in terms of the animal identification and movement system, AIMS.  The minute the animal moves, it should be on the computer and if it is not, the keeper is in trouble.  I have always believed we should cut to the chase here and work towards a system in which there is absolute and immediate traceability of horses.  People should not be able to say that they do not own the horse, or other such excuses.  We need to get to a point where we really clamp down on illegal horses.</p><p> Is it the view of the welfare groups and the city managers that it is not possible to clamp down on illegal horses without a regime in place for urban horses and people living in urban areas, particularly for the Traveller community, which has a huge and legitimate affinity with horses, where that regime would be legitimate, legal, properly supervised and properly funded in terms of ongoing capital and current expenditure funding streams?  Would they be of the view that it is not possible to have one without the other and that we cannot have a clampdown and enforcement of the law without the legitimate out?  I would be interested to know if anybody has costed it so that we have that information when we are putting everything into the 3% imaginary tax we are going to get.  As somebody who is not big into betting, I am all for that tax as long as it goes back into the industry and so on.  It would be a good way of developing our industry.  I am interested in the groups views on this matter.  Would it be possible to get a rough costing sometime in the next few weeks, without gilding the lily?  I often say if one asks for reasonable money, one might get it, but if one asks for ridiculous money, one will never get it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#JJ00200"><p>I thank all the contributors here today.  When they speak about animal and horse welfare, what is quite provoking is how far the system has failed in terms of its responsibility with regard to cruelty and so forth.  My first question is for the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association.  In its presentation it mentioned a sizable decline in the number of small breeders in particular and the effects that is having on the industry, especially the reputational effect when it goes outside the country and so forth.  It also mentioned the prize money factor, particularly in England, the decline in the prize money and the effect that was having on the industry.  Would it be fair to say the prize money on this island is having an equal effect on breeders in its association?</p><p> I commend Ms Sharon Power for her presentation and the tremendous work her organisation is doing from an educational as well as an animal rights point of view.  Would most of the young people in her project be from deprived areas or the Traveller community or would it be widespread?  I lived on a local authority housing estate for a long part of my life on which there were Traveller families living.  Traveller families have a tradition of owning horses and it is my experience that they treat horses as well as they treat members of their own families.  There is that connection and relationship. </p><p> Is it fair to say most of the cruelty we see is associated with abandoned horses?  Horses have been abandoned and abused terribly, as a consequence.  </p><p> In his presentation Mr. Kelly mentioned traceability and responsibility.  I concur that the lack of traceability or identification leads to cruelty because no one is held accountable for it and there are no sanctions.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned that we should do something similar to what we do with cattle.  I concur.  Every single calf born is more or less tagged right away and wherever it moves from that date on is known and traceable.  We should look to do something similar with horses.  </p><p> On enforcement and penalties, if we were to have regulations in place, we would also have to have sanctions and penalties.  What are the delegates' views on the issue?</p><p> Each year money is allocated to Horseracing Ireland, Bord na gCon and so forth.  Perhaps we should look at whether some of the money allocated should be made available to those who are doing tremendous work to promote horse welfare.</p><p> I would like to hear from all of the delegates on harness racing, in respect of which there seems to be a blockage, which I perceive to be a matter of status.  I am reliably told that it is a lucrative as well as a popular form of racing in France and other countries in Europe, Canada and the southern hemisphere.  I see many younger members of the Traveller community where I live on the roads and Banna beach with their sulkies.  Their horses are well looked after and treated properly.  </p><p> I again thank the delegates for their presentations which were thought-provoking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#KK00200"><p>I thank all of the organisations for their comprehensive and informative presentations which will prove very useful and constructive.  The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association spoke about a lack of profitability in the industry and the reductions in the numbers of mares, breeders and everything else.  Prize money has been reduced, but it is still substantially better than in England.  It costs more to bring a horse to many of the tracks in England than the prize money on offer.</p><p>That is why there are so many selling races; they are mad to get rid of them.  Mr. Iceton indicated that there had been a 40% reduction, but surely one of the problems is that many people are being priced out of ownership.  Has he any comment on that?  There has been a huge reduction in the number of both individual and syndicated owners.  Too many people are grabbing from the pot, which is driving out the ordinary people who used to enjoy buying a horse.  I am aware that the industry became greedy, not just on one level but at all levels, including the organisational levels, which I spoke about previously.  People are priced out of the market.  </p><p> In their budget submission the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association spoke about enhanced depreciation.  Is this the equivalent of a tax incentive or subsidy?  I would like Mr. Iceton to expand more on that.  I know how things are written off over a period of time, but they are all a cost.  Really, that is tax incentivisation.  I am not surprised.  Horse Racing Ireland does not give owners much money.  What is new?  I am sure the committee will have an opportunity to examine that in due course.  </p><p> I visited  the Irish Equine Centre in Kill, which has the highest standards.  I am surprised that Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association is not getting a subvention from them and that nearly all the funding comes from the breeding industry through the foal levy.  That is a surprise.</p><p> What percentage of non-thoroughbred horses are not being registered?  This is extremely important in the context of the points raised about passport regulations.  In his presentation, Dr. Andrew Kelly, the chief executive of the ISPCA, spoke about the change in the passport regulation in January.  He is absolutely right.  The first thing that a person who owns a racehorse has to do is to notify change of ownership, and even if one changes the trainer, one has to notify the authorities.  It is amazing that something as important as this is not applied to non-thoroughbred horses.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right to refer to the aims.  Everything is computer-generated, and records are there to underpin the traceability from yard to yard and street to street and from house to house.  That is the way it should be.  We should get to that very comprehensive traceability system that is in place for the bovine industry and it should be applicable to the equine industry at all steps.  We have no compunction about making that a very strong recommendation.  I am sure the Chairman will deal with that in due course.  I would like to know what percentage of non-thoroughbred horses are not being registered.  Is this phenomenon increasing?  Obviously the disease issue is of great concern to the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association.</p><p> The witnesses also referred to the over-zealous implementation of veterinary medication rules set down by the EU but implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am not surprised.  Sometimes the Department cannot see the wood from the trees, even if is standing at the side of the forest.  They have been over-zealous in terms of implementation at various points in time.  Mention was made of  various things.  What type of product have breeders not been able to use, and are they readily available somewhere else?  I think they should tell us, as it is very important that we know about those things. We will be dealing with the Department in due course and cross-examining its representatives on what they have to say about this.</p><p> I was a member of a local authority for almost two decades, and some things have not changed or altered in the 13-year period since I left.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine devolves responsibility and obligations to local authorities without a concomitant transfer of resources.  It is as simple as that.  Mr. McGrath is talking about something that costs &euro;900, &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,100, and they get &euro;375.  One cannot continue to survive on that, especially at a time of declining resources at local authority level, and there is fierce competition for resources.</p><p> Mr. McGrath might be the right person to answer a particular question.  There are service level agreements and there is a rush for somebody to indicate that he or she is doing a great job, or instead, the veterinary officers may be transferred or amalgamated.  Am I correct?</p><p>I think I have a rough idea.  There is a proposal to spread people across six or seven counties.  As far as I am concerned, I want to ensure the veterinary officers are retained, and I know from personal experience that the veterinary officer in Westmeath, Mr. Sean &Oacute; Laoide, and his colleagues play a very vital role.  We should not mind the idea of rushing around and trying to signal a win in terms of putting people together.  Those people, such as Michael King, the veterinary officer in Longford, whom I know, have done tremendous work.  They have an array of roles that is not even understood sometimes.  I think service level agreements and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland may be involved in all this, but I want to set down a marker that I would not be happy to see people in headquarters, away from the places where they inspect.  The veterinary officers do a lot of work with abattoirs and even small rural abattoirs.  We are losing enough activity in rural areas without losing everything.<br/><br/>Veterinary officers play a role in the protection of a vulnerable public when the local authorities are dealing with horses. I certainly agree that the local authorities need proper resources to continue the work they are doing.  I note the proposals for improvement, which are useful and which we appreciate.<br/><br/>I saw a reference to the success of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust jockey training programme on Sky television some years ago.  Any cost-benefit analysis of the work of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust would show it in a very positive way.  Long may it continue with that work.  We will take cognisance of the benefits of the horse projects education and training programme in our recommendations.<br/><br/>Dr. Andrew Kelly from the ISPCA made a number of points in addition to the opening statement.  I was interested when he spoke about having to deal with a racehorse in Mullingar.  I know the ISPCA centre in Keenagh operates at the very top level and one could not praise highly enough the work they do and their raising the funds to do it.  Does the ISPCA get grants or only an <i>ex gratia </i>payment to run the centres in Mallow and Keenagh?  What level of grant aid is available from the Department  to deal with abandoned and-or neglected animals and animals subjected to cruelty?  The work of the ISPCA is not confined to equines as I know it does a tremendous amount of work with cats, dogs and various other animals in Keenagh.<br/><br/>Like my colleagues I was somewhat taken aback by the change in the regulations.  I think, Chairman, that we should explore the reason for the change.  If one has a passport, one has to know who is involved at every step of the process.  We could examine and explore the Equidae (Transfer of Ownership) (No. 2) Regulations that have come into effect and the rationale for that change in the context of what has been brought very forcefully to our attention in today's presentations.<br/><br/>I thank all the witnesses for coming before the committee and giving us the benefit of their expertise.  The presentations are food for thought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#MM00200"><p>I thank all the representatives who have come before the committee and made very interesting presentations.  First and foremost it is important to acknowledge that.  We have had quite an array of presentations both today and on Tuesday last.  Many of the issues raised come under the remit of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the dialogue and giving people the opportunity to put their viewpoint across will play a key role.</p><p>In terms of funding the horse and greyhound industry, I acknowledge the Government made a significant increase in funding in the last budget with a view to increasing it on a multi-annual basis over the next few years.  That is important.  With the extension of the taxation to online remote bookmakers, which we discussed here last week, that brings in more than &euro;10 million per annum.  That has brought extra funding into the equation, and that was done in the face of Opposition parties calling for cuts at the same time.<br/><br/>I will make my comments in the order in which the presentations are made and I will begin by putting some questions to Mr. Iceton.  I am concerned about the statistics in terms of the pressure that is being borne by small breeders and the fall in numbers in terms of both the National Hunt and the other side.  This is an area that has supplemented farm income for many years.  I do not know if the statistics have changed, but 90% of breeders had four or fewer mares and they generally had farms as well.  Friends of my age who are engaged in farming and whose families keep horses say that as soon as they take over the farm the horse will be gone because they see that business as hardship and there may not be a return from it.  Does it come down to the return, or is there more to it than money?  Mr. Iceton made a comparison with the French-bred animals that were in the Fairyhouse sales, but the French have a different funding mechanism in terms of betting tax and parimutuel betting<i>, </i>and we will never be able to compete with that with the existing structures we have inherited.  How do we compare with countries such as Britain on that one?  What more can we do to help the smaller breeders?  Is it purely a question of finance in regard to the return they get, and how do we address that?  We have to acknowledge the intrinsic role that small breeders play in the breeding industry.  Is this something on which a case could be put to Horse Racing Ireland to seek funding from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund to go towards further initiatives or towards expanding on the initiatives Mr. Iceton mentioned?<br/><br/>Mr. Iceton touched on the foal levy.  I am aware of some opposition from smaller breeders to the foal levy structure at present.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Iceton's views on the suggestion of replacing the foal levy with a mandatory sales levy.<br/><br/>Ireland's disease-free status is hugely important for us and we may take it for granted.  Mr. Iceton might comment on the importance of that to the equine industry.  What would the implications be for the industry if something negative were to happen in that regard?<br/><br/>Mr. McGrath also gave a detailed presentation.  I strongly concur with that he said.  We need to focus on the fact that prevention is always being better than cure.  The figures he gave point to a significant issue and trend, and that must be dealt with.  The presentations that followed Mr. McGrath's also touched on that. We cannot spend our time asking what we will do with the thousands of horses.  We need to examine the root causes of the problem and put significant resources into making sure that these horses do not manifest in the first place.  That is crucially important.  Otherwise, the problem will continue and we will always be two steps behind chasing it up.  My view on this is that horses should not be in urban areas.  They are not designed to be there, and I say that as someone who lives in such an area.  Comments were made about tradition, but the tradition when it comes to horses is that they were in green fields with lots of space.  That needs to be our starting point.  Can Mr. McGrath indicate whether there are spot checks in urban areas where there is a significant intensity of horse-keeping?  There are certain pockets of urban areas in my constituency in Kildare where there are many horses, and they cause problems for people who live in estates.  I note Mr. McGrath said in his presentation that when many of these horses are seized they are not microchipped.  Is this being actively pursued to ensure that they are microchipped before they are seized?  Are there checks to ensure that horses are microchipped and, if they are not, are there repercussions?  Mr McGrath pointed out that the current arrangements are more reactive.  That suggests we that are not proactively carrying out on-the-spot checks, which is an issue.<br/><br/>The representative of Irish Horse Welfare Trust mentioned that the programme will require more buy-in.  The representative from the ISPCA said there was lack of enforcement.  We can see a crossover there and we can see the picture.  That leads me on to the point that was mentioned about legislative interventions.  The witnesses referred in their presentation to the legislative underpinning, and a list of Acts is provided.  Are they suggesting that changes need to be made to those Acts, or are the changes being made to the Animal Health and Welfare Act not sufficient?</p><p>I accept the point that local authorities are under funding pressure as they try to deal with the end problem.  Do the delegates believe the legislation listed needs to be amended and changed to facilitate the early intervention needed to minimise the end problem?  Do they have the legislation they need at their disposal?  If so, is it reasonable to suggest it is purely a matter of financing and putting a better structural arrangement in place?  Is there a service level agreement between the Department and the local authorities?  It would be a concern if no such agreement were in place.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 allowed for the appointment of authorised officers.  The delegates might outline how many local authorities have made such appointments, to their knowledge.</p><p> I would like to comment on the presentation made by the representatives of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust.  I am happy to support the trust's efforts to renovate its farmhouse because it is a worthwhile project.  </p><p> Reference has been made to the tradition of some urban dwellers to keep horses.  We have heard about how well they care for them.  My simple view on it is that horses should not be kept in urban areas, but I do not know whether everyone would agree with this.  If our starting point is trying to facilitate people in keeping horses in urban areas, we will always have a problem and will always be dealing with issues.  I suggest a much better way to approach this matter would be to provide appropriate places to which people from urban areas could travel to visit their horses.</p><p> I concur with the point made by the representatives of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that traceability equals responsibility.  Obviously, we can do more in terms of microchipping.  Every horse is supposed to be microchipped, but many horses seized are not.  Is it the case that not enough fines are being imposed when horses are not microchipped?  Is there a problem in the execution of fines?  How do we address this issue?  If the system in place is not being used properly, surely we need to address the issue.  </p><p> I thank everyone for the very informative presentations.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for their educational, informative and up-to-date presentations.  I have a few comments and questions.  Some of the witnesses might concentrate on racehorses whereas the representatives of the Irish Horse Welfare Trust and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals might know more about urban horses.  Given that we are still in a huge crisis, it is hypocritical that we are sitting here relying on the horse to a significant extent culturally and economically.  Ireland is the fourth largest breeder of thoroughbred racehorses in the world.  We are up there with the top showjumping countries.  Bertram Allen is fifth in the world.  We are brilliant at eventing.  We have many horse fairs.  We are at risk of destroying our reputation because, as far as I can see, we still have a major crisis.</p> <p>  I would like to put to the witnesses a question we all have to ask ourselves.  This House spent a great deal of time on the animal health and welfare legislation.  Is our legislation sufficiently robust and detailed to deal with this crisis?  Does the current legislation or the implementation of the law go far enough?  Is it going anywhere at all?  Are the fines or levels of penalties anywhere close to being acute enough?  It seems to me that people are getting away with murder.  Do we need to revisit that?  Do we need to have a miscellaneous animal health and welfare Act that gets down to more detail?  I heard the points that Deputy Penrose, who is very experienced in this area - I will not say weathered - put to Mr. McGrath and his colleagues.  The Deputy said that while it is easy for the Department to make these wonderful laws and pass them on to the councils, if the councils do not have the money, they will not have the training, the resources or the people.</p> <p>  I do not always agree with Deputy Heydon, but I agree with him that horses do not belong in urban areas.  Perhaps it is not popular to say this.  I know there are people in urban areas who love horses.  I am aware that it is part of their tradition.  I am sorry to say that horses belong in rural areas.  They are a bit like myself in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Power and Ms Myerscough for their presentations.  The importance of education as one of the solutions came across hugely in what they had to say.  I would like them to tell me more about their current funding position.  What do they think they need to make a serious and meaningful impact nationally?  We want to deal with the crisis.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, wants to do so.</p><p>I feel the Department's solution was to round up the horses and euthanise them - I hope painlessly - but that does not appear to have happened because that was talked about 18 months ago.  The horsemeat crisis has not gone away and has affected hugely the market where people brought their horses to be slaughtered and got their couple of hundred euro.  That continues to be a reason there are so many extremely distressed, starved, neglected, tortured and abandoned horses all over Ireland.  I agree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the betting tax.  I wish HRI was here today because it gets magnificent funding from the Government.  I know it is never enough and I know how important the thoroughbred industry is but the horse as a whole is important to us as a nation.  The horse industry, be it for small breeders, is a pillar.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Derek Iceton.  I note we have gone from quantity to much less quantity.  Is he worried about quality?  My husband kept telling me there were too many mares and foals in the country but now the numbers are down and, sadly, the number of breeders is down.  Is there a problem with quality and what could be done to get some serious quality injected into the smaller breeders, in particular, to give them the ability to breed world class horse? </p><p> I ask Mr. Brendan McGrath if he has come across sulky racing and, if so, are there plans to control or ban it, particularly on the hard roads where there have been many deaths of horses?  Has the Department provided council workers and the Garda with scanners so that if they come across a horse they can scan it to see whether it is registered?  As many people have said today, registration is one of the names of the game.  I could talk all day but as it is now 5.45 p.m. enough is enough. </p><p> Ms Barbara Bent and Dr. Andrew Kelly spoke about the donkeys.  There are about  two and a half donkeys who will be looking for homes soon.  What are going to do about that?</p></speech>

I am trying to hurry.  I know we are speaking about horses today but perhaps  Ms Barbara Bent might say a few words.  </p> <p>  The dairy industry is about to explode and I am aware that her organisation, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is worried about cows.  I would like to hear from her as this is the right committee to speak about that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#UU00600"><p>I thank the various groups for their presentations.  We all agree not only in regard to the equine sector but the beef sector and the food sector as a whole that health status is paramount and particularly as we are an exporting nation.  The reality is that this is potentially a ticking time bomb and a reservoir for disease in terms of stray horses that have been abandoned.  It is clear from the evidence we have heard today that the Department is paying about &euro;3 million per annum to dispose of stray horses and local authorities pay about &euro;2 million, a total of &euro;5 million in that area.  It is clear from the evidence provided by Mr. Brendan McGrath and Dr. Andrew Kelly that it is a growing problem and is not abating to any extent, based on the numbers coming through their organisations.</p> <p>  Dr. Kelly cautioned that changes to the disadvantaged areas payment could have an impact on donkey welfare if the rules were changed.  As he is aware, the rules were changed regarding the disadvantaged areas scheme for horses.  Did the changes to the disadvantaged areas scheme have an impact on the number of horses that seemed to have been abandoned?  The other question is for the City and County Managers Association and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association.</p><p>Based on ISPCA figures, 10% of equines were thoroughbreds or ex-racehorses.  All those animals would have been chipped.  I am sure a substantial number of the other animals identified were chipped, but all the thoroughbred horses were chipped.  On the change in SI 189 of 2014 were either of the witnesses' organisations consulted in advance of the change introduced last December by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  The ISPCA has said that while it was not consulted, the Department had consulted stakeholders.  Both organisations are significant stakeholders.  I come from a suckler farm and in the 1980s - the Chairman will relate to this - beef farming was very much about the ears on the cattle because that is how premia were paid.  Once one had the head and the ears, that was the most important part of the animal.  Thankfully, through decoupling, but also because of schemes introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regard to the suckler cow and promoting the beef industry, we now have one of the finest herds in the world.  While there may be some debate about the new support scheme being proposed by the Department, the reality is that we have a premium beef product which we can export internationally.  There is huge potential in regard to the equine sector.  We could probably generate about &euro;1.5 billion for the economy from this sector if it were properly developed.  Should we be looking at developing something along the lines of the suckler cow welfare scheme for the horse industry to try to improve the quality of animals and selecting animals for their breeding qualities?  The other side of it is that we need an outlet for those that do not reach the standard.  In the beef industry that was easy because they were put into the processing industry.  That is not possible for the equine sector for many of the animals that are not chipped.  How does one deal with that aspect?</p><p> I have one final question to Ms Sharon Power based on her evidence.  She spoke about the importance of education and training.  We all agree on that.  Reverting to the beef industry, education and training, particularly of older farmers, is important and an integral part of the suckler cow support schemes.  Does Ms Power consider there is a need for something similar to what her organisation is doing but expanded to all horse owners throughout the country and to the industry as a whole and not just young people from disadvantaged backgrounds?</p></speech>

An overarching question has come through about the registration of horses and the Department's computer system with regard to cattle.  I am a cattle farmer.  The Department does not need to reinvent the wheel.  Unfortunately, the movement registrations system it introduced was a paper-based system.  The paper-based system broke down.  I will give an example.  At Goffs last year, if one was a vendor of a foal or a yearling, one had to sign one piece of paper.  The sales companies, whether it was Goffs or Tattersalls Ireland refused to handle that piece of paper because it was not within their remit to do so and the purchaser was supposed to go to the vendor and get the piece of paper and then remit that piece of paper back to Weatherbys.  I cannot understand this nonsense when it already has a tried and tested system with regard to cattle.</p><p>The same proviso in regard to Goffs and Fairyhouse applied.  We recommend that it be put into force with due haste.</p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s question, I hope we reach a stage at which we can get a proper percentage from the betting industry.  What would we do with it?  We were here last year and spoke about the alliance for racing.  The most important thing we can have is good prize money for racing.  From that, there is a trickle-down effect.  If racing is profitable, people want to buy horses.  Moreover, the general standard of horse in training also increases.  As a breeding nation, we are breeding from the females in the racing industry here.</p><p> I spoke previously about a mare depreciation scheme.  Deputy Penrose asked a question in this regard but I will wait until he returns before I answer it.</p></speech>

There is a tendency to have great peaks and troughs in income.  The problem is that when there is a peak, one cannot average one&rsquo;s income.  Therefore, I would like to see an arrangement similar to that for farmers under 35 years of age, whereby they can reinvest profits immediately without paying the tax.  This is not an issue for the bigger breeder, obviously, because he will always have plenty of animals breeding.  If a smaller breeder has a bonanza year, it should be worth his while to invest the money earned in a better mare.</p> <p>  With regard to the other money, we would like some other facilities, such as all-weather paddocks and lunge rings.  If one is to produce horses, one needs the facilities to do so.  In a wet climate like ours, we need proper facilities.  It would be helpful if we could have a scheme whereby younger breeders, in particular, could invest in their farms and install proper all-weather facilities, including lunging facilities, to allow them to produce the horses they need to produce.</p> <p>  Marketing is incredibly important.  I instanced previously that we have a business here that is worth approximately &euro;1.25 billion, yet our marketing budget is &euro;1.5 million.  A number of years ago, Dairygold relaunched Dairygold on the Irish market, in which it was already a market leader.  Its budget for the relaunch was &euro;1.25 million, yet we are trying to sell horses to the whole world with the tiny marketing budget that we have.</p> <p>  As I said in my presentation, the real markets for us are in the Far East, Middle East and North America.  It takes money to break into them.</p></speech>

International bloodstock markets are in good health and we have an export nation that exports 80% of what is produced.  If we had a correct funding mechanism in place and were looking for 2.5%, which could generate around &euro;100 million, it would result in reinvestment in the industry.  It would go to owners.  We need owners to reinvest in the industry.  Every &euro;1 that is added to prize money is worth about &euro;8 to the local economy.  That is what one is doing with the money.  We have to increase prize money.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose mentioned the United Kingdom.  Our most valuable race, based on international rankings, is the derby.  It is ranked No. 52 internationally.  Approximately 70% of the prize money on offer comes from the entry fees paid by owners.  Generally speaking, owners contribute 30% through entry fees.  Potential returns to owners are much worse in Ireland than in any of our competitor countries.  Therefore, it is important that we bear this in mind.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that charges are too high for owners.  To defend Horse Racing Ireland, it has appointed, through Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, a person with special responsibility for ownership.  He is examining ownership costs and reducing them.  Last year at this forum, this matter was raised and action has been taken in this area.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned stallions and the stallion tax.  The most important lever in the development of the thoroughbred sector and industry was the stallion tax exemption.  This incentive cost the State nothing and encouraged people to stand horses here.  It gave broodmare owners the opportunity to gain access to high-quality bloodlines.  Since its removal in 2008, the number of stallions fell, as predicted.  It fell from 414 in 2006 to 216 in 2014.  There have been no new entrants to the stallion business.</p><p> Equally important, there has been a shift of the highest quality stallions to the United Kingdom.  In 2004, Ireland had seven of the top ten stallions in Europe based on nomination fees.  Now we have four.  Having stallions here attracts foreign direct investment and it brings in mares.  As Mr. Iceton said, the benefits trickle back down to the small breeder.</p><p> On the subjects of prize money for smaller breeders, the national hunt and people with one or two mares, we in the ITBA introduced a scheme, a self-help scheme, a couple of years ago to improve the broodmare band in respect of national hunt fillies, encourage breeders to sell their fillies and to have a market for them, and encourage the owner-breeder to put mares in training.  With these objectives in mind, we added &euro;5,000 to the prize fund for the winning owners.  It is has made a little bit of a difference.  We talk about increasing this by 10% to 12% by being able to sustain just in excess of 9,000 foals.  We want to be able to make sure that we concentrate on quality.  Particularly for the small breeder, the better the racing rating, the better the broodmare will be in the covering shed.  That is what we are striving for.  With initiatives such as those mentioned by Mr. Iceton, with the increase in the prize fund and with the encouragement of the smaller breeders, I hope we will not lose too many people who fall off.</p></speech>

This ties into what Deputy Naughten said.  I cannot state how important our disease-free status is.  Our competitors are anxious for us to have even the smallest issue, which can arise in any sector of the business.  A number of years ago, and only because the Irish Equine Centre was so on the ball, we managed to keep the yearling sales in Goffs open.  Just two weeks before that, it looked very difficult.  Goffs' yearling sale is the Rolls-Royce sale in Ireland.  Luckily, on foot of a disease outbreak that started in Northern Ireland but which was basically regarded as an outbreak on the island of Ireland, the Irish Equine Centre managed to do what was required and we stayed open for business.  That just goes to show how vulnerable our industry is.  We need to keep our disease-free status.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris asked about prize money.  Mr. O'Dwyer has covered this.  Deputy Ferris also asked about harness racing.  He was alluding in particular to harness racing in the stadium in Dundalk.  I have no issue with harness racing taking place there but with one major proviso, namely, that the animals that take part in the sport be of the same health status as the other horses that perform, be they showjumping horses, ponies, or otherwise.  The biggest issue we have in the racing industry is respiratory virus.  It is a devil to get rid of.  If the harness-racing horses are of the same calibre and health status as the others, I am more than happy.  We do not want circumstances in which we bring in horses in respect of which we do not know what is going on.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked about racing in the United Kingdom.  Circumstances are dreadful there.  I thank the Government and those responsible for the cross-party support we received last year in respect of the increased prize money for the racing industry.  There was a very worthwhile venture between all the constituent groups and I am delighted to see it worked.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose might agree with me in saying that if further money becomes available, perhaps not all of it should go into prize money.  I would like to see some of it going towards a reduction in the cost of having a horse in training.  In other words, I am referring to the cost of entering a horse in a race and other such factors.  That hits everybody.  Although winning a race is great because it allows everyone to pay his dues, it would be nice to reduce somewhat the expenses pertaining to the average horse that does not win a race.</p><p>The committee asked what percentage of horses are registered.  For the non-thoroughbred industry, it is in the low thousands, and in the thoroughbred industry, it is about 7,000 horses.  Every one of them is registered and micro-chipped.  As a cattle farmer, I live in fear of losing a tag or the Department coming in and finding that my herd register is not as it should be.  I would really encourage the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to get on top of that aspect.</p><p> Reference was made to issues with veterinary products.  This is quite interesting because currently the most simple antibiotic of all, crystalline penicillin, is an illegal product to use on horses in Ireland.  It is also the product that has the lowest threshold of issue in relation to human health, but because this product is not available, due to very simple administration, vets cannot use it.  Two years ago we had a problem with an abortion vaccine which was available over the Border, but no vet could legally give it here.  Last year, we had a problem with supplies of a reproductive hormone running out, yet it was available throughout the rest of Europe.  Perhaps the Department would investigate putting the horse into a minor species status.  I am not looking to use any product we should not use, or any product that is not safe to use, but if it is safe to use in Britain and Germany and France then it is a pity not to use it here.</p><p> The other problem is that the market for veterinary products has become so small that most of the pharmaceutical companies now do not want to research new products or vaccines for us.  Deputy Heydon asked how we compare with the UK.  Its national hunt industry now has less than 600 mares in England and it worries me to see our national hunt band also falling.  At our premier national hunt sale, which is in the Derby sale, 15% of the horses are French bred.  I would hate to get to the situation where horses are being bred in France for us to buy in order to sell them in our premier sale.  It is something we need to keep an eye on but we are up against a breeding and racing industry that is heavily subsidised.  I thought we were supposed to be in a Single Market but these are the people who strongly advocate against us and for racing and breeding in France.  It is a real pain.</p><p> Deputy Heydon asked about the foal levy.  There is a levy payable on every thoroughbred foal.  Only the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association can attend to the international issues in relation to horses and the national issues, etc.  We are the representative body.  Irish thoroughbred marketing has to be co-funded by the breeders' association.  We must do this by statute so we have to raise the money and a big chunk comes from fund-raising.  The figure of &euro;800,000, which is by far the biggest amount of money, comes from breeders and goes into the Irish Equine Centre.  That is what the money is used for.  It is also used for the alliances for racing and for veterinary procedures.  I am pleased to say that our European lobbyist is here today in the visitors gallery.  We are working on behalf of breeders everywhere.</p><p> The levy is based on the amount of fee and is more than progressive.  For example, the most expensive foals - the top 11% - will pay 40% of the levy.  An average levy of &euro;65 will be paid for 53% of the foals.  That is to pay the Irish Equine Centre, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and all the myriad schemes that we have put in place.  I suggest this is incredible value for breeders.  When, in the cattle business, I look at my returns from the meat factories and I see the stoppages coming out, then the foal levy is small beer.  The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association does the best it can with that money and there is a 98.3% compliance rate with the levy.  This House would be delighted if every tax had the same level of compliance.</p><p> It has been suggested that we might bring in a mandatory sales levy.  A levy proposed by others was to be 1% and only apply to sales of horses in Ireland.</p><p>Unfortunately the only cohort that would get hit with that levy is the commercial Irish breeder who sells in Ireland.  The breeders who sell in Britain would not be caught with it and neither would the big owner breeders and the bigger farms in the country, so I cannot see the merit in that.  It is something towards which we are pretty reactive, to try to change.  We are trying to make it fairer on everybody.</p><p> Senator O'Brien was concerned about quality, and it certainly is a concern.  We have had too many mares and we have gone through a dreadful period of reorganisation in the business.  Unlike any other form of animal, the supply does not just cut off.  We have to keep running with it.  Mr. O'Dwyer has suggested 9,000 as the figure we can probably produce, but it must be quality.  The world market shouts quality.  I am pleased to say that no matter where one looks at racing throughout the world, most of the top horses in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia at the moment are Irish and Irish bred.  That is where our future market is.  The drive is for quality and for that market.  I hope the British market improves but it needs to get a few quid off the bookmakers to improve it.</p></speech>

There must be proper policing and local authorities need to be funded.  I agree with the committee about the urban problem.  I welcome Deputy Naughten's question on whether we knew or if we were informed about this issue.  We had concerns and Mr. Iceton has referred to the fact there was a little confusion about the whole thing at last years' sales.  The Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association has a close relationship with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we highlighted the fact that it needed to be looked at.  We did not know that the statutory instrument had been introduced.  We and other witnesses present are members of the Farm Animals Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC, and the equine liaison group within the Department.  These are the issues that require consultation before anything is implemented.  It is going in the right direction and I am hopeful that, given time and with computerisation, it will work.</p></speech>

It was news to me today and I find this shocking.  The committee asked about the breed improvement scheme.  It is difficult because it is not like the cattle industry.  One is not producing for a particular trade.  We meet breeders throughout the country and try to show them how to produce a better horse in all shapes and forms.  These meetings are usually well-attended.  I do not wish to give a negative view of our industry.  We are fortunate to have plenty of young and older successful breeders.  The country is full of good breeders.  My concern is for some of the smaller ones who are going through a tough time at the moment.  I thank the committee for its attention and for the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McGrath" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#ZZ00400"><p>I trust that the respiratory symptoms displayed by Senator O'Brien and I are not symptomatic of what my colleague discussed earlier.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Deputy Heydon and Senator O'Brien all referred to the urban horse phenomenon.  The question was asked whether horses in urban areas should be allowed.  I concur that the short answer is "no".  In an ideal world there should not be such horses, but it is a fact of life that there are.  On my way here today I received a text with an image attached from a councillor who resides in a local authority estate.  The photo showed three horses walking around his front lawn.  That is neither acceptable nor desirable in a modern scenario and it causes untold problems for residents in such estates and adjoining areas.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if we know how many of the horses are Traveller horses.  We do not know that figure but, anecdotally, in Galway city, a significant number of the urban horses are associated with the Traveller community.</p><p>As a consequence we have to deal with the underlying issues.  There is a significant space to be occupied by urban horse and other horse projects generally throughout the country.  The local government sector has collaborated on several initiatives, such as the Dunsink and Limerick Horse Project, which is a model of excellent practice.  We have to take what we have learned from those projects, disseminate it and introduce it in some properly funded projects around the country.  Those projects must be community-led and supported and have multi-sectoral involvement.  Those are some facets of the learning that must be disseminated.  They have to be bottom up.  They will not succeed if they are top down.  We advocate and support those projects and the sector as a whole has said it will willingly commit to, and get involved with, projects that are brought forward.  <br/><br/>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced a fund last year and invited applications and several local authorities expressed an interest in that, including Galway City Council.  Local authorities have land banks.  We have access to land that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and other agencies have.  It is possible to bring forward planned, structured, multi-stakeholder plans, involving all the agencies, the Garda, education and training boards, T&uacute;s, the local government sector, the Traveller support agencies and so on.  That enables us to deal with some of the issues Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about, in terms of having a controlled response and reducing the criminality, which enables us to go after the horses that are utterly illegal and outside the scheme.  The sector would welcome a structured, funded approach and a stream of funding.  That stream needs to continue because we will achieve nothing if we operate on an <i>ad hoc</i>or an non-integrated way.  We need to break the cycle.  In our submission we spoke about research.  We understand many of the anecdotal reasons underlying the keeping of urban horses but we need to back those up with evidence.  That does not need to be a very lengthy exercise.  If the Department led out on it, the other partners in the sector could contribute to it.  Let us for once and for all determine the best way to break that cycle.  <br/><br/>Deputy Martin Ferris talked about harness racing and Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien talked about sulky racing.  I presume the reference to harness racing refers to organised, structured racing, like that in Dundalk.  Sulky racing is often a problem on public roads.  The local government sector regularly gets complaints from concerned motorists and landowners about sulky racing.  Generally, it comes under road traffic legislation.  It is problematic and difficult to deal with.  One local authority has specifically adopted by-laws but to date the response has been under road traffic legislation.  We certainly concur with Deputy Ferris and others who spoke today that traceability and responsibility are key to this. <br/><br/>Deputy Penrose spoke about the transfer of resources.  We have made the case that what we recoup from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not sufficient to refund the local government sector.  It is costing the sector a significant sum of money.  We have told our colleagues in the Department that the current approach needs to be more structured and formalised.  There is no service level agreement, SLA, with the Department but there should be one between the local government sector and the Department.  That would enable a more structured approach.  Scanners are a routine piece of equipment and our veterinary officers have them.<br/><br/>Part of the reason that seizures cost between &euro;800 and &euro;1,100 per horse is that there are significant problems.  It is no exception that in many cases we must engage other stakeholders, particularly the garda&iacute;, to help us in round-up and collection of horses.  That tells a story in its own right.  Seizing horses often has to be planned for out of hours, early in the day, and cannot be publicised.  One of the speakers told of how difficult it is to retrieve a single injured horse and the amount of resources that took.  It is difficult to try to go into certain environments to collect horses where we are not welcome and where there are significant health and safety concerns.  As employers we have other legal obligations in respect of the safety, health and welfare at work legislation.  That is why it is so costly.</p><p>We generally have to engage contractors to assist us in the work.  We are tendering for that.  There are a very limited number of contractors in the business.  That is a significant problem, which reflects the cost to us.  Speaking anecdotally, in Galway City Council 84% of the money that I, as chief executive, will spend this year is collected locally.  It comes largely now out of property tax or rates.  I am accountable to the councillors for the money I spend.  Over the past three and a half years Galway City Council has spent a net &euro;260,000 collecting urban horses which could be better spent elsewhere if we had a fundamentally different approach.  </p><p> Deputy Penrose asked another question, which is not, I understand, specifically related to the work the committee is doing, about the proposed veterinary shared service.  At its simplest, it is not proposed as part of that to remove from any county or city the existing veterinary officer.  It refers to putting in place a regional chief veterinary officer to facilitate a coordinated approach and involves enabling vets at the extremities of counties to go over the boundary if a premises requires a food safety inspection.  Instead of a vet having to travel the entire length or width of a county, a vet from a neighbouring county can cross over.  That is the kind of practical arrangement being discussed.  There is no proposal whatsoever to remove a vet from any county; it is quite the opposite.  Part and parcel of the change is to strengthen the veterinary service at local government level.  That is the response for Deputy Penrose in his absence.  </p><p> I concur with Deputy Heydon&rsquo;s comment that prevention is better than the cure, which goes back to research and the urban and rural horse projects.  </p><p> The resource issue does not determine spot checks.  Our response at local government level has tended to be largely reactive.  The local authority sector has lost more then 30% of staffing resources across the organisations, down from a high of 37,000 to 26,750.  That varies between 20% and 30% across every authority.  Our responses are sometimes reactive rather than proactive when resources are squeezed and we are under pressure on the housing or transport front, or whatever.  Squeezed resources mean we have to tailor our action accordingly.  That is a practical problem that we try to deal with daily.</p><p> We were asked about the level of legislative intervention.  It is the view of the local authority sector that generally the suite of legislation is adequate and robust.  I refer the committee to our submission of February of this year, where as an appendix we highlighted several technical and procedural changes that we would recommend for the legislation.  If they were corrected, with the suite of legislation that exists, they would go a long way to dealing with some of the lacunae or vacuums we encounter.  We also stress that we require multi-stakeholder involvement, and there must be a more structured approach.  It is very important for us that we have a service level agreement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We heard the point about the appointment of authorised officers.  We hope the current arrangement that the Department has with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, could be more structured with the local government sector, which would go some way towards addressing some of the lacunae.  I think that answers Deputy Heydon&rsquo;s questions.</p><p> I hope I have answered Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s questions about the legislation, sulky racing and the scanners.  That brings me to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s questions.  Typically, between 10% and 12% of the horses we seize are microchipped - or, to put it another way, close to 90% are not.  Based on the figures we produced, we seized close to 5,000 animals in 2014.  The numbers so far in 2015 suggest the total will be in or around the same level.  We were not consulted about the change to the statutory instrument.  The changes emerged as news to many of my veterinary colleagues within the local government sector.</p><p>I hope that answers the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Power" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015071400002#CCC00200"><p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v first, in our experience urban horse communities are not just Travellers; it very much depends on the area.  For example, in most areas of Dublin, the horse-owning community is a settled community, and the same is true of parts of Limerick.  Other parts of Limerick have second-generation Travellers.  In some of the bigger towns around the country and outside of towns, there are Traveller communities.</p> <p>  The way forward is for structured horse projects working in conjunction with the local authorities and providing education.  That is the key to solving the problems in the long term.  However, in our experience there is a need for ongoing management by a committee of the stakeholders or other group.  The Deputy also asked if most of the horses were abandoned, neglected or abused.  Most horses that are abandoned are simply abandoned.  They are seldom well cared for and the more cruel actions take place in urban areas, which relate to over-use, misuse and cruelty.</p> <p>  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien asked about funding and the funding models for running courses and providing education.  I probably should have pointed out earlier that we do get some funding from the horse industries and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but almost three quarters of our funding comes from fund-raising and donations.  In terms of running courses, we have funding this year, for example, from the Department to run two courses which cost approximately &euro;5,000 each.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Owens, to speak about the costs involved in our most recent horse projects and that will give the Senator an idea of costs.  In general, once there is land available from a local authority, the costs of running a horse project are not significant.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon asked about horses being in urban areas.  Nobody wants horses in urban areas as it is not a suitable environment for a horse and it is a very dangerous one.  The very first time I went to Moyross, I said that people in towns should not have horses and that they should be all removed, much as the Deputy said.  However, 20 years on, I realise that system has failed.  From working in disadvantaged areas, where a lot of horse-owning communities are based, I realise there is a genuine passion for horses among many of them, which could be harnessed for educational purposes and also to solve the urban horse problem, not to mention other issues such as helping with anti-social behaviour and drug prevention.  We have a testimonial, for example, from the Garda youth diversion project in Moyross which states that the Irish Horse Welfare Trust horse project was the single most effective way of engaging with marginalised young people.  Other agencies also help to fund courses such as the HSE, the Garda youth diversion projects and community groups.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughten asked about consultation on the changing of the statutory instrument.  We were not consulted on that.  The massive number of horses that have been destroyed has not been mentioned in the three-year period up to 2014.  I believe between 60,000 and 70,000 horses were destroyed.  That is worth mentioning at this meeting.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughten also asked about the expansion of courses to a wider group.  That would be ideal if it were possible.  There is a large population of young people with a passion for horses who could take up a career involving horses.  That should be used as something positive, as we could potentially provide grooms and riders in the future as well as addressing issues of horse ownership in urban areas.  We would be quite happy to enter a service level agreement with the Department or with any other local authority to help set up projects.  We have offered the service previously but initial engagement between communities and local authorities is often difficult and can be a stumbling block.</p></speech>

I work on the ground with a lot of horse owners.  Two areas need to be highlighted that feed very much into the problem of unregulated horses.  The monitoring of ports must be addressed.  There is not enough funding or resources to properly monitor the movement of horses in and out of Irish ports.  Trucks come into urban areas and horses are sold off the back of a truck for &euro;50 or &euro;20.  That feeds the unregulated urban horse problem.</p> <p>  Another area on which we have received many unsubstantiated reports from different sectors of the community relates to pounds.  We would like to see better regulation in that regard.</p></speech>

It has been mentioned that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine made &euro;1 million available for projects to deal with some of these issues.  The ISPCA has joined with Cork City Council to put in a proposal for a mobile education unit that would reach out to all communities with equines in the Cork area and possibly reaching up into other parts of Munster as well.  That would be funded for two years, with the aim of the ISPCA taking on the baton after the two years.  The full cost of the proposal for that two years would be around &euro;140,000.  The funding is an issue.  We would also like to recruit a dedicated full-time education officer who would recruit a team of volunteer education officers around the country to deliver those kinds of educational programmes.  We are also looking at developing our site in Mallow to have a permanent education centre there where we could bring in people for education purposes and where they could have hands-on work with the horses and learn how to care for them appropriately.</p> <p>  We recognise the affinity that some members of the Traveller community, for example, have with their horses and we want to work with the community to provide them with the resources they need.  Some of the cruelty we see is through a lack of understanding, lack of availability of resources and lack of access to veterinary care.  If we can provide those things, the horses and dogs that we work with become more valuable to them.  That is what we would like to do in the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris asked whether the cruelty we see is more related to the horses that have been abandoned.  Certainly, those that have been abandoned will suffer and they will starve to death if there is no food available.  They may injure themselves if they are in a poor environment, but we also see cruelty in cases of horses that are, at least on paper, being cared for.  It is not confined to members of the Traveller community but rather it occurs across all sectors of the equine community.  In particular, we see problems in some halting sites, but by no means in all sites.  However, we need to work with those communities in order to change that situation.  </p> <p>  Deputy Ferris also asked about our views on penalties for animal welfare offences.  I mentioned in my presentation that the ISPCA has initiated 45 prosecutions since the Animal Health and Welfare Act came into force.  I will provide details on three of those cases which have been finalised in court.  The first case was for tail docking of puppies which is now illegal under the Act.  A father and son pleaded guilty.  The son pleaded guilty to allowing his father to do the docking and the father pleaded guilty to doing the docking.  They appeared in court and they were not convicted, despite the facts not being disputed and despite the fact that they pleaded guilty.  The judge elected to invoke the Probation of Offenders Act and that is a matter for the court.  They were invited to make a donation to the ISPCA.</p><p>We might like to see higher penalties in those circumstances.  The second case involved a dog that had been abandoned when a person moved out of the house and left the dog with a bucket of water that it could not reach.  That individual was ordered to pay costs of &euro;400 to the ISPCA.  The third case was a one of causing unnecessary suffering to a dog that died of parvovirus and a fine of &euro;100 was imposed in that case.  Important in that case, the judge also issued an order limiting the number of dogs that could be kept on that halting site to one per adult.  This allows us to deal with that particular issue in a different way in the future.<br/><br/>Under the Protection of Animals Act, one of the cases that came to court last year was a case where we found several dead horses and several suffering horses in very poor condition.  Despite not disputing the facts of the case, the judge elected not to convict and, in fact, actually said that if the ISPCA inspected the property in six months and everything was up to scratch, he would not convict.  However, in that six-month period, the chap involved sourced another 40 horses and the situation is essentially a ticking time bomb.<br/><br/>The Animal Health and Welfare Act is a very good piece of legislation.  It provides for penalties and fines of up to &euro;5,000 and-or up to six months' imprisonment for cases in summary and on indictment, up to &euro;250,000 and up to five years' imprisonment.  The penalties are there but it is a matter for the courts.  Our job is to bring the cases to court.  Sadly, it is a damning indictment of other agencies that it is a charity that has brought these cases to court.  In so far as I am aware, no other agency has yet brought a prosecution under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  We are working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  <br/><br/>Deputy Ferris also asked about harness racing.  As Mr. McGrath said, if the health and welfare of the horses is protected and the harness racing is regulated, then it is good because it takes if off the roads.  In the case of sulky racing, we see some horrendous injuries to horses on a regular basis around the country.  They have collided with cars and been dumped at the side of the road.  We would like to see sulky racing taken off the road but the local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine then have a responsibility to provide off-road facilities where it can be regulated and the health and welfare of the animals can be protected.  We have called for this in the past.  <br/><br/>Deputy Penrose asked the percentage of horses we come across that are not micro-chipped.  Similar to Mr. McGrath, 85% to 90% of the horses we deal with are not micro-chipped.  In the case of the small proportion that are micro-chipped, we find that the owner denies all knowledge and says the animal has been sold on.  Deputy Penrose asked about <i>ex gratia</i>payments.  Last year the ISPCA received &euro;210,000 from the Department for which we are very grateful.  This amounts to approximately 7% of our annual expenditure.<br/><br/>Deputy Heydon asked about penalties for failure to micro-chip animals.  If an animal is not micro-chipped, it is very difficult to impose a penalty because the owner is not known.  On a small number of occasions, we may come across a horse that has been micro-chipped and may be able to trace the owner.  However, as I indicated, there are significant penalties to be imposed but the courts seem not to impose high penalties for these kinds of offences.<br/><br/>Senator O'Brien asked if the legislation is sufficiently robust to deal with these issues.  I have cited the penalties imposed in a number of cases.  The legislation is in place and it is good but perhaps guidelines for the judges might be useful.  We would like to see higher penalties in some of these cases.<br/><br/>Deputy Naughten asked about the disadvantaged area scheme.  I am not aware that there was a marked change in the number of horses being abandoned at that point in time but that might have been masked by other things.  The donkeys may be more noticeable if they are dumped when the disadvantaged area scheme is scrapped if this happens in the future.</p><p> I am very pleased that committee members have all made positive comments on the need for traceability.  I hope we will see a review of the statutory instrument to make sure there is full traceability for horses.</p></speech>

I think the last figure was 2,280.  If the scheme is scrapped - we believe it may be - we will have to deal with a huge number of donkeys.  We, therefore, need a proactive approach before the scheme is scrapped to decide what is to happen to them.</p> <p>  Sulky road racing is one of my pet problems.  If we are reviewing the control of horses, it is not the actual racing that is the problem but the training.  We are sitting on another time bomb in about five counties.  One of these days one of the ponies will run away on a main road and there will be a major incident in which people might be killed.  From an animal welfare perspective, the number of horses injured sends a very bad message to tourists.  People travelling in double-decker buses rung our helpline and centre in Mallow to complain when they saw six-month old foals trotting up and down side roads and byroads with two or three kids on them.  People abroad think we are absolutely crazy in Ireland to allow such a carry-on on main and side roads.  It sends a very bad message to visitors from an animal welfare perspective.</p></speech>

As they are not small animals, it is not like dealing with cats where one could breed 100 very quickly.  Horses have a longer gestation period.  As they are big animals, it is amazing that we cannot settle this issue once and for all.  </p> <p>  On the comments made about the import of horses, at one stage we were looking at offering a bounty for six months or paying &euro;100 for every horse brought to a knackery, including abandoned horses that had not been microchipped.  However, it would be pointless if they were being brought in by the back door.  This seems to be the No. 1 point that we must deal with.</p></speech>

That is actually the number of horses destroyed, including in registered abattoirs.  It is approximately 24,000 per year.  Ten years ago the average figure was 2,500 per year.  It reflects the numbers of unwanted horses and horses being bred for the factories.</p></speech>

The garda asked a local who owned the horse, but nobody could find out who owned it.</p><p>Somebody asked who would own a dead horse.  The same thing applies.  It comes back to the point about being reactive or proactive.  My next question is for Mr. McGrath.  What do the local authorities have to do to get the subvention from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  That goes back to my earlier point about whether we can go into certain areas where we know there are many horses.  It seems logical to me.  We are finding many horses that are very distressed or are dead in these situations and, inevitably, they turn out not to be micro-chipped.  If we go into an area where there is no problem on a given day and do an on-the-spot check and find that a load of horses are not micro-chipped, can we seize them or does a horse need to be in distress before local authorities can access the money from the Department?</p></speech>

There is a set procedure and a form we must fill in that specifically covers the cost of seizure, the subsequent boarding of that horse up to a maximum of five days and the knackery costs if it is euthanised.  It is very structured around the seizure and disposal of the horse.  It does not really cover the targeted and pre-emptive approach suggested by the Deputy whereby we would target groups of horses which we would scan and try to pre-empt the problem.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses.  As Mr. Iceton said, Ireland is the home of the horse and yet we see an attitude and behaviour towards horses that could undermine it.  None of us could accept that.  It is not all about funding but funding is a very important component of it because nothing can be done without money and resources.  As with any implementation plan, we need targets and goals and the money to be used in the best possible way to achieve that.  We received a couple of shockers today, particularly in regard to what Ms Owen said about the movement of horses on to the island without any control.  It seems unbelievable that this could happen with such a large animal.  It is not like moving mice.  We have a bit of work to do.  We must finish this series of hearings in the autumn and make a recommendation to the Minister, the Department and other Ministers regarding how best to address the issue so that the reputation of the sport horse and the thoroughbred industry is protected.</p><p>We were shown pictures today of poorly and emaciated former racehorses.  When a horse is in good form, be it at the RDS, the Curragh or Leopardstown, one can tell if it is a good racehorse, showjumper or eventer, but when it is emaciated one cannot distinguish what it was, regardless of whether it was a top class breed or could hardly perform.  Once it is cruelly treated, that is the end of it.  It is an animal that has been mistreated and we cannot tolerate that.  Many of the committee members are farmers, so we understand what it is.  Our viability depends on minding animals, apart from the fact that it is bred into us, if I can use that phrase, to do so.  There is a keen interest among the members and the witnesses will have gathered that from the questions that were asked.<br/><br/>Again, I thank everybody.  This is probably the last meeting before the D&aacute;il rises for the summer recess.  I thank the committee secretariat, the members of the committee and the broadcasting personnel for their assistance during this term.  I hope to see everybody back next September.  I will adjourn the meeting <i>sine die</i>because I am not sure of the date of the next meeting and one does not know what emergency might arise that we will have to deal with.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider matters relating to the consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland.  We will now discuss this subject.  It is proposed that this part of our meeting will conclude at 4.30 p.m., unless previously concluded, and that at the conclusion of public business, we will go into private session to discuss other committee business.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: Ms Helen Dixon, Data Protection Commissioner; Mr. Tim Duggan, assistant secretary, and Ms Michelle O'Donnell, assistant principal, client identity services, at the Department of Social Protection; Dr. Adrian Kavanagh, lecturer in geography, NUI Maynooth; Mr. Se&aacute;n Donnelly, political analyst; and Mr. Liam Kenny, director of the Association of Irish Local Government.

I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>It is proposed that all opening statements and any other documents the witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>After the presentations, I will call members to make their opening remarks and ask questions.  Their contributions are to be limited to approximately ten minutes.  There are many witnesses in attendance and not everyone will get to speak.  If members exceed the time I allow them, it will eat into the remaining time in which witnesses may answer questions.  Members should be mindful of this.  I will ask whoever is in possession to conclude at the end of each ten-minute slot and then proceed to the next questioner.</p><p>This is the last of six meetings the joint committee has planned on the proposal to establish an electoral commission for Ireland.  We have heard from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and also academics, officeholders, representatives of local government, national agencies and bodies, and various experts.  During the course of our hearings, numerous witnesses told us there are 31 electoral registers in Ireland and that the absence of a unique identifier, such as the PPS number, is causing considerable difficulties with updating them.  This will feature strongly in our deliberations.  Today we will have questions on this matter and take into account the views of those involved in elections.  We are to produce a report on this in September.  The views of analysts and individuals involved in elections are very important to our work on making a proposal for the Minister regarding the electoral commission.</p><p>I call the witnesses to make their opening statements, beginning with the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#C00400"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to engage with it on the important data protection considerations that might arise in regard to any reform of the electoral registration process.  As the Chairman has outlined, the committee is interested in considering whether the PPS number would be a solution to accuracy, omission and duplication issues affecting the register.  I am well aware the committee has been informed by various witnesses that the use of the PPS number would, of course, be no trivial matter.</p> <p>  In the statement I submitted to the committee in advance of the meeting, I set out some of the specific considerations concerning security risks that can arise through over-reliance in the State on one identifier and the ability that could be created to link, potentially unlawfully, across a variety of Government databases.  What is at issue is striking a balance between the fundamental right of individuals to have their personal data protected and the public interest in democratic legitimacy through having an accurate voter register.  To strike that balance correctly, the Oireachtas will need to ensure the very specific context in which additional personal data are processed is detailed and analysed.</p> <p>  In data protection terms, the devil can often be in the detail of implementation.  Consider the example of a registration system involving a centralised verification service within a Department through which local authorities and new individuals who wanted to register electronically could submit their applications and have them validated.  A system that did not retain the PPS numbers once it completed a validation exercise would be very different from a system with a centralised electoral register run by one State body and under which the PPS numbers would be permanently retained.  Therefore, we need to understand in detail what we mean by use of the PPSN to resolve the issues with the electoral register.  It is important we outline precisely for what, in what circumstances, by whom and how the PPSN would be used in any proposal.</p> <p>  Equally, however, it would be preferable to start examining a range of solutions to the issues identified with the register and testing the solutions to determine whether they resolve the issues that have been identified.  The committee heard previously that there are potentially more PPS numbers than persons eligible to vote and, conceivably, persons eligible to vote who do not have a PPS number.</p><p>A range of solutions would need to be identified to deal with these issues.  Solutions would also need to be assessed so that they did not cause further issues beyond those that are sought to be resolved.  Ultimately, for any final proposal, a thorough privacy impact assessment would need to be carried out on the proposed solution to ensure that the implementation delivers the best protection of personal data as well as the most effective and efficient process for dealing with personal data.</p></speech>

I have responsibility in the Department of Social Protection for client identity services, which manage the PPS number and associated public services identity dataset, as well as the public services card currently in roll-out.  We support the use of all three of these elements across the entire public service.  I will briefly describe each of them to the committee, so members can understand them and their relationship with each other.  I will then give a brief view on the part they might be able to play in an electoral register.</p> <p>  The PPS number, as members will know, is an individual's unique reference number for all dealings with Government Departments and public bodies.  How it is governed is set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  Only those Departments or public bodies authorised by that legislation or their agents can use the PPS number as a personal identifier.  A body that is so authorised is usually referred to as a specified body.</p> <p>  A PPS number is automatically issued in the case of children born in Ireland.  In other cases, PPS numbers are issued in accordance with a controlled procedure following a personal attendance at one of the Department's dedicated PPS number registration centres, submission of a completed application, the capture of a photograph and signature, the submission of appropriate identity documents and proof of address, as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions, which we use subsequently to ensure the future integrity of that data, in other words, that someone else cannot change it.  We publish the information on that process in a whole load of places, including our own offices, citizen information centres, embassies, immigration advice centres and so on.  As a result, people who attend our offices to get a  PPS number are usually well informed and have all the necessary documentation.  It is only in very rare circumstances that somebody would have to attend more than once to be allocated a PPS number.</p> <p>  Associated with that number is a full identity dataset, known as the public service identity dataset.  That itself is also set out in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002.  Currently, that dataset consists of the PPS number, a person's surname, forename, date of birth, place of birth, sex, address, nationality, photograph, signature, any former surnames the person may have had, any former surnames his or her mother may have had, the date of death in the case of a deceased person, and any other information that the Minister may prescribe as necessary to validate and authenticate an identity.  That last provision has not been used to date.</p> <p>  In addition to the PPS number and public service identity dataset, there is the public services card, which more and more people getting, particularly if they are customers of any kind of the Department of Social Protection.  The purpose of the public services card is to provide people with a robust token of identity to enable them to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.  It is designed to replace other cards which people currently use in the public sector, such as the free travel pass and social services card.  It has the potential to replace a great number of other cards as well.  Those possibilities are currently being examined. </p> <p>  Considerable progress has already been made on the roll-out of the public services card.  Over 1.46 million cards have been issued up to yesterday, including 464,000 free travel versions of it.  Face to face registration for the card is taking place countrywide in 97 offices of the Department.  Some customers whose identities are regularly authenticated in a face to face process can avail of an easier postal registration process.  Registration is now required for individual adult applicants for a PPS number and for those applying for or in receipt of social protection payments or benefits.  In other words, it is no longer possible to get a PPS number without also registering for a public services card.</p> <p>  In order to ensure that a person receives only one PPS number and the public services card is allocated on the basis of information that is accurate and verified, certain operational procedures are prescribed for registration personnel who are dealing with applications.  It is necessary to have effective controls around the process to guard against fraud and protect the integrity of the data.  Evidence of identity is a vital element of the process.  Once the identity of an individual is verified, his or her relevant identity data is entered on our records and a batch process is run each night to allocate the PPS number itself.  A number of system validation checks are part of this process, to prevent multiple numbers being issued to the same person.  The accuracy of the information gathered from the individual is therefore critically important.</p> <p>  The face to face process for someone who already has a number involves the capture of his or her photograph and signature, the verification of his or her identity through documentation and checks of back-end databases, and his or her current address through documentation, as well as the capture of some security questions.  As part of the roll-out, we have invested in facial recognition software which ensures that multiple or fraudulent identities can be detected at the point of registration.  In other words, if someone is already registered and seeks to register again under a different identity set, the facial image recognition technology we use will prevent that from occurring, in the main.  During the course of the process, the software searches for photographs which we already have in our database against that scanned in for the individual applicant.  Only when all of those checks are completed will a public services card issue to a person.  Today, that is the only means by which a PPS number can be issued as well.  As a result, a public services card now provides a very substantial assurance of the identity of its holder.</p> <p>  We transfer our identity data to a system called the single customer view, which is operated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on our behalf.  This provides a central repository of identity data - that which is in the public service identity dataset - and can be used by other public bodies to do two things.  First, it can be used to verify the public service identity data presented by somebody coming to the public body and, second, to provide the public body with assurance on the verification status of a person's identity.  I can go into detail on that if the committee wishes.</p> <p>  To sum up, the public services card registration process is by far the most robust system of identity verification in the State today.  In this context, we understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has decided that, in future, new applicants for passports will have to undergo public services card registration before they can receive a passport.  In addition, we understand that the Road Safety Authority is upgrading its national driver licence service application process so that it is compatible with our registration process.  Therefore, somebody who applies for and gets a driver's licence will get a public services card as part of the same registration process.  The committee may also wish to note that Statutory Instrument No. 35/2014 provides that the public services card is specified as an identification document acceptable in the electoral process.  A person can prove his or her identity at a polling station using just a public services card.</p> <p>  On the electoral register, the Department considers that the PPS number, the public services identity dataset and the public services card could have a role to play in the establishment of the electoral register and its subsequent maintenance, and in checking against it.</p><p>In that regard, we would be more than willing to discuss the implications of the PPSN being used as the unique identifier for those purposes.  If this proposal is being seriously considered there is no point in using the number just for setting up the register.  That data would need to be maintained and this would require, in our view, regular exchanges of data, most likely through that single customer view system that I mentioned earlier.  Accordingly, the Department's view is that this could best be facilitated through a single register, to avoid duplicate entries across multiple registers, although we take the Data Protection Commissioner's point that there may be an alternative central verification mechanism through which this could be done.  In this context, there may be a need to look at the legislation and data protection memorandum of agreement so that data can be legitimately exchanged between the relevant public bodies.  The Department would not be in favour of making the PPS number publicly available along with other register data that is made publicly available.</p><p> The Department thinks that it may be feasible to consider the public services card as the means by which a person could prove his or her identity at a polling station, as it would provide both a physical check in terms of the name and photograph on the card but also a system check using the PPS number on the card against the register. </p><p> It is worth noting that just because a person has a PPS number, that does not confer any rights of any kind on the person.  It simply means that the person has registered his or her identity to a very high level with the Department of Social Protection.  It confers no right and in particular, does not confer any right to vote.  </p><p> The Department is clear that the decision on who has the right to vote would be outside its remit in this regard but we are more than happy to discuss this with the relevant Departments if it wishes to explore the issue further.  I will do my best to answer any questions from members. </p></speech>

The committee has heard from a number of political science academics.  My specialty is geography so I will not be giving the same level of detail as people like Dr. Theresa Reidy or Professor David Farrell offered.  I have put together a few ideas about what I regard as important for the proposed electoral commission.  I have grouped them under the headings of Reform, Independence, Information, Value for Money and Administration-Organisation.<br/><br/>Under the heading of reform I would argue that the main driver or function of the proposed commission - its <i>raison d'etre</i>- should be to focus on a reform.  There is a lot of talk about the importance of a commission in terms of improving the quality of the electorate register but in my view the commission could be most valuable in the area of electoral reform which could involve looking at various innovations for improving electoral practice or the sharing of electoral information and also as a body that is able to learn from international precedents of good practice.  It should also be able to learn from good ideas about elections or improving the electoral process that it gains from the Irish public or from experts in the field, be they academics, experts in the area of elections, such as Mr. Sean Donnelly, for example, or people who are petitioners in the field, such as people who work in the area of electoral administration or politicians themselves. <br/><br/>An electoral commission would be important because, as the past few years have shown, in instances or accusations of partisan bias it can be very difficult to get certain electoral reform ideas across or passed.  I refer to what has happened in the past few years such as the Seanad referendum which failed for different reasons.  Most recently we had the collapse of the referendum to reduce the age of presidential election candidates.  In part I would argue the main problem in that case was that these were represented or misrepresented sometimes, as trying to get too much power for the D&aacute;il, for example. However, ideas put forward by an independent body, in theory at least, those concerns about partisan bias should be able to be overcome that might otherwise nix good ideas about electoral reform.<br/><br/>The electoral commission would also be able to drive certain reform efforts from an organisational perspective, in the way that other bodies might not be able to do.  One area that I suspect will become a major issue will be a focus on the area of voting rights for the Irish diaspora.  I was talking to the European Affairs committee about this topic a few months ago.  I suspect this issue may become fairly significant with regard to electoral reform in the future.  Certain electoral reform efforts may require a centralised independent body to push them through over and above what can be done by a body that is more tied in to the Government or to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the local authorities or local bodies.  <br/><br/>The next heading relates to the independence of a commission.  An independent commission should, in theory, be better placed to drive or push a reform agenda and get public acceptance for it than might be the case if it were seen to be a policy pushed by certain politicians or by the Government.  If it is decided to go down the route of having an electoral officer or an elections ombudsman or elections Czar to head up this body, the main aspect to ensure the independence of the commission is that the leadership should be, in so far as practical, drawn from outside the political sector or the administrative elite.  <br/><br/>There are two significant issues relating to independence and it is a question of how can a commission's ideas become policy.  All a commission can do in driving new ideas for improving electoral practice is to put forward proposals.  It will require some thought as to how to turn proposals into policy.  Generally, I suspect, that the best model is that proposals from the commission should go before the Seanad and the D&aacute;il for decision, with the scope that these can be rejected because I would suspect there may be certain proposals from the commission that might not work when they are examined.  However, these should only be rejected when there is very good reason to do so.  <br/><br/>The briefing document raised the question of engagement with politicians, whether politicians should be involved in the commission.  I would argue that there is a place for politicians or people from the general political sector in the commission but perhaps in the form of an advisory panel instead of having politicians on the commission.  An advisory panel of politicians could debate and discuss issues with the commission.  Certain expert knowledge can only be had from politicians, whether Deputies, Senators or councillors or local party workers.  People working in politics have certain in-depth expert information that others do not have and certainly academics do not have it.  This would be a very good scope to draw on the political knowledge.  I suggest an advisory panel made up of politicians or people from party headquarters.<br/><br/>I refer to the importance of accountability.  It was suggested that the commission should produce reports.</p><p>A precedent in New Zealand was referred to where the commission must always produce a report on the administration of elections within months of an election taking place.<br/><br/>Information is an important element.  Dr. Theresa Reidy, who appeared before the committee on an earlier occasion, spoke about the possibility of an electoral commission being established before the next election.  There are certain things a new commission could not do in a short period of time but one thing it could do quickly is to work on getting electoral information out to people.  I had a quick look at the British electoral commission's webpage yesterday and it gives details on how to register on the front of its webpage.  If one wanted to get that information in Ireland, one would need to go to a number of websites, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government website, the Standards in Public Office Commission website, a local authority website, a political party website and so on.  Getting that information out would be an important function for an electoral commission.  The commission could work on that very early in the day.  <br/><br/>One of the first things a commission could do would be have a one-stop-shop with information on the electoral process and important statistics on elections to hand so that the public could quickly access it.  That is being done on websites, such as Mr. Se&aacute;n Donnelly's <i>electionsireland.org</i>, and my own website.  This would probably take away all our business but it is probably for the best.  <br/><br/>As regards other aspects relating to information, the commission should be involved in carrying out research into better electoral practice and so on and there may be scope for funding PhD scholarships for such research.  Importantly, the commission should also be involved in voter education programmes with the funding directed at voter education programmes, focusing particularly on areas or groups which tend to have low turnouts either for specific elections, for example, in Donegal for a referendum, or generally, such as inner city populations, younger voters and so on.<br/><br/>I would like to make two further brief points as there are others here with better opinions on this subject.  With regard to value for money, centralisation and economies of scale may work.  On the other hand, as we have seen in the past, new initiatives have often produced false economies of scale and the possibility of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  I would be careful about and would argue against a new electoral commission trying to reinvent the wheel from stage one.  The best practice is probably to see what is already there and examine how a new commission could link with these different bodies.<br/><br/>On administration, the best model might be an electoral commission body.  Instead of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum Commission, the new electoral commission should be an umbrella grouping tying together these different bodies with the main role of the chief electoral officer or electoral Ombudsman being to link up with the different bodies involved in different parts of electoral practice.</p></speech>

The word comes from the Greek word <i>psephos</i>, pronounced with a silent P, which means pebble because in ancient Greece they used to vote by casting pebbles - they may be using something else in the next few weeks in Greece.  Psephology is a branch of political science that deals with the study and scientific analysis of elections.<br/><br/>I have a fair bit of experience of our elections.  I have written ten books since 1991 on all of our elections from general elections, by-elections, European elections, Presidential elections to referenda.  I will give a few figures on our elections.  There have been 31 general elections in this State since 1922, which was the first proportional representation, PR, election.  There have been 131 by-elections, 28 Seanad elections, eight European elections, seven Presidential elections, 39 referenda and 24 local elections.  In all there have been 268 elections, so we have a fair bit of experience of the electoral process.  <br/><br/>I will refer to my experience in this area over the last 30 years.  I have encountered four problems, in particular.  One is the lack of overall control.  No one is in charge of the overall system.  There is no consistency and the left hand does know what the right hand is doing and is not particularly interested.  The Internet ethos of sharing information has not permeated to these bodies.  The information is power ethos overrides the transparency aspiration.  The register of electors is probably the most talked about item at this committee.  It is well documented in the committee's hearings and I will come back to it.  It is obviously a big item.  The election results, because of the attitude that prevails, are very deficient.  The system relies on people like myself and others to come up with election results, but that is not good enough.<br/><br/>I will move on to some possible solutions to these problems.  Regarding the lack of transparency and lack of overall control, the establishment of an electoral commission will solve that problem overnight.  On the second item, the sharing of information, that requires a cultural change and I do not think it can happen.  That is why we need an electoral commission.  I have dealt a good deal with the councils in regard to the register.  Any time I want information, it takes up to 34 telephone calls to get it, or many more than that by the time I eventually get it.  The first response I get to a request for information is, &quot;What do you want that for?&quot;  When I telephone the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the staff there cannot do enough for me.  It is that cultural change that needs to take place.  One item of information I look for is the breakdown of the electoral register - the way the books are structured, for example.  When I telephone to ask for that information, the response I get is, &quot;No. We do not have that.&quot;  When I say they should have it, they say that they do not have it.  When I say they used to sell the register, or parts of the register, and, therefore, they must have a list of the books with the number of voters on it, the response is, &quot;Is that what you are talking about?  No, we do not have that.&quot;  When I say they have enumerators who update the register and who are paid on the basis of the number of people on the register and that they must have lists of them, the response is, &quot;Is that what you are talking about?&quot;  There is an issue in that they do not know what I and others want and they are not particularly interested in helping us. <br/><br/>Moving on to the register of electors, there are three items to consider, the boundary report for elections, the register of electors and the census of population, for which the Central Statistics Office has responsibility.  The latest census was in 2011 when there were 4,588,252 people in Ireland.  The building block of the census is the electoral division.The building block of the boundary report is also the electoral division.  The register of electors is now in the hands of three city councils and 28 county councils.  They deal with the electorate.  Their building block is the polling district and I have not been able to find out how it came about or what it means.  We have a Tower of Babel with the electoral division as the building block of the census and of the Boundary Commission, which forms the boundaries for the elections, and then with having something different in the register of electors.  We cannot get the two to co-ordinate. <br/><br/>There is also the lack of an overarching body.  Two city councils, Dublin City Council and Cork City Council, do it right but the others councils do not.  It is a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.  It creates a problem when it comes to doing any analysis, because it is a Tower of Babel, and there is no need for it.<br/><br/>I gave an example in my submission of how one can compare the electorate and break it down into these small electoral divisions, EDs, but even taking a local electoral area, and I have used the example of is Dublin Bay South for the next election, it is possible to compare data.  I also included the number who are able to vote, the number who are Irish and the number who are over the age of 18.  The figure comes out at about 70%, which  means 30% cannot vote.</p><p>One could use the figure, working down to the electoral divisions, EDs, and it would immediately show where there are too many voters registered and all sorts of issues which I have found over the years.  For example, if one applies it to the last census, the percentage comes out at 71%.  In Dublin city, it is 61% and in Ulster, it is as high as 77%.<br/><br/>The population and the census are the same thing and there should not be a discrepancy between the two.  The CSO is an excellent body, which produces excellent reports and is very helpful.  Such an organisation could take over the electoral register.  The CSO has the expertise to overcome the problem of PPS numbers.  We will have a census next year and it would be convenient if there was a note from the Government asking the CSO to form the census so as to ascertain the number of people who should be eligible to vote.  The census has a grouping of ages zero to 19.  We would like a grouping of people aged zero to 18.  Why is it 19?  What does 19 mean?  I do not know.  It has no significance, whereas the age of 18 has the significance that one can vote.  This information is available from the CSO on payment of &euro;50.  The model is there, the CSO is there and the census is there with all the details we need.  I can leave the duplication problem to other experts.<br/><br/>Another major gap in the system is election results, which are difficult to get.  They do not see it as part of trying to get election results.  During general elections in Italy, results are displayed on a big screen in the local piazza as it is happening.  One would be lucky to get the information from the councils six months after the event.  We have not got the local election results yet.  We are in the Internet age and it has changed everything else, but the Internet has not changed our electoral system.  It has had no effect.  When I started out, information was posted out.  When I tried to get the local election results, I was told they only had the big sheets that were displayed at the election count and they would have to post them to me.  That was the system.<br/><br/>During the Presidential election I spoke on the radio at lunch time on the Saturday complaining about the system.  Claire Byrne said she had to go over to one of the Dublin counts in the new Convention Centre.  The RTE reporter said they could not get the fax machine working.  Claire Byrne told the reporter she was having to restrain Se&aacute;n Donnelly and that I was about to fall off the chair.  It is typical.  We are in an age when everything is about statistics and analysis.  We see it in American football, rugby and GAA.  A statistic was given that Michael Murphy of my county, Donegal, had touched the ball 50 times.  Is it good or bad?  Paul O'Connell, playing for Ireland, made 16 tackles.  Is it good or bad?  Sporting people know it is very good.  However, if the turnout in Kerry at 6 p.m. on the day of voting in the last election was 40%, is it good or bad?  We do not know because we have nothing to compare it with.  Statistical analysis is being used everywhere.<br/><br/>A few years ago, I came across a book entitled <i>Slater's National Commercial Directory of Ireland</i>.  It broke down the country into baronies, parishes, statute acres, annual value, population, families, population per family and education.  I thought it must be very recent, but it was produced in 1846 in Manchester.  It puts us in the shade.  It provided the pre-Famine figures, when the population was 8.175 million.  I did an analysis of it, and an average family had 5.6 people.  In the last census, there were 2.8 people per family.  If we returned to 5.6 people per family, we would return to the pre-Famine population.  One could argue that contraception had as significant an effect on our population as the Famine had.<br/><br/>The tally holds a revered position in Irish politics, although it is over-rated.  Counting votes is not rocket science and it is no big deal that the result is produced a few hours before the official result.  In 1994, I set the task of doing a full European tally in Dublin.  People said it could not be done.  It was before Microsoft Windows 95 and the Internet.  There were approximately 1,300 boxes and to put them into a computer would take approximately 22 hours, whereas we had approximately four.  The obvious solution was to get a number of computers.  I drove around Dublin and got 12 computers and we had one master computer and the old floppy disks.  Every hour we stopped the count and produced a tally.  There was a photocopier for the parties.  All the media received it and it worked like a charm.  This was 30 years ago.<br/><br/>In 2005, there were two by-elections, one in Kildare for Charlie McCreevy's seat and one in Meath for John Bruton's seat.  We decided to go one better and see if we could put the tally on the Internet.  We put it on the Internet and on people's mobile phones as it was happening.  All the parties decided to do their own tallies and they passed them on to me.  They hardly differed.  One has to go to two decimal places to get any differences.  The Fianna F&aacute;il tally for the Fine Gael candidate was 33.98%, whereas the Fine Gael tally was 34%, Sinn F&eacute;in 33.95%, my tally was 34.05% and the final result was 34.13%.  The difference was less than 0.1%.  It shows what individual people can do.  What could be done with the powers of the State supporting it?  I feel passionate about the electoral commission.  Given that election day is a slow news day, RTE sends correspondents all over the country to check in on polling stations and ask how many ballot papers have been given out.  One phone call from each polling station to an Internet site would provide hourly updates on every polling station.  Compare what was achieved in 1846 with what we are doing now.<br/><br/>Electronic voting is the elephant in the room.  I was one of the few who publicly supported it.  All the political parties supported in the D&aacute;il.  While electronic voting was not a problem, electronic counting became a problem.  Everybody found the voting machines worked well.  Had there been an electoral commission, the debacle would not have ensued, it would not have become a political issue and we would have saved ourselves over &euro;50 million.  These matters are important.  The validity of the arguments raised by the computer buffs could easily have been checked during the following election by selecting a few constituencies and feeding all the ballot papers into the electronic voting machines to see if it differed hugely.  If one entered three to five complete ballots, it would have come close.  We are not sure of the present system.  I have never seen a recount produce the exact same figures as the original count.  It became a political football and nobody wants to touch it.  I believe it will be touched.<br/><br/>I have outlined the main deficiencies in our electoral management system and the necessity of establishing an electoral commission.  Some people say these things are not important.  The last referendum was supposed to be the 34th amendment to the Constitution, but it was the 29th.  Before it, only 28 referenda had been passed by the people.  Previously, if a referendum was not passed, the number was brought forward, for example, there were two attempts to pass the third and fourth amendment.</p><p>Then there were the eleventh and twelfth amendments and there were three amendments on the one day, two of which were passed.  There was another amendment about judges and calling them to heel which did not actually pass through the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, in the next referendum, whenever it is held, it will be on the thirty-sixth amendment, but it would actually be the thirtieth amendment to be passed.  That is sloppy.  Imagine the Americans pleading the fifth amendment and wondering whether it was the sixth, the seventh or the eight amendment.  Perhaps somebody might make a case against this sometime.  <br/><br/>There are four recommendations; an electoral commission should be established with responsibility for all aspects of the electoral system, including voter and party registration; there should be reviews of boundary divisions; there should be the organisation and running of various elections and referenda; and there should be the publication of results and analysis.  A national register of electors should be set up based on electoral divisions as per the census and boundary reviews rather than polling districts as occurs at present.  The 2006 census form should be altered to allow for calculation of the proportion of the population allowed to vote.  This is not available at present but could be.  The register should be the responsibility of the electoral commission but could be contracted out to a body such as the CSO which carries out summary work in compiling the census every five years.  There will be a census next year.  It would also have the expertise to tackle the ongoing problem of voter duplication.  A comprehensive website should be set up containing all relevant data associated with the electoral process, including the register of electors and real-time election results, rather than being provided six months later.  It should include all historical results.  In other words, it should contain the data contained in my ten books on the <i>ElectionsIreland.org</i>website.  The issue of electronic voting should be revisited which, as happened in the case of a few recent referenda, might get through at the second attempt.  It would bring us into the Internet age of instant and much more detailed results.  It would bring to an end the tally which has been overrated.</p></speech>

We represent 949 councillors throughout Ireland.  Our submission was put together after much discussion at plenary and executive committee meetings.  It is detailed, very broad and deals with all aspects, from registration to logistics on the day and boundary commissions, as well as, of course, the diaspora which has been mentioned by some of the other contributorsl.</p> <p>  I will briefly give our opinion on the establishment of an electoral commission.  County and city councils have, in law, a valuable mandate to: "Promote interest among young people in democracy and local government and in community and civic affairs, generally".  This was included in the Local Government Act 2001.  Many local authorities are active in this manner, including in hosting local meetings of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and other educational activities such as facilitating groups of youths to visit council chambers and arranging visits of mayors to schools.  The capacity of local government to organise and administer elections is intertwined with its mandate to educate and interest young people and the community generally in democracy.  That is one of our main topics and one of the issues about which we feel exceptionally strongly.</p></speech>

I will make a few points about the current system of electoral administration, working from the bottom up, to include the following: local talliers who have multiple responsibilities in the election process, including for local elections; the administration, organisation and maintenance of the register of electors; making polling schemes; for the logistics of elections; for providing assistance for the county registrar in the organisation of elections and formal and informal provision for providing personal assistance during elections.  They also maintain the register on spending by parties and candidates in local elections.</p> <p>  The country registrar who is independent functions within the remit of the Courts Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The county registrar has many other responsibilities through court administration, for example, shadow functions.  County registrars are also returning officers in general elections and sub-returning officers for presidential, D&aacute;il and European parliamentary elections and referenda.  </p> <p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government franchise unit drafts and monitors policy and the legislation regarding the electoral system.  </p> <p>  The Referendum Commission is a temporary commission which is activated in the weeks preceding a referendum and then lapses after it.  Its main role is to give impartial information on the referendum issues in question.  </p> <p>  Boundary committees are established from time to time to redraw separately constituency boundaries, parliamentary constituencies and local electoral areas.  Such committees are temporary in nature.  </p> <p>  The Standards in Public Office Commission has functions that relate mainly to the explanation of spending by parties and candidates in a general election, the maintenance of the register and lobbyists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien Geoghegan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#H00500"><p>We have also put together a critique of the savings claimed in the establishment of a commission.  The proponents of a single electoral commission argue that by centralising some or all of the functions in a central organisation there would be cost and efficiency savings.  It is also argued that a body with a remit focused on electoral administration would do the job more effectively than county councils or county registrars, for whom electoral administration is only a part of their overall responsibilities.  To assess the usefulness of such claims, the following should be taken into account.  <br/><br/>On the savings claimed, we make the following points.  The local authorities would continue in existence performing all other functions; therefore, we would see the savings on the franchise side as minimal.  Similarly, county registrars, for court purposes, would continue in existence; therefore, savings in terms of their time involved in election administration would also be small.  <br/><br/>On the franchise unit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, it is certain that even if a one-stop electoral commission were to be set up, the Department would still need an office dealing with broad policy and the drafting of electoral legislation.  A transfer of functions to a new electoral commission could, in time, lead to a duplication of work.<br/><br/>On the Standards in Public Office Commission and the administration of election spending, it is true that the commission and the local authorities operate parallel systems for different cohorts of elected members.  Some savings may be possible in developing a common template for such returns.  However, on integrating the SIPO with an electoral commission, there is an argument that the standards in public office body should stand alone, given its very specific role in maintaining propriety and standards.  <br/><br/>The approach to the Referendum Commission is essentially <i>ad hoc</i>, with a commission being called into office as a referendum is called.  There have been complaints that the short period in office of a commission does not allow it to sufficiently convey information in advance of a referendum.  This is one area where integration with a more continuous body could help in conveying information to the public and enhancing voter turnout.  That said, the experience of the May 2015 same sex marriage referendum showed that the existing system operated by the county councils was able to cope with a surge of new registrations within a matter of weeks before the referendum.  <br/><br/>Taking all of the above into account, there is a question as to whether a single body, as proposed, would, in fact, deliver appreciable savings, which would be at the cost of losing local knowledge and involvement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christy Hyland" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#H00600"><p>I am from the municipal district of west Mayo and thank the joint committee for its invitation.  As most of the areas have been covered by my colleagues, I will be brief as I am conscious of the time.  </p> <p>  I want it to be recognised that the input of local authorities into electoral arrangements and registers must never be diluted because they have been a valuable source of local knowledge and their role should never be interfered with.  At times we make a mess of the register.  We have a population of only 4.5 million people, yet time and again, as each election takes place, we can never get it right with the register.  One system we put forward for consideration is that the moment a citizen reaches the age of 18 years, the Department of Social Protection will notify him or her to register to vote.  It is very simple and not rocket science.  That is the opinion of the Association of Irish Local Government.</p> <p>  Another issue about which we feel very strongly is that on election day, when each of us wants to exercise our constitutional right and cast our vote, the first people we meet are the polling clerks or the presiding officer.</p><p>Some 99% of them are in full-time employment as public servants, working perhaps for the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We feel strongly that qualified young people such as third level students in full-time education who perhaps are studying politics are the ones who should be employed on the day of the count.  It is worth between &euro;400 and &euro;500, which to a third level student could be very important.  Time and again we hear about who was employed in polling stations, but we still have not got it right and the association believes it is time to call a halt to serving public servants taking annual leave on the day of an election to work in a polling station.  It is a crying shame and has to stop.  There are 949 of us throughout the country and we get this every day.</p><p> A polling card is not an identification card, which can be one's driving licence or passport.  People do not even have to bring their polling card to cast a vote.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Data Protection Commissioner might comment too.  </p><p>To what extent does the Department of Social Protection share PPSN information?  I presume it liaises with Revenue on PPS numbers, but to what extent does it happen?  With how many other public bodies does the Department interact on the issue of PPSN information?  We have many organs of State which collate a lot of similar information.  Some already have it, while others go to extreme lengths to information that is already in the possession of another public sector organ.  It is like a dog chasing its own tail.  Is there interaction between the Department of Social Protection and local authorities and if not, why not?  It is the one Department that knows everyone's date of birth and date of death when survivors apply for bereavement grants.  Why does it not happen when local authorities compile the electoral register?</p><p>Can Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Kavanagh answer one question for me?  I am intrigued about opinion polls.  The standard of political writing in the newspapers nowadays is absolutely appalling and a lot of the stuff online is just clickbait and deals with aspects of politics that I do not find in the least bit interesting.  One of the features newspapers use to sell copy is opinion polls, which are now front page news.  Most of those present will be exercised by the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>Red C poll which is the only tracking poll of its kind.  There are other polls which can vary greatly, with one newspaper publishing a poll which reflects a difference of five or six points from another.  They cannot both possibly be correct.  </p><p>There have been two recent significant events.  One was the polls before the UK general election.  I was surprised to learn there was a polling commission in the United Kingdom which had launched an inquiry into why the polling companies had got it wrong.  Either the polling companies or the people got it wrong and I would conclude that the polling companies got it wrong.  Can they be held to account in any way on these matters?  There is no way of knowing how scientific or accurate the data they use are and it is all done to drive the sales of newspapers.</p><p>I campaigned against the abolition of the Seanad as I thought it was appalling that any Government would want to move from a bicameral to a unicameral system.  The word on the street and the feedback from canvassers was that the people would reject the proposal, but <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>carried a poll that week that suggested the Seanad would go and that it was a foregone conclusion.  It got it horribly wrong, but there were no consequences and no one was held to account.  If a Minister had made a statement in the course of a plebiscite that was deemed to be grossly inaccurate, one would have heard about it until the cows came home.  Should there be a role for polling in the electoral commission?  If and when the commission is up and running, should it have a remit to monitor this behaviour?  Polls can sometimes influence voters in an unhealthy way.  The Administration of 1997 to 2002 tried to bring forward legislation in 2001 to ban opinion polls, but after it had passed through the D&aacute;il and while it was in the final stages in the Seanad, a Senator spotted an anomaly and it was abandoned.  Does an electoral commission need to have a remit which covers polling?  There is wide inconsistency in the way information from polls is fed to us and questions need to be asked as to why it is fed to us.  </p><p>Perhaps Mr. Duggan might answer the questions on the Department of Social Protection.  If Ms Dixon wants to respond, she may do so.  I will then go to Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Kavanagh.</p></speech>

In my opening statement I said the PPS number was available to bodies known as "specified bodies".  They are specified by being included in the Schedule to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  The Chairman can see that the list runs to over two pages.  He will also see that No. 2 on the list is local authorities and that, accordingly, they have the legislative power to collect and use PPS numbers, as do Revenue and any other Department.</p> <p>  We put together the public service identity dataset, including all those things I listed such as name, address, date of birth, place of birth and PPS number.  These are made available through a system called the "single customer view".  Local authorities have an entitlement to access that system to verify the data.  We also have a death event notification system which takes death information registered with the GRO and disseminates it through the single customer view infrastructure to any public body, including local authorities, that is entitled to the information and subscribes to the system.  Local authorities have the ability to check and validate PPS numbers and all public service identities offered to them by an individual and can check if people have died and have been registered as such.</p></speech>

It is because there is no legal basis in primary legislation for this to happen.  For data of this type to be shared, it would have to be underpinned by specific primary legislation.</p></speech>

Indeed, that poll showed Fine Gael on 36.1%, which is exactly what it got.  The poll underestimated the Fianna F&aacute;il vote by two percentage points.  We have to bear in mind that voters are allowed to change their mind coming up to election day, as often happens in referenda.  Just because a person tells a pollster two weeks before the election date that he or she will vote for Fianna F&aacute;il, there is no obligation on the person to follow through on it.  People have free agency in this regard.<br/><br/>There have been problems with the reliability of poll findings.  The main polling companies, including those which conduct polls for <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and so on, have an excellent record.  However, rogue polls are published and we must be very wary of them.  Before the last election, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>published a series of constituency polls which seemed to have been done on the back of an envelope.  They were absolute rubbish.  That type of thing should not be allowed because it gives everybody a bad name.<br/><br/>I am wary of suggestions that an electoral commission might have a role in making decisions around polling.  In France, a decision was taken to suspend polling in the last week of campaigns, and there was a similar proposal here.  Poll findings can work either for or against a party.  When leaked poll data showed that Bertie Ahern, as then leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, was heading for an overall majority in the 2002 election, Michael McDowell climbed up a lamp post in Ranelagh and everything changed.  As I said, it can work both ways.  People may get frightened at the prospect of a particular party winning an overall majority, which can lead to a rowing back of support for that party.  If one is in the game, one has to go with it.<br/><br/>In general, the polls produced in Ireland over the years have been pretty good.  Everybody is talking about how the polls in Britain did not reflect the actual outcome of the recent general election.  I do not know enough about that matter to give a view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Adrian Kavanagh" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#K00200"><p>In general, I agree with everything Mr. Donnelly said.  In regard to the British election, looking at the poll of polls taken on the day of the election, the main issue was that the Labour Party's actual share of the vote turned out to be two or three percentage points lower than expected.  The results for all the other parties, however, were pretty much bang on.  The poll of polls predicted the UKIP, for instance, would be at 13% or 14%, which is where it finished.  The Green Party, as predicted, secured about 4% of the vote.  The problem was in translating those poll figures into seat numbers.  A lot of people did not take account of the fact that the UK uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, which is a factor.  In addition, there was the knock-on effect of the large swing to the SNP in Scotland, which was always going to result in a drastic reduction in the number of Labour Party seats.  The latter would probably have had to be above the Conservative Party in percentage terms to have had a chance of winning more seats than it.</p> <p>  It is often the case that the main issue in regard to polls is probably the question of how to translate the data they provide into seat numbers.  We have a proportional representation electoral system in this country, but that does not mean the seat outcome is exactly proportionate.  For instance, until 2009, Fianna F&aacute;il generally won a seat bonus at every local and general election.  In 2011, however, the party won 17% of the vote but only 12% of the seats.  There is no neat relationship between actual percentage share of the vote and seat numbers.  Another issue to note is that there is a margin of error associated with polls.  Most polls tend to have approximately 1,000 respondents and the margin of error is around 3%.  If, say, Fine Gael is at 25%, it is feasible that one poll might have the party at 22% while another puts it at 28%.  That is another factor to take into account.</p> <p>  In the case of the Seanad referendum, probably one of the most important issues was turnout.  Where turnout is low, as is often the case in referenda, opinion polls are less reliable than would be the case in a general election where, generally, turnout levels tend to be much higher.  The polls before the Seanad referendum were probably not as inaccurate as they seemed to be.  The issue may have been that not enough of those who intended to vote "Yes" actually turned out on the day.  In other words, it may have been that the "No" voters were simply more likely to turn out.</p> <p>  Mr. Donnelly made a very good point regarding constituency polls.  I agree that most of our national polls are generally quite consistent and accurate, but there is a problem with constituency polls.  In the case of the latter, the number of respondents is usually much lower.  If, for example, the sample is only 200, the reliability of the data is reduced.  The smaller the number of respondents, the greater the margin of error.  In addition, there is a name recognition factor with constituency polls.  I recall that one particular poll in Laois-Offaly, for example, had Brian Cowen at 33%.  Candidates with greater name recognition, which is usually the candidates who are sitting Deputies, tend to have higher poll ratings.  However, after an election campaign, other candidates may catch up.  Constituency polls are perhaps the most problematic of all polls for the reasons we have outlined.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Kennedy for the good news that sitting Deputies have a name recognition advantage.  Sometimes that works out and sometimes it does not.</p><p>Ms Dixon mentioned there is an over-reliance on one identifier, namely, PPS numbers.  Does she have any suggestions as to what other identifiers might be used?</p><p>Regarding the IALG presentation, I have a natural bias, as Mr. Kenny and his colleagues know, towards local government taking on as many responsibilities as possible.  Do the IALG delegates have any suggestions for dealing with the address-based registration problems we are seeing?  Young people, for example, often have two separate addresses, namely, their home address and the address at which they are studying or working.  They might live with a boyfriend or girlfriend for a time before returning home to live.  Some 300,000 households are in private rented accommodation, which is transient by nature, as opposed to local authority rented accommodation, which tends to be much more long-term.  How do the delegates see these issues being dealt with?  There is also a cross-boundary issue.  In the case of Laois-Offaly, for instance, people might be registered at an address in both counties.</p><p>I am mindful of the local information to which local authorities have access and how useful that can be.  However, as we have often noted in this committee, that information-gathering capacity has broken down to some extent in a context where we no longer have rate collectors and 700 town councillors are gone.  That weakens the process of local intelligence gathering.  In addition, political parties do not have the same on-the-ground membership they had 40 or 50 years ago, where there was somebody at every crossroads.  How do we deal with the issue of multiple registrations?  I accept that some of the benefits of local intelligence are still there as a result of the efforts of local authority staff and the 949 members of local authorities.  However, capacity in this regard has been compromised.</p><p>Dr. Kavanagh referred to the staffing and management of the electoral commission.  Who does he envisage heading the body up and how should that person be selected?  The <i>ad hoc</i>boundary commissions do not always deal us the hand we would like.  In the case of Laois-Offaly, we have inherited a piece of south Kildare that has no relationship to Laois.  Some people have asked whether there is bias there and how those decisions are made.  Oireachtas Members from Laois-Offaly discovered the changes in the constituency when they found a map in their pigeon holes one day.  I have no idea how the decisions in regard to my constituency were arrived at, because there is no accountability.</p><p>Who should be included in these commissions, including the boundary commission and the SIPO, and how should they be selected?</p></speech>

We can, however, assist in assessing the data protection and privacy implications of any solution that might be proposed.  In terms of suggestions that could potentially be considered by any executive body examining this area, it might perhaps involve an enhanced version of the current registration system.  What issues arise with the current system in terms of duplication and fraud and could it be enhanced without using additional personal data to improve the system and eliminate some of the problems?  While I do not suggest they offer more viable or less privacy invasive solutions, other jurisdictions have, for example, investigated biometric data measures.  Another alternative could be using different identity data such as a passport and a copy of a bill from the voter's current address.  There is no doubt that the PPS number would come into the mix.  The new UK individual electoral registration system has most recently used that country's national insurance number.  The PPS number would need to be considered as a viable solution, but we must also adhere to data minimisation principles.  The PPS number solution would require voters who are validly on the current register to re-register with their PPS numbers or, alternatively, a data matching exercise could be carried out with the social protection database to clear a certain percentage of those already on the register, thereby avoiding the need for them to provide their PPS numbers.  Only new registrants and those for whom data matches were not found would be required to re-register.  The details of how the PPS number is used would dictate the data protection issues arising.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

I am not sure the proposals would address the problems with the address based systems, given that people are now more transient and that local intelligence can be lacking.</p></speech>

The fact that people are so mobile nowadays creates a big problem for us.  That is why it is important that local councils continue to have an input.  They would be aware of people's history and different movement types.  Tying people to PPS numbers would probably be helpful, but the issue is quite complicated in general.  Voters are required to get a Garda stamp to complete form RFA3 to change their address.  It is an onerous form to complete.  Voters might register twice without bothering to inform the local authority.  Unless the council official notices the anomaly, it will not be fixed.  Sometimes good staff will notice the anomaly and remove the individual from the register after checking his or her date of birth, but much of the time that does not happen.  The bigger sin is that the voter is removed from the register and, therefore, cannot vote.  The register numbers are inaccurate because people are on multiple registers, as we can see as politicians on the ground.  We definitely have to consider tying registration to the PPS number.</p></speech>

In regard to the constituency commission, the last report on local election boundaries was prepared by a commission comprising five or six people who were given six months to redraw boundaries across the country.  I was on one of the two previous committees for the 2008 redrawing of local election boundaries.  We had the same amount of time.  The committee with which I was involved was only examining Dublin and the cities.  From my experience, we had sufficient time for our examination, but we still made mistakes.  There is more scope to review the proposals made by the two local election committees and the constituency commission.  Perhaps we should consider the model used in the United Kingdom, whereby instead of the commission or committee of committees producing a final report, at some stage early in the process, even before public submissions are invited, two or three options are set out in a draft report.  If, for example, there is a proposal to merge County Offaly with part of north Tipperary, there would be an opportunity to respond.  </p> <p>  The other problem with the commission and the committees is that, either because of the number of voters or the level of work involved, it becomes a numbers game when it comes to local elections.  There might not be sufficient people in County Laois for a three seat constituency and, therefore, the constituency would simply be expanded to include the additional numbers.  This is something that might require further thought.  The current guideline is that every constituency should have a population per Deputy that is within 5% of the national average, although in practice that figure has varied as high as 9% in Mayo East in 1983.  This is something that probably has not been given sufficient thought.  My sense of the constituency commission is that it puts greater emphasis on proportionality over continuity of place based on county based elements.  I understand the current general election boundaries breach 15 or 16 county boundaries.  Perhaps we need to discuss the extent to which proportionality should be seen as more important than maintaining county boundaries.  Perhaps there is more scope to preserve county boundaries in constituencies, even if it means the population is 10% too large.</p></speech>

However, that is another day's work.  The boundary commission should at least try to align constituency boundaries with municipal districts in the adjoining county rather than biting a piece from two municipal districts.</p></speech>

In regard to the Deputy's point about larger constituencies, Professor John Coakley in UCD carried out useful research which indicated that if there was scope for larger constituency units, it would not be necessary to move away from county boundaries.  If, for example, we had six seat constituencies, we might have combined counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in one constituency without drawing in parts of south Donegal or west Cavan to make up the numbers for the four seat Sligo-Leitrim constituency.</p><p>What was the other question?</p></speech>

As I tried to say in my initial submission, ideally there should be an identifiable head of the commission, an ombudsman or electoral czar.  This is for various reasons, the main one being it is important to have an identifiable person who can speak on behalf of the commission to try to get across what it is doing.  It should not be someone who is or has been involved in politics, nor should the person be from the administrative sector.  It should be someone outside the political administrative sector who has a very good understanding of how elections operate.  I am sure Mr. Donnelly has ideas about this.</p></speech>

When I was canvassing I met an 88 year old man who has lived in the same house all his life and has never left the area.  He was taken off the register.  He cycled to vote but when he arrived at the polling station he discovered he was not on the register.  There should have been something in place for that man.  The people at the polling station knew in their hearts and souls he had not come from somewhere else.  I have heard a lot about regulations and rules from the people sitting behind me.  We must have regulations but some of them are a bit over the top.  When a child is born, he or she gets a PPS number, and when they reach 18 years of age, the State stops their children's allowance.  It should be compulsory for everyone to vote.  It would wake people up a bit if it were introduced.</p> <p>  The changes introduced by the boundary commission in Cavan mean 13,000 voters in west Cavan have been put into a constituency with Sligo and Leitrim, as were 8,000 voters in Donegal.  Did whoever came up with that idea really put any thought into what they were doing?  My municipal area has been divided in two.  Part of it is in Sligo-Leitrim and the other is in Cavan-Monaghan.  It is ridiculous.  Who picks the people on the boundary committee who introduce these rules?  I speak to people, and other councillors here deal with the same issues every day.  People at the top do not think of those who understand what is happening at the bottom.  The people who deal with this every day of the week should be listened to more.</p></speech>

I hesitate to say this, but Mr. Donnelly makes a very strong case for being in charge of the electoral commission with his passion for the subject and his breadth of knowledge.  What is the opinion of the Data Protection Commissioner and Department of Social Protection on Mr. Donnelly's suggestion that the CSO has the knowledge and expertise to be able to bring it about?  I will be heretical and state I agree with Mr. Donnelly that we should have electronic voting.  If we were to have it, there should also be a paper vote, so if there were ever a contest on whether the electronic result was correct the paper vote could be also examined.  I am not a statistical expert, but I understand electronic voting would be more accurate in determining a seat being decided by three or four votes.  We should strongly pass on the message that it would be very useful if the census age division went from zero to 18 years as opposed to zero to 19 years.  This would be useful with regard to drawing up an electoral register.  What do the witnesses think of the idea of the electoral commission looking after the boundary commission?  I ask this because of the points made by Mr. McVitty.  The constituency to which he referred is the ideal example of something being put forward which a person of any political hue would not have put together.  There ought to be a political input to the electoral commission, perhaps from retired politicians or people with in-depth political knowledge and expertise who will act independently.  How can we best arrive at this without it being politically partisan?</p></speech>

Ten years ago I was in a football dressing room.  I was not playing, but a man who was boasted that he and his wife had spent the entire day in Northern Ireland and that he had voted 11 times.  I took note of what he said but I did not pass any comment.  The next local elections, in which I was involved, were held in June 2009.  I decided to check on my friend who had spent the day voting in Northern Ireland.  Lo and behold he was on the register six times at six different polling stations in the one county.  Someone spoke about councillors having local knowledge.  This actually happened to me.  I asked the rate collector responsible for compiling the late additions to the register whether this was a small man or a big man with curly hair and it was the man.  Two of the polling stations were across the road from each other.  This is a problem and it must be identified.  We must ensure it does not happen again.  I believe it does happen.  I will not go so far as to say it happens mainly in Border counties where people may have come from or gone to the North, but it does happen.</p><p>I suspect there were four or five people in the car that went north that day but I cannot guarantee it.<br/><br/>Let me draw attention to another issue involving local knowledge.  The Chairman will be aware of it.  People who had emigrated to England, the United States and other parts of the world were still on our local registers.  I ensured that they were removed from them.  They were on the register so that they could vote in an election if it was held when they were home for summer holidays, for example.  If we do not keep our registers up to date, we cannot have an accurate reflection of the percentage return.  How do we overcome the problems?  There are people who have died but who are still on the register.  In some instances, their voting cards may be used by somebody else.  I feel strongly about this issue.  There must be some way of identifying those who need to be removed from the register.<br/><br/>I took my wife with me for the day to the west of Ireland.  When having lunch in a hotel, she asked me who knew we were there on that day and whom I had told we were going.  I told her I had told nobody.  My wife said she had asked the reception whether Terry Brennan had received a telephone call and was told that I had and that I had taken it.  I had taken no call.  However, I discovered there was another Terry Brennan in the hotel on the same day.  We must ensure there is proper identification.  It could be a PPS number.  Councillor McVitty mentioned the concept of people having a PPS number from when they are born.  This obviously does not apply to people born in Northern Ireland and living in the South, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Could we have co-operation between North and South to ensure no problems arise?  I believe what I have described has happened and will continue to happen if there is no proper identification system.  If one is voting electronically and keys in a voting card number, such as 456, and that number is registered, one cannot or should not be able to go to another polling station and enter that number.<br/><br/>There are people who boasted to me that they have never voted and never will, yet they are still on the register.  There should be some way of removing people from the register if they do not vote in two successive elections.  I believe Councillor McVitty mentioned compulsory voting.  It is a great idea.  People are killing one another in foreign lands for the right to have a say.  One should relinquish that responsibility if one does not exercise one's democratic right.</p></speech>

Very few in this room, despite taking pride in their knowledge of elections and statistics, could beat the Chairman in this regard.  I believe I lost a bet with him on one occasion; perhaps I never paid him.  I commend him on his knowledge.</p> <p>  I apologise as I was not able to be here for the earlier contributions.  I was representing my electorate with a Minister as part of a delegation.  I have a number of points.  This is our fourth or fifth day listening to submissions on the electoral commission.  The PPS issue has arisen on every occasion.  I lay down a challenge for the IALG.  Representatives of the CCMA were before us.  It is now within the ability of the IALG and CCMA, armed with the knowledge we have and the information imparted to us on the making available of PPS data to local authorities, to fix the issue once and for all.  It is a big challenge but I put it to the delegates.  I would like to hear their response.</p> <p>  Councillor McVitty told a story about an 88 year old.  I encountered a similar case with a 90 year old in the 2011 election.  He is now deceased.  I knocked on the man's door only to discover he had been taken off the register although he had lived in the same house for 49 years as a council tenant.  That was appalling.  It is down to people like ourselves in the system to solve this.  There is a solution and I would like the delegates' response on that.</p> <p>  With respect to the eminent speaker who referred to centralising the franchise, I totally disagree.  We have seen too many services centralised in this country.  I would probably need two hands to count them.  In every case, a mess has been made.  The solution is not to centralise but to get to the nub of the problem.  The nub of the problem is that nobody is grasping the problem in his hand and dealing with it.  That is what we need to see and that is why I am laying down the challenge.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by opinion polls at times.  I take a steer from the Chairman because I have won a lot of money over the years based on his predictions, particularly on the Seanad referendum.  I do not mind saying that we lumped the money on when we saw the ridiculous opinion polls based on knocking on doors that I had knocked on throughout Tipperary for two or three months.  The opinion being obtained from those who were committed to going out to vote was that they were going to vote "No" to the abolition of the Seanad.  The best opinion poll is one that one produces on one's own patch.</p> <p>  I get a little annoyed when opinion polls carried out at national level make downward extrapolations and give results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.  The power bases for elected people are different in every constituency.  Therefore, they should all be taken with a health warning.  I do not agree that they should be banned a week or any other time before an election.  They should be available right up to polling day, because I do believe they contribute.  I accept the comment that polls did affect trends before polling day and that voters are allowed to change their views.</p> <p>  On the Boundary Commission, there are now new proposals for the changing of boundaries in Waterford, Drogheda, Laois, Carlow and perhaps one other location.  I guarantee that if Councillor McVitty checked who made the changes regarding Leitrim and Donegal, and all the other cracked ideas, he will find there was no retired, experienced politician on the boundary commission.  I disregard the comments that retired politicians should not be on any commission, including the electoral commission.  Nobody has more knowledge of the system than those who are practised in it, in some cases for 20 or 30 years, and who have voluntarily retired.  As stated earlier, their experience is cast aside in favour of the retired judge.</p> <p>  I would like a response on the various issues I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1195" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#N00300"><p>I am sorry I had to leave the committee briefly.  I would have liked to hear everything the delegates had to say.  I wish to raise a few issues.  There has been a significant concentration on the electoral register.  Unlike some of the previous speakers, who are concerned that people could have nine votes, I am trying to get votes for the people I represent, because one in four people in my constituency, Dublin West, are from outside Ireland.  In the most recent referendum, young people did not have to be persuaded to vote when they had something to vote for that they cared about.</p><p>Many European people who are married to Irish people and who have been living here for a long time had no vote in the referendum, although they would have liked to have a vote and should have had one.  I am more concerned about that than I am about citizens abroad.  In my area, the big problem is getting people on the register rather than getting them off it.  </p><p> The D&aacute;il and local authorities are not representative of the population.  They are too old, too male and too pale.  They certainly will not be helped if we have a register that does not reflect the reality of the changing Ireland.  According to the National Youth Council of Ireland, 30% of 18 to 24 year olds are not registered.  I believe the Union of Students in Ireland, which was before the committee last week, conducted a massive mass registration of young people for the referendum.  These are serious issues that need to be looked at by the electoral commission.  I do not know if our speakers have considered this but, as a result of the housing crisis - because the Government, in the main, is not building local authority houses - and homelessness, every time a person moves, he or she must go to the Garda station and get re-registered.  I faced this issue last year.  A range of people in my constituency are homeless or have had to move because of rent increases.  The rental sector makes up a massive proportion of the population.  It is about 700,000 people.  The electoral register is a significant issue.  </p><p> We probably need an electoral commission for a longer period, because these issues will not be resolved if local authorities are working at different levels.  I have some fears.  Creating super-quangos is a problem.  I would not like to see staff in local authorities losing their jobs, because they are generally decent jobs and there are few enough of those.  Local authorities are being divested of all their responsibilities, from bin collection to water.  There are no houses.  I do not know what councillors actually do but I would not like to see councils losing more staff.  I think that is a role that should be maintained.</p><p> We have spoken previously at the committee about judges and male academics.  It does not have to be a retired judge who heads this up.</p><p> With regard to PPS numbers, I read what the Data Protection Commissioner had to say.  Could the witnesses comment on how this could help?  Without permanent storage, is there a way this can work?  There is massive paranoia in society about PPS numbers, as we saw recently in respect of Irish Water.  Once you mention PPS numbers, people go into freefall about it because of their distrust of the Government and the establishment.  If this was implemented without proper safeguards, people would be very concerned about it.  How could it be done?</p><p> It is ludicrous that so many young people are not registered when this could be done automatically upon reaching the age of 18.  There are many people who become Irish citizens.  I have attended ceremonies because I know a lot of people who have gone through the process.  They should be handed a form to register that day.  Instead, they do not even realise that they must upgrade their vote from local to general elections.  They just think, "Oh, I'm an Irish citizen," but they are not on the register.  Going around my area, I find it ludicrous.  In one area, 51% of people are not Irish.  You might as well throw the register out the window.</p><p> Registration of political parties is another thing that is listed as a possible function of the electoral commission.  It should be easier for people to designate themselves in a certain way for the purpose of standing for election without necessarily having to establish a political party.  In other countries, there are alliances of people for the purpose of elections.  Otherwise, a person is designated as non-party.  This is something that should be looked at, although I suspect it will not be looked at because it suits the current system to have two big parties and few small parties, although some of the big parties are becoming smaller and will continue to do so.  It is linked to political reform.  There is a list system in other countries.  People can go on a list to stand for election.  Being designated as non-party automatically deprives a person of identity, and this should be examined, because politics is changing in this country and people are more willing to look for alternative formations.</p></speech>

We have discussed this matter for a few days.  We have a lot of experts before us today who have been dealing with the organisation of elections for years.  Dr. Kavanagh and Mr. Donnelly have done <i>pro rata</i>work for this State.  When the State needs to be told what it should do regarding central registration and data collection, electronic organisation and anything that needs to be known, where does it go?  It does not go to a State organ or body.  It goes to either Mr. Donnelly or Dr. Kavanagh for central analysis.  I am not saying they should be done out of a job, but this job should be incorporated into the electoral commission, because there is a body of knowledge there, going back to 1991 in the case of Mr. Donnelly and his first book.  You do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  I am all for setting up an electoral commission, but we need to take note of what is there.</p><p>There is a body of knowledge in local authorities.  When rates were being collected and rate collectors visited every house, it was easy for them to know what was happening.  Local councillors have a body of knowledge.  They know who lives in the houses.  We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater in this respect either.  We need local expertise and knowledge.  We need central registration and collection of data to enable everybody throughout the country to have a central means of access.  In Mr. Donnelly's submission, I saw that when he went looking for information he had to go to every local authority, and they all had different answers.  Eventually, he had to put it in writing and give reasons why he wanted it.Local authorities have the information but each one has it in its own database.  Centralising the information for people who want to carry out central data processing is very important.  The electoral commission could make use of that.  In setting up anything, one needs to look at the expertise in local authorities.  </p><p>There is considerable criticism of the electoral register.  Every Senator and Deputy here has spoken about people who are on and off the register.  I know Senator Brennan spoke about somebody who voted nine times.  All of this can and will be corrected at a central level.  If a person moves out of one local authority area, he or she is not required to de-register.  A central database would correct that, because the computers would be talking to each other.</p><p>I am sorry for concentrating on Mr. Donnelly.  I do so because he has so much expertise.  One point that was made in his submission was that it was not electronic voting that was wrong but the actual process of counting.  There was nothing wrong with the system of voting.  Mr. Donnelly made the point that if it had been done centrally it would not have happened, because they were all doing their own thing at a particular time.  Manual voting is not perfect either.  It is not the case that everything manual is correct and everything electronic is wrong.  IT is brilliant for this type of thing.  Again, Mr. Donnelly said that he had never seen a recount come up with the same count twice.  If we keep this in mind, we will not be frightened away from doing things electronically.  We should not be afraid just because it failed us once.  It was made into a political football in the past.</p><p>I was here for the presentation by the Data Protection Commissioner on PPS numbers.  I can see why people would be afraid of using PPS numbers.  Any European country with electronic voting has a central identifier.  We do not have that in Ireland.  It is only in the past couple of years that all Departments have begun talking to each other on computers.</p><p>I cannot remember who made it, but one of the recommendations was that the registration of electors should be contracted out to the Central Statistics Office.  Why would a body be set up if its function is to be contracted out?  That is passing it on.  The knowledge and expertise in local councils should be used.  That information should be collated.  It was not possible to do that in the past, but it is possible now with computers, and it would not involve transferring information every four hours onto floppy discs; that is done automatically.  It is not that the function should be removed from the local authorities and given to another body.  We can ensure that everyone works together to do it properly.  There are problems with the process.  At the last meeting, criticism was expressed of the fact that councils no longer check the number of people living in a house.  I live in Dublin, and last week I had a visit from someone in South Dublin County Council checking on the number of people who live in my house.  They were doing a check.  Councils do those checks, but we have had too many experiences of people being crossed off the register if they did not return the form or whatever.  I have heard many Senators and TDs mention that.</p><p> I am sorry I was not here for the entire presentation.  I thank the people who have done what we should have been doing nationally for years.  I am sorry I missed their contribution, but it is available online, as well as that of Mr. Liam Kenny.</p></speech>

However, we must also consider that we will never have the optimum position, which is that everybody who should be on the electoral register is on it.  There are two parts to that, the first of which is trying to get people to register, which has been debated.  The second part is that, as Councillor McVitty stated, there will be occasions on which the names of people who have been on the register for 40 or 45 years are removed.  There should be accountability for that, as there is in every other area.  We are sitting here recounting such stories.  There should be a paper trail in terms of the reason someone's name was removed.  The county registrar has a role, and people's absence can be notified after deaths and so on, but if a person is looking to vote, some evidence should be provided as to the reason their name was removed.  When elected representatives, for example, find that out that someone has been removed from the register, it would be worthwhile for them to follow up on that to determine the reason.  If there was not a valid reason for removing the person's name, somebody should be held accountable.  Otherwise, it will continue to happen.  The evidence that might have to be produced to show why a person has been removed from the register could vary.  I have encountered cases in which the name of a person who had lived in an area all of his or her life was removed from the register.  Somebody should be accountable for that if we are serious about doing our business.</p><p>I agree that we should cater for people from European Union countries who live here and may have married here but who will never get to vote in referendums or general elections.  Those people are <i>de facto</i>citizens of the country.  Alternatively, we could have a simpler process whereby people from EU countries who have lived here for a certain length of time can become citizens.  It would not be as expensive to provide for that.</p><p>I have not asked any questions but I would make the point that we are not a nanny state.  Every time we start moving in this direction we say we will look after this, that and the other area.  That is unachievable.  I would like to see more of an emphasis on people who want to participate in the democratic process, and that begins at a younger age.  We never get a full turnout in elections in terms of the numbers on the register, even allowing for errors.  Many people are not interested in voting.  I agree with Deputy Coppinger that people vote when they are interested in the outcome and, in fairness, some of the issues are not as exciting as the marriage equality referendum, but it is necessary and it is part of our democracy.  It is important that people participate.  We should have that conversation.  Democracy can be laborious.  There is an idea that it is all about those types of conversation, even the conversations we are having now.  We might try to glamorise the process on occasion when we are trying to get votes, but we might engender that idea when young people are in secondary school, and not just expect them to register and vote when they become of age.  There are young people of 16 who are fit to vote but there are people of 21 who will never want to vote.  That is not the issue.  It is about instilling in people the idea of citizenship, and part of being Irish and participating in the democratic process is using one's vote and making the best decision possible.  We must also engender the idea that my vote is equal to that of the President or the man living down the street.</p></speech>

Thank you for that insightful comment.  We will now hear closing comments.  Many of the points have been made well over the past six weeks.  We are rehashing many of the topics, and the questions, raised with witnesses over that six-week period.  I ask the witnesses to reflect on some of those if they wish to make closing comments.  We are a little caught for time.  I will call Dr. Adrian Kavanagh, who will be followed by Mr. Se&aacute;n Donnelly, the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government and, if they wish, the Data Protection Commissioner and the representatives from the Department of Social Protection.  I ask Dr. Kavanagh to be brief.</p></speech>

In response to the points made by Deputy Dowds and Senator Landy on political input, the point I was trying to make in my initial submission was on the idea of having a political advisory committee.  I agree that politicians, party workers and people working in political organisations know a great deal about politics.  They know about aspects of politics that academics do not have a clue about, so expertise is needed.  The suggestion I tried to make in my submission is that the best way to do that would be to have an advisory committee made up of former politicians, current TDs, Senators, councillors, members of party headquarters and party workers.  It would have to be a good mix representing all parties, groupings and alliances that was balanced in terms of gender, age and area.  That would be my argument.</p> <p>  On the register, my sense is that the PPS number is the best way to go about it.  Looking at what they do in the United Kingdom, there is scope to use online registration, not just to register people but to facilitate people who are moving house.  It may need to be centralised.  Eircodes could help the process even more because now one can type in one's name, PPS number and Eircode and that will show the holding district and the county one should be in, but we still need the locally based councillor.  As Deputy Mulherin and others stated, we need to prevent people from being accidentally removed from the register.  That can happen where people get into a moral panic about the registers being in a mess and the need for them to be cleaned up.  As we have seen in the past, many people, usually older people, can be taken off the register because they did not complete forms or they were unable to check their registration online.</p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger made a good point about not having a committee made up of male judges or male academics.  I would argue that some female academics would be excellent members of a commission.  Dr. Theresa Reidy has spoken here, and there are a few others.  We have to move away from the idea that every commission has to have a High Court judge or other such person.  We do need expertise, but other voices are necessary also.</p> <p>  The idea of removing people from the register if they do not vote in two elections is bad politics.  The danger is that after a while there might not be many people left on the register.  Who should be removed?  It might be younger voters or, in the case of a low turnout, people from disadvantaged areas.  I do not like that idea.</p> <p>  I understand the point about compulsory voting.  My argument is that we should only consider compulsory voting when the electoral system has been cleaned up.  Otherwise, we have no right to talk about compulsory voting.  If we had compulsory voting, people would have to have the right to choose "none of the above" when it comes to voting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Donnelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015071400002#P01300"><p>I will make some general points.  I believe an electoral commission should be set up, and it could be done fairly quickly once the staffing and so on is in place.</p><p>The very first thing to do is to get a decent website up and running.  One can do a lot of the stuff that should be transparent in Irish politics.  I refer to historical data on elections and other such information.  Irish politics is full of myths.  The register came up as an issue a few years ago when a by-election turnout was dreadful.  People panicked and said the turnout was dropping and people were losing interest in politics, which never happened in this country before, and all of that nonsense.  The obvious thing was that the electoral register was getting out of control.  People now have much more mobility.  People who were born in Donegal had a vote there, but if they went to UCG they had a vote there and if they were working in Dublin they had a vote there.  They voted once, which meant there was 100% turnout, but because they were on the register three times it was considered to be a 33% turnout.  That has been the problem.  The solution was to check the register.  I remember thinking it would be great because I would see every register, but the way the website works is that one puts a name in and one is told whether that name is on the register.  Big deal.  That is the most ridiculous thing ever.  It is nonsense.  We were not serious about that.</p><p> It is obvious from the hearings that the biggest item is the electoral register.  It is a huge issue.  If one considers the number of times it has been mentioned at the meetings, one can see it is way ahead of anything else.  It is obviously very important and it must be treated with the utmost respect.  Deputy Coppinger referred to getting people on the register and removing duplication.  That is extremely important.  It is not good enough in this day and age if we are making decisions based on inaccurate facts in terms of turnout and such issues.  We must have transparency.  We must have all of the figures available to us.</p><p> I remember some crowd did a survey in this country a few years ago and reported it to be one of the most corrupt countries.  I wondered what they were talking about.  They quoted certain figures.  A couple of weeks later they withdrew the statement because it was based on inaccurate facts and they did not stand up when challenged.</p><p> It has been said that transfers decide who gets elected.  Transfers do not decide elections.  The first preference vote mostly decides elections.  It is only in 10% of the seats that the transfers play a big part.  There is all this mythology about elections and the fact that the turnout is dropping.  We must get real.  The hearings have shown how important the register of electors is.  It is definitely not good enough at the moment.  It does not work and it is giving us the wrong facts and figures.  I accept there are problems with PPS numbers.  I do not mind what way they do it.</p><p> The census is a system that works.  It is carried out by the Central Statistics Office.  It works because it is done by a central body.  It deals with a population in this country of 4,588,252.  We are a small country.  Could one imagine us doing the census through the county councils and then have someone adding the numbers up at the end?  It would not work.  A centralised approach works.  One would break it down into the electoral districts.  The way the Revenue Commissioners probably works is that it does not check everybody&rsquo;s VAT; it carries out random sampling or has another way of doing it.  That will work.  We know that the census has worked.</p></speech>

Gay Mitchell did a quiz book of Irish politics in 1990 and he did a follow-up in 1994.  One of the first questions in the 1994 publication was "What is psephology?".  His explanation was that it was the sociological and statistical analysis of election counts and trends.  In my experience there is only one person who has referenced most elections in recent years in this country and that is Se&aacute;n Donnelly.

The thing about electronic voting is that one gets far better and more accurate results out of it.  The issue is transfers, even though I derided them a few minutes ago.  If one has transfers after the first count, an electronic system only uses the first batch of papers on the system.  I use it in opinion polling and it has worked for me over the past 15 years.  It goes through every vote and every paper and does it in percentages, so it is a much purer form.  That is important when one is down to small margins involving between one and three votes.  That is why electronic voting is much more dependable and accurate and one gets a lot more out of it.</p></speech>

There was much talk about electronic voting, but unless the State can show that it can get various websites working right and IT systems in different agencies, people just will not trust electronic voting.  It is as simple as that.  Mr. Donnelly touched on the point when he referred to <i>checktheregister.ie</i>.  If there is one thing that is in a worse state than the register, it is the <i>checktheregister.ie</i>website.  That is a fact.  Young people nowadays want information at their fingertips, at a couple of clicks of a button.  One has various websites and census results going back to the late 1800s, and one can find out what house and what street one&rsquo;s great great grandfather lived in, but when one goes onto <i>checktheregister.ie</i>one cannot even find one&rsquo;s own house on it.<br/><br/>Local authorities need to do a lot of simple things.  For example, when a local authority house is allocated, that person should immediately be placed on the register.  It is as simple as that.  The supplementary register should also be open longer for additions.  It is closed too early prior to polling day.  If one is out canvassing and one meets someone six weeks prior to an election and they are not on the register, one can get them onto the register, but if one meets a person four or five days beforehand it is too late.  If one had met them the previous week it would have been possible.  We need to consider such issues and keep the supplementary register open that bit longer.<br/><br/>Quite a lot of people do not want to go on the register.  That will have to be dealt with.  Whatever about compulsory voting, everybody has an address or a place where they reside and perhaps one should at least have compulsory registration.  There are a number of reasons people do not want to go on the register.  They may not want their domestic situation, for example, being brought to the attention of the authorities.  That is something we need to deal with as well.  It is not a simple or a black-and-white issue.  There is much food for thought there.</p></speech>

Will he take on the issue with the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, in terms of what I said about PPS numbers?  Will he engage with the CCMA to see if a solution could be found?  The ball is in the court of the local authorities.  They are the critical people in the equation.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, it is worth remembering that the PPS number has been established as the unique personal identifier for engaging in transactions with the public service and, consequently, that is the context in which it should be considered.  After all, it is the outcome of an Act of Parliament for that very specific purpose.</p> <p>  In addition, serious consideration should be given to the fact that beyond the PPS number there is the public service identity dataset, which has very valuable information in it that could be of pertinence to an electoral register and the maintenance of it, such as people's nationalities, dates of birth and other information of that nature.  The whole idea of people going onto the register automatically on reaching 18 years of age could be fashioned out of that dataset and its leveraging.</p> <p>  A number of contributors mentioned changes of address, people emigrating and such issues that arise for the register.  In reality, none of the identity infrastructure that is currently in place will adequately deal with that.  What happens in other countries is they maintain population registers, and if we are serious about dealing with continual changing of address and people leaving the country then the only way to deal with that is through a legislative population register, as exists in central European countries in particular.</p></speech>

For example, data matching in relation to the existing register could be provided for by matching up against a consolidated Department of Social Protection website.  When this was done in the UK, 66% of the entries on the register were validated automatically through data matching without the need for people to provide additional or personal information.  Only the 34% that could not be matched then had to provide additional identity information.  That is one solution that could be examined in the first instance.  If the use of PPS numbers is legislated for - it may well be a viable solution in some of the issues that have been identified - we need to be clear that it does resolve the issues and that it does not create further issues.  We need to be sure it does not create a chilling effect in terms of those seeking to register to vote.  Deputy Coppinger mentioned some of the sensitivities we have seen around the use of PPS numbers.  All of those could be mitigated.</p><p>If it is a good idea to use PPS numbers, a proper privacy impact assessment, which includes public consultation, to identify what the sensitivities are and explain why it has been proposed as a solution, will mitigate those risks.</p></speech>

As the Chairman noted, I am joined this morning by my colleague, Avril McMonagle, who herself is one of six regional manager representatives of our national network of the 30 city and county child care committees.  We welcome the opportunity to bring forward our views on some of the challenges of the early years sector and, in particular, bring a local perspective, given our local and county delivery structure.  The 30 city and county child committees operate across the country and were established in 2001 to advance the provision of child care facilities in their local areas.  City and county child committees, CCCs, offer a wide variety of services locally to early years services, childminders, after-school services and parents.  The 30 city and county child care committees operate in each of the local authority administrative areas and are governed by a voluntary board of management.  This board includes representatives from the early years sector and agencies within that area, including local authorities, State agencies, local development companies and voluntary child care organisations.</p> <p>  The functions and roles of the committees are aligned to support the implementation of national policy at a local level.  In addition, we play a key co-ordinating role and are actively involved in various co-ordinating bodies to support the delivery of supports to children and families.  This includes children and young people services committees, as well as local community development committees.  As the established local delivery structure for the early years, CCCs play a crucial role in supporting the development of the early years sector in each county, responding to local needs and implementing comprehensive support plans to address these needs.  This has been for a core function of the CCCs since their establishment.  Over the past 15 years, the CCCs have been at the centre of these supports and development within the sector.</p> <p>  Such development goes back as far as 2000 and over the decade 2002-2010, the State itself, initially in partnership with the European Union, invested more than &euro;425 million in capital funding to create child care places throughout Ireland.  That was probably the start of the major investment programme in Ireland for the early years sector.  From 2006 to 2010, we had a follow-on programme, the national child care investment programme, NCIP, which was the State's vehicle for wider investment in the sector and, as I stated, the NCIP succeeded and built upon the programme known as the equal opportunities child care programme, which was the initial programme put in place between 2000 and 2006.  I refer to these programmes because it is important to see the context for the funding and in the first instance, they provided capital funding, staffing grants and quality programmes.  The programmes aimed to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services, which are planned and developed locally and centred on the needs of the child and the family.  Over that period, the CCCs, working with the sector, put in place 65,000 child care places in the early childhood sector.</p> <p>  Since then, the role of the CCCs has expanded to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs.  More recently, CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing administrative processes associated with the various national funded programmes.  The recognition and value of their work are evaluated on a yearly basis and the most recently published report completed nationally showed that 95% of services report a high satisfaction rating in respect of the support provided to them by the CCCs.  The value of a local delivery agent working with the sector is an important building block for the sector and remains so.  Indeed, the efficiency and value for money delivered by this structure shows that of the approximately &euro;260 million invested in the sector, currently the CCCs account for 4% of this budget and for this, a national delivery structure is in place across all counties in Ireland.  The CCCs remain focused on responding to the local need but, equally, very responsive to the implementation of a range of national programmes on a consistent basis.  For example, we have assumed responsibility from Tusla for the roll-out of the Always Children First child protection training for early years settings and childminders with the stated aim of ensuring that staff members from every service throughout the country receive accredited child protection training.  The roll-out of this training is co-ordinated at local and county level by CCCs.</p><p>To date, more than 3,605 services have accessed that training, with more than 6,459 practitioners receiving that training.  This approach has been strengthened by our national network, which we are representing.  This national network provides a coherent structure for various bodies, in particular, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to plan and implement its policy brief.  CCI, as the national network, works closely with a range of stakeholders to ensure we put in place strong, effective systems with our partners.  These include Pobal, the National Early Years Quality Development Service also known as Better Start, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Social Protection and Tusla.</p><p> It is important to recognise that the early years sector and, in particular, the role of the State within it, is still relatively new in Ireland.  The primary school education system has been in place since the State was established and dates back to 1931 while free post-primary education has been in existence since 1966.  The early years sector in Ireland is still in the early stages of development with the introduction of the free preschool year in 2009.  This was an important milestone and an important step in the provision of universal early childhood care and education.  It is important to recognise that was the first universally recognised programme the State had put in place.  Prior to that, there was no universal provision.  It is, therefore, still early in terms of the State's role.  </p><p> The introduction of the free preschool year has brought with it significant changes which the sector has adopted and worked with.  Committee members will be aware of these, with some having been elaborated on in previous presentations.  However, we would like to give an overview of some of these challenges and how they can be addressed.  My colleague, Ms McMonagle, will elaborate on them, particular policy issues in which we are engaged, and the future support priorities the sector requires.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.352" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Avril McMonagle" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071400002#D00200"><p>The introduction of the free preschool year in 2009-2010 marked a turning point, not only for the early childhood sector but also in the work of city and county child care committees.  As my colleague highlighted, this sees us increasingly dedicated to managing administrative processes associated with five core child care funding programmes and grant initiatives.  Since its introduction last year, child care committees have supported more than 4,500 early years services to access and administer their compliance requirements via the Department's new online system.  We are currently administrating almost &euro;3 million of grant funding through the learner fund to 2,860 members of the workforce who are upskilling as part of this initiative.  The transition from supporting not only early childhood services but also parents alongside the administration of child care funding programmes has been a challenge for county child care committees, especially in the context of a reduction in overall funding by 20% over the same period.  The challenges faced by the early childhood sector are constant and have been well communicated to the committee by previous contributors.</p> <p>  However, as a collective of organisations that exclusively has direct reach into all 4,500 early childhood services nationally, we would like to share our perspective on how these challenges manifest at local level and their correlation with, and repercussions for, our work.  The introduction of the various child care funding programmes, while overall a welcome development, have brought an element of challenge and change that early childhood services were never established to cope with.  Prior to the introduction of the child care funding programmes, the only engagement early childhood services had was with the then HSE inspectorate.  Currently, compliance validation involves Pobal, Tusla and NERA and the forthcoming education-focused inspections will result in the Department of Education and Skills staff visiting services for the first time.</p> <p>  Imminent changes to company law and voluntary sector governance will also increase pressure points for the sector.  Each policy change or new initiative has a direct correlation with an increase in demand for local support, much of which is individual and on a one-to-one basis.  Many of these supports are difficult to measure in our performance reports and their specialised and individual nature makes them extremely resource intensive from our perspective.</p> <p>  Child care committees have played a fundamental role in quality development over the years.  The initial phase of this work was under a quality sub-measure of the equal opportunities child care programme and saw us address quality at its most basic level.  In those days, training and continuing professional development comprised supporting services to develop policies and procedures, good work practice, child protection and health and safety measures.  The early childhood sector was starting from a low base at that time and the fundamentals had to be put in place first.</p><p>In recent years, this work has included the delivery of continual professional development and training on Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework, supporting the implementation of S&iacute;olta quality standards and on-site professional development support, advice and guidance at local level.  For city and county child care committees, the notion of quality standards goes far beyond early childhood practice standards alone.  While they are a core element of our work, we take a much more multidimensional view of the fundamentals that must be in place before quality for children is realised.  By way of example, we face an ever-increasing demand for financial advice and individualised plans for service sustainability.  Often, we help to create detailed financial projections to determine whether a service is sustainable from year to year.  Fluctuations in child enrolments in a given year have the potential to close a service in a very short space of time.  Challenges regarding human resource management and supports and employer-employee conflict resolution are ever-present.  High staff turnover in services, unsatisfactory working conditions and low pay collectively cause workforce stress, which can manifest as conflict situations.  Child care committees undertake a mediation role in these cases as much as possible, and it is an extremely resource-intensive element of our work.</p><p> Corporate governance, compliance with regulation and effective management are noteworthy stress points for early childhood services.  The company limited by guarantee model, while important for transparency and protection, places an onerous burden on community and voluntary child care services in particular.  We are facing a crisis whereby it is becoming impossible to attract volunteers to participate on voluntary management committees in community child care services.  This presents a huge threat to the continuance of community child care services in Ireland, and alternative models need to be considered and provided for with regard to administration funding.</p><p> All child care committees report high levels of engagement with parents and early childhood services in trying to provide support for children with special educational needs to participate in mainstream preschool education.  A properly resourced framework of supports co-ordinated at local level through the child care committees is urgently required to provide equality of participation for all children.  This area warrants immediate attention and is placing untold stress on parents and child care providers.</p><p> As highlighted, the fundamental strengths of the city and county child care committee structure include not only our local response and national reach but also our ability to be flexible in responding to policy change and development.  We have responded to recent unplanned developments, such as the introduction of the learner fund and the introduction of the programme implementation platform, in an efficient and timely manner.  The child care committees have a unique ability to monitor, collect and collate national data, making us a valuable support, implementation and delivery mechanism.</p><p> We are fully aware of the many competing priorities for funding.  We hope we have provided a perspective that identifies particular pressure points which pose significant risk to the future of the early childhood sector and the crucial nature of localised and responsive supports in alleviating these.  In trying to make savings, we caution against streamlining the city and county child care support structure to office-based administration duties only.  The committees need to be sufficiently resourced to continue to act as a local one-stop shop for early childhood services and parents seeking support with child care funding schemes, quality development, HR, governance, financial sustainability and continuing professional development.  This will enable us to respond to current and future challenges and support this fledgling sector in the next stage of its development.  We thank committee members for their attention and welcome any questions they may have.</p></speech>

PL&Eacute; represents 18 higher education institutions offering 27 early childhood education and care degree programmes.</p><p>The association advocates on behalf of approximately 5,500 early childhood education and care degree level students and graduates in Ireland.</p><p> The issues of affordability, quality and supply in the early childhood sector have dominated political debate for quite a long time.  As we all know, affordability is particularly problematic and I welcome the opportunity to explain why the cost of child care in Ireland is frequently referred to as a second mortgage.  It is now widely recognised that Irish parents pay the highest child care costs in Europe.  Typically, parents in Ireland pay 35% of net income, and for lone parents the figure is closer to 40% of net income.  Throughout OECD countries, the average cost of child care is between 10% and 13% of net income.</p><p> In spite of the high cost to parents in Ireland, the quality of provision is diverse and sporadic, and those working in the sector are underpaid and undervalued.  I will address the issue of training, qualifications and remuneration, all of which are necessary components in the provision of high quality education and care to young children from birth to school age.  To do this, I will use three perspectives, namely, historical Government investment, the skills and competencies required by our educators, and the settings' perspective and their challenges.</p><p> Since the inception of the Child Care Act 1991, myriad policies and initiatives have been developed, culminating in two practice frameworks, namely, S&iacute;olta and Aistear, to support and enhance the quality of early childhood provision.  In addition to this, the State invested &euro;1.139 billion in the period from 2000 to 2010 in the development of a child care infrastructure, primarily in the creation of child care places.  This investment, however, was a supply side measure driven by the need to capitalise child care places for children working parents, and over the decade many commentators have pointed out that the much needed parallel investment in staffing did not occur.</p><p> In the aftermath of the RTE "Prime Time" expos&eacute; in 2013 of bad practice in some early childhood settings, the then Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, acknowledged there had been a wholly inadequate approach to quality sustainability.  The sector has, in effect, been provided with extremely limited funding for developing staff quality, that is, high-level training and commensurate pay levels, with the Government investing just 0.2% of GDP.  In 2008, UNICEF recommended this figure should be 0.7% and the OECD has repeatedly recommended that it should be 1%.  As a result, many early childhood educators are ill-equipped to engage with initiatives such as the two quality frameworks, S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which are the pillars of quality in child care in Ireland.  They leave little doubt the education and care of young children is highly skilled and complex.  Regardless of the complexity of educating and caring for young children, the need for staff qualifications has for too long been overshadowed by the rush to create child care places.</p><p> Although definitions of quality vary, it is recognised that the ability of educators to care for, nurture and teach young children is strongly influenced by their level of education and training, their work environment, salary and work benefits as well as their experience in the field.  The need for appropriate training and qualifications is finally being recognised in Ireland, as evidenced by the recent introduction of a mandatory minimum training requirement for all staff working in the early childhood sector.  Settings engaging in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme have also been incentivised to employ early childhood graduates.  While these requirements are positive steps in the right direction, PL&Eacute; believes that on their own they are insufficient to address the many issues endemic in the sector.</p><p> I wish to draw the committee's attention to the model framework for education, training and professional development which was developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002.  This framework identified five occupational profiles which have since been validated against a national framework of qualifications and the practice frameworks, S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  Committee members will have seen table one, which I submitted.  This provides an overview of the matches decided relating to the occupational profiles and National Framework of Qualification, NFQ, levels as well as the attributes, skills, processes and accountability identified for each level in the model framework.</p><p> It is worrying that in 2013 Pobal reported that only 12.8% of educators working in the sector in Ireland holds a degree at level 7 or 8 in early childhood education and care.</p><p>Addressing the annual Maynooth university education forum on the theme of educational disadvantage recently, Professor Kathy Sylva asserted that a characteristic of a high-quality preschool was having &quot;teachers&quot;, her word, trained to degree standard, which in Ireland is a level 8 qualification.  Ireland does not have a vision or a target for the number of graduates who should work in the early childhood sector, and the present 12.8% reported by Pobal is far below the EU 2011 recommendation that at least 20% of the workforce be trained to degree level.<br/><br/>Currently, of the 25,000-strong early childhood workforce in Ireland, only 3,200 educators are working at advanced or expert practitioner level as envisaged in the model framework.  Advanced or expert practitioner levels require the broadest range of skills and competencies, as outlined in table 1.  In fact, PL&Eacute; argues that advanced and expert practitioners are required to engage meaningfully with the Aistear<i></i>and S&iacute;olta frameworks.  Goodbody Economic Consultants, for example, in its evaluation of an initial implementation of the S&iacute;olta quality assurance programme in 134 services between 2009 and 2010, found that staff education and training levels impeded educators&rsquo; ability to engage with and implement the S&iacute;olta framework.  PL&Eacute; asserts that the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear<i></i>and the present Childcare (Pre-school Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 require the following knowledge, competencies and skills: knowledge of play, child development, early childhood curriculums, teaching and learning strategies for young children, child health, working with families and communities, oral language and communication development, second language acquisition, child psychology, special educational needs, cultural diversity and inclusion, and national policies and priorities; competencies in child observation, communication at multiple levels, reflection, curriculum planning, implementation and evaluation, in addition to report writing, curriculum differentiation, development of individual education plans for children with specific needs, empathy, creativity and team work; and skills including engaging in, supporting and facilitating children&rsquo;s play, storytelling, creativity, nappy changing, feeding, checking temperatures and sleeping positions and administering medication.  As we move to an evidence-informed profession - that is, based on evidence gathered through research - educators need to understand the various research processes, be skilled as social researchers and also be able to make sense of research-based articles and research reports. <br/><br/>This is not an exhaustive list, but it does provide insight to the complexity of the work and the challenges associated with quality in early childhood.  It is not possible that programmes pitched at FETAC levels 5 and 6 would cover all of the areas outlined, nor should they be expected to.  Rather, these programmes provide a basic foundation and introduction to the fundamental aspects of early childhood education and care.  They do not prepare students for the depth and breadth of experiences required in early childhood settings, as envisaged within the S&iacute;olta and Aistear<i></i>frameworks.  However, all of the areas outlined can be expanded upon incrementally in a three-year and four-year degree in early childhood education and care.  PL&Eacute; asserts that degree-level programmes with a strong practicum component can adequately prepare early childhood educators to support children&rsquo;s educational development and equip educators to become curriculum and pedagogical experts in early childhood education and care. <br/><br/>Degree programmes are also designed to prepare graduates to become reflective, thereby increasing the chances of producing educators who are committed to ongoing learning and professional development.  Additionally, in time, such graduates may also be well placed to mentor, induct and support colleagues within the sector, creating a community of practice leading to enhanced quality and benefiting children in their experiences of early childhood education and care.  This could potentially complement the Better Start mentoring service currently working within the sector. <br/><br/>The issue of the poor remuneration levels in the sector has been well documented and presented to the House previously, and various reports have pegged salaries at minimum wage levels.  Working conditions and poor pay are undoubtedly a factor in the quality of early childhood provision, and to this end, there is increasing evidence that highly skilled graduates are being lost to the sector.  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the average industrial wage in Ireland, according to the Central Statistics Office, rose to &euro;828.88 per week.</p><p>Just last week, I interviewed a number of early childhood managers who informed me that there is no difference in the salaries payable to educators qualified to QQI level 5 and those with a level 8 honours degree.  These managers told me that the rate of pay for an educator is generally &euro;9 per hour and if one is lucky it is &euro;10 per hour.  When we did the calculations, we found this was less than half the industrial wage.  </p><p> Managers who hold a level 8 honours degree stated that they earn between &euro;12 and &euro;14 per hour, which is also far removed from the average industrial wage of &euro;828.88 per week.  One manager advised that after working in the sector for five years, she is seriously considering exiting the sector to work in a factory or a shop, anywhere she can earn more money, because as she explained to me, "I want to get a mortgage, to have a life".  </p><p> I recently analysed data from the 2014 annual occupational profile study undertaken with the graduates in Mary Immaculate College, Limerick.  The findings make for disturbing reading and endorse the view that educators are undervalued and underpaid, with a pervading sense that the work is not something people can continue to do in the long term and that the conditions are terrible, in the words of a graduate.  One graduate described how she was back living at home with her parents because there was no way she could afford to pay rent or bills on her salary.  These stories are replicated all over Ireland as those working in the sector find it difficult to live independently, to secure a car loan or procure a mortgage.  Crucially, there is no reward for obtaining a degree in early childhood education and care, and with the exception of the ECCE scheme which requires a minimum of a level 6 qualification, there is no incentive for existing educators in the field to upskill to higher level qualifications.</p><p> The recruitment of early childhood graduates to the Better Start mentoring service and the Department of Education and Skills early years inspectorate is a welcome development that, for the first time in the history of early childhood education and care in Ireland, provides pay parity with other professionals working with young children, as well as validating the value of degree level training and experience in the field.  The recently established Low Pay Commission is examining the possibility of introducing a living wage of &euro;11.45 per hour, which it deems to be the income below which it is impossible to make ends meet.  Research consistently indicates that irrespective of qualification levels, those working in the early childhood sector do not earn a living wage.  In response to repeated calls for Government intervention, the Government insists that remuneration levels and conditions of employment are ultimately matters for the management of settings, while at the same time expressing concern that tax credits for parents, for example, will result in increased child care fees.</p><p> This is indeed a double-edged sword, and presents a considerable conundrum for the sector.  Salaries represent between 70% and 80% of the income of an early childhood setting.  The remaining 20% to 30% of income must cover all the overheads associated with operating the setting including rates, mortgage, insurance, maintenance, equipment and materials, food and beverages and so on.  Parents are hard pressed to pay current child care fees, and there is evidence that some are left with no option but to leave their employment when a second child arrives.  Equally, child care managers cannot afford to pay salary increases.  Any such increase would warrant a significant increase in child care fees.  In the current climate, primarily as a result of inadequate investment and poor planning, considerable numbers of early childhood settings are finding that they are no longer sustainable and are closing their doors. </p><p> A recent study by Early Childhood Ireland suggests that almost 10% of services will cease to operate in September, 2015, while a study undertaken by Meehan Tully &amp;amp; Associates limited on behalf of the Dublin City Childcare Committee points to unsustainable small scale profit margins across five child care funding models.  The committee has received a copy of my statement.  I would like to conclude by saying that I have discussed issues in regard to training, qualifications and remuneration, all of which are necessary components in the provision of high quality care and education to young children from birth to school age.  It is just and necessary that educators working with children before they start school in Ireland are recognised as professionals and are appropriately remunerated in the same manner as professionals working with school-age children in the formal education sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071400002#J00100"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for feeding into this debate, which has been ongoing for a number of weeks.  We are trying to make proposals that will address the quality and affordability issues that so many parents are facing.  I will not rehash what we have said in recent weeks.  Instead, I will seek clarification by asking the witnesses a number of questions.  The county child care committees play important roles in the communities they serve.  It is fair to say that there may be inconsistencies from county to county in the level of support provided and the level of engagement with certain services.  Thankfully, I can say from my personal experience that the child care committees in Counties Westmeath and Longford are very proactive and very supportive of the services in those counties.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.</p> <p>  It has been suggested that approximately 4% of the overall expenditure of &euro;260 million on early years settings is spent through the county child care committees as part of the national delivery structure.  Do the committees feel they have the capacity to deliver more?  I wonder why the Better Start programme, which has been initiated in recent months, has not been rolled out through the county child care committees.</p> <p>  I think the removal from the county child care committees of the childminding post, which was important in terms of providing the necessary supports to childminders, has been a detrimental step.  Many of our children are being minded in this unregulated sector.</p> <p>  Reference has also been made to community services.  I sit on the board of a local community service in County Westmeath.  I agree with the assertion that it is becoming very challenging to find people to sit on the boards of these community services.  Perhaps the witnesses might share their experience of how we might address that.  Many community services would not be viable if they were not able to avail of community employment staff.  It seems that when the changes to the educational qualifications that are required come in, a number of community employment staff will be disqualified from being part of the core staffing requirement.  If that happens, the viability of many community services will be threatened.</p> <p>  I understand that the learner fund is due to expire later this year.  Would the witnesses support the extension of that fund?</p> <p>  Dr. Moloney spoke about educational requirements.  Goodbody Economic Consultants found that staff education and training levels impeded the ability of educators to engage with and implement the framework.  Does Dr. Moloney think the decision to defer the qualification requirement by 12 months was the right one?  Should it have been maintained in September of this year?</p> <p>  I ask the representatives of the county child care committees, who have said they represent the only organisation that is in operation nationally, to comment on the capacity with the sector for a second free preschool year.  A number of people who acknowledge the need for a second free preschool year have suggested that capacity issues would come into play.</p> <p>  I am surprised that nobody has mentioned the new regulations and the registration process.  The Department announced new regulations as a consequence of the "Prime Time Investigates" expos&eacute;, which has been alluded to, but we have yet to see those regulations.  We know that services are inundated with inspections from bodies such as Pobal, NERA, the HSE and Tusla.  The new educational inspections are also going in.  What is the opinion of the witnesses on the inspection process?  Surely a streamlined overall approach would be much better and would give much better value without putting undue pressure on services.</p><p>That is not saying for a moment that the standards should be compromised, but it should be done in a far more streamlined way.</p><p> Regarding S&iacute;olta and Aistear, the witnesses alluded to many of the positive developments that have taken place in this sector over the past ten to 12 years and the fact that we are coming from a very low base, not to mention the huge investment in the capital infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the investment in personnel did not match the investment in capital infrastructure.  We have S&iacute;olta and Aistear, our curriculum and the quality framework for implementation, and they are internationally recognised to be of a very good standard.  What must happen to ensure we have an effective roll-out of these?  I have asked both the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his predecessor about the national roll-out of these.  Frankly, I have not been able to get the answer.  Perhaps the witnesses would outline their personal experience in that regard.</p><p> I wish to raise a matter with Dr. Moloney.  It has been brought to my attention that in certain instances some of the educators that are educating the workforce to FETAC level 5 or level 6 in some of the institutions are not qualified to be conducting the courses.  If the educators are not qualified to conduct the courses, how can we expect quality qualifications emanating from that?  Perhaps she will address that point.</p><p> As the witnesses might be aware, my party has published a strategy reflecting how I would like to see this sector develop over the next five years.  A number of strands feed into that in terms of increased capitation, a special fund for special educational needs and a special fund for professional development.  However, it also acknowledges, and the witnesses might wish to discuss this, that there are capacity and quality issues which we must address over the next number of years.  On an interim temporary basis, to support families who are put to the pin of their collar with the cost of child care, it proposes the introduction of a tax credit.  I do not believe it will increase the cost of it, but I would welcome the witnesses' comments on that aspect.</p></speech>

We have had a number of meetings over a long period so my questions will be relevant to the presentations and will not rehash questions we have been raising repeatedly.</p> <p>  The city and county child care committees offer a wide variety of services locally to early year childminders, after-school services and parents.  What is the relationship between the child care committees and parents?  What do parents avail of and about what issues do parents contact the committees?  The city and child care committees were established to advance the provision of child care facilities and to support the implementation of national policy.  Do the witnesses believe the role of the county child care committees has evolved and is very different today from what they were originally set up to do?  Perhaps they would comment on that.</p> <p>  With regard to the inspections and the various child care funding programmes, the inspections are very inconsistent.  From speaking to others involved in the sector, I am aware that they are very stressful and it is difficult to deal with so many different Departments.  How do we address this?  Should it be streamlined through one Department, and which Department or body should that be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.362" nospeaker="true" time="11:45:00" ><p>With regard to special needs, the witnesses stated in their submission: "A properly resourced framework of supports... [for children with special needs] co-ordinated at local level through Childcare Committees is urgently required for providing equality of participation for all children."  Can they explain exactly what that framework of supports involves, what steps it would entail and what are the immediate steps to be taken to create that system?</p><p>Regard those in the sector holding a level 7 or level 8 degree, it is stated in one of the presentations that "12.8% of educators working in the sector only hold a degree at level 7-8 in early childhood education and care".  We understand the reason that is the case.  The wages and terms and conditions are dreadful.  Those in the sector have a 38-week work year and some of them might have to sign on the dole for the summer months.  They cannot obtain a mortgage or a car loan.  Why would one stay in a job where the conditions are so terrible?  Obviously, people in the sector love what they do, but staying in it is not sustainable if one wants to have a better lifestyle.  There is no incentive to move from a level 5 or level 6 up to level 7 or level 8.  We were given figures at one our committee meetings last week that those who are obtaining a degree at level 7 or level 8 are not staying in the sector.  They are moving on to teaching or to other areas.  The answer to this issue is resources and funding.  Those in the sector have to be paid what they are worth.  They must be treated as educators and not as childminders.  I would just make that comment because the witnesses have outlined the situation very well in their presentation.  It is difficult to ask them questions on it because they have given all the answers to the questions as they have moved along.  It is a very good presentation.</p><p>The roll-out of the Aistear and S&iacute;olta frameworks seems to be a major problem.  How can we roll them out?  It was stated by some people who came before the committee that perhaps the roll-out of it should be introduced at one of the lower levels as a module in itself and that might address one part of it.  Would the witnesses agree with that view?  Also, emphasis was placed by the Department on people being able to educate themselves online.  I believe that this was actually stated, but education is about mentoring and it is also about one-to-one interaction.  It cannot be about a box-ticking exercise.  I cannot see how that would work.  Would the witnesses agree with that point?</p><p>I note in the recommendations in one of the presentations that with regard to the S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks it is stated that "it is important to note that neither framework has been implemented universally".  It is obvious that it needs to be.  It is also stated in the presentation: "Alongside the enactment of the practice frameworks, there must be a nationally funded implementation plan."  I would not disagree with anything there.</p><p>I wish to ask each of the witnesses that if they were to make one change in the morning and make it a priority, what is the one change they would want to see implemented?</p></speech>

We have reached a reached a crossroads now, and I have said that previously here.  Are we going to rush something through and try to please everyone or are we going to put the basic steps in place?  We have been throwing money at this sector.  A total of &euro;1.13 billion has been spent in the sector in the period from 2000 to 2010.  In this context, we need to examine is it education or is it child care?  What are we talking about?  I would like to ask Dr. Mary Maloney about this.  I think we have it all mixed up, that child care is regarded by some as childhood education and a delivery of a proper education to little children.  We all know, and I know this as an ex-schoool principal, that within three weeks of little children coming into junior infants class, one can nearly write their CV.  It is extremely important that we get it right and it is not just a matter of putting something in to try to please a group of people.</p> <p>  I am extremely worried about the education level of the people who are delivering education to preschool children.  It is so important.</p><p>I would like to see staff who are qualified up to level 7, 8 or 9 and with an expertise in early childhood education.</p><p>   I thank Dr. Moloney for her superb presentation.  Why are there 27 ECCE courses rather than just one or two, as is the case with primary and secondary teacher education?  I am very aware of what is going on at St. Nicholas Montessori College in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and how many of its graduates come through with a primary degree only to leave early childhood education after a year or two to try to get into primary teaching.  That is happening because early childhood education does not offer a sustainable career.  Part of the problem is that we are mixing up child care and early childhood education.  Why is child care in Ireland more expensive than anywhere else in Europe but the staff working in the sector here are among the lowest paid in the country?  Where is all the money going that is generated from fees?</p><p> We need to work together to give these matters proper consideration and find solutions.  The sector will not be fixed simply by flinging money at it.  This issue is too important to take a political bandwagon approach with an eye to getting through the election.  We did not have the money to invest in the sector in the past four years.  Anybody who thinks we should have done in any case need only look to Greece to see what can happen in such cases.  However, the country has been turned around since this Government came to office and now is the time to do what is necessary to do.  I urge Dr. Moloney to continue shouting that message from the mountain tops.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates and commend them on their fine presentations.  As a new member of the committee, I have not been party to previous discussions on this issue.  The presentations were an eyeopener for me.  I thank the witnesses for the work that went into them and the professional manner in which they were delivered.</p> <p>  Leading on from the point made by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, we have a very mixed, piecemeal and ineffective system of child care and early childhood education.  Staff in the sector are poorly paid and, in some cases, their qualifications are inadequate.  The service provided is incredibly expensive and provision is not universal by any means.  The issue that presents immediately concerns the extent to which we are mixing child care and early education, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor noted.  The question to be answered is how we can build a coherent and holistic system of child care and early education that is efficient, cost effective and does what it says on the tin.</p> <p>  Primary school teachers in Ireland have always been insistent that primary education should start at an early age.  At age four, we have one of the lowest primary school entry ages in Europe and, indeed, throughout the world.  The challenge is to bridge the gap between birth and age four and do so in such a manner that there are not gaps all over the place.  We started out in the wrong way, unfortunately, with the funding coming from the European Union for this purpose being administered through the Department of Justice and Equality.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why it was done that way.  It meant there was a focus on the number of places rather than the quality of care and a structure which effectively put the cart before the horse.  That remains the case to an extent.</p> <p>  The introduction of the free preschool year in 2009 represented an essentially stand-alone initiative.  There has been some discussion recently as to whether a second free year should be provided.</p><p>If the latter were to be done, it would mean free preschool education for the two years prior to children turning four.  Thereafter, we are concerned with the period between birth and two years of age.  Will the witnesses outline their views as to how we might bridge the gap between birth, child care and preschool education?  Will they indicate as to where and how the integration might take place?  We need to put together a sustainable plan for child care and preschool education that will bring children right up to their entry to primary school.  The process in this regard should involve professionals who are properly qualified.  The problem is that until now we have only been making isolated attempts to deal with this matter and that nothing really coherent or professional has been put in place.  Will the witnesses outline their views in respect of this issue and indicate how they see matters developing into the future?</p><p> I cannot for the life of me understand why the current system is so incredibly expensive or why those who work in it are so poorly paid.  There is almost a contradiction in terms in this regard and I would welcome some ideas from the witnesses as to why that is the case.  Are there many men working in the system?  As I understand it, the system is almost entirely the preserve of women.</p><p> The free preschool that has been provided is not being taken up fully, with a 5% to 10% shortfall in terms of the number of parents who are accessing that year for their children.  Will the witnesses comment on the difficulties in this regard?  What are their views on paternity leave and on extending the term of maternity leave?  I understand that Ireland is way behind the rest of Europe and other OECD countries in the context of both paternity and maternity leave.  If we took action in this regard, perhaps it could form part of the process by means of which we might provide a continuum of child care from birth all the way through to entry to primary school.</p><p> The witnesses made a very good presentation that highlighted the inadequacies that exist at present.  Perhaps we should examine the possibility of drawing up an overall plan which we could seek to implement quickly as the recovery in the economy kicks in.  We should seek to proceed in a holistic, coherent fashion rather than continuing in a piecemeal manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Rynn" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071400002#N00200"><p>I thank members for their questions and thoughts.  I will reply first to the questions posed by Deputy Troy.</p> <p>  In terms of the level of consistency of supports throughout the country, there are 30 CCCs and these are aligned to national policy.  Prior to the establishment of the national network that is now in place through Childhood Committees Ireland, there might have been a perception that the 30 committees were raising and pursuing issues with members and the various the Departments and were in continual communication with them.  However, in an important step for us, we streamlined our process in order to ensure that there is one unified voice emanating from the 30 committees, that we engage with Departments and policy-makers on the issues we identify and that we bring forward solutions.  We have addressed one of the weaknesses of the previous structure through the development of the CCI because we believe it is important to have a consistent, coherent system of communication with all the stakeholders involved.  That is something we worked hard to develop over the past three years.  The level of supports in each county is very similar.  In larger urban areas, there are greater service numbers required and more needs to address.  As a result, it may not be possible to give as much attention to those service providers in urban areas as one can to their rural counterparts.  The authorities in smaller counties are able to offer more intensive supports and devote more time in terms of meeting services' needs.  There might be an inconsistency in this regard but it is due to different levels of support and engagement and the simple volume of people with which one is dealing.  In Dublin there are 450 services whereas in other counties there may only be 100.  These are issues which must be managed.  The supports are the same in each company, it is just the level of intensiveness one is able to offer when providing supports to a service.</p> <p>  The issue regarding resources is ongoing.  Deputy Troy referred to a particular figure, which we discussed earlier.  There has been no increase in resources and, in fact, we absorbed a 20% cut over the past three to four years.  This has had implications in terms of how we respond to and manage service issues.  Better Start, the national support programme, has been put in place and we have engaged with it.</p><p>Any service that seeks supports under Better Start and the specialist mentoring service goes through the CCC.  A total of 200 services have gone through that nationally to date.  They come through the CCC for engagement with, and referral into, the mentoring supports.</p><p> Our staff have also access to training around the new practice guidelines.  The two frameworks - Aistear and S&iacute;olta - have been merged into a common set of practice guidelines and we are looking at how we can build in a training programme using those frameworks for services, but, again, we can only do so much within the resources we have.  We are looking at how we can implement and support Aistear and S&iacute;olta in a much more integrated fashion next year within our plans.</p><p> Ms McMonagle referred to PIP, which is an online implementation system for programme management.  We are hoping that system will free us from some of the administrative duties we have been given and that we will get into the space of focusing on quality supports, because there are 30 specialist mentors in place through Better Start.  That will not address all the needs of the services, and we have a resource within the CCCs, which can do some of the pre-development work.  We hope to get into that space over the next year.  We are writing that into our plans, which will go to the Department for 2016 funding allocation.</p><p> Childminding remains important for us.  It is a key access point for parents.  They continue to use childminders to provide care, particularly for the younger age range.   Parents with babies feel more comfortable with childminders and look on them as providing a home from home.  They feel it is a better choice.  Adequate resources have not been put into childminding, but we support childminders through our teams.  We have a voluntary notification process.  The issue of regulation of childminders has been well debated and highlighted.  It is a policy decision that needs to be made.  We welcome regulation for all of the sector.  It should be an level playing field for both school-age and preschool children, and we continue to engage with childminders who wish to engage with us.  It is a voluntary process and we continue to do that.</p><p> Community services are under serious threat and serious pressure.  It is about resources, because they deal with vulnerable families that have many complex needs.  That has a cost for a service to manage, because family supports must be provided and individual needs addressed.  It is not just about funding a place for a child; the families look for other supports.  The community services are managed within the community child care subvention programme, and that just pays a portion of the fee.  Invariably, services use other means to address the shortfall.  They have a relationship with Tusla, which funds some services.  They had relationships with other funders, but much of that has been withdrawn and, therefore, they are down to trying to extract that funding from families that do not have it.  It is a resource issue that has to be addressed in the context of the current programme.  Services are dependent on CE in some cases.  There has been a great deal of reconfiguration in how child care is implemented by community services, and the Department of Social Protection has done significant work on that.  Officials have reconfigured the CE programme as a three-year programme whereby people are put in an apprenticeship programme over three years.  There is value in that, as it allows staff and others who wish to train to be practitioners to undertake a three-year programme.  One of the issues we spotted was that some services are depending on CE to meet their ratio.  We acknowledge that, and that is one of the reasons the extension of the scheme was granted.  We highlighted the concerns we had around the implementation of the 2015 deadline for the learner fund and the requirement for FETAC levels 5 and 6 qualifications.  We had concerns that if that change came in this September, some of the community services would have been unable to ensure their staff had attained the necessary qualifications.  The extension is welcome in that it allows us to address those issues with services that need to examine how they manage the implications of this change, but, equally, the learners can train themselves on level 5 and 6 programmes in their own time.  They do not get time outside their day jobs to do this.  They have families and other commitments and they take these programmes in the evenings.  It was an enormous amount to ask of these people to deliver this in 12 months.  The extension gives them breathing space, but we want this to happen.  The Department has committed to the 2016 deadline and there has been no movement on that.  The additional year provides time to address those issues.</p><p> The final issue was tax credits.  From our perspective, in terms of making a decision, we want a policy decision that considers three issues.  The first is the sustainability of child care providers.  Whatever policy decision is made, it should not impact on them and it should give them a long-term plan to trade and operate.  Second, it has to ensure parents can have affordable and accessible child care and the needs of the child are fully addressed.  There is no silver bullet to address this.  Tax payments may be one, and direct payment to services are another, but each policy decision must have a positive solution for both parents and providers, because their needs are equal and they have to be considered in whatever decision is made.</p><p>I believe that covers most of the Deputy's questions and I will let Ms McMonagle pick up some of the other points.</p></speech>

She asked about the relationship between county child care committees and parents.  In the first equal opportunities childcare programme, EOCP, we did not really have engagement with parents because, as the Deputy is aware, that phase of development was all about developing infrastructure.  The national child care investment programme, NCIP, process and the introduction of the child care funding schemes, particularly the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, year, gave us a new audience with parents and, as I stated, that was a challenge for us.  However, the main work we find with parents pertains to support and advice on accessing funding schemes.  Some of them are not the easiest to access in terms of entitlements and so on, particularly schemes such as the community childcare subvention scheme or the school-age child care scheme.  We inform parents of their entitlements, even at a basic level, in respect of the service profile within the county.  If a new parent comes into a county, we can signpost what services are in what areas, what schemes they offer, the profile of qualifications of staff, for example, and can signpost them towards where they can find the latest copy of the inspection report.  Our relationship with parents is all about informing them of what is good practice and to what they and their child are entitled.  In addition, we even deal with things like complaints and general queries.  That constitutes our relationship with parents.</p> <p>  As for whether the role of child care committees have evolved over the years, yes absolutely.  I have been around from more or less the beginning in this process and yes, during the EOCP programme we were out on building sites and were acting as semi-architects, designers and all those things and then we moved into a different phase.  It often is stated that money was thrown at the sector at that time but this is not strictly true because we were starting from a point at which child care services were operating out of people's garages or spare rooms and the infrastructure had to be built.  It was a response at that time to the state of affairs at that time and because places were needed for children.  In addition, the issue of quality often is mentioned, to the effect that there was no focus on quality.  While there was, it was at a very low base.  Sub-measure 3 of the EOCP programme was a quality sub-measure but as I indicated in the presentation, it was about basic things like policies and procedures and health and safety, that is, very low base quality, which were, nevertheless, very important fundamentals.  Our role has evolved and as new policies have come online, we are obliged to respond quickly but again, that is one of the strengths of the county child care committee structure.  We are all there, are imbedded at local level in our local areas and can respond quickly.  In addition, our teams are highly skilled in a range of different areas from early childhood care and education to administration and financial skills.  We come from a range of backgrounds and that is the reason we are able to offer the breadth of supports.</p> <p>  As for the inspections, yes they no doubt are very stressful.  In an ideal world, it would have been much better had we had some kind of streamlined inspection process.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware, these things are not always that easy when one is dealing with legislation and in trying to push through some of the standards that we now need, it probably would have taken a lot longer to get them on a legislative footing.  However, one probably would be looking at the importance of needing things like S&iacute;olta and Aistear to be embedded within the preschool regulations in a formal and mandatory way and for that to be streamlined definitely into a single inspection process.  The services are under huge pressure at present with a number of different people coming in.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about special education needs and the system we had mentioned.  Our idea in this regard is there would be a central fund held locally by every county child care committee because people would agree the last thing we need is simply to throw money at special needs.  We need to make sure that for those children who need it, there is a full second preschool year available as a way into the second preschool year.  Not all parents will choose that because it will not suit all children but it definitely should be there as a choice for certain children.</p><p>If there was a central fund available at child care committee level, then we could tap into the fund in order to meet the needs of every child.  For one child it may be a piece of equipment; for another child it may be specialised training in sign language or personal care procedures.  It could be just about anything.  We are not stating that everybody needs to have a module in special needs.  Yes, it should be part of the mandatory core training, but it is much more important that these short continuous professional development upskilling courses are available and, more importantly, that the money is available in time for a child to participate fully.  There are many children with special needs in our mainstream early childhood services, but just because they are present physically and are being counted in the numbers does not mean their participation levels are the same as those of other children.  That is our idea for that system.  It is quite broad in terms of the supports that would be required.</p><p> The S&iacute;olta and Aistear programmes are an old chestnut that will not go away.  Our strength is in what we can do locally.  As Mr. Joe Ryan said, the Better Start initiative - the national early years quality development service - does not have the reach into the services that we have.  We have direct reach into 4,500 services across the country.  We are probably the only organisation that has that.  That puts us in the position of being a key implementer in whatever service we are chosen to be resourced for.  It is not about our saying what we could or could not do.  We can do just about anything that policy drives us to do, because we have the infrastructure set up and the national reach into the services.</p><p> The big question is why there has not been a consistent roll-out of Aistear.  The simple answer is that it has not been funded at national level.  Pockets of community childcare have done their pieces of work, but it has not been possible to take it on to a national level.  We are blamed for being inconsistent, but it is actually the case that we were not funded to do it in the first place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-14a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Moloney" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015071400002#Q00200"><p>It is so heartening to be part of a discussion in which people are being exceptionally honest and frank on the issues that have led us to the crossroads that we are at today.  My particular interest in representing PL&Eacute; is around training, qualifications and remuneration.  All of the members have acknowledged the difficulties in their own ways.  Deputy Troy is absolutely correct that there are issues with regard to those who are on level 5 and 6 training courses.  It would be remiss of any of us to leave today without saying that those operating at levels 5 and 6 are to a large extent doing an incredible job in very difficult circumstances.  Deputy McLellan asked why a person with a degree - a level 7 or 8 qualification - would stay in the sector.  I could equally ask why somebody with a level 5 or 6 qualification would remain in the sector.  Nobody within the sector is earning a living wage and it behoves all of us to fight for proper salaries and conditions.</p> <p>  I have an issue with the fact that the minimum qualification requirement was postponed for 12 months.  I think we were talking about 3,000 people in the sector who will not have their qualification this coming September.  In a sector in which 25,000 people are at work, that is quite a small number, and an interim measure could very easily have been put in place to take account of those people.  As I understand it, the worry is that inspectors going into a child care facility will not be able to make a judgment because people do not have their qualifications.  I share the concerns about inspections in the sector.  We have a preschool quality agenda, and the more I think about the preschool quality agenda the more frustrated I get, because the focus of that agenda seems to be solely on inspection.  There are many people - as a parent, I am one of them - who have recently seen their children through the leaving certificate examination.  My son could not have sat that examination without the preparation and study that went in beforehand for a five-year period.  Under the preschool quality agenda we are sending inspectors to inspect child care facilities against S&iacute;olta and Aistear standards.  That will be the premise of the new-education focused inspections.  Yet we are not building the capacity within the sector.  We are setting the sector up for failure.  Many members have used terms such as "putting the cart before the horse," meaning that we addressed the wrong end.  We are again in danger of addressing the wrong end.  I am absolutely in favour of inspection by the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>That is a step in the right direction.  For too long we have been investing in bricks and mortar, space, air vents, dust and adult-child ratios, all of which are important aspects of quality but the processes in settings, the way we engage with the children, the relationships with children and how we nurture the children are the critical elements that can be benchmarked against S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  Mr. Joe Rynn and Ms Avril McMonagle have said, and I have said it repeatedly myself in my presentation, that those frameworks remain optional.  Six years on from the Aistear framework, it is still an optional framework in early childhood education, with one exception where it is mandatory for the free preschool year.  Nine years on from its publication, S&iacute;olta remains optional within settings.  What are we at?  If there was a political will - it sounds trite and inconceivable in a way that with the stroke of a pen the Government can enact both those frameworks - they would become mandatory.  In that scenario, everybody who is training educators for the sector would be mandated immediately for the frameworks to become part and parcel of training the length and breadth of Ireland.  We do it in the higher education institutions.</p><p> Deputy Mitchell O'Connor asked about the 27 degree courses.  There are 18 institutions and some offer level 7 and level 8 courses, which immediately means there are two degree programmes in those institutions.  The other element is that different institutions will have a different focus.  Some will be very focused on outdoor play.  Some, depending on the background of the people operating within it, will look very much on social care, as they come from that model.  I am a lecturer in early childhood studies in Mary Immaculate College, where we embed S&iacute;olta and Aistear from year one right through to the end of year four.  Each degree has its own particular focus.</p><p> There has been much mention of whether we are looking at education or at care.  One of the major issues in the sector for the past 15 years is that we have never had a national discussion about the purpose of early childhood education.  Is it education or is it care?  Some people have argued and continue to argue that what we have done effectively is to create holding centres for children while their parents work.  That is a very sobering thought because we have not given enough thought to what happens within the settings.  We have an ideal opportunity as we are at a crossroads.  We have very hard decisions to make, not political decisions and not as members rightly put it, throwing good money after bad.  We can make very good decisions about the future.</p><p> Many members will remember the White Paper on Early Childhood Education in 1999 and the inextricable link which we said could not be separated as one cannot have care without education or one cannot have education without care.  If I pick up a six month old baby in my arms and nurture that baby, the baby is learning from me.  It is education in its broadest sense.  If I set up an environment that is welcoming for a young baby or young child, what is the child learning from that environment and what is the child learning from my responses?  It is education in its broadest sense at that very young age.  We need staff with those skills who know how to nurture.  I spoke this morning on "Newstalk" about a baby of six months old babbling and cooing, the very beginning of communication and language development.  That is education but it is also care because of how we respond.  There are so many issues, but we have an opportunity to get this right.</p><p> Deputy Troy mentioned tax credits.  I do not subscribe to the notion that tax credits would increase child care fees.  There is no evidence that this has happened in any other jurisdiction.  I am of the opinion, and I share Mr. Joe Rynn's opinion, that tax credits as an interim measure with other measures would get us out of the quagmire that we are in at present.  We need to enact S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  We need a dedicated training fund for the sector.  Mr. Rynn rightly states that people are going out at night and at the weekend to work on the minimum wage to pay for their training and upskilling.  Many of the students who sit before me at third level are struggling to get through college because we know the recession has hit them badly.  I meet students in our cafeteria on Monday morning and their treat for the week is a coffee in Starbucks.  We are not talking about anybody who is making big money out of child care.  My students tell me that they stick with it because they want to be the best educators they can be.  They want to give children the best opportunities and I salute them for doing that.</p><p>I do not salute a sector which continually states we must do it for free.  That is effectively what we are doing.  The committee has asked repeatedly why Ireland has the highest child care costs.  I ask the members in turn what do other jurisdictions have where there is the Rolls Royce model?  There was a lady from Sweden on the radio yesterday morning.  What does Sweden have that we do not have?  Its taxation rate is 30%.  Anybody in Ireland will tell the committee that when we add in USC, PRSI and PAYE, we pay 52% tax on our salaries.  We ask parents to pay an additional 35% on child care out of their net income.  We are not investing.  We do not recognise it as the social service that it is and we do not see the savings.</p><p> Mr. James Heckman has been quoted in the Houses before.  There is a &euro;16 or &euro;17 return on every euro invested.  We know that if we invest in early childhood, we stave off issues in the long term.  We prevent people going into prison at a very young age.  Our young children are our future and it behoves us now to make decisions on what is best for their futures.  All of us sitting here may not want to make the hard decisions, but when we retire in ten, 15 or 20 years, the young children we are depriving now will be the nurses, doctors and teachers who will be responsible for our care.  We must make proper decisions now to ensure a future for Ireland.</p></speech>
