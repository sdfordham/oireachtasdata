    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#G00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for providing me with the opportunity to update them on developments regarding the beef data and genomics programme, which was launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on 5 May 2015.  It is part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, involving involves funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years, and builds on the State&rsquo;s investment in data recording and genomics in recent years.  It will address widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the Irish suckler herd, make a positive contribution to farmer profitability and reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s beef production.</p> <p>  Beef accounts for 35% of the gross output of the agriculture sector.  It is arguably the most important primary agricultural product in Ireland at farm level.  Beef exports in 2014 amounted to 524,000 tonnes, worth &euro;2.27 billion.  Ireland exports 90% of its beef.  We are the largest net exporter of beef in the EU and the fifth largest in the world.  In addition to beef exports, Ireland also has a strong live export trade to Europe and beyond, with more than 236,000 live animals exported in 2014 at a value of over &euro;172 million.   </p> <p>  The suckler herd is a critical component of the industry.  It is beef from the suckler herd that has principally enabled us to succeed on international retail markets.  It is important, therefore, that policy at EU and national level recognises the challenges and opportunities facing suckler beef farmers and provides the infrastructure to help it to respond and thrive in this environment.  There is a clear profitability challenge on suckler farms, which is not a new phenomenon.  The 2014 Teagasc national farm survey showed that cattle-rearing farms had an average family farm income of just over &euro;10,000 and that for many suckler farmers the income received from direct payments exceeded the income they received from the market. </p> <p>  In addition, the impact of livestock production has become a critical part of the international debate on climate change.  While the production of beef in Ireland has a low carbon footprint relative to some competitors, in Ireland the agriculture sector accounts for a high percentage of our overall emissions.  Positioning Ireland in the international marketplace as a producer of high-quality, environmentally sustainable beef through initiatives such as Origin Green has been a central part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotion strategy on international markets.</p><p>In its October 2014 conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s Climate and Energy Framework to 2030, the European Council recognised the need to meet rising global demand for food in a way that is environmentally sustainable, and committed the Commission to examining how to encourage the sustainable intensification of food production.</p><p> Improving the genetics of the suckler herd can make a positive contribution in all of these areas.  Research from Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, shows that the suckler herd faces significant breeding challenges at present.  The sector has been successful in breeding animals for terminal-type traits such as carcass weight and carcass conformation in response to market demand for high-output beef animals.  However, there has been less concentration on maternal efficiency traits such as fertility and milk yield, which are equally important for producing good weanlings and improving profitability.</p><p> On average, Irish beef farmers produce only eight calves for every ten suckler cows, and this trend has not been improving.  The interval between calving has been expanding and is now well in excess of 400 days, at 419 days.  This is going in the wrong direction and the reality on the ground is well beyond the target of one calf per cow every 365 days.  There are similar concerns in relation to other measures such as the age at first calving and weight of calves at weaning.</p><p> The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is a response to these challenges.  It provides targeted support to suckler farmers.  It builds on the success of the State&rsquo;s investment of &euro;9 million in the beef data programme in each of 2013 and 2014, and on the success of the pilot beef genomics scheme, which involved investment of around &euro;23 million last year.  The BDGP will enhance our knowledge and understanding of the national herd through increased data collection and genotyping.  Farmers can utilise this information to retain the best types of animal as replacement heifers for breeding.  The rationale for the scheme is based on the relationship between carbon and economic efficiency at farm level.  It is critical that there is a synergy between carbon efficiency and economic efficiency.  By producing animals more efficiently in terms of fertility levels and milk yields, the beef sector can benefit on the double - first, through an improvement in profitability for farmers from producing weanlings or finished animals, and second, through a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the production of these animals per kilo of beef.</p><p> The BDGP is the first measure of its kind anywhere in the EU.  It has been approved by the European Commission under Article 28 of the Rural Development Regulation, which deals with agri-environment measures.  Programmes approved under this article are required to comply with certain requirements.  The first is that payments are based on the cost incurred and income foregone in carrying out the programme.  This is a principle which applies to rural development schemes generally.  Any modification or deletion of actions in the programme would of course result in a corresponding reduction in payments.  Second, commitments must, under the regulation, be for a period of five to seven years.  The BDGP requires a six-year commitment by the scheme applicant and this is matched by a corresponding commitment from Government to provide a stable and guaranteed payment to applicants over that six-year period.  Some concerns have been expressed regarding this six-year commitment and, as a result, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has signalled a number of flexibilities regarding exit during the six-year programme.  I am happy to go into these in more detail later if the committee wishes.  All agri-environment measures are required to be paid on a per-hectare basis. </p><p> Participants in the BDGP will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for the first 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each hectare thereafter, up to a maximum payable hectarage.  This is equivalent to approximately &euro;95 for the first ten calved cows and &euro;80 for each additional calved cow.  Participants will also receive an additional &euro;166 to attend a training course linked to the programme.  The maximum payable hectarage is calculated by dividing the number of calved cows in the herd in 2014 - the reference amount - by a standard stocking rate of 1.5 calved cows per hectare.  On the basis of this stocking rate, the vast majority of farmers have far more land than they require to obtain the maximum payment under the scheme.  Almost half of farmers have a stocking rate of 0.5 or less and 90% have a stocking rate of less than one.  An example is that a farmer with ten cows and a stocking rate of 0.5 will have 20 hectares, but will require less than seven of these to attract the full payment under the scheme.</p><p> In return for this payment, which is calculated on a cost-incurred and income-foregone basis, the participant will be required to undertake six actions, many of which are already known to and well understood by participants in last year&rsquo;s beef data and genomics schemes.  The first requirement is to provide calving details.  Participants must complete a calving ease survey for each calf born on the farm using what is known as the animals events sheet.  This is in addition to normal tagging and registration requirements and can be completed online or through the animal events book provided by the ICBF.</p><p>Farmers are familiar with this requirement, which is exactly the same as that under the beef data programme during the past two years.</p><p> The second action involves the completion and submission of survey forms for the cows, calves and stock bulls on a farm.  The data submitted will relate to criteria such as milking ability, docility, calf size and calf vigour.  This is vital information for the database behind the breeding indexes, which are developed by the ICBF, and will strengthen the robustness of breeding advice provided to farmers.  Again, this requirement is the same as that which applied to farmers who were involved in the beef data programme in recent years, albeit with some additional information now required.</p><p> The third requirement relates to the genotyping of animals on farms.  This requirement was the central component of the pilot beef genomics scheme last year.  The only difference under the BDGP will be the increase in the percentage of animals to be genotyped.  However, this will be matched by an increase in payment.  As with last year&rsquo;s scheme, the proportion of the payment to the farmer absorbed by genotyping costs is expected to be approximately 15%.  The position will, therefore, be much the same as last year.  The ICBF will select animals to be genotyped in each herd and will notify the owners of the animals selected.  Tissue tags will be supplied to the participants for this purpose.  The selection of animals will be based on a genotyping plan developed by the ICBF.  The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his or her holding in 2014, that is, the applicant&rsquo;s reference animals to which I referred earlier.  For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype nine animals in each year of the programme, without repetition.  This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of four and five-star females required by BDGP herds.</p><p> The replacement strategy relates to both the stock bull and the female replacements introduced into herds during the six-year programme.  In order to achieve the objectives of improving the genetic merit of the national herd and lowering the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions, it is vital that we not only identify the appropriate animals, but that we also incentivise their use in farmers' breeding strategies.  This requirement is, however, will be phased in over time.  The requirement for farmers using stock bulls is that at least one of the bulls on the holding on 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped four or five-star animal on either the terminal or replacement index.  Where it is replaced in the following 12 months, it must be replaced by a bull of equivalent genetic merit.  For those using artificial insemination, AI, at least 80% of that used must be from four or five-star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index from 30 June 2016.   Farmers renting bulls for breeding must, from 30 June 2016, use bulls that are four or five-star on the terminal or replacement index, either within or across breed.  Such farmers must, of course, inform the Department of their intention to use a rented bull and should ensure compliance with animal health and movement legislation, including  a requirement for a pre-movement test for TB and bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD.</p><p> The requirement for female replacements is that, by the end of the scheme, the number of four and five-star cows on a participating herds must be at least equal to 50% of the number of reference animals advised to the farmer at the start of the programme.  For example, a farmer with 20 calved suckler cows in 2014 must have ten four or five-star females by 31 October 2020.  These animals must be at least 16 months old, to ensure they are being retained on farms, and must be four or five stars on the replacement index at the time of purchase, for heifers brought into the herd, or at the time of genotyping, for those replacements bred within the herd.  There is also an intermediate target of 20% for 2018.  A considerable amount of analysis has been undertaken to ascertain the availability of these female replacements in the coming years.  Many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for four and five-star animals.  Analysis undertaken by ICBF of the 2014 beef genomics scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement for female animals in 2020, that is, that the number of four and five-star heifers is equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm.  All farmers will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy.  Of course, these requirements will take time to introduce and this is why a five-year lead-in time has been included in the design of the programme.</p><p> The fifth element is the carbon navigator, which is an online farm management package produced by Bord Bia and Teagasc.  It quantifies the environmental gains that can be made on each applicant's farm by setting targets in key areas.  It is a very useful and simple tool which allows individual farmers to look at changes which can be made on their farms, in areas such as the length of the grazing season or their average calving rate, and illustrates what that change would mean in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions from his or her herd and the increased profitability associated with such a change.  The first completion of the carbon navigator must be undertaken in conjunction with an approved adviser, the cost of which will be covered separately under the rural development programme, RDP.</p><p>Participants must also submit data annually to allow for an update of the carbon navigator. </p><p> The final element of the programme is the training course to be delivered over the next 16 months or so.   To deliver on the objectives of the BDGP and to work with each individual farmer to identify their breeding needs, it is vital that the participants receive dedicated training and advice.  The four-hour training course will cover the individual requirements of the scheme; the importance of data collection and maternal breeding traits; the optimal use of breeding indexes; and the linkage between breeding and carbon efficiency at farm and national level.  The cost of the training will be covered separately under the RDP and farmers will receive &euro;166 to cover their costs of participation.  Again, that will not cost the farmer anything.</p><p> The BDGP involves an investment of &euro;300 million in addressing some of the key challenges facing the beef sector in Ireland . Some 30,000 farmers have applied for the scheme at this point and the programme is likely to be fully subscribed.  I thank members for their time and patience, and I would be happy to provide any further detail of clarification they deem useful.   If they need information that I do not have with me, I am happy to come back anytime.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#K00300"><p>I thank the officials for attending.  To say that was a quick tour of the genomics scheme would be an understatement.  There is major concern about this.  The first thing we must remember is there are 73,400 herd owners in the country and we must look at the profile of these people.  The booklet associated with the scheme is enough to put off many people from joining it because they will say to themselves: &quot;I will get clobbered in years five and six and the money I do not get, I do not miss, but the money I get that is clawed back I will miss when the claw-back happens.&quot;  It is interesting that across the country there is a distinct impression that somebody has dreamt up this scheme in some laboratory of bureaucracy and science with no reference to the reality of the ordinary farmer and he or she is not willing even to listen to the concerns.</p><p>The first concern I have heard about relates to the claw-back and the penalty.  The main concern about the penalty relates to not achieving the four star and five star status as required.  I acknowledge the Minister's reassurances about <i>force majeure</i>and so on.  Any confidence people would have had in the common sense of the Department and the European Union in respect of penalties went out the window with the LPIS review in 2013.  There is a lack of confidence in the Department not to approach participants in five or six years' time under a different Minister and using different officials to say: &quot;Sorry, these are the rules.  Did you read your little booklet and in paragraph 52A(d) it says such and such?  Sorry, a penalty will be imposed.&quot;  That is what farmers are afraid of.  The claw-back and penalty is a major issue.</p><p>I am not an expert in this but I welcome my colleague, Deputy Aylward, to the committee.  He is an experienced farmer and he will be able to elaborate on a second issue that has been raised with me.  I am told that in certain herds, the 60% requirement will mean one will run out of cattle to genotype unless one starts genotyping male cattle.</p><p>The third issue relates to the four star and five star status.  Ideally, I would have liked representatives of the ICBF to have come before the committee to give members the A to Z of star ratings and to tell us exactly how they arrive at a star rating because I have heard more combinations and permutations about such ratings over the past three or four weeks to last me a lifetime.  However, the pedigree breeders seem to have issues and Deputy Aylward will the deal with the technicalities such as lack of bulls and so on.  There is a great worry when talking about maternal rates, lactation and milk production that what the Department will rate as a highly suitable animal will not suit hills and marginal land.</p><p>It would be like using a very productive lowland ewe and saying this produces a lot more lambs than any hill ewe and therefore we will put it up on the mountain.  What will happen is that she will never come down again.  </p><p> A fourth issue raised with me is one of these quirky little ones.  Complying with this with regard to bulls out on islands becomes a particular challenge where they have their own ways of dealing with these issues.  It is not that easy to bring bulls over and back to islands and on islands, by definition, AI does not work.  It is not a possibility because by the time the AI person is brought out, the cow would no longer be in heat.  There is also the problem that a lot of farmers are part-time farmers and, again, AI is not how it is done.</p><p> I am very grateful to the Department for providing me with some figures.  As I said, there are 73,640 herd owners in the country.  The number of applications show, as one would expect, that the small herd owners have said, "Thanks, but no thanks; you can keep your scheme".  Some 54% of the herd owners, which is more than half and is a majority in a referendum, have fewer than ten suckler cows.  Only 22% of those have even sent in the form.  I know they do not come to the Department and it does not affect the figures that much as to the number of animals in the scheme, but obviously the majority of herd owners are small herd owners and they have said, "Thanks, but no thanks".  When we move to ten to 20 cows, 53% have applied and when we go to the higher deciles, the average is around 70%.  To remember Pillar 2, the Minister said time and again that he would look after the marginal areas, the small farmers.  Once again, the scheme is designed to be totally unattractive to the small operator.</p><p> This scheme needs to be radically reformed.  I suggest that what we should do is see if the science really works in practice on the ground for six years.  In an ideal world, what would make the scheme at least operable would be to reduce the genomic testing to 30% instead of 60%.  The Department should say that genome information is provided to the farmer for the first six years but that it would be left to the farmer to decide how to use that information rather than the Department being prescriptive.  As I said, there are serious reservations as to whether this will necessarily give them the one that suits the particular lands in question or the pedigrees and so on.  If it is as profitable and produces much more profitable and greater calving numbers, the farmers will cotton on fairly fast and they will follow.  However, it may not be as simple as the Department is making out - this is new science and it is very different from the dairy herd where one is talking about big herds, small numbers and professional farmers.  If there are flaws in this, we will not have driven everybody into a very confined market where the price of certain type of cattle will be driven right through the ceiling.  We will not have driven them into a crazy situation.  </p><p> Finally, I have a question.  A farmer rang me today and said that he had been in contact with the Department and it had informed him that if he did not withdraw from the scheme, as this farmer intended doing, before the ICBF pack issued, and if he then, having seen this information sheet and baulked at it at that stage because it was too bureaucratic and involved too much paperwork, too much risk or whatever, that he would be billed for the pack.</p><p>Is this correct?  When will the packs issue to farmers?  What is the cost of the pack as issued to farmers?  To be quite honest, if that is true, the Department should write to all farmers within the week informing them that if they do not get out before the packs issue, they will end up paying money for having sent in a form to the Department for a scheme about which they have second thoughts.  My belief is that a lot of farmers, big and small, have sent in the form hoping that the Minister would make radical changes to the scheme in view of the massive meetings that have been held in every corner of the country.  It is my belief that as the Minister has made no change to the scheme and has not listened to anybody with regard to it, there will be a massive withdrawal from the scheme among all farmers but again particularly among the farmers with fewer than ten suckler cows because to put simple figures on it, when one takes out the direct cost of paying for the genotyping, a farmer with fewer than ten cattle, with six or seven cattle, will only get a few hundred euro for all his or her trouble.  I think a lot of farmers will decide the risk is not worth the benefit because in five or six years' time, somebody can just ring up and say, "Sorry, we want the money back."  </p><p> It is also written in this that when the inspector comes out to inspect for this scheme, part of the deal will be to do a whole farm inspection and farmers are very reluctant these days for &euro;300 or &euro;400 to have any unnecessary whole farm inspections drawn on to them.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#M00300"><p>I thank Mr. Gleeson for his presentation.  I concur with almost everything Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.  There is awful confusion with regard to this scheme.  There is fear, in particular with regard to the claw back.  If someone takes up the scheme and midway through it, for financial reasons, is no longer able to continue with it, there is a claw back and this could happen after four or five years.  For example, if a farmer falls ill and is unable to continue for the six-year period, there is an understanding that this money will be clawed back.  This is creating a lot of fear and I ask Mr. Gleeson to clarify the situation in his response.</p> <p>  The other issue is that a farmer must be at 60% by the third or fourth year, that 60% of the animals must be tested.  The cost of those tests is around &euro;30 a head which would work out at an average cost of &euro;18 for an average sized herd.  I understand that is at a loss to the applicant.  </p> <p>  I refer to the four to five star genotype which must be realised by June 2019, as stated in Mr. Gleeson's presentation.  If this is not realised, it is clawed back.  In effect, it does not augur well.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said that a lot of people will pull out of the scheme and will not go ahead with it.  What is the level of funding allocated for the scheme?  If the full amount is not taken up, where does the surplus go?  Mr. Gleeson stated that &euro;166 is allocated for training purposes and that it can be done in four hours for those with an average second level education.</p><p>Many of the older farmers, and I mean no disrespect, who live in isolated rural areas might not have that opportunity.  That needs to be considered.  Many people would prefer to know exactly what they are getting into.  There is a lot of confusion, not least among many Oireachtas Members.  Before recommending the scheme to anybody, I would like to know exactly what it entails and the consequences for the farmers and so forth.   </p><p> How does the reliability of four and five star artificial insemination, AI, bulls figure after the tests?  Will the farmer be the victim if the expectation is not met?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#N00200"><p>It is vital to ensure that the genetic background of our herd continues to improve to allow us to penetrate and achieve a greater share of the market.  The market is much more profitable now.  Two decades ago, fewer than two out of every five of our animals was capable of doing so because of our genetic and breeding background.  In my area, the midlands, suckler cows are significant and we are significant beef producers.  This scheme is very important and I will have no truck with anybody advocating that people do not apply by the closing date.  I certainly advocate very strongly that they apply and then make up their own minds.  I would not encourage people to withdraw from the scheme.  I hope there will be amendments and changes that will make it more meaningful and allow people to continue to participate in it.</p><p>People always preface their remarks with the phrase &ldquo;it is my understanding&rdquo;.  That is the problem with the scheme.  The phrase means there is less certainty and a lack of clarity.  That was the bane of the scheme in its infancy.  The way the information was presented was less than helpful, to put it charitably.  The emphasis on claw-back was a major error.  Putting red lines up straightaway strikes fear and terror into people, particularly given that the strength and depth of the <i>force majeure</i>circumstances were not set out comprehensively and illustrated, as they should have been.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the experience of looking back and clawing back from people when they were given payments under the circumstances that prevailed at the time.  Now people are suffering because of high resolution digitisation of cameras.  That is less likely to happen in this area.  That is the rationale for people&rsquo;s fears.  The Department must understand why people are fearful and address those fears in a comprehensive and focused way while dealing with the issues. </p><p>How will farmers maintain the number of animals to fulfil and achieve the four and five star status requests specified for the BDGP herds?  What guarantee can one give to ensure that the genotyping costs will be restricted to 50% of the total payments to farmers?  Why is the number of animals for genotyping being significantly increased when compared with the numbers in the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, trials in 2014?  One would anticipate an increase but the volume, level or nature of the increase is significant.  Very often it would be better to have the training up front, rather than as the final element of the programme.  I know there were time constraints but this is the problem with a scheme that is time constrained.</p><p>We are coming to the troughs late in the day and are now trying to fit it in.  It is being brought in under a different heading and trying to achieve things in an area using a particular heading.  We all understand that, as we should.  Over the six years it will bring in well over &euro;300 million.  I hope that when those teething problems are ironed out, there will be some flexibility to give people confidence in the scheme.  If the first thing we are presented with in school is a ruler instead of being welcomed and we are slapped, we will have a fear for the rest of our time there.  That was a failure of communication on the corporate and political levels.</p><p> It would be foolhardy to dismiss the scheme.  I see a great deal of benefit in it, particularly in the trying circumstances beef farmers are in, and it is important that they get every aid that can be given and that it is used to increase the profitability of the herd.  This could be modified and appropriate flexibility built in to correlate to the individual circumstances of the farmers.  Some farmers are ageing too.  That has to be taken into account.  Some farmers I deal with are ageing and the amount of paperwork is a negative for them.  That may well be part of the issue.  If the Department can get the training right and not laden it with bureaucracy, it is a worthwhile scheme and I would like to see it go ahead when some flexibility and appropriate amendments are made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#O00200"><p>It is good to get this information into the public domain.  The scheme has been fraught with confusion.  It was introduced in rather a hurry and many people contacted us to say there were not sure whether to participate.  The scheme is a good idea and down the road will prove valuable.  We need to be very cautious and aware of the best way to implement it.</p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson mentioned the low carbon footprint throughout his document and to a great extent it is the basis of the scheme.  He stated: &ldquo;The agriculture sector accounts for a high percentage of our overall emissions."  I hope the savings in carbon emissions will be passed on to the other sectors of agriculture, rather than to industry.  Does that make sense?  The number of dairy herds will increase and I hope that any benefits achieved at the expense of beef farmers will be kept in farming in general.  I would like an assurance on that.</p> <p>  I understand the aim is to produce more beef efficiently, and Mr. Gleeson outlined other efficiencies, for example, eight calves for every ten cows, which would give a 20% efficiency.  A total of 54 days out of every 365 are missing where another 14% or 15% could be picked up, giving a total of 35%.  The stocking rate varies by 100%.  There could be more benefit for farmers in examining their efficiencies within holdings rather than this scheme.  I would be conscious of that because the profitability of most agricultural commodities is low.</p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson said the information on BDGP will help farmers retain their best animals but most farmers who rear sucklers professionally would know their best animals.</p><p>The benefit arises when farmers sell their animals at a mart or into the public domain, where people have a reference.  It is similar to milk recording data in the case of cows in that one knows exactly what one is buying.  The same principle should apply to leased land, as many people farming leased land do not have a clue about the fertility of the land they have leased.  </p><p> There is a six-year commitment to this scheme.  It is good to know that the Department is committed to it.  Many people have contacted me about this scheme.  In one case a retiring farmer wanted to reduce his herd from 60 to 30, but that would preclude him from participating in the scheme.  He will continue into his older age to produce 30 fine animals at a high rate and the land he would have leased will go to a young, active farmer.  Therefore, there will be a net benefit to agriculture in that case.  However, under this scheme, he would be precluded from reducing his herd to that extent.  I understand the threshold under the scheme is 20%, although I might be wrong on that percentage.  We should examine that point, because we must realise that our farming population is elderly.  Many of those farmers who have suckler herds will not commit to the workload involved in this for six years, and we should not expect them to do so.  Rather, we should expect them to commit to what they can manage.  Also, if these animals are being recorded under the scheme, there is no reason they cannot continue to be recorded if they are sold to somebody else.  Flexibility is needed here, because behind all of this is a fear of penalties.  We have seen farmers penalised for small items for which they feel hard done by.  There is a lack of trust, and that is the source of the fear.  If we could say that this would be dealt with in a very practical way, that would be an important factor.</p><p> There are cases in which a farmer wants to reduce his suckler herd because of profitability concerns.  We had a serious incident last week, and if the profitability of Irish beef dropped substantially, it would be unfair to expect farmers to continue in production in this sector for five years, making a loss.  God knows farmers are making very little as it is.  Profitability is a very important factor and that aspect needs to be examined.  Nobody stays in farming unless they can make a profit, and we would not expect them to do so.  Those two points need to be examined.  </p><p> There has been a lack of communication about this, and I am glad it has been set out in more detail here.  Every farmer who is involved in this programme should get a pack setting out the detail of it and possibly more meetings on it should be held around the country.  </p><p> Farmers have also expressed concern regarding the speed of genotyping to date.  Can the witnesses give assurances that this will be done in a speedy and reliable fashion and that there will not be any inconsistencies in the results that come through?</p><p> It was stated that the stock must be of four-star or five-star quality.  We all know that there are incidents on farms in which, for example, bullocks are not castrated properly, there are break-out episodes, or animals are put in calf and those calves will not be four-star or five-star quality.  Are there methods whereby such incidents can be reported without incurring a penalty?  These are the practicalities of farming.  The witnesses might comment on those points.</p></speech>

There are a fair few farmers in the beef sector who are not making much of a profit other than what they are getting in direct payments.  Many of the processors expect them to stay in the sector, and their business model is built on that.  I have attended a few meetings in Clare on this issue.  Some criticism was voiced that Department officials were not going out to meet farmers, and on behalf of those farmers, I have two specific questions.  People from the artificial insemination side told people at these meetings about the case of a bull that was brought into Ireland that initially was considered to be a four-star bull but that was suddenly downgraded to a two-star rating.  Those in AI are specialists in this area.  In every other area and every other scheme farmers have to do their utmost, and they must act in good faith.</p><p>If one declares the right amount of land, the land does not change.  It is still the same acreage and bushes do not suddenly appear, although I accept there can be some doubt about what land is or is not eligible.</p><p> If the Department officials were to go out and meet the ordinary farmers they serve, how would they guarantee them that on 30 June 2019 they would have genotyped four-star and five-star bulls?  What could they do to be certain that they meet that requirement and that 50% of the number of reference animals with regard to cows were four-star or five-star quality?  I am talking about what they could do to be certain in this respect as opposed to acting in good faith because acting in good faith is not enough for this scheme.  They either make the cut or they do not.  That is my first specific question.</p><p> At both of the meetings I attended, I noted that the age profile of the participants was quite old, which is not unusual to find at farmers' meetings across Ireland.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said that many farmers will not be able to comply with all these technicalities.  They have been farming a long time, they are heading towards retirement and they are not interested in this.  That came through at those meetings and although there were a few young farmers there who were interested in this, they were new entrants.  They did not have a suckler herd in 2014.  They are considering moving on to another type of farming or they are taking over a farm.  What would the officials say to them?  How can they get involved in this scheme in a worthwhile way?  I presume they are the target for this scheme in that they are the future of Irish agriculture, but such farmers seem to be penalised by the terms of this scheme.  Will any moves be made to include them in the scheme?</p></speech>

The launch of this scheme has created much debate across the country and members have attended a number of meetings on it.  With &euro;300 million available for farmers under this scheme, or &euro;52 million in each year of the scheme, it should have been a very positive story.  The first mistake made was the inclusion of what was written in red on the top of the application form to which many people reacted.  A number of issues have arisen and I hope we will be able to get clarification on them.</p><p>The six-year period is a major problem, as has been mentioned over and over again.  Would it be possible to have a rolling reference year?  This issue has been raised by the farming organisations.  It has been raised with members in their constituency clinics and by people they met at the meetings that have been held.  Many farmers would have had difficulties in 2013 and, as a result, they would not have had their cows in calf and, therefore, calving was down in 2014.  I have met farmers who had cows in their herd and those cows would not have calved until early 2015 because of 2013 being a bad year.  Those farmers could prove that the cows were in their herds right through that period.  There may be some aspect to be considered in that area.A rolling reference year would work or account could be taken of herds and if cows were among herds during that period.</p><p>A review of the star ratings has been promised.  I agree wholeheartedly that we must try to produce animals of a three-star, four-star or five-star rating.  That is  the way forward.  We want to ensure the beef sector is profitable and that is the way to proceed, but we may be trying to do it too quickly.  Four or five years might be too short a period to achieve it.  It may take a little longer.</p><p>It is important to get the information out to farmers.  The Department will be sending out a pack to farmers.  Farmers would have compiled much information dating back eight or nine years on foot of various schemes in which they have participated.  Considerable information would have been gathered.  It would be important to let farmers know as soon as possible the status of their herds in terms of the star rating.  It is vitally important to improve the herd.  We have encouraged people to join the scheme.  Beef has been a very low-income business.  The point was made, and this was the subject of a recent article in the <i>Irish</i><i>Farmers' Journal</i>, that if were had a better quality herd more money could be made by farmers having fewer animals.  Farmers could reduce their herds and produce much better quality animals and as a result they would have more income from fewer animals.  Those are a number of points on the scheme.</p></speech>

Most of the issues I wished to comment on have already been raised.  We started on the wrong foot with this scheme.</p><p>People thought it was a suckler cow scheme.  We must remind people that it is an environment scheme and is equivalent to schemes such as REPS, AEOS or GLAS.  That is the message behind the scheme and why there is a six-year tie-in.  </p></speech>

The market has picked up over the past year but for the previous two years it had been a disaster.</p><p>Many Members have raised the issue of inspections and how farmers fear them.  I hope the new charter will convey to participants that a beef genomics inspection will not be a full compliance inspection.  That fear has turned a lot of people off the scheme.</p><p>The biggest issue is the star rating for replacement stock.  Farmers have between three and five years to get this matter in order.  The Department has stated here that 50% of the female stock is already compliant.  Unfortunately, that may not be the case because the data stems from larger suckler farmers.  A lot of new people wish to join the scheme so we may not have data on their herds.  I do not know how new participants will achieve a rating of three, four or five stars in the next four or five years.  The matter must be examined.  A mid-term review will take place but the Department must be flexible about three, four or five star replacement aspect.</p><p>I wish to mention the rolling reference year.  Last year, 2014, has been set as the reference year so the Department knows exactly how much it must pay out for the next six years.  The rationale for the scheme is to produce better quality beef in a shorter space of time.  I believe that people should be awarded for their efficiencies.  Therefore, if people want to increase numbers by 10%, 15% or 20% flexibility should be shown.  As the assistant secretary said, people can reduce their numbers as long as it is less than 20%.  If people choose to reduce their numbers then other people should be allowed to increase theirs if we want to retain the same size of suckler herd.  We have discussed the growth of the dairy industry on numerous occasions here.  However, there is a danger that the national suckler herd will be reduced. Unless we are seen to support a viable beef suckler herd then we will not have one and, eventually, the majority of our beef will be produced from a dairy stock.  The issues are the rolling reference year and providing flexibility to people so they can increase their herd size.  In terms of the latter, I am not saying increase it by 100%.  People are allowed to increase by a certain percentage every year and will be paid for it.  Such provision will help to support and sustain our beef suckler herd.</p><p>The scheme is due to last six years.  I suggest there is flexibility shown; <i>force majeure </i>can come into place but there are other issues.  If a business is no longer profitable then people should not be asked to stay in it.  That element must be examined.</p><p>The biggest issue is worry about inspections.  There is also an issue with the replacement indexes. </p></speech>

I welcome the officials from the Department and I am glad we have an opportunity to air our grievances.</p> <p>  For the past ten weeks I have travelled the highways and byways campaigning to be elected in a by-election.  On my travels I met the farmers of counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  Therefore, I know there is a lot of fear, distrust and a lack of communication across the board.  </p> <p>  When I came in here today the first thing I learned was that the committee welcomes the fact that Commissioner Hogan, during his term in office, wants to prioritise the simplification of agriculture.</p><p>If that is the case then why has Europe imposed more bureaucracy on the sector through this programme?  People and farmers distrust the scheme and are not fully aware of what it is about.  The Assistant Secretary has stated that 30,000 people have subscribed to the programme.  Last weekend I talked to some farmers in Counties Carlow and Kilkenny who told me that a lot of participants drop out because the bureaucracy and amount of paperwork involved does not make it worth their while.</p><p> One farmer who contacted me told me that he has built up his herd and now breeds purebred bulls and heifers.  He also told me that even though he got the top price when he sold a bull last year the animal would not get a three star rating now and may be granted just two stars.  He has spent 20 years building up his herd to provide a finished cattle product up to factory level standard, yet his bull will not receive a rating of three or four stars.  Where does one go from there?  I think the scheme will not work.</p><p> I ask the Minister and his Department officials present to look at my list of questions and consider these issues.  Will the Minister and his Department postpone a mandatory Euro-star index system?  I suggest that the system be implemented as a guideline for the next five years.  If it is found to work, then we can make it mandatory in 2020, and thus protect the future of the beef farmer in this country.</p><p> I wish to ask about the 2014 reference year.  A lot of young farmers in 2015 had no reference year and may not even have had a farm in 2014.  Therefore, I suggest we give them a two-year chance.  I ask for 2014 and 2015 to be made reference years, which would give them a chance to join the system.  I suggest that each year be taken in its own right.  In other words, I want a rolling system every year which is based on its own merit.  For example, 2014 would be the reference year for 2015, and the same would apply for each year up to 2019.    </p><p> As part of the roll-out of the beef data and genomics programme, I want the rate of 60% replacement reduced to 40% by 2020.  The new system should not be pitched as high as 60% but reduced to 40% in order to give people a chance to participate and remain in the scheme.  </p><p> I want to know the following.  How many farmers have applied to join the scheme?  What will happen to the moneys if they are not fully utilised?  It was mentioned that there are 30,000 applicants and the scheme should be fully subscribed.  If the scheme is not fully taken up, where will the leftover money go?  The matter is of concern to farmers.</p><p> I understand that Dovea Genetics has only one Charolais bull that has a five-star rating.  The company supplies half the country with straws for breeding purposes.  With such a situation, how can we prevent inbreeding?  Farmers participating in the programme will want to get a good-quality animal.  If one buys a heifer in Wexford and a bull in Waterford, the purity of the breed might be in danger.  Not having enough four- and five-star bulls available for breeding is a serious matter.</p><p> I understand that exported calves were not included in the genomics programme last year.  I believe appropriate credit should be given for export animals and they should be acknowledged in the Euro-star index system.  In other words, exported calves were not included, so their mothers did not benefit in terms of the index system.  Why?  They were excluded just because the calves were exported.  If those animals had been sold to factories here their mothers and fathers would have received a rating.  The omission of such exported animals is wrong.</p><p> Will the system be able to efficiently process cases?  Will tests be omitted?  Last year I was told that purebred herd owners had to wait six months to get the result of a genomics test, which prevented them from selling their animals.  As many as 30,000 farmers have applied to join the system.  Is it capable and efficient enough to cater for such a number?</p></speech>

As much as 70% of the suckler herd is located in the west of Ireland in a region that spans the country from County Clare all the way up to County Donegal.</p><p>People were frightened when they received a letter with red writing which referred to clawing back the money.</p><p> Why has the Department decided on an environmental scheme?  Under the previous system the calf was weaned before it was sent to the mart and the farmer had to fulfil certain criteria before he was paid.  I know one answer.  In an era of world trade, one cannot subsidise production.  This was not a subsidy but a means of ensuring that the animal for export would be in better condition and would not contract pneumonia.</p><p> I query the Department's figure of &euro;30,000 because I can tell everybody that all the farmers who talk to me are pulling out of this scheme.  The average size of a herd is 12 cows.  The proposed scheme is not worth the hassle for producers.</p><p> I know Mr. Gleeson has stated that the cost of genotyping will be in line with what it cost last year, but we have heard the Minister say in the past month that the contract will go to tender and the price will come down to approximately &euro;18.  Previously it cost &euro;30.  Are Mr. Gleeson and the Minister on two different wavelengths or are they basing the reduction on the whole herd?</p><p> The ICBF has no statistics on all the calves that are exported to Italy and England.  We are relying on farmers to feed good food to the animals they sell.  If one sells animals that have not been fed well, it will come back when the animals are killed as the quality of the cow will not be good.  </p><p> An issue that we will need to consider in the next three or four years is the general configuration of the animal.  Not so long ago the heifers that a farmer brought to the mart could either be put in calf or killed for meat.  Now we are going down a road whereby the heifers will be classified and those with one to three stars will be sent to the meat factory.  We are walking into a situation in which we are putting the farmers into the hands of the meat factory once more.  When the Scottish farmers came to buy animals, they judged the animal and bought black heifers.  Some of them might not have been classified as four or five star animals, but they were good cattle.  I think the way this scheme is put together will play into the hands of the dairy sector.  I was at one of the meetings on the maternal scheme where a farmer who had Charolais bulls and cows was told straight out that he would probably have to change breeds.  We are choosing to go for a narrow-arsed animal.  We are deciding to go for the animals produced for the dairy sector, which will play into the hands of that sector.  </p><p> There is a fear about entering a six-year cycle to produce a greener animal, an animal that will grow faster and die sooner.  It is expected that everything will be hunky dory.  What if the system does not work out in five years' time?  I have warned that if the proposal does not work out the farmer could face a penalty.  I invite Mr. Gleeson to put himself in the situation of a farmer who goes with this scheme and finds that after five years it has not worked out and then he is told that all the money he has received will be clawed back.  Somebody from the unions would be jumping and hopping if this were to happen to officials, but the farmer gets kicked every time.</p><p> I know the bulls that come in from France or other European countries are just one star or two star animals.  The EU is great for telling farmers right around Europe what to do, but there is no joined-up thinking on bulls bred in England, France or elsewhere to make sure that farmers have accurate information on the calibre of the animal.  Farmers have judged cattle down through the years and can evaluate them based on their experience.  There has been no consultation whatsoever with the ordinary farmer.  The ICBF and the Department have come up with this rushed scheme.  Everybody welcomes the money - nobody is saying that the money is not welcome - but the level of fear means that farmers will walk away from it.  That is a very sad thing.</p></speech>

We had a meeting on the scheme in Tuam three or four weeks ago.  The officials should have been there in front of 700 farmers to go through the scheme with them.  I know a number of people withdrew their application on the basis of what they heard.  Now they want to go back in.</p><p>This is a relatively good news story.  The suckler herd has been crying out for this for years.  It is an environmental scheme, but the work involves the animals.  It is a crossover scheme whereby the farmer is paid per hectare, based on the animals.</p><p> I know from talking to breeders that the price of pedigree bulls with four or five stars has increased in the past number of weeks and is now between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,200 a head.  There is no reliability whatsoever in respect of some of these animals.  Is there a concern that the star rating will fall by the time we start to see the progeny in 20 to 24 months?  A farmer could be buying trouble right now to make up the scheme.  I know Mr. Gleeson says they must have it by 2018, but the farmers are doing it now already.  There must be some concern within the Department that the animals that farmers are buying now will not be good in three years' time and the progeny will not be good in three or four years' time.  I am not trying to be dramatic, but instead of using a good eye to look at animals before he buys them, a farmer might as well buy an animal from the newspaper based on it being a four star or five star animal.  Are the marts able to provide the star rating of the animals that are being sold in the ring?  Up to now the weight was the most important element.</p><p> I welcome the fact that money is being spent on the suckler herd.  Let me give an example of the level of confusion about the scheme.  A farmer in south Galway participated in the genotyping programme - I acknowledge that that scheme is different from the scheme we are discussing - but missed out on genotyping one cow and suffered a 100% penalty.  Mr. Gleeson assures us that this scheme will be flexible, but there is not that level of trust on the ground.  What Mr. Gleeson says and what we as members say is not good enough because the real experience of the past number of years does not bear it out.  It is about building up that trust again.</p><p> There are still too many unanswered questions.  Even though we say there is a lead time of two or three years, people want to know what the review will look at in three years' time.  What can be changed?  If I miss an action, what is the penalty for that one missed action?  What number of penalties add up to a 100% penalty?  There is nothing worse than having a system under which a problem found in the fifth year can result in a requirement for a farmer to return all moneys received for the first four years.  That is no good for the suckler herd.  The majority of farmers are trying to improve their stock and improve the cattle they have for export.  They would welcome the money coming into the suckler herd, but is it worth taking the chance if they cannot work with the Department?  I think the Department is behind the curve on this issue.</p><p> It is a bit ridiculous that this briefing session did not happen six weeks ago, but is happening after the deadline has passed.</p></speech>

Farmers who are less open to change now have to face far more challenges.  I do not think this is feasible.  We are trying to put a square peg into a round hole.  I echo what Deputy Connaughton said in that the issue of trust is massive.  Farmers have already been hit badly in respect of land eligibility clawbacks.  That has left a bad taste in their mouths.  We are tying farmers into a six-year scheme, a scheme under which the ICBF cannot guarantee the star rating of the cattle involved.</p> <p>  There have been significant inconsistencies in the past five years in respect of inspections by the Department.  An as example, let us take land eligibility inspections, whereby one is twice as likely to get a financial penalty from an inspection in County Clare than in County Mayo.  Surely there is not that big a difference in farming practices between Clare and Mayo, yet one is twice as likely to get a penalty in County Clare.  There is a significant level of mistrust, and Mr. Gleeson has not allayed it.  He has not made it his business to go around and explain to farmers in advance of the closing what was involved.</p> <p>  All of us, to one extent or another, have been very badly burned by the housing bubble.</p><p>The Department is creating a bubble in the breeding herd through the use of four and five star ratings, which inflate the price of stock.  These inflated prices are built on quicksand.  A four or five star bull may end up being a two or three star bull, and while the reverse is also the case, consideration has not been given to the fact that farmers will have to buy into this programme at inflated prices.  </p><p> I calculate that a substantial amount of money, approximately &euro;8.3 million, will be spent on genotyping alone.  On what basis are the witnesses adamant that this programme will deliver for farmers, especially given that payments under the previous beef genomics scheme were late because the Department failed to release them before Christmas?  Would the majority of farmers, namely, those with ten or 12 cattle, not be much better off putting another heifer in calf as opposed to tying themselves into this scheme for six years?  What measures will be introduced to improve the entire herd?  A great deal of learning is available on issues such as getting cattle in calf quicker and better use of grass.  This learning should be used to benefit farmers inside and outside the scheme.  What specific measures will be introduced in the next five years to achieve this objective for farmers who are inside and outside the scheme?  That the majority of farmers with smaller suckler herds are not joining the scheme sends a clear message that the Department has failed to achieve its primary objective for this programme.</p></speech>

I accept that members' comments reflect what people are hearing on the ground.  Having listened to what has been said in recent weeks, we are not blind to the issues.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v held up a booklet to demonstrate the complexity of the scheme, and I accept it is a complex, turgid and difficult-to-read document.  To provide a little background, this is a rural development scheme which comes under the rural development programme.  A number of members asked about the six-year period and the reason it is designated an agri-environment scheme.  Previous schemes, including the beef data and genomic schemes in the previous two years and the suckler cow schemes, were national schemes and did not receive co-funding from the European Union.  As EU co-funding is associated with the genomic programme, it must be slotted into an article within the rural development programme.  In this instance, the relevant article is Article 28 of the rural development programme.  Having explored all of the possibilities within the regulation, we found Article 28 was the only one into which we could slot the scheme.  There are valid reasons for including it under Article 28, including that more economically and financially efficient animals are also more climate-efficient. </p> <p>  As to the reasons we are proceeding with the scheme, while I accept everything members have said about individual cases, it is clear that if the calving rate nationally is 80% and getting worse rather than better, one has an asset that is swallowing up profits and not delivering anything.  This is a climate and profitability overhead, and it is important to do something about it.  </p> <p>  Improving genetics is one of the principal vehicles for dealing with fertility, producing heifers that have more milk, and ensuring that weanlings are heavier at weaning time.  Mr. Sean Coughlan of the ICBF is due to come before the joint committee in a couple of weeks.  He knows more about this issue than I do and will be able to describe what genetics can deliver in terms of improved profitability and carbon efficiency.</p><p>On the six-year timescale for the programme, it is a statutory requirement under the rural development regulation that schemes approved under Article 28 are of six years' duration.  The principle behind this is very good.  As the Commission will explain, a one-year approach will not deliver the agri-environmental dividend the Commission wants agri-environment schemes to deliver.  It wants measures introduced that will deliver improvements over a number of years.  The more traditional agri-environment schemes include programmes with which members will be familiar, for example, the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environmental options scheme, AEOS.  Furthermore, a farmer joining a scheme should know what he must do and how much will he be paid.  This is a very sound principle and as with all sound principles, it implies difficulties.  In this case, the difficulty is the commitment to actions over a six-year period during which a farmer's circumstances may change. <br/><br/>A number of clarifications have been issued on the nature of the six-year commitment.  I will go through these and perhaps my colleagues will prompt me if I omit anything.  The scheme allows for <i>force majeure </i>circumstances on a farm to be taken into consideration, for example, where a farmer becomes sick or loses land through no fault of his own.  A variety of <i>force majeure</i>circumstances are allowed under which a farmer may extract himself from the obligations without penalty.  In addition, if a farmer decides for commercial reasons to lease or sell his land, he can extract himself from the scheme without penalty.  If he retains enough land - in other words, the maximum payable area -  to deliver his obligations under the scheme, he must do so.  <br/><br/>The third area issue that arises is penalties.  I understand precisely the reasons people are concerned about penalties and accept the comments made about the red print in the document that was circulated.  In some ways, the expression, &quot;damned if one does and damned if one does not&quot;, applies.  People have to understand that they are entering a six-year scheme.  On the other hand, the penalty regime in the scheme is complicated.  A long list of penalties is included in the terms and conditions.  However, the circumstances in which a clawback of funds can occur are rare and unusual and would require someone to disengage from the scheme.  To the extent that penalties apply, they are graded in various ways.  For example, if someone delivers between 80% and 100% of the data collection, a proportionate reduction will apply based on the percentage of the data submitted.  If somebody delivers less than 80% of the data, no payment will issue for data collection for the year in which the breach occurs.  On genotyping, if someone delivers between 90% and 100% of the genotyping, a reduction will apply to the genotyping element of the payment only, based on the percentage that has been genotyped.  A penalty description is provided and the penalties are proportionate and reflect the minimum required under the regulatory requirements and approval of the Commission. <br/><br/>People fear that a breach of any condition of the scheme will result in a clawback of funds but that is not the case.  It is important that applicants, of whom we have 30,000, engage with the Department and their Teagasc advisers and that we get this information to people as quickly as possible.  <br/><br/>A question was asked about the level of genotyping.  This is a costs incurred and income foregone scheme, as are all rural development programmes.  For example, this approach also applies to the rural environment protection scheme.  A framework has been built on costs incurred by the farmer.  For example, if we were to reduce the 60% requirement, the minimum required would be that we reduce the payment by whatever is the cost of the genotyping and whatever overhead we have imputed for the effort involved in doing the work.</p><p>That is not something we would choose to do; we would have to do it.  That is the way the payment is built up.</p></speech>

There is another important point here.  We have been through a complex and difficult negotiation with the Commission.  This is a kind of leap for the Commission as it is an aid to a suckler scheme that involved getting approval from the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Directorate General for Climate Action and the Directorate General for the Environment, and persuading them that this scheme, which will improve the efficiency and profitability of the beef sector in Ireland, will also deliver benefits for the environment.  We have just come through that process and have a scheme approved.  To be perfectly frank, going back to the Commission with another negotiation that would have to go through inter-service consultation would put at risk the payments we want to make this year.</p> <p>  The Minister has already agreed that we will engage with farm bodies in the context of a mid-term review.  The concerns that emerge as we run the programme will be taken into account.  What is really important now is that we engage with individual applicants, that they talk to their Teagasc advisers and that they get clear information on the scheme.  We will try and do that as much as we can.  </p> <p>  People have a difficulty with the replacement strategy.  All I can say on it is that this is something on which we engaged carefully with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and experts.  We are assured there are enough animals in the system to address the issues on the replacement strategy.  For example, 75% of herds already have a four or five-star bull in the terminal or maternal index.  We think there are enough replacement animals out there, based on the best information we have from people who know what they are talking about, and I have confidence that they know what they are talking about.</p> <p>  There was an issue about the reliability of the index.  An index, by its nature, evolves over time.  There is no doubt that the information we are gathering now will improve the quality and reliability of the index we have.  I would expect those changes to be incremental.  The scheme requires animals to be of four or five-star standard at the date of genotyping or at the date of purchase.  If there is a change in the star rating of an animal afterwards, it should not result in any penalties for the farmer.</p> <p>    Deputy Connaughton raised issues about communications with farmers and I accept there is a view that the Department might have attended Irish Farmers Association, IFA, meetings and so on.  We have written and sent information sheets to 70,000 farmers, spoken to 8,000 farmers on the phone through our helpline and have put frequently asked questions up on our website.  We will have training as part of the programme, so that people involved with it will be taught how to use the indexes.  It is important that people get information directly from the Department and from those who are running the scheme.  In the next week or two, we will send a letter to people which will be quickly followed by information from the ICBF on the star ratings of the herds.  At that point, people can make a decision.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned a case in which someone was told that if they did not withdraw from the scheme before they had the letter from the ICBF, they would be penalised.  That is absolutely incorrect.</p></speech>

According to the farmer, who is not a constituent, he was told that once he got that pack, he would owe the money for it to the ICBF.</p></speech>

I accept absolutely that somebody told him that but it is simply not correct.  People will have up to the time of the payment or an inspection to determine whether they want to engage with the scheme.  We want to allow people the maximum flexibility.</p><p>There was an issue about the profile of herds and applicants.  I only have the figures in today but, looking at the 30,000, there is a broad spread of applicants from around the counties, predominantly in the west, and there is also a broad spread of herd sizes, from the very smallest to large herds.</p></speech>

From the Department's own data, 80% of farmers with fewer than ten cows have said "No".  Based on the data I was given yesterday, only 8,677 herd owners with fewer than ten cows have applied for the scheme.  I think Mr. Gleeson will find a huge rate of attrition among those.  I told all the farmers in Connemara to apply because we were hoping to have a bit of common sense about this, yet if the rules change, they will find they are out.  There are 39,605 farmers in that group, so the number of farmers with ten cows or fewer who have applied equates to 22%.  In the next group up it is 53%.  It then goes in around 70% for the remainder and does not vary that much.  The biggest cohort, 55%, of 73,000 farmers have ten or fewer suckler cows.  Only 22% applied, so in other words, virtually 80% of those farmers said, "Sorry, no thank you."  It is a massive number of farmers.  It might not count at the Department because they do not count for an awful lot of cows, but these people are trying to live.</p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson says he has 80% calving.  Did it strike him that, as Teagasc points out all the time, when he takes out the single farm payment, the disadvantaged areas scheme payment, the areas of natural constraint payment and so on, there is no profit in the farming of suckler cows?  More calving is probably a zero-sum game in terms of increased profitability.  Farmers are cute; why would they break their necks buying more feedstuff and increasing their calving rate if there is no profitability?  If Mr. Gleeson can get more profit for the farmer, he will find that the farmer will suddenly get his calving rate up.  Farmers will do things that can bring profit.  All these artificial methods of trying to boost production are only doing what they did in New Zealand; they are making the factories richer and doing nothing for farm incomes.</p></speech>

Approximately 78% of herd owners have less than 20 cows.  Does Mr. Gleeson see?  I got the figures yesterday evening from Mr. Pat Preston in Mr. Gleeson's own Department.  I am telling him that the herd size is tiny.  Therefore, when he says 60% of applicants have fewer than 20 cows, that is inevitable.  Based on the figures I was given yesterday, 22% of farmers with ten cows or fewer have applied for this scheme.  They represent 55% of the herd owners in that group.  Seventy-eight percent of herd owners have fewer than 20 cows.  Obviously, if there any applicants at all, the vast majority of them will have to be in that cohort.</p></speech>

The Department received about 28,000 applications, so it is about 60%.  That is a fact.  In simple terms, the situation becomes much more acute at ten and under.  In case people think these are all in the hills of the west of Ireland, from Donegal to Kerry, they can forget it.  These small herds are spread throughout the country.  We do not have 40,000 herds in the west of Ireland.  Therefore, the fact still remains, as Deputy McNamara said, that this scheme is totally unattractive to small herdowners and is geared towards the guy with the big automatic computerised operation for all the data keeping.  That claim is borne out by the figures.  </p> <p>  I  will make the following prediction.  I went on radio and encouraged farmers who had between three to nine cows to apply because we hoped the Department would adopt a common sense approach.  Unfortunately, I must now explain to those farmers that the Department will not budge an inch and that farmers will have to weigh advantages against risks before participating in the scheme.  With or without me, when the packs arrive the Department will find there is a massive attrition rate among small herdowners.  I do not know if any of my colleagues on the committee, who deal with farmers at marts around the country, agree with me.  I believe the Department will find that of the 8,600 farmers, or 20% of applicants, that 50% of them could easily vamoose.</p> <p>  The scheme reminds me of the Grand National.  Let us say 28 horses line up and that they represent 28,000 applicants.  The pack comes out at the first jump and the scene is like Beecher's Brook on a bad day where all the runners tumble down.  The participants will go over all the jumps over the six years but at the end of the scheme, we will be lucky to wind up with 20,000 farmers finishing and the Department will claw it all back from the rest.</p></speech>

If one has cows and one bulls them with five star bulls from this year on - as we all know, the ICBF changes its data three or four times a year - by the time a heifer comes to calving, she could have between nine and 12 judgments on her, so her rating could be reduced to two or three stars.  How does the Department intend to address the problem?</p></speech>

How can a participant be certain, when it comes to having the 50%, that the replacement cows and bull are four or five stars?  As Deputy Fitzmaurice pointed out, one could start off with a four or five star bull but end up with a two star bull, notwithstanding one's best efforts.  How can one be certain about star ratings?  How does a new entrant into beef farming join the scheme?</p></speech>

There is concern about the matter.  As has been said by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, if the Department does not make some changes to the scheme, then an awful lot of people will drop out.  It will not be worthwhile participating in the scheme unless one is a big farmer with between 50 and 80 cows.  A small farmer with ten cows will only receive &euro;60 or &euro;65 each or &euro;650 a year, so it will not be worthwhile for him or her to participate.  The scheme will not benefit small farmers who are the very people we are trying to keep in beef production.  There must be some changes that we can made to make the scheme more attractive.</p><p> Testing is another factor.  What will happen when one runs out of animals after conducting tests for four and five years?  Where will one find animals to test?  According to the terms of the scheme, one must buy another ten animals just to conduct a test, but farmers cannot afford such a practice.  I am a beef farmer and I rear calves right up until they become beef cattle.  Therefore, I know that farmers cannot afford to buy new animals.  If a farmer does not have the money, where will he or she get animals to fill the quota stipulated by the Department?  I cannot fill the quota so I must buy an animal or animals and prices will increase as a result.  The beef market will go haywire because I and others will have to bid against other buyers.</p></speech>

I want an answer to the following.  If one buys a bull with a two-star rating, and one is a good judge of an animal, yet the bull turns out to be a four or five-star animal down the road, is one complying with the rules of the scheme?   Is it the case that an animal will not be in compliance with the scheme if it has been purchased as a two-star bull?  If that is the case, then the scheme will take good stockmen out of the sector altogether.</p></speech>

On 30 June 2019, one must have at least one stock bull that has been genotyped at four or five stars on a holding.  If a bull is genotyped at four or five stars then he is genotyped at four or five stars.</p> <p>  Let me answer the question about payments.  This is not an income support scheme.  We are trying to do something that we believe to be in the best interests of the herd and of farmers generally.  It is not in the interests of large or small farmers to carry animals that are deficient, and I think everybody would accept my view.  The average payment for a herd of 20 cows would be &euro;1,750.  We expect the cost of genotyping to be around &euro;350.  I say this to put some perspective on costs, because there is a misunderstanding about the matter.  </p> <p>  On the question of genotyping, part of the reason for the 60% testing requirement is that there will be more four and five star animals available.  The concerns people have about the availability of four and five star animals would be exacerbated if we had a smaller testing requirement.  Such a percentage will help to make more of these animals available.</p> <p>  In terms of spreading the benefits to the herd generally, even if there is testing of the core 30,000 herds, better animals will be produced which will filter down through the system.  All of that would benefit everybody in the sector, not just participating herds.</p> <p>  On the question about genotyping in terms of the availability of four and five-star heifers, we understand there will not be any difficulty with the availability of four and five-star heifers.  We understand that there are enough four and five-star heifers in the system and the number will increase as the scheme goes on.  The Minister has said that we will engage with farm bodies.  We will engage, through the scheme, on its operation and we will see how it is working.  There will be a mid-term review.  Under the rural development programme there would be such a review anyway.  We will examine any of the difficulties that emerge in the operation of the scheme and build this into any mid-term review.</p> <p>  It is not the case that there is an unwillingness to move.  The difficulty is that the scheme has been approved by the Commission on the basis of a regulatory framework which has a certain rigidity in it, to the extent that we cannot move.  For example, the six-year requirement is stipulated by the legislation.</p></speech>

The ICBF will judge a bull on 12 tests.  One will start off in good faith with one's animal and then one will get a calf.  What happens if the rating changes, following 12 different tests, by the time the heifer has had her calf?  Where does the Department stand on that issue?  Does one have to buy a five-star animal?  I expect a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

Some people have the idea that they can start with a certain kind of animal and end up in the same place by 2020, but that would not happen anyway.  There will be a replacement of females in beef herds between now and 2020.  The best information we have from the ICBF is that there will be enough four and five star animals in the system to meet the requirements of the scheme.</p></speech>

The Department's star rating will give one the equivalent of a lowland sheep, but when it comes to viability in the harsher conditions of parts of Leitrim, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Kerry, it will not suit the GAEC.</p> <p>  Many farmers produce their own replacement animals instead of going on the market and buying them.  Will it be a big challenge for them to get their replacements up to four or five stars without going on the market?  If they go on the market, will they get something that they think suits their particular land?</p><p>Since AI is out of the question on an off-shore island like Inishbofin, will each farmer, irrespective of herd size, be required to own four or five-star stock?</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, the opposite is the case and four and five stars will produce lighter and more robust and efficient animals that are better suited to marginal land.  I do not think it is the case that one is talking about breeding a lowland sheep.  It is the case that one is breeding a more robust cow that calves at a younger age, calves more easily, requires less inputs and has more milk for the calf.  These things will ultimately save farmers expenditure on feed and vets at calving and improve their overall profitability.  They are characteristics that are equally suited to farmers in the west and on marginal land.</p> <p>  I must confess that the situation pertaining to the islands had not occurred to me.  The requirements of the scheme are that a farmer must use AI involving a five-star bull or they can rent or lease in a bull, as people do, subject to the normal animal health considerations.  A farmer can rent an animal in the same way as they always did.</p></speech>

Will the Department go back and look at the situation on the islands?  I was talking to a farmer yesterday who was farming on an island but the island happened to be in the Shannon.  He had the exact same problem so Mr. Gleeson should not think that this is just a problem in the west.  In five years when the guy gets penalised, it is no good saying page 15 of the rules say that the Department cannot help him.  Can the Department sort that out now?</p></speech>

The Department needs to get more information out because people think that a four or five-star animal is a U or E-grade animal.  It is not.  The Department must get the information out that it is not just on confirmation but is about milk production and things like that.  A Kerry cow could have a four or five-star rating because it has the maternal instincts for more milk.  The Department must get that information out there.  We see how a four or five-star bull is about confirmation of production but it is totally different on the maternal side.  People are working under a misapprehension about the four or five-star rating on the maternal side.</p></speech>

The maternal index includes terminal traits.  It is not a simple thing.  We are trying to produce beef but we are trying to produce it off cows that are robust and efficient and calve easily, so that is the delicate balance that the four and five-star rating tries to achieve.  If one looks at the bull side, it is four or five stars on either of the terminal or maternal index so this is not driving things one way.  It is just trying to produce a more efficient cow that improves profitability and efficiency.  It is not a one-way street.</p></speech>

Before we wrap up, I have two questions.  There was not much discussion since I arrived about the stocking density.  Is the stocking density of 1.5 very rigid?</p><p>The suckler farmer would be very uneasy or unhappy compared with the dairy farmer who would regard the stocking density as a serious advantage.  A stocking density of 1.5 calved cows per hectare will prevent a number of farmers from qualifying.  It may eliminate some of the bigger farmers.  These are the farmers who may be more progressive and they will feel a little left out in this regard.  What is the position on this issue?</p><p> What will the position be in the event of the doomsday scenario of a low take-up under the scheme, resulting in a pool of money left over as we move towards the back end of 2018, 2019 or 2020, for example?</p></speech>

We are saying a stocking density of 1.5 animals per hectare is used to calculate the maximum number of hectares that will attract payment.  In other words, what we will do is divide the number of calved cows in 2014 by 1.5 to come up with a maximum payable area.  That does not mean that somebody cannot have a higher stocking density than 1.5 calved cows per hectare, but he or she will be paid only on the qualifying number of hectares.  Some 50% of suckler farmers have a stocking density of 0.5 or lower.  Some 90% have a stocking density of one or lower, while 98% have a stocking density below 1.5.  The 2% who do not have a stocking density lower than 1.5 can still apply under the scheme.</p></speech>

The issue we bring to members' attention relates to young farmers who, through no fault of their own, are not catered for under the national reserve arrangements in terms of entitlements under the new basic payment scheme.  The ICSFA believes this issue must be revisited if we are serious about supporting the future of agriculture and encouraging those who have worked hard to make a go at farming with very little EU or national support to date.  The issue essentially revolves around the technical definition of a young farmer set out in EU regulations which refer to a young farmer as having commenced farming in the five years preceding the first submission of an application under the new basic payment scheme.  This definition was set out in reference to the young farmers' top-up payment.  It was also used initially in the definition of a young farmer under the national reserve scheme.</p><p>A key issue in the debate on CAP reform revolved around the definition of a young farmer as being under 40 years of age.  This limit continues to apply but the national reserve regulations were subsequently revised so that old young farmers, that is, farmers who commenced their farming activities in 2008 or 2009 would also be eligible to apply for entitlements.  The off-farm income limit of &euro;40,000 which applies in all cases has resulted in a number of anomalies.  It is important that farmers who commenced farming prior to 2008 are given a chance.  The basic entitlements allocated under the new basic payment scheme are linked to the rate of entitlements held by farmers under the old single payment scheme.  As members will be aware, these entitlements reflect the farming activities carried out during the original reference period from 2000 to 2002.  A cohort of farmers who commenced their farming activities too late to benefit from the original period are now considered to have been farming for too long a period to get a fair opportunity under the new scheme.  The problem is that the national reserve during the single payment era imposed a restrictive ceiling on off-farm income of &euro;30,000, as well as limits on allocations per hectare.  We ask that farmers in this category be brought up to the national average payment per hectare, which is approximately &euro;250.  That is a very modest amount for hard working young farmers.  ICSA believes that it is profoundly unfair to leave these farmers behind.  It is welcome that a way was found for old young farmers but it is now time to resolve the unfair treatment of the remaining farmers.</p><p> We cannot complain about the age structure of the industry if we allow a cohort of young farmers to be left behind.  We have met a considerable number of farmers in this category and, in all cases, we were impressed by the hard work, courage and determination they brought to farming.  It is a major flaw in the national reserve that regulations do not allow for a five year use-it-or-lose-it clause.  The options should include a substantial claw back on entitlement sales to ensure there are funds in the national reserve.  At this point we have no information on how many of the current applicants to the national reserve will be successful, or how much money will be left over.  The key message is that the farmers concerned have a compelling case based on merit and we have to do the right thing by them.</p></speech>

We are known in the media as the forgotten farmers.  I started farming in 2001, which was the last year of the reference period.  From a financial point of view, I had to pay for my agricultural course and started out by leasing my land.  By the time I had enough money to lease the land and pay for my agricultural course, I had fallen out of the category because I was not able to lease sufficient ground to draw down installation aid.  In the following year I had land on a five year lease but by the time I applied to the national reserve, the lease was down to four years and I fell between the stools once again.  I have fought this for the last 13 years but I seem to have fallen into the cracks rather than crossing over them.</p> <p>  Along my journey I have fought against the big farmer who was on a single farm payment.  I had 32 hectares and my overall payment was &euro;780.  I fought against that big farmer to be able to lease my land and stay in this game.  I was told that we would be brought up in the subsequent round of CAP in 2013.  It is now 2015 and I have been left out once again.  This was an extremely difficult year.  One expects things to get easier with time and effort but I am still fighting against the big fellow and now we have the new entrant with &euro;40,000 in off farm income and &euro;300 per hectare.  My payment equates to approximately &euro;28 per hectare.  When I tried to lease land, I was beaten from both sides because I was competing with the new entrant and the big farmer.</p><p>From meetings we have held around the country, we have discovered that a maximum of 3,800 farmers are in a similar situation.  I recognise that not all of these farmers have a green certificate, and that some may meet different criteria, but all they want is to be brought to the national average - the 25% top-up and 60% into the hand.  I am 33 years old.  I stayed in farming, which is the backbone of rural Ireland.  We lost our youth in every other walk of life.  We have to do something for these farmers.  We have been in this game for 13 years and it is unfair that we are being kicked to the kerb.  We feel we are being discriminated against.  We paid for our green certificates but the work we have done is not being acknowledged.  If we get a single farm payment, we will return twice or three times the amount we receive to our local villages and towns.</p></speech>

I am the national president of Macra na Feirme and I am accompanied by Mr. Bryan Hynes, chairman of Macra na Feirme's agricultural affairs committee, and Mr. Derrie Dillon, agricultural affairs manager.</p> <p>  The new CAP reform has brought positive and important incentives for young farmers, including the young farmer top-up for those who are within five years of set-up.  However, the rules for establishing and administering young farmer schemes under the basic payment and rural development programmes have not had the same positive impact on old young farmers.  Certain old young farmers have been particularly disadvantaged by the CAP.  Many of them have either low or no basic payments under the CAP for a variety of reasons related to the historical model on which the single farm payment was based.  This situation has been compounded by the introduction of a five-year rule for eligibility for support, with the result that they lack the support of the CAP system to help them manage income volatility or to facilitate investment in their farm businesses.  The convergence model under the new CAP will bring them within 60% of the national average basic payment by 2019.</p> <p>  In terms of Macra na Feirme&rsquo;s active engagement on young farmer issues and developments in the CAP process, we work closely with the European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, which is the representative body for 2 million young farmers in Europe, and we are active participants at Irish and European level in developing policy on young farmers with the various institutions and stakeholders.</p> <p>  I will now outline the background to the situation in which these young farmers find themselves, following which I will describe a young farmer case study, and then I will summarise the key issues and possible solutions for these old young farmers.  Historically, some of the most far-reaching and fundamental changes in the Common Agricultural Policy to date have arisen out of the Luxembourg agreement, which allowed farmers who previously claimed production-based premiums to receive a decoupled payment instead.  This broke the link with production, and subsequent CAP reforms used historical data to determine the value of farmers' basic payments.  We believe in the underlying principle that farmers should be rewarded for developing their businesses and generating economic activity.  Basic payment allocations to farmers should reflect this principle.  As a general principle, land and basic payment should be released from those who do not want to engage in agricultural production and made available to active farmers who want to produce food.</p> <p>  Our policy fundamentally differs from other proposals in the last reform in that we believe payments to individual farmers should move from being on a historic basis to being on a rolling reference year basis whereby farmers would continue to be paid a basic payment but according to their current level of farming activity.  The main motivation for this approach is that over time the historic basis for basic payment becomes less equitable as farmers develop and change their enterprises, so that their activities now are different from their activities between 2000 and 2002.  The only obligation on farmers currently is to maintain their lands in good agricultural and environmental condition, with no obligation or encouragement to maximise the productive potential of the land.  Furthermore, the historic system does not adequately take into account new entrants and young farmers who did not establish a basic payment entitlement in the reference years.</p> <p>  The introduction of a mandatory young farmer basic payment scheme under Pillar 1 to deliver a 25% top-up of the average basic payment on a maximum of 50 ha for the first five years in farming was a very positive element of the reforms and a policy for which we had lobbied on behalf of young farmers.</p><p>The young farmer measure is worth approximately &euro;800 million annually for European young farmers and up to &euro;24 million for Irish young farmers, or &euro;64 per hectare.  The basic payment national reserve is also a very important mechanism to ensure young farmers get a fair start relative to their established counterparts in farming.  For the first time, the EU Commission's proposals emphasise that national reserve entitlement shall prioritise young farmers who are commencing their activities.  The change to prioritising the allocation of entitlements from national reserves to young farmers is particularly welcomed by the European Court of Auditors.</p><p> Young farmers who are potentially eligible for the national reserve includes those who commenced farming since 2010 and meet the additional objective criteria such as off-farm income limits and educational requirements.  An additional category in the national reserve is based on a hardship case for young farmers who commenced farming in 2008 or 2009, due to the fact that installation aid was suspended.  Macra acknowledges the introduction of this category, however there are still young farmers who commenced before 2008 with low levels of basic payments.  The rules of the basic payment national reserve, as implemented at member state level, can constitute a barrier to entry for certain young farmers and new entrants when applying for entitlements.  Many of our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of single farm payment they were able to establish from previous national reserves.</p><p> Farmers who commenced farming activity before 2008 are not eligible to apply to the basic payment national reserve.  These older young farmers who have low or no basic payments feel that the CAP system has failed them since many of them fell outside the criteria of various schemes in the past.  The ongoing replenishment of the national reserve is also a concern and Macra has proposed that mechanisms should be put in place to guarantee that entitlements are available in the national reserve every year for young farmers applying for it.  We need to learn the lessons from past national reserve and avoid a scenario of inadequate resources to meet the needs of young farmers.  The experience in recent years has been that the national reserve does not provide sufficient payment to new entrants as it becomes depleted of funds as there is no sufficient ongoing mechanism to fund a national reserve.</p><p> In Pillar 2, the introduction of the 60% young farmer targeted agricultural modernisation scheme on certain capital investment for start-up young farmers within their first five years of set-up was also important in the absence of the introduction of an installation aid scheme.  The key obstacles for young farmers starting up in farming in order of priority are: transfer costs, conveyancing, cost of stock and land improvement.  Many young farmers are not in a position to make significant physical infrastructural developments within their first five years of set-up.  They have had to prioritise investments that will give a short to medium-term return.  Therefore, Macra believes that the 60% young farmer TAMS should be extended to all young farmers in order to benefit from the support.</p><p> The overall CAP package for farmers is positive but the measures for young farmers are restrictive and therefore more limited in their impact.  This amounts to a missed opportunity to support all young farmers.  Accommodating older young farmers in the national reserve, and all young farmers in the 60% young farmer TAMS was to deliver a comprehensive package for Ireland&rsquo;s young farmers.  The sympathies towards these young farmers need to be converted into action.  </p><p> The EU Commission definition of a young farmer under the new CAP is a young farmer who has established in farming and generally activated a herd number within a five year timeframe.  This is a very restrictive definition, with the result that a young farmer who activated a herd number at 18 years of age is no longer defined as a young farmer at 23 years of age, while a farmer who activates a herd number at 39 is still defined a young farmer at 43 years.  The definition is also linked to both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the CAP.  Macra believes that the EU definition of a young farmer needs to be reviewed as part of the simplification of the CAP and the mid-term review.</p><p> The basic payment national reserve needs to be a real support for young farmers who find themselves with no or low entitlements.  It needs to be available throughout the duration of CAP 2014-2020, so that as each year passes, a new tranche of young, trained farmers will have the opportunity to get into the reserve each year and get on the first rung of the ladder for a successful career in agriculture.  Otherwise, this group of young farmers will become the next older young farmer group who will have missed out on the opportunity to access young farmer schemes.  The national reserve must remain available to young farmers and further linear reductions on basic payments may be required to replenish the national reserve.  Young farmers accessing the national reserve should not be tied up in red tape and ruled out by a range of restrictive criteria, which is generally implemented at the discretion of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> In regard to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, farming is a capital intensive, expensive industry for young farmers to develop their farm businesses in.  The definition of a young farmer as one who commenced farming within the past five years to activate the 60% young farmer TAMS is restrictive.  Many young farmers will have infrastructural deficits on farms that need to be addressed.  Macra believes that the 60% grant rate should apply to all young farmers.</p><p> The new CAP reform will benefit many young farmers through the young farmers' top up, the national reserve and the 60% young farmer targeted agricultural modernisation scheme.  However, there is also a group of older young farmers who for a variety of reasons related to the historical model upon which the single farm payment is based fall between rules and miss out on measures intended for their benefit.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Finan on his election as president of Macra na Feirme.  The presentations speak for themselves.  When the Minister was negotiating the CAP, he brought in an unnecessarily  restrictive definition of a young farmer.  He said there was not only an age requirement but also a restriction based on when one had entered farming.  As has been pointed out, a farmer could be disqualified at 23 years of age and be eligible at 39 years of age.  The Minister's explanation was that he wanted young farmer provisions to be mandatory across all member states.  I suggest that it might have been better for the Minister to allow each country the flexibility to provide its own definition of a young farmer, and leave each country make up their minds on what it did or did not want to do for young farmers.  The whole CAP was characterised by much more national confidence.  I have no doubt that in reality all countries would have activated a young farmer provision even had it not been mandatory.  I cannot see any country that would have passed it over.</p> <p>  I believe we can all support what was said about priority access for all young farmers under 40 to the average rate of basic payment plus greening.  The Department needs to be pressed on how to get there.  I understand that the Department considers the old young farmers to be disadvantaged group. Therefore, although they are not officially young farmers, we can get them through by calling them disadvantaged.  I do not know why the Department could not call young farmers super-disadvantaged.  Has Macra any idea of the potential cost of this? Presumably some old young farmers, or forgotten farmers, have quite decent entitlements.  Sometimes when people are making a case they think it is important to picture it as very expensive.  Sometimes I believe that it might be useful if it was not so expensive because it would be easier to fund.  I wonder if we could find out? I believe it is important that we do this and that we fund it.  The mechanisms are there if the will is there to do it.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the points raised on capital investment.  When young farmers get into farming it is hard for them to have the ready cash because they have not had years of opportunity to build up reserves.  The temptation is to go to the bank to borrow excessive amounts, which puts the farm regime under pressure.  I believe the Minister should make the simple decision that all farmers under the age of 40 should get the grant at the 60% rate.  The Minister needs to go to Europe to make the case that Europe should not be short-changing young farmers and that young farmers are those who are chronologically young, not just farmers who have entered into farming in the last five years.  I support the two points made and I think something should happen.  I hope the committee sees itself as being in a position to support the clear-cut case put here, and I believe the costs would be quite modest.</p></speech>

I believe there is unanimous support on this committee, but where it goes from here will pose the difficulty.  The Department and the Minister, deliberately or otherwise, are discriminating against old young farmers.</p><p>Up to 3,800 farmers will be affected by this.  Mr. Kenneth O&rsquo;Brien said his entitlement was &euro;780 for 32 hectares, working out at &euro;28 per hectare.  All of us know that if it were not for the entitlements, many in the sector would not be able to survive.  How one can survive on that payment is baffling.  It is an indictment of the system and how it has failed these farmers.</p><p> The money will have to be found to remedy this.  We are trying to get more young people involved in the farming sector.  When one has this example of discrimination hanging out there, however, it is an awful disincentive to young people.  Have the associations been advised legally on this?   Has any legal advice been sought on it?</p><p> Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan stated: "Individual farmers should move from a historic basis to a 'rolling reference year' basis whereby farmers would continue to be paid a basic payment but based upon their current level of farming activity."  Would that be based on production or effort?  If it were based on production, then it would affect farmers on marginal land and so forth.  Their activity is just as strong and committed as that of farmers on good arable land.  Will Mr. Finan clarify that for me?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015061600002#KK00200"><p>I welcome the associations and thank them for their presentations.  I understand the conundrum in which they find themselves.  It does not seem so many years ago that I was in their position applying for installation aid and all that went with it.  The system back then was a lot easier, however.  One applied for area aid on whatever crops one produced.  Once one did it according to the standards, one got paid.  I have put down parliamentary questions to the Minister on this.  The answer I am getting back is that many farmers in this category have received the benefit of free quota, low-price quota, etc.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier, we need to get the facts.  I have asked several people affected their details so that we can clearly show that there is unfairness in the system.  A little bit of homework needs to be done and all it will take is a few cases to prove it.</p> <p>  I am not happy about the suggestion of a linear reduction in basic payments, in view of the fact that many people, including myself, have already taken up to a 40% reduction.  The associations need to be conscious that it is not a bonanza time for farmers.  I agree that we need to support the active farmer.  Therein lies the problem.  Macra na Feirme stated: &ldquo;The basic payment should be released from persons who do not want to engage in agricultural production.&rdquo;  That is easier said than done.  From what I can see with the single farm payment, in the past, when one produced an acre of grain, one paid, say, &euro;150 per acre and collected a similar figure.  However, today, if one rents land from someone who has a single farm payment, the payment goes back to them and then one pays an additional &euro;200 or &euro;300 an acre.  The system as it evolved with decoupling has crippled the active farmer.  I feel the single farm payment has become a social welfare system for Irish farming.  It is not staying with the active farmer but is actually going out to pay for ground.  Effectively, what was &euro;150 in rent on land a few years ago is now &euro;150 plus the entitlement.  That is going in the wrong direction.  If we got the facts and figures on several individual cases, we could get a costing on it and make a good argument on the associations&rsquo; behalf.</p> <p>  I also have a disagreement with the use of off-farm income.  It should play no role in eligibility for several reasons.  Many working spouses of farmers may have lost their jobs.  We should also be encouraging diversification and encouraging farmers to earn off-farm income.  They should be encouraged to earn, not discouraged from doing so.  Off-farm income has kept many farms viable over the past several years.  The simplification process in the review is the time to tidy this up.  If the associations get the facts behind the stories presented today, then the arguments will be much stronger.</p> <p>  I thank the delegations for attending today&rsquo;s meeting.</p></speech>

I was particularly struck by Mr. Kenneth O'Brien&rsquo;s because I have met a number of those farmers categorised as &ldquo;Others&rdquo; which he represents.  He put his case eloquently in terms of how people are impacted on by a cohort of anomalies which are historic in origin.  No matter how fast he ran, he still found himself going backwards.  It is an unusual achievement, meaning the efforts he made were reduced to nought.</p> <p>  There are 3,500 farmers in this category and not all of them will qualify because some may lose out due to agricultural qualifications and various other factors.  It is a pity installation aid was done away with because it was a simple way of getting farmers established and re-established, particularly with the significant set-up costs for young farmers.  Some of the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures are useful, such as the 60% under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme and the 25% top-up.</p> <p>  It is time this anomalous position regarding the forgotten farmers was addressed.  Any cost-benefit analysis would show the country would gain positively.  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that the money required would be low, approximately &euro;10 million.  It has to be found to remedy this anomaly.  Ultimately, if these farmers do not get their entitlement, the legal side of this should be explored.  It is important that we get the facts and the numbers.  The point was made about the restrictive definition, with the result that a young farmer who activated a herd number at 18 years of age is no longer defined as a young farmer at 23 years of age, while a farmer who activates a herd number at 39 is still defined as a young farmer at 43 years.  That does not make sense, particularly when we are trying to encourage young people to go into farming.  If we do not have flexibility at this level, we will not have it at any level.  If we get the figures on the farmers affected, I will be supportive of advancing the argument to ensure this anomaly is remedied and the farmers get what is justly theirs.  We would all reap the benefits of a positive payback.</p></speech>

I have followed this issue with interest for a while.  I wish Mr. Finan the best in his new position.  I listened to him speak about the TAMS and he is right about including people.  If a young farmer walks into a bank in the morning and tells the bank manager he or she is putting up a shed or buying a bit of land, am I correct to state the first thing he or she will be asked for is the single farm payment?  Farmers are not asked how many cattle they have, they are asked about the single farm payment.  Do the witnesses agree that the present average single farm payment in the country for 32 ha is alarming?  We are looking at young farmers with 90 ha.  Adding 90 and 90 is 180 and adding 45 gives 235 acres.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses spoken to the Department about considering a 40 ha or 50 ha threshold, which may give money to all these guys under 40 years of age who have no payments?  My understanding from the figures I received from the Department is there are almost 4,000 of them.  Not all of them are as low as Mr. O'Brien and some of them are higher.  My understanding is the total figure is &euro;12 million and we need to ensure there is enough money in the pot to include everyone.  It will be a sad day if we do not bring in the new farmers.  Recently I watched George Lee on the television, who told us the beef barons are able to get &euro;500,000 in a single farm payment.  Many of us are from the west where many of the farmers are elderly.</p><p>We are not bringing in the new blood we need.  It would be great if we could bring in the 5,500 farmers who have applied along with 4,000 more.  Let us face it, only 10% in whole demographic are changing.  Year by year we must encourage it.</p><p> Macra na Feirme has welcomed the young farmer scheme.  Was this on the basis of 90 ha or does it believe everyone should be included?  We must watch that we are not always looking after the big fellows and think of the ordinary person with 30 ha, 40 ha or 50 ha.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any idea where they are?  Is there a bigger proportion in one part of the country than another?</p> <p>  This day week, the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, will come before the committee to brief it on agricultural matters.

It is even enough throughout the country.  There are many in Cork and Kerry.  We have not been in contact with them all.  We have been in contact with most of them.</p> <p>  Going back to what Deputy Fitzmaurice said, farmers are on varying levels of payments.  When I went to the bank to get a loan, the first thing I was asked for was information on the single farm payment.  When the bank officials saw it was &euro;780, I was laughed at and I was told I could do nothing without a single farm payment.  We need a single farm payment for sustainability.  According to the figures of which we are aware, 80,000 farmers in rural Ireland are over the age of 55 and 6% of farmers are under the age of 35.  We also know approximately 4,000 farmers are in this scenario.  I can speak for myself.  I have put up an awful battle to have land included.  Every other year I fought against big farmers but now it is against new entrants.  We will not be able to be sustained in farming.  These are family farms and it is a problem throughout rural Ireland.  We cannot get funding from the banks.  We feel we are being discriminated against on every side through no fault of our own.  We have a green cert.  I am not considered a young farmer at 33.  I see people older than me, aged 39, who come home from a good job where they earn &euro;40,000 a year, which is &euro;800 a week, and get &euro;300 per hectare.  The lads who stayed in the game are being discriminated against.</p><p>We paid our way, including the cost of agricultural courses.  When I did my course in 2001-02, it was suggested that my local college in Mountbellew would close.  We were the lads who kept it open and stayed in agriculture, yet we are being discriminated against for adhering to the rules.</p></speech>

I hope to work with him in the years ahead.</p> <p>  I support the position taken by the witnesses.  In recent years, members have received many telephone calls from this group of farmers who receive either no payment or only a small payment.  Some of them have been farming since 2002-03.  It is vital that the joint committee identifies what can be done for this forgotten group which numbers fewer than 4,000 farmers.  I spoke to a few lads during the recent break.  Perhaps their cases can be examined individually.  Some of them may be fortunate enough to receive a reasonably good payment, while others may not receive a payment.  It may not cost a great deal to look after them.  Members support the case that has been made, certainly in respect of the 60% proposal regarding capital investment, which is crucial.</p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Se&aacute;n Finan on his election.  It is great to see a Roscommon man as president of Macra na Feirme.  I thank Mr. O'Brien for the work he is doing on this issue which affects 4,000 farmers.  A large number of farmers have fallen between the cracks, with one in five farmers under the age of 40 falling into this category.  All the farming organisations and public representatives must take some responsibility for this issue and there is an onus on all of us to try to find a final resolution to it.</p> <p>  We must acknowledge that there were problems with the previous national reserve scheme, which was established after the introduction of the single farm payment.  We were in the unfortunate position that young progressive farmers who happened to be in a district electoral division with a large cohort of older farmers received a very low top-up under the national reserve if they were lucky enough to be accepted in the scheme.  One of the main problems with the old national reserve scheme was that priority was not given to young farmers and new entrants.  The problem was noted by the European Court of Auditors which criticised the lack of priority given to young farmers and the issue was addressed in the most recent scheme.  The difficulty, however, is that this occurred after the horse had bolted and left another group of young farmers isolated. </p> <p>  We need to overcome the current difficulties.  Another category of specific disadvantage could be introduced for farmers who were disadvantaged under the old national reserve scheme.  While they could theoretically apply for a payment under the scheme, many did not obtain a decent payment, if any, under the national reserve scheme and their position was not even close to being equitable with their peers who are able to access the scheme.  </p> <p>  The definition has already been provided because the Minister has stated that, under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, he will give priority to every farmer under the age of 40.  However, the rate of grant provided to farmers who are defined as young farmers will differ from that available to those who are not defined as young farmers.  The Minister should remove this anomaly rather than creating new ones.  Part of the problem is that he has tied his hands and reduced the flexibility available to him by taking the bizarre decision to introduce a 90 ha limit for the national reserve.  Given that the average holding is 33 ha, the Minister's decision, as Deputy Tom Barry noted, will mean the national reserve will be paid to retired farmers.  We are in the bizarre position that young farmers who are eligible for a payment under the national reserve are applying in respect of additional lands and paying a premium over and above the value of these lands.  This premium is what they will receive in the national reserve top-up.</p> <p>  It is wrong that people who have left farming are being given priority under the national reserve scheme.  The Minister must address this issue and not only in respect of this specific cohort of young farmers.  In the area I come from, one in three farmers is aged over 65 years.  We will not change the position unless young farmers are given priority in TAMS and the national reserve scheme, irrespective of how long they have been established. </p></speech>

It is difficult to determine in practice how many people would require payments because some of them will be in receipt of payments, while others will have an entitlement under the Scottish derogation.  For various reasons, therefore, the entire sum will not be required to bring payments to this group of farmers up to the average.  In addition, we do not know how many of the group would be excluded from payment for other reasons.  As such, the final figure may not be as high as the estimate.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that a small cohort of people receive payments of &euro;500,000.  If we reduced payments to this group to &euro;150,000 - let us not be greedy - we would quickly find half of the &euro;12 million it is estimated we would need.  It is clear that a wrong has been done to this group.  </p> <p>  To address the question on the agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, the problem is that the definition of a young farmer in the regulation includes a five-year rule.  However, it also makes provision for categories of disadvantage, which I understand was used for applicants in 2008.  This type of innovative use of the current definition is needed if we are to achieve a quick resolution to this problem.  We must also discuss the possibility of changing the regulation at EU level because the five-year condition attached to the definition of a young farmer will continue to be problematic.  In the short term, however, we must use the existing flexibility in the national reserve to look after this group of farmers.</p></speech>

The mandatory approach to young farmer measures was very important for Macra na Feirme because in the case of non-mandatory measures there was a tendency to withdraw schemes when budgets came under pressure.</p> <p>  We understand the potential cost involved in addressing this issue would be of the magnitude of &euro;12 million, although we do not know how many of the 3,800 farmers concerned have fulfilled the educational, income and other requirements of the schemes.  </p> <p>  Deputy Ferris referred to my comment on having a rolling reference year.  We wanted to establish a principle that payment would be based on farming activity and effort, which could include stocking rates or whatever is the level of a farmer's activity.  It would also take into account disadvantaged area status, which would overcome the issues Deputy Barry raised in respect of land mobility and access to a single farm payment.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry also referred to the new interim parent partnerships.  While this is not a subject for discussion today, it is an issue.  Some 249 young farmers are in this category, having entered milk production partnerships.  As they have never activated a herd number, they were not deemed to be established by the Department by entering the partnership with their families.  Now, when they activate a herd number, they are not deemed eligible, as young farmers, for the young farmer schemes, national reserve scheme or TAMS grants.  This anomaly needs to be addressed. </p></speech>

While it is good to receive payments spread over five years, as Deputy Penrose pointed out, the ideal scenario for young farmers would be if installation aid were reinstated.</p></speech>

Why restrict them to 50 ha if they want to have a full-time career in farming?  That is not realistic for them and that was our difficulty.  There was a 90 ha limit for the young farmers top-up payment, but Ireland chose to implement a limit of 50 ha.  Some member states have decided not to apply any limit in the case of the national reserve.  Having low limits in place is adding further criteria and imposing restrictions on young farmers.  That is our difficulty.  Young progressive farmers should have opportunities and not be restricted by particular limits.  That is Macra's na Feirme policy.</p></speech>

I speak on behalf of a group of political scientists comprising Professor Farrell of UCD, Dr. Jane Suiter of DCU and Fiona Buckley of UCC.  We have submitted a detailed statement but I will highlight several points this afternoon.</p> <p>  There is widespread agreement that Ireland needs an independent electoral management body.  An excellent report published in 2008 provided a very detailed outline on how to establish an electrical commission and the structure and role it would have.  The commitment to establish an electoral commission was included in the 2011 programme for Government, and a detailed agreement on establishing it was reaffirmed when Deputy Joan Burton took over as T&aacute;naiste in 2014.  The initiation of a public consultation process which made clear from the outset that no commission is likely before the next election only reinforces the impression that the management of the democratic process in Ireland is not a political or administrative priority and we consider this to be deeply regrettable.</p> <p>  Ireland has a particularly long and proud democratic tradition.  We are one of the world's oldest contiguous democracies and are approaching the point when we will celebrate close to 100 years of free and fair elections, which puts us in a relatively small group of countries.  This point is not often aired.  An important element we want to highlight is data from successive waves of the Irish national election study and the European social survey have all documented a high level of trust in the electoral process in Ireland.</p><p>In our submission, we went into a great deal of detail on the first wave of the electoral audit by the Electoral Integrity Project of electoral procedures in Ireland.  It is based on the 2011 election.  The data that we present affirm the overall high levels of integrity and trust in the electoral process, but the headline figures obscure considerable variation.  In particular, the data highlight serious concerns about the electoral registration process, political financing and equality of access to the electoral process for women and minorities.  We note that reference is made in the consultation document to the work of Professors J&oslash;rgen Elklit and Andrew Reynolds.  We wish to point to a particular contribution they made in 2005 in which they pointed out that countries with high levels of trust and electoral integrity could see those eroded quickly where there were electoral instances of malpractice.  We would point to recent difficulties with postal voting in the UK and broader difficulties with voting in the US, all of which have contributed to a significant undermining of overall trust in the integrity of democratic systems where there had been high levels of trust beforehand.<br/><br/>The electoral commission should be established immediately.  Indeed, it is advisable that a skeletal body be put in place before the next general election.  We were persuaded by the structures that were advanced in the 2008 report, which we consider to have been sensible.  It is important that the commission be established as a statutory agency and given responsibility for the management of the democratic process.  It should have operational and regulatory powers under the legislation and be led by a chief electoral officer of Ireland.  It should also have an advisory board that would be established by statute and be subject to clear criteria in its composition.  We point to the question of gender balance in particular, but we indicate in our submission that members with communications and electoral expertise should be required.  The commission should be accountable to the Oireachtas rather than directly to a Department and financial accountability should be to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, following standard practice.  It should have an annual budget, one that is negotiated directly in the normal practice, but also a statutory budget whereby it can disperse moneys in respect of the conduct of elections and referendums as required.<br/><br/>Regarding the remit or functions that the commission should have, it should be responsible for all areas of management and administration of the democratic process.  This includes voter and party registration, boundary divisions, organisation of elections, voter education, campaign oversight, election and referendum research and political financing.  It should also include the functions currently carried out by the <i>ad hoc</i>referendum commissions.  All policy, management and oversight electoral functions should be located within the commission.  The commission should be a relative small body.  Following practices in other jurisdictions, it is probably best that the commission continue to liaise with local authorities in the decentralised provision of certain electoral functions, in particular, the recruitment of polling day staff and the counting and tabulation of votes.  Ireland needs an electoral commission and steps to establish one should be taken immediately.</p></speech>

Some of the matters are outside my areas of competence, including costs.  There are various works of perhaps fiction about how much electoral commissions cost in different countries.  It depends on what goes in and how it is costed but I do not want to get into that.  We will let an accountant deal with it.  Following Dr. Theresa Reidy's comments on the extremely thorough report of 2008, there are other matters on which I can add nothing of worth beyond the reports already available.  We thought that report might have led to something but unfortunately, or fortunately for some people, there was an election instead.  I would like to address with the joint committee the functions an electoral commission might fulfil.  I can imagine that someone might ask why we need an electoral commission as everything is grand out there.  Electoral integrity is quite high in Ireland and there are not a lot of complaints from the majority about the process.  The outcome is another matter.  I note the briefing document prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which references a brief submission I made to the Constitutional Convention on the topic of why we need an electoral commission.  I will expand briefly on that submission in what I say today.<br/><br/>Most of the countries with which we might compare ourselves have electoral commissions.  In particular, I mention Australia, New Zealand, Canada and even the UK, which does not tend to be ahead of the game on these things.  The widespread use of the option reflects a norm that sees more legislation covering elections and the removal of electoral matters from direct political control.  We have seen this in Ireland in the last few decades with the creation of <i>ad hoc</i>institutions to determine boundaries which was a function the Minister used to have.  We also have SIPO to look after finance and have had successive referendum commissions.  As such, we have moved in that direction, albeit by setting up a number of <i>ad hoc</i>bodies.  Very often, they have been set up with many of the same people.  <br/><br/>Table 1 of my submission compares functions across four countries, namely, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  It sets out the various functions electoral commissions in those countries fulfil.  Managing the electoral registers is done by all commissions except in the UK where it is done locally.  All commissions but that in the UK are responsible for conducting public elections and referendums.  All the electoral commissions have responsibility for administering the rules, including funding registration and things like that.  All the electoral commissions have some role in determining boundaries even if it is incidental, usually by an overlap of personnel and by providing the servicing function.  All of the commissions have a function in terms of educating the public.  They all educate, advise and inform government and parliament.<br/><br/>We might think about the Irish case and those same functions.  In Ireland, managing the electoral registers is done by local government.  Referendum commissions do a little bit of conducting public elections and referendums as do the Department and local government.  Administering the rules is done by SIPO and electoral boundaries are determined by <i>ad hoc</i>electoral commissions.  I am not sure who has the function of educating the public while the Government and Parliament are probably educated by the Department.  Only in the UK are the first two functions not the preserve of electoral commissions.  The rest are fulfilled by electoral commissions everywhere.<br/><br/>If one looks more closely at these research and educational functions to get a better idea of what they are, in New Zealand the role of the electoral commission includes advising the Government on changes to electoral rules, reviewing electoral law and procedures, and advising those involved in the conduct of elections and referendums.  The functions of the Canadian electoral commission include reporting to the Parliament on the administration of elections and referendums, carrying out studies on alternative voting methods and, with the approval of parliamentarians, testing alternative voting processes for future use during electoral events.</p><p>Why should we give these functions to an agency dedicated to this relatively narrow range of functions as compared with leaving it with <i>ad hoc</i>bodies and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government?  First, they run less risk of being ignored or given a relatively low priority, and many of these functions have been given a very low priority in the past.  Second, and this is most important for the research and new ideas function, apart from the fact that more research and new ideas might become available, these ideas come from a source that would be seen as non-partisan.  It cannot be discounted immediately because it has the Minister's fingerprints all over it.<br/><br/>The right of citizens to vote is a central element in democracy.  The electoral register, a list of who is allowed to vote and who is not, is clearly very important in that.  It is widely recognised that the electoral register we have from our decentralised procedure is far from accurate.  It includes many who have no right to vote and does not include many who do have that right.  That has been talked about for quite a long time, and it is probably no better.  Different local authorities have gone about maintaining it in different ways, with very different degrees of zeal and enthusiasm.  They have to spend their money on it, and I am sure they can find, as they see it, better areas on which to spend their money.<br/><br/>As regards new ideas on electoral matters, in the past these have largely come from governments.  Suggestions for change in the electoral system to a more majoritarian one was a brilliant idea in the 1960s.  It was seen as partisan and rejected by the people in referendums.  There have been relatively few other innovations.  We saw the addition of party labels on the ballot, which most people would probably see as a good development, and later photographs added to ballot papers.  In the recent past we saw a somewhat ill-fated experiment with voting machines.  These ideas came from the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.<br/><br/>When it comes to referendums, the practice now is to establish a referendum commission each time.  The precise functions of this body have changed a little over time, but it has always been there to maximise citizen awareness and help them engage in the process properly.  Anybody reading through the reports of each referendum commission, something it has been my professional duty to do, and all the members might not have read them assiduously, would think it was the same report because they always say the same thing, except the one set up on the second Lisbon treaty referendum that was so important we set up the commission a very long time in advance.  The referendum commission always asks the reason it was not set up earlier because it could have done a much better job if it had been set up earlier.<br/><br/>Even allowing for the fact that Governments procrastinate in setting the vote, permanence would greatly facilitate the work of the commission.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here.  I congratulate the committee on taking time to consider this issue.  I am not an expert on electoral commissions.  Much of my work is very much on public organisations.</p> <p>  Most of the members might be aware of the review by the OECD of the Irish public service in 2008 when it said it found this organisational zoo.  To use that analogy, in my contribution I would like to assist the committee in considering the consequences of introducing a new animal, as it were, to the zoo.  It sounds like a very good idea.  There seems to be a good deal of support for the idea of an electoral commission but it is worth reflecting, as the members are doing, on what it will look like and how it will operate after day one, and that is where my contributions will be focused.</p> <p>  I will briefly summarise the paper I have distributed, which is in bullet point format.  The general idea is that just as we have a long, proud democratic tradition in Ireland, we have a long, proud tradition of creating bodies in response to policy problems.  That is usually in response to a new issue.  It is not to take issues away from Departments and so on and rarely is it to consolidate functions, as seems to be the case for this electoral commission.</p><p>One must be a bit careful when taking bits from the system and putting them together in a new body.  It sounds fine, plausible and logical to do so, but we should think about how these functions will be managed and co-ordinated in order to ensure there are no gaps and overlaps.  These are common questions that arise in the organisation of government.</p><p> Everyone is talking about an electoral commission.  Unlike in other countries, names do not mean so much in Ireland, because we have talked about commissions, councils, authorities, boards and agencies.  Titles have no legal standing and, therefore, do not confer rights and powers.  In Ireland, agencies are defined organisations that have a variety of governance arrangements.  I must confess I have not read the paper prepared by Dr. Reidy, Professor Farrell and others.  However, I believe it sets out a plausible governance structure at the higher level, which I shall discuss in a second.</p><p> In the context of the financial crisis, new agencies are now being created in a very different and much more regulated environment.  For example, budgets are not necessarily on an annual basis but on the basis of a three-year envelope.  Budgets are also subjected to critical review every three years, which is, quite possibly, a good thing for a new organisation.</p><p> In Ireland and internationally, there has been a move away from having stakeholders or people from affected groups on boards and towards having a more professional panel, as Dr. Reidy has mentioned, with people who have certain skills and competencies.  I urge the committee to think carefully about whom the board will represent and what exactly the people on an advisory board or commission will contribute.  The consultation paper that was written in 2008 was very good but it did not take the next step.  If a judge, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or the Clerk of the Seanad were involved, I am not sure they would have a chance to think through a situation.  Were accountability dilemmas to arise, would the Comptroller and Auditor General suddenly be auditing himself?  What would happen if a judge said there was a crisis, even though it had been decided that a judge would head the electoral commission?  What would happen if a constitutional crisis arose and a judge were head of the commission?  I cannot think of a specific example of same.  I ask the committee to reflect on who is the most appropriate for appointment to the board of such an entity if one has a small board.  When I looked at this matter in 2010 I counted a total of 2,300 board or governing authority memberships in Ireland.  The average board was comprised of 12 people, but the number is getting smaller, and it is international best practice to have small numbers.</p><p> There is no best organisational formula, and I hope the committee has picked up that aspect from what I have said.  If anything, we have seen more diversity internationally.  As Professor Marsh pointed out, there is diversity among electoral commissions just as there is for other types of public organisation.  We tend to look to other countries to see if we can copy them, but we need an Irish electoral commission which is unique and specific to the Irish situation.</p><p> With regard to accountability, if the commission is to be directly accountable to Parliament in the same way as the Environmental Protection Agency or the Ombudsman, that is fine.  However, accountability is not just upwards; it is also downwards to the public.  We must think about how the commission can be accountable to citizens in terms of what it does and how it can, in practice, demonstrate that.  It is not just about an annual report; there might need to be television advertisements and so on.</p><p> There is something of a paradox of which we must be aware.  We should always be cautious of attempts to depoliticise an issue - again, this has not really been an issue in Ireland, where integrity is quite high - by putting it in a body that is held at arm's length.  Such attempts can often have a perverse effect - I refer the committee to the poor unfortunate HSE - in that the body becomes a real focus for political anger or criticism when things go wrong.  When creating this entity we must ensure it is robust enough to stand up to any form of political interference well into the future while, at the same time, being responsible in dealing with genuine and fair political criticism of its actions.</p><p>  As I have mentioned, new agencies cannot be divorced from changes that have taken place in the wider Irish public administration.  Agencies will now be subject to much higher levels of scrutiny, financial accountability and audit compared to what has existed hitherto for a lot of bodies.</p><p>I thought it might be useful to the committee if I asked some colleagues in countries other than New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia whether anything had come up in respect of electoral commissions.  The Netherlands made a major change recently in its electoral commission, changing the legal status of the employees of the commission.  They thought it would be a good idea for the people working in the commission to have a separate legal status and not to be civil servants in the normal way of other government departments, in case there were undue pressures on them.  It is interesting, also, that in Sweden, as well as having an electoral commission, they have created a further body to which decisions of the commission can be appealed.  That is chaired by a judge.  Again, I am not sure whether that is being considered, but in the event of a crisis, is it the parliament that decides, or does one need another body to decide?  I will stop there.</p></speech>

The consultation paper produced by the Department is an excellent starting point for this exercise.  As Dr. MacC&aacute;rthaigh just mentioned, it takes things much further than we did in our study in 2008, particularly with regard to the examination of some of the governance arrangements in respect of an electoral commission.  It was very gratifying to hear the nice things people said about the 2008 study.  When we entitled it "Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission In Ireland," we did not realise quite how preliminary it would turn out to be, but it may be useful after seven years to look back at some of the issues that have been raised in the consultation and to share my own thoughts on them as they have been formed at this point.</p> <p>  In compiling the 2008 study, we found it striking that there were different levels of satisfaction with the operation of the administration of elections, as previous experts have mentioned.  At one end of the spectrum, in discussions with the political parties, the Department and the returning officers, apart from the occasional complaints about particular issues, there was generally a very high level of satisfaction with the way in which the core function of conducting elections was conducted, such as the nomination of candidates, the production of ballot papers, polling, and the counting of votes.  It was recognised that it was appropriate to do this both at local level and at the level of returning officers, who are independent of the public sector to a large extent and are just brought in for this particular function periodically.  More towards the middle of the spectrum of satisfaction, there was a fair level of support for the Standards in Public Office Commission in terms of its performance, but specific inadequacies in the legislation were identified, some of which have been remedied since, and there was also praise for the commission in the sense that it did a very effective job with very slender resources.  In terms of enforcement, for example, it could have done with a much better level of resourcing.</p> <p>  The main area of dissatisfaction has been mentioned several times, and I am sure that members, as public representatives, are well aware of the dissatisfaction with the maintenance of the electoral register.  We recorded this and several other reports noted it.  Many of the concerns, as has already been mentioned, related to a lack of consistency and co-operation between local authorities and in particular the very different levels of performance that different local authorities were able to achieve.  What we were told, although it is not the total explanation, was that in many local authorities this function seemed to have a very low prestige attached to it, so that if anybody did particularly well in the franchise section of a local authority, he or she rapidly got promoted to some more important post and somebody else had to start all over again learning on the job.</p> <p>  What was striking in our report - it is difficult to document it, but we learned this from talking to people - was that the actual role in the system of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government goes considerably beyond the formal description of its responsibilities.  It is essentially the brain of this quite decentralised electoral system, and through various informal levers or channels of communication it has carried out much more of a co-ordinating role than is formally described in the legislation or in the published practice.</p> <p>  It is noted in the consultation paper that in the 2008 study we favoured a phased and partial consolidation of electoral functions into a new electoral commission.  I do not see any reason to depart from that.  Given the differing demands and expectations in relation to the various electoral functions, it still seems reasonable to me to concentrate on those functions that can be quickly and easily consolidated into a new body of this type, rather than attempting to set up a new institution and making radical changes to the administration of elections simultaneously.</p><p>I am still of the view that the Standards in Public Office Commission ought to remain the core of the new body and that in the short term it should have oversight rather than direct responsibility of electoral registration.  There is some scope for improving the performance of local authorities in this respect through establishing performance norms and supervisory mechanisms, while a more fundamental reform of electoral registration is planned and prepared for.  It is noted in a number of places that PPS numbers might play a role in a new system of individual rolling registration rather than household annual registration.  As we noted in the 2008 study, it is somewhat misleading to focus only on PPS numbers because experience in Northern Ireland and elsewhere shows that a wide range of identifiers must be used in order to satisfactorily establish the identity and entitlement to vote of a particular individual.</p><p> Similarly, in relation to the type of conduct in which the returning officers engage in administration of elections, we noted in 2008 that there is probably a need only for a general oversight function in the electoral commission rather than a detailed assumption of that role.</p><p> On the composition of the commission, I am open minded about whether the study we authored in 2008 made the right call, that the new commission should be constituted in broadly the same way as the Standards in Public Office Commission and similar bodies and that it should specifically exclude those who had experience of party politics.  Dr. MacC&aacute;rthaigh referred to the fact that there is a reasonable case to be made for a smaller specially-appointed board to exercise oversight over the operations of an electoral commission.  There are cogent reasons for this, as I say, on grounds of effectiveness and accountability, but I remain to be persuaded that it will be possible in the short term to come up with a method of appointment that retains the undoubted impartiality and legitimacy that are clearly desirable here, particularly bearing in mind that the new body will have responsibility, not merely for the conduct of elections but also for referenda.  I make that point because it might be possible to get agreement among the political parties as to who are suitable persons to serve on an electoral commission.  However, if the electoral commission is to take over the role the Referendum Commission has in referenda, given in many referenda the political parties do not represent one side, the "No" side, it could be that a body that is satisfactory to the political parties is not seen by those who are proposing a "No" vote in a referendum as being a legitimate entity.</p><p> Where I would perhaps differ in emphasis from the consultation paper is on the planning and policy functions of a new electoral commission.  The consultation paper, at page 42, observes that the circumstances have "largely changed", since 2007 or 2009, as to whether an electoral commission should have "a significant advisory role on electoral and political reform issues" because of the enactment of a considerable number of significant pieces of legislation, and the Department is entitled to take some credit for the fact that there have been substantial changes in party funding and other aspects of electoral law.  I would not be as sanguine as the Department appears to be in the consultation paper about the fact that this is a closed chapter because there is a need for the electoral system to be kept under constant review and for forward planning in order to take a proactive rather than reactive approach to electoral policy and administration.  It seems to be desirable that an electoral commission should have a significant role in these matters and that the franchise section of the Department should not be left as the dominant governmental actor in planning and policy change in relation to elections.  As I noted already, the franchise section has a role in the development of policies and standards in elections that goes somewhat beyond the formal specifications of its responsibilities.  For example, it is clear that there is a degree of long-term planning at work in the efforts of successive constituency commissions and it seems plausible that this element of continuity is influenced by the support role of the franchise section.  The franchise section has generally discharged well its co-ordinating and planning roles in terms of the electoral system, but within the constraints of a departmental administration where particular Ministers have particular projects, with which they want to be associated, for which they want to take credit and which do not necessarily always go smoothly.  It strikes me that a meaningful electoral commission must, to some extent, supplant some of these functions now performed within the Department and would, ideally, involve appropriate transfers of staff to the new body.  In that context, perhaps it is not surprising that the consultation paper to some extent skirts around this aspect of the planning for the transition to the new body.</p></speech>

I have no questions <i>per se</i>.  I acknowledge and appreciate everything that has been said.</p><p>I agree with much of it, especially the first contributor who mentioned the lack of leadership on the part of Government in putting forward a draft commission in order for a consultation process to emanate from it whereby we might be in a position to have an independent commission in place for the next election.  The amalgamation of the Department's role with the local authorities and SIPO could have formed the basis for an electoral commission.  There was all-party agreement on a report that emanated in 2008.  There was a commitment on the part of this Government in 2011 in the programme for Government to do so and, as has been referred to by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, when she concluded her discussions with the Taoiseach, after each election, especially referendums during the lifetime of the Government. a commitment has been made by members of Government to bring forward an electoral commission prior to the next election.  Unfortunately, as with much of what was promised in the form of radical overhaul of the electoral system and the way in which politics is done and how it is led, we have seen nothing except balls of smoke.  While I welcome the contributions that have been made, I do not think the type of leadership that was promised is being given by Government in this area.  We will all be the worse for it in the context of the next general election.  I would hope that the message that might emanate loud and clear from this gathering today is that the Government should take a bold step and make proposals that can be adjudicated on and agreed in order to move forward.</p></speech>

It is a very large agency and it has evolved since about 1920 so it is a body that has developed over a long period.  It has quite extensive roles and robust powers.  In terms of scope and function, Elections Canada would be where we should aim if we are really looking for the best model.  It is worth noting that in terms of a model similar to Ireland, New Zealand is also a small relatively homogenous country so it has certain elements in terms of scale.  I suggest we look to New Zealand for scale but to Elections Canada in terms of scope and robustness.</p></speech>

We need to fix a system that is not working.  As a practising politician, I recognise that there are major problems with the electoral register throughout the country.  After each election we are informed of the numerous errors that occurred in every single register.  Sometimes people who have been on the electoral register for 40, 50 or 60 years turn up at a polling station to find their names are no longer on the register.  This is due to the fact that the system of compiling the register is not a rolling one.  It has to start from scratch every year from about September or October within the local authority.  Local authorities do not have the resources to upgrade and supply an accurate register of electors.  There is a need for a single independent body, a centralised electoral commission, to compile the register.</p><p>There would be a greater degree of accuracy with an electoral register than with the current system.  I am not criticising local authorities because they have done the best possible job in the circumstances.  The care of an electoral register should not be in their remit because it has placed an undue burden on staff who are not properly trained to compile a register of electors.  I have spoken to local authority staff who work in the area of compiling the register and they feel the same.  Have those people been spoken to?  Clerks, and maybe junior clerks, are brought in from time to time to help with the register and would not have a great deal of experience in that area.  The politician always faces the anger on polling day and for a few days afterwards if people find their names are not on the register.  It can also cause a great deal of confusion at the polling station if there are inaccuracies in the register on the day.  People are advised to check the register well in advance, but very few do.</p><p> There is an electoral commission in Northern Ireland which was established nearly 40 years ago and is working very satisfactorily.  There is no obligation on people to vote, but it is compulsory to register to vote there.  That is a very good system.  They say the electoral register in Northern Ireland does not have the same problems as we have in the South.  I met a person recently who told me they were on six registers.  I know it would be illegal but it is possible that a person in those circumstances could have voted six times.  That person would have been breaking the law and they knew that but that should not be the case.  A person should be registered to vote only once and at one location.  That crops up all the time and there are thousands of people whose names are duplicated on the register.  We will not have an accurate register until we eliminate that type of error.  </p><p> The administration of the electoral system has been piecemeal and has been lacking a cohesive approach.  For a long time, I have felt that an independent body, free from Government or political interference, would be more acceptable to everybody and to all political parties.  A CEO, who should not be a member of the Civil Service, perhaps with the same powers as a District Court or a High Court judge, should be an electoral commissioner and special terms of reference should be issued to that person.  We need to put in place a system-----</p></speech>

He said they knew where everybody lived.  Whenever one moves into a house one is required to register.  Most of Europe operates under a law that is more Napoleonic than British and the role of the citizen typically has been more that of subject than it was under British law but their electoral registers are far more effective than ours.  Ours is probably a bit more like that of the US, which is probably the worst electoral register in the world and one in which anything up to 30% of the electorate are not on the register at all.  By US standards we are doing pretty well but by the standards of most of the rest of the democratic world we are doing poorly.</p></speech>

The advantage of the new Eircodes, about which I know very little, is that they have a unique address.  Everybody in my road has the same address so it is not unique and the new codes might make it marginally easier to locate an individual at a precise address.  The will at the centre is the most important thing and if there is an agency dedicated to providing us with a good electoral register we are more likely to have one.  Then we might see an end, for better or for worse, of people flying back from Australia to vote as these people will not be on the electoral register now that they no longer live here.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that we are in anti-quango mode at the moment and people will say this is another superquango.  There are questions around whether it will take on the role of the Boundary Commission, the Standards in Public Office Commission, those of local authorities or of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>  There are divergent views on whether it should be an oversight body or one which has oversight functions and is operational.  Given the electoral and registration systems I am not too sure we can cut out local authorities.  Some of the people working in local authorities will take exception to some of the criticism on their level of expertise but that is not the issue.  Local authorities should be capable of getting people registered to vote and making sure they are not registered twice as it is not too complicated to do.  The single biggest issue is the system we have for registration.  I have been banging the drum on this for a long time and am very much favour in trying to weed out situations.  I am particularly concerned about Deputies on the Government benches talking about meeting people who are on the register six times or stories such as the one about 28 people at one address, a derelict house in County Monaghan.</p><p>Examples like that highlight the urgent need to deal with the registration process and try to ensure that people are registered once and once only.  </p><p> Deputy Bannon is correct that some improvements were made in the North and another party to which I belong insisted very strongly on doing that.  In a subsequent election we improved our performance by about 25% or 30%.  Having a good register worked well for us, and it is something parties and independents need to fix.  I would like to hear some examples of how that might be addressed because it is the single biggest issue.  How it is addressed will, in large measure, determine the operational remit of the body.  If we are still going to tie it to an address, then the local authority will have to continue playing a major role because it will have some hope of finding out who lives where.  The system worked quite well when we had rates collectors who were also intelligence gatherers in terms of the electoral register and there were more local councillors.  I am not making any judgment and have my own opinion.  We now have 950 rather than 1,450 town and county councillors - some were dual roles and on paper there were over 1,600 seats.  Town councillors, in particular, were very good at gathering that kind of information, but that system is no longer in place.  </p><p> The commission has merit and I would support it.  In terms of its role, the jury should be out on registration until we decide how to make the register 100% accurate.  Who would appoint the members of the commission?  Who currently appoints the members of the Boundary Commission?  I am interested in knowing how people are appointed and how they come to their conclusions, such as deciding to saw counties in half, cut off chunks of north Tipperary and lump them in with Offaly and bite off little bits of south Kildare and lump them in with County Laois.  The suggestion that it would be accountable to the Oireachtas rather than to a Minister of the day is very good.  </p><p> The witnesses may have views on the vexed question of funding for political parties.  I am somewhat curious as to how a quango or body would fix the problem of gender balance.  I have spoken to Members, in particular those elected to the D&aacute;il, as well as those elected to local authorities for the first time last year.  Women, in particular, have told me that getting a nomination is not a problem and it is easy enough to get going.  It has been shown that when women put themselves forward, they can get elected.  The problems for women, as well as men, begin when they are elected and are a result of the hours involved.  It was 6.45 a.m. when I got home one morning.  That is one of the issues.  The roles members of local authorities and Deputies are expected to perform are also an issue.  </p><p> It was proposed that local government would have a role in terms of election counts.  While we have an address based system, I cannot see how local authorities can be taken out of the equation too easily.</p><p>I have suggested in the past that this could be linked to PPS numbers.  I raised this with the former Minister, Phil Hogan, on many occasions.  He made the valid point that we have many more PPS numbers than we have people living in this three quarters of the island of Ireland.  In fact, we have as many PPS numbers as we have people living on the entire island of Ireland, despite the fact the Border cuts off six counties.  This would indicate that many people who have emigrated, many emigrants who have returned and many people who have died still have PPS numbers.  Is it the view of the panel that we could link the registration of voters to the PPS number system?  Is there another system we could use to do that?</p></speech>

There is some very interesting detail in Deputy Stanley's questions.  They all come to the same point, to a large degree.  They are all about trying to look at details.  One of the reasons that Deputy Cowen is able to talk about how this Government has failed to meet the need to introduce an electoral commission, just as the previous Government failed to do, is that there is a great deal of focus on detail.  It is a question of putting the cart before the horse.  As we say in our paper, the establishment of an electoral commission is needed as a matter of urgency.  When it is established, it should be given a remit which would include things like the sorts of questions about which the Deputy is talking.  However, if we keep on talking about the details of electoral registers and PPS numbers, this is never going to happen.</p></speech>

I can attest that after I moved across the Border, I was never asked for identification until I went to vote in Belfast.  I was certainly asked for identification then.  It is quite difficult for one to get on the register there.  One has to prove many things.  I have moved once since I started living in Northern Ireland.  I had to come off one and go onto the other.  It is a different experience.  It is a much more regulated system.</p> <p>  Professor Farrell made some important points about the exact role of the commission.  I might differ a little with him in this respect.  Maybe he is not saying that an electoral commission is needed and we can wait until it has been set up before we decide what it will do.  I think the tendency to rush has been a problem in the Irish administrative system.  That is why this discussion is very useful.  Will the role of the commission be confined to ironing out kinks in the system - for example, in the register - as has been suggested?  Perhaps it should be set up for just five years if it will no longer be needed after this work is finished.  That probably will not happen.  If it is agreed that we need an electoral commission immediately to sort out some glaring problems in the Irish system, that is fine.  The bigger question is what it should do thereafter.  I would see that as a greater challenge.  How will we know whether it is doing a good job?  Every public organisation in Ireland should be pushed at all times to improve the quality of performance; in this case, the quality of the performance of the Irish democratic process.  I was very interested to read a list in the 2008 document which referred to codes of conduct for returning officers.  It is important to think beyond day one about what else this commission can do.  It should not be a case of merely setting up a commission that solves a problem, but then sits there with nobody quite knowing what to do with it.  It needs to have an ambitious agenda way into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theresa Reidy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015061600002#N00400"><p>We can learn from a great deal from international practice in the appointment of commissions.  I will go back to the Canadian example.  The Canadian Government consults the other political parties in the Canadian Parliament, a person is agreed on, he or she appears before a parliamentary committee and he or she is formally appointed by a vote of the Canadian Parliament.  There are three-person or ten-person commissions in many other countries, some of which were mentioned in the examples given by Professor Marsh.  Similar procedures are followed and there is a great deal of advance scrutiny.  I suppose there is nothing to say a Government could not insist on a partisan appointment but in a substantial democracy, it is very unlikely to get away with it.  All of the procedures involve consultation.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question related to scale.  The annual budget of the body in New Zealand is NZ$6 million.  It has a permanent staff of 30, which expands in advance of an election when polling and tabulation staff are recruited.  On the other end of the spectrum, the Canadian body has a permanent staff of approximately 500.  I think its annual budget was C$87 million last year.  It spends approximately C$100 million on each election.  Canada is an enormous country, even if its population is not that big, and it has quite a complicated federal structure.  Perhaps the Irish case would be more towards the New Zealand end of the spectrum.</p> <p>  The last thing I would like to say relates to gender balance.  The point we are making, and I think the Government and all parties have agreed to this, is that there should be a 40% gender balance on all State boards.  That principle should also be adhered to in terms of the composition of the commission.</p><p>In regard to the gender legislation and the quotas which have been introduced, in due course, the electoral commission would be responsible for administering those and there are certainly quite a lot of other areas where it could make contributions in terms of improving gender balance.  However, it is important to say that the commission itself cannot transform anything, although it can work with other strategies in that particular area.</p></speech>

The question raised by Deputy Stanton reminded me that in the locality where I was born, there was a very strong political tradition which as a child I took very seriously, and that was that one voted early and voted very often.  I am not suggesting for one second, given this is recorded, I ever did that, because I got out of there as quickly as possible.  Nevertheless, whatever about the merits of an electoral commission in today's Ireland, there was certainly a big need for one back then but sin sc&eacute;al eile.</p> <p>  I am not entirely convinced about the merits of an electoral commission.  The 2008 report is very interesting.  There is this question of population size as a big factor, although I am not suggesting it is the only one.  We sometimes get carried away, particularly in this House, with the idea of our importance in the world and that we are some sort of superpower.  Perhaps this is one of those examples, given there is a very small number of people and a very small number of voters.  While that is no reason for not doing it in an orderly and accountable way, and I do not want to take away from that, I do not get terribly excited about this and will not be putting it on my literature next April.</p> <p>  I want to raise one of the great shortcomings in recent referenda.  I was waiting for one of the five witnesses to refer to what happened during the Seanad referendum and the appalling way the wording of the ballot paper was dealt with.  I have said this in the House in another debate because on polling day, I and other members saw people filling in the ballot paper relating to the inquiries referendum, looking at the other ballot paper-----</p></speech>

Even Deputies have shortcomings.  I saw people putting back the ballot paper in regard to the Seanad.  While everyone here may not agree with me on this, I could see people folding the paper and putting it back without voting because the wording was so bad.  I thought, given the subject matter, somebody would have mentioned that.</p> <p>  As I have said before, the Referendum Commission made a bags of it in respect of that referendum.  If that had happened in the Scottish referendum last year, there would have been another referendum and all hell would have broken loose, but it did not happen.  It was one of those extraordinary things that so many people folded up their ballot paper due to the confusion.  I am not saying it was by design or otherwise.  I have my own opinion about the Seanad, although I will not go down that road today and irritate more people.</p> <p>  With regard to one of the merits of the electoral commission, the witnesses quite rightly point to the registration of electors.  Like my colleague, I think local authorities do the best job they possibly can.  I am obviously very pro-local government and think we are very lucky to have good councils, particularly in Dublin.  The staff do the best they can.  Professor Marsh used the word "civic".  One of the problems we have, which is due to the reality of being an island off another island, is that we do not have the sort of civic responsibility that other Europeans have.</p><p>The Romans did not come here and we have a strong Luddite tradition.  While some people take voting very seriously, others who go up to the polling booth and find they are not registered do not feel it is the end of the world.  They go home and watch "Eastenders".  We have to get to a place where people take the franchise very seriously, and education is part of that.  </p><p> Nobody has referred to the new difficulty which all politicians now experience in respect of elections and referendums.  The number of people going out to vote does not decline.  I do not talk about the turnout any more.  I am not sure about Carlow-Kilkenny, but in the by-election in my constituency of Dublin South-West, and in the recent referendums, the issue was not the turnout but the number of people who stayed at home.  People are not going out to vote.  There are those who argue that it will be repeated again next April.  I take my share of responsibility, but that is what has happened.</p><p> In respect of the possibility of setting up a new commission, there is accelerating hostility among the public towards another body or quango, so to speak, appointed by the Government.  I have said before that this Government or some other is going to run out of retired judges.  We will have to import them because we have so many inquiries and commissions.</p><p> I am always amazed by this notion of the independence of judges, although I do not know any; none of them live in my estate so I do not mix with them.  Judges in this country are the most political and ideological - I know what side of the House they vote.  To suggest we can bring in a judge who is going to be entirely impartial, I would be more inclined to bring in a retired judge from Greece than to put in one of our own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Marsh" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015061600002#P00200"><p>On the wording of the question, it is very important that, when referendums are given to the people, the question is clear.  In my submission I pointed to the role of the UK Electoral Commission, which is starting research now for the referendum on the European Union.  It is already undertaking all sorts of research on the different ways in which that might be worded.  It can then advise the British Government.  That is one of those things which an electoral commission can do in a neutral way.<br/><br/>The UK Electoral Commission also examines whether the vote should be held on the same day as other elections.  Mr. David Cameron announced the other day that he saw no problem with this.  They did it with the alternative vote referendum in 2011 and he was pleased with the result.  For him, the fact that the public was thoroughly confused by it was beside the point.  We know that when we have referendums on the same day as other elections, people can sometimes get a little confused.  We had a wonderful referendum on the power of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries and the evidence was that never in their lives had citizens been more confused about any referendum.  Most of them did not know there was a referendum because there was a Presidential election on the same day.  Electoral commissions can help with that.<br/><br/>In terms of the expansion of government, I suppose I am not particularly keen on seeing ever more civil servants, since they will be looking for pensions.  I will be looking for my pension and I do not really want the money to go to anybody else.  The whole point about an electoral commission is that the Government or <i>ad hoc</i>bodies are already doing all these things, one way or another.  We do not necessarily need any more people.  Arguably, we would only need one judge, not three, in future.  It is a matter of combining functions so that they can be better carried out, rather than anything else.</p></speech>

All of us around the table, and we are not alone in this, have repeatedly been saying that introducing an electoral commission would reduce the number of quangos.  The Boundary Commission, the party register, the referendum commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission will all be replaced by one body, with one judge rather than several.  We would actually be making government more efficient.</p></speech>

It has been raised in the Seanad many times and has been voted on there too.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Government in its five years has failed to deliver on this cornerstone of political and electoral reform.  I concur with Dr. Reidy that it is regrettable that after five years an electoral commission will still not be delivered on for the next general election.  Whatever about fears of quangos, ultimately, failure to establish such a commission undermines potential political participation, good positive political culture, trust and accountability.  It is a slight on both Government parties that they were not able to deliver this in five years, even with a pre-existing report from 2008.  The Independent group in the Seanad has called for the establishment of such a commission many times.  I welcome the fact the committee is pushing for it.  What is the likelihood, however, of it being instituted by the next Government?</p> <p> I am mindful about what Professor David Farrell said about detail.  I must mention Professor Michael Marsh taught me in Trinity College, Dublin just in case there is a conflict of interest.</p></speech>

Although the referendum to maintain the Seanad I take as an endorsement of that.</p> <p>  What has the delegation seen in other countries regarding easier and more transparent voter registration and how it can link up with increased participation?  We saw recently a surge in late registration to vote during the marriage referendum.  We can do digital banking and, God forbid, even pay for water charges online.  Recently, I was a witness at the local and federal elections in the state of North Carolina where one could register up to the morning of the elections.  I was involved in a ridiculous scenario of trying to convince the former environment Minister, Phil Hogan, on decreasing the timeline for applying for and casting a postal vote.  The philosophy in this country is to make it more difficult for us to vote.  Are there examples where easier voter registration has worked?  Professor Michael Marsh stated the UK is the only country in which the electoral commission does not manage the electoral register.</p> <p>  What is the delegation&rsquo;s view on lowering the age of voting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Marsh" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015061600002#Q00400"><p>I am not an expert in how people register in most countries of the world as I have not done direct research on it.  What I know about it is something I have come across in passing or, as I said earlier, I asked a professor in Amsterdam how the Dutch system worked.  I do know about some countries such as the US which is one of the worst systems.  The problem in many parts of the US is that many people do not get on the electoral register.  In some states, that suits the state as it does not want poor and uneducated people on the register because they might vote for the wrong people.  It is the same reason we are not necessarily keen on 16-year-olds getting the vote because they might vote for the wrong people.</p><p>That is the position, although certain things have been tried in the United States.  For example, in some states people registering for a driver's licence, and everyone seems to have a driver's licence in the US, registers to vote at the same time.  This is known as "motor-voter" registration.</p><p> Regardless of which system we adopt, we do not want one that places the responsibility for registering on the individual because the responsibility for ensuring people are registered lies with the State.  The State considers it important that people have a right to vote and should make sure they have that right, regardless of whether they want it.</p><p> We then move to the issue of turnout.  At the moment, we speak a great deal about turnout, yet we do not have a clue about the level of turnout.  It may be 5% or 10% more than the figures indicate.  The only thing we can be certain about is that more people vote than the statistics would indicate because the electoral register is deficient.  The strong probability is that it is deficient because it features more names than it should.  </p><p> The age at which people should be able to vote is probably outside the scope of this discussion.  One of the things I expect an electoral commission to do is generate some ideas and research on precisely this type of issue.  In Australia, which uses exactly the same electoral system as we do in certain circumstances, as does New Zealand - contrary to what we may believe, the system we use is not unique - the electoral commission produces regular reports about how to improve the operation of the system.  Extensive discussion takes place about the system in a way that it has not been discussed here since the foundation of the State.  This is what an electoral commission can do for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theresa Reidy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015061600002#R00200"><p>I agree with Dr. Marsh, especially with regard to conducting research on elections.  In Canada and New Zealand, the electoral commissions regularly produce research on issues such as lowering the voting age.  Some countries also do trial runs, which means they will temporarily reduce the voting age, for example.  In certain regions in Germany, for example, the voting age was reduced to 16 years for some local elections.  Following an evaluation, it was decided to stick with the lower voting age.  These are precisely the types of things an electoral commission should do.</p> <p>  In terms of increasing participation, while the levels of trust and integrity in the electoral system are high, one of the problems we have is that the system of electoral administration is moribund and has not moved into the 21st century.  Other countries have experimented with postal voting and Latvia has looked a great deal at online voting.  In Ireland, we restrict access to postal voting when we should be examining how to provide greater access to the polls for citizens through, for example, early voting, more postal voting and alternative ways of casting ballots.  If one had a structured framework such as an electoral commission with the capacity to do research and subsequently, with the agreement of parliament, as occurs in Canada, conduct trials about how this would operate, it would be possible to expand the electoral functions while maintaining trust in the system.  Care is needed, however, and we should not adopt a system that randomly trials any form of innovation.  This must be done in a structured fashion that is accountable to citizens and grounded in research.  </p> <p>  There are many different options available in the area of voter registration.  As Professor Farrell noted, the electoral commission should, in the first instance, initiate a consultation on this issue before proceeding as changing the electoral registration process is a big job.  One of the reasons a commission should be established quickly is that one of the biggest jobs it will face is to decide how electoral registration should occur.  It will then need a significant lead-in time to prepare for the next set of elections in order that a robust electoral register is in place beforehand and no glitches occur on election day.</p></speech>

We would expect an electoral commission to set standards, experiment and monitor.</p><p>I lived in Manchester for 20 years and can remember voting in a local election in the Asda at the far end of Manchester from where I lived.  There were no limitations on my ability to vote because the British electoral commission was experimenting and that is what we would be considering here.  I will give members one potentially mundane example of just how bad things are here.  Where does one go when one wishes to learn who won an election or what were the election results?  One goes to RTE, to a television company.  That should be the function of an electoral commission and one should not be using a utility to try to get that information.  It should be the job of the electoral commission of Ireland to provide such information as it happens but that is not available in this country.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether Professor Farrell referred to this - I note his observation about voting in shopping centres, that is, where people actually go - but having a day for voting and whether we really have experimented with Saturdays or Sundays, which for many people are not working days.  The evidence shows that in the early part of the last century, there were many more polling stations.  However, if one specifically considers shopping centres, that is where people go in their tens of thousands in cities and in their hundreds in smaller towns.</p> <p>  I am not criticising local authorities but the day of the rent or the rates collector looking after the register is long gone.  Change, in particular in an urban environment, is so frequent and so massive that there is no way one can keep track of them casually or as part of a part-time job in addition to other work.  Were one to consider any agency, An Post should be considered, as that company knows exactly where everybody lives, as it delivers the mail and the bills.  Were one to use such organisations that already are visiting people's homes daily, one would have a far better register than one has at present.  Moreover, if one contacts people on the register the day after one receives it as a public representative, one will find that 10% to 20% of those people are incorrectly on the register for some reason and there is a huge margin of error there.  Consequently, if one gets a 70% or 65% turnout at a polling station, it probably is akin to an 80% turnout of the people who are alive and who are actually able to vote at that time.</p> <p>  The other important issue is the question of reform to which Senator Mac Conghail referred.  He is an example of the reform the Government has brought about and is in the Seanad because the Taoiseach properly and rightly nominated him.  Indeed, the vast majority of the Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad were non-political appointments and to state there has been no reform flies in the face of his own voice, because his is a non-political voice and I make that point to the Senator.  Moreover, I have no problem with listening to criticism, which I welcome.  However, I welcome the Senator, in particular, as well as everyone else.  Every voice should be heard in the Oireachtas.  As for the Seanad, the Government tried to reform it and while I acknowledge the people made a choice on that-----</p></speech>

The Government put that to the people, they gave a result and the Government accepted it.  The other reform proposed by the Government concerned the power of Oireachtas committees, which was put to the people.  That was turned down but to state there was no reform is not accurate.</p> <p>  The other point I wish to make concerns the question of local government reform.  One major reform that took place was the introduction of a highly unpopular tax, namely, the property tax.  However, that tax put on a statutory basis an income for local government that would be independent of the tax system and would be based on property values locally.  One thing I would like to see a commission examining is the entire question of local government reform.  There have been political experiments but I do not believe the last one has worked particularly well.  I certainly believe that large towns, which have lost their corporations or councils, are now at a major disadvantage because they have been subsumed into a county-based structure.  Moreover, most people do not know the local councillors any more because they go off to the county town, nobody knows what is happening and there is no local debate on local issues.  While I acknowledge it was unproductive in some respects, it involved the community.  Politics is about everybody having a voice, everybody being aware of what is going on and helping people to participate.</p><p>If an electoral commission were to compile reports on local government reform or other issues, it would have the necessary stature to ensure that such reports would be of the best quality.  Commissions are separate from and independent of Government and it is they which should be charged with having such reports compiled.</p><p> There is a great deal of potential for change.  I welcome our guests and I thank them for sharing their professional views with us.  Ultimately, however, the most pressing reform required relates to the electoral register.  Most of the previous speakers referred to that issue.  Apart from An Post, the only other entity which might be able to maintain the electoral register in an extremely capable fashion is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners because it has information on where citizens live.  The days of local authorities being responsible for maintaining the electoral register are long gone.</p></speech>

It probably would be sensible to try to limit what it does to the electoral process itself.  Perhaps it might review matters in a broad sense but not widely enough that it would be expected to advise the Government as to whether, for example, town councils should be reintroduced.  It could, I suppose, express a view regarding the ratio of numbers of local representatives to numbers of citizens and there might be some incidental issues on which it might advise.  However, the idea that it is some form of panacea for political reform generally is to be avoided.</p></speech>

I accept that the commission should not be examining the possibility of tinkering with the system.  What I am suggesting is that it should consider what are the alternatives, rather than leaving it to the Government of the day to do so.  Obviously, the Government must ultimately either introduce  legislation or put a proposition to the people.  I am genuinely convinced that local government is losing out and that towns are definitely losing out.  More power has been transferred to the Executive, to officials and to administrative systems locally as a result of the changes that have been made.  That is my honest opinion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1195" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015061600002#T00900"><p>I am open to the idea of a commission but people are concerned that it will just be another quango.  How would such an entity impact on current council staff?  We do not, for example, want people to lose their jobs.  Neither do we want to see the maintenance of the electoral register or other electoral commission functions being privatised.  I would baulk at the idea that judges must automatically preside over every commission.  Why should that be the case?  There are capable and competent people who are not judges.  In fact, one could argue that many judges are not necessarily automatically competent and capable.  I just do not understand why - no offence - it must be a male judge or academic who runs these things. The staff complement attaching to the commission should be small.</p> <p>  The people who should be involved in the electoral commission are the members of the four largest sectors that are currently outside the system.  The first such group is migrants.  Some 23% of the people who live in my constituency of Dublin West were born outside Ireland.  Most of these individuals are completely disenfranchised.  They live, work and pay taxes here and they have their children here.  Many of them might be citizens but they do not realise that they are entitled to a full vote because they have never been informed of that fact.  The remainder are not citizens but they should also be entitled to the vote, particularly if they have lived and worked here for five years or more.  Many of those felt excluded because they could not vote in the recent referendums.  Such people should be involved in any discussion on this matter.</p><p>How will these people be integrated into the political process they are currently excluded from?<br/><br/>The second group I have huge concerns about is renters.  Every time people change address in this country, they have to go to the Garda station, fill a form, which they have either downloaded or gotten from the council and then queue in the station, which could take any length of time.  I bore witness to this last year when I stood in a by-election.  Why is this the case?  The number of renters has increased by 52% in 18 months in the State, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i>rent report, published yesterday.  A total of 700,000 people are renting.  How can we have an accurate electoral register with that number renting and when we make it difficult for people?  I agree it is insane the lengths people are put to to go on the register or to take part in the voting process.<br/><br/>Young people are another issue.  As we witnessed during the recent referendum, they will vote when they feel there is something worth voting for.  Young people played a critical role in the passing of the referendum, as did working class people, who do not normally vote.  There was a higher turnout in working class areas and among women.  Those where the people who were concerned about the issue based on my own canvassing.  I favour the lowering of the age to vote but why do we make it difficult for young people to get on the register.  Surely, when they do their leaving certificate examinations, there should be a table in the room where they can register to vote because they generally will be aged 18 at that point.  These initiatives need to be considered and they are not being brought forward currently.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a debate to be had about people who have been exiled from the country, mostly for economic reasons, although some have left for social reasons and by choice.  However, much of our recent emigration was forced and, therefore, there is a debate about whether voting should be opened up to them.  I am more concerned about people who live and work here having a vote.  I live in a constituency which is new, diverse, etc., and many people are being excluded.  They contact me with housing, homelessness or rent problems but they have no vote and Deputies do not care about them.  Councillors might care because they might have a local election vote but there seems to be no concern about our new population having a vote.  We have mostly focused on the register but I agree other reforms need to be examined to make it easier for people to cast their vote.<br/><br/>I am not necessarily a fan of postal voting.  I was recently in America, which uses a different electoral system, the primary system, and people have a postal vote, which must be submitted within a two-week period in this particular state.  It is difficult to get people to vote.  At least when a vote is held on one day, one can pull out the stops.  I am open to postal voting.  It is amazing that when people go on holiday, they automatically lose the right to vote.  It was booked well in advance of the election being called, for example, or for work reasons and we have all experienced that.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with anything the Deputy said but her points group into at least two areas.  She referred to the rights of emigrants, migrants and young people, in particular, and they all group in my area to the discussion about franchise and whether the franchise should be extended to groups that are currently not included.  A properly developed electoral commission would commission research to explore the issue and come forward with policy proposals.</p> <p>  Second, the Deputy referred to renters.  That addresses the question of voter registration, which has come up so often.  An electoral commission that is properly constituted would monitor, set down standards, look for good practice, experiment and come forward with proposals for change.  I am completely on the same page as the Deputy.</p></speech>

The views are not entirely consistent on postal voting.  Many of the conclusions on such voting say it makes it easier to vote for those who would vote anyway.  Clearly, if one goes on holiday and otherwise could not vote, it would help but those who do not tune into politics and would not think about voting still would not vote even with a postal vote.  There are other consequences of postal voting.</p><p>In Sweden, where postal voting is very easy, at least two thirds vote long before the election is actually held which means running around campaigning is a waste of time as most of the people have already voted.</p><p> I was asked about judges.  I sat here before and suggested a head of a tabloid newspaper should run the electoral commission rather than a judge because they might be rather better at communicating with the people than the average judge, although there have been some very good ones.  I do not know that I still necessarily subscribe to that view but, equally, I do not know why a judge is thought suitable.  Having met quite a few of them, I do not think they are particularly neutral.  In comparable countries, such as the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, what we used to call the "English-speaking world", they seem to have a high opinion of judges and a low opinion of the rest of us, but that is the way it is.</p></speech>

These are practical issues and real concerns.  The media will talk about another quango and another &euro;50 million.  If we are going to set up an electoral commission, we must ask about the transitional arrangements and where people's jobs are going to go.</p> <p>  The issue of different social groups is vital to the whole discussion about what the design of the electoral commission will be.  Will it be a small group of the great and the good, the Clerk to the D&aacute;il, the Clerk to the Seanad and a judge of some sort?  I would point to the success of the Road Safety Authority, which seems to have cracked this problem by setting up a stakeholder board.  This was not in the legislation but it brought in people from various groups and listened to them on a quarterly basis in the early days of the authority's existence in order to determine the issues.  The Road Safety Authority board was concerned with governance and was not a stakeholder but the advisory stakeholder board is an idea that might address the questions raised by Deputy Coppinger. </p></speech>

There are things we can learn from other countries.  One of the reasons we recommended following something like the UK model, where they still use staff from local authorities, is because the experience of both Australia and Canada has been that it is difficult to hire staff.  These staff work for two or three days at election time.  They work quite long hours and the pay tends to be pretty poor.  Canada saw a 25% drop in the number of applications between two elections and the cautionary note in the research on electoral management bodies suggests that if there is an existing structure that works well around the provision of these <i>ad hoc</i>services that should be maintained as it can be difficult to establish new ones.  It is not that people would lose their jobs - the people who currently do the work would do it under a more structured framework with clear standards and better provision for training.</p></speech>

The people with the occupational skills of counting pieces of paper are rapidly disappearing.  On the question of a quango, there is a very good analogy in the establishment of the Courts Service in that previously the administrative support functions for the courts were scattered among the local authorities, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance but the Courts Service has generally been recognised as being a great success over the past 15 years or so.  It has brought all those things together and been able to plan effectively.  It has also absorbed substantial budget cuts successfully in the past few years.  Its board has a majority of judges but that is another story.  We only have the Courts Service because of Harry Whelehan and Fr. Brendan Smith, etc. so it may well be that we have the same scenario with the electoral commission.  Perhaps only if we have a major scandal relating to the administration of elections will we see such a body.</p></speech>

I served on the Constitutional Convention and many of the constitutional issues we looked at brought us to a recognition of the need for an electoral commission.</p><p>There was an exploration of issues and matters that could be brought within its remit.  There has been practical input from citizens working with politicians, which would be helpful. </p><p> We are focused on shortcomings, but one very interesting fact which arose from the Constitutional Convention was that most people are happy with our electoral system in terms of the single transferable vote and the PR system.  We had the opportunity to examine many other systems and it seemed that everybody was happy with ours.  In terms of reform, there has never been a Constitutional Convention before and we would not have had the referendum on marriage equality if it had not ratified it and suggested that the opportunity be given to the people to decide whether they wanted to endorse marriage equality.  That is all pretty reforming and a new and different approach to bringing forward procedural and substantive issues around the Constitution.  </p><p> One irony which strikes me in Ireland, and perhaps the Western world, is that we are very evangelical when it comes to democracy in developing countries.  We think things such as the Arab Spring are wonderful and that countries will embrace democracy.  We make sure things are done fairly in Eastern Europe and Russia.  The United States, for example, pumped a lot of money into Kenya to develop a new constitution or katiba.  We all see the value of democracy outside our country, but unfortunately when it comes to Ireland it seems the value of our democracy seems to be constantly diminishing.</p><p> In terms of reform, we no longer have town councils, we voted on whether to abolish the Seanad and there are fewer Deputies.  On the other hand, much of that matches people's general feelings about things, which may not always be rationally thought out.  The general view concerned what politicians were doing, what it was all about and quangos.  There were many buzzwords, and people felt irritated because of the pressure on them.  There was a backlash.</p><p> An electoral commission, if done the right way, would not be a quango and could encapsulate many things.  We have to go back to our citizens again.  Are we at a point where, having had the benefits of democracy for so long, now more than ever the rights of individual citizens and the right of people to live their lives they way they want to are valued more than they ever have been?  There are certain parameters, but people have the right to self-determination.  Are we now more self-centred and not as bothered by what we need to do to keep the overall framework going?  </p><p> We are all outraged by the atrocities of the past and the not-so-distant past, as well as what is happening now, such as systemic failures and so on.  The children's rights referendum was brought forward on the premise that we would strengthen children's rights, yet the turnout was poor.  I visit polling stations on the day of a referendum or election and touch base with the people running them.  They told me young people did not turn out for the children's rights referendum, which was held on a Saturday.  It was not just young people that questioned its relevance.</p><p> We know a certain socio-economic group does not vote despite being, arguably, one of the largest beneficiaries of the welfare state.  We need a reality check.  In terms of stability, perhaps democracy is boring because it all about conversation, dialogue, listening to diverse views and ultimately accepting that we will not all agree on things, such as in the most recent referendum.  Everybody does not agree on things, but we need to respect that democracy is about conversation.  Of late in this country, we have seen extreme protests which were more akin to intimidation and bullying and did not respect that the other side, be it a politician or another group, may have a different view that can be respected.</p><p>I suppose I just want to mention it.  The whole water protest was changed by what happened to the T&aacute;naiste in Jobstown.  I thought it was a disgrace.  What was the point of preventing her from leaving for three or four hours?  Were those involved hoping she would be intimidated and would change her mind?  Did they think she did not have a deep-held conviction about the particular policy she was putting forward?  Democracy is delicate.  It is only good if we keep working on it.  We constantly strive towards excellence in improving and supporting the organs and instruments of our democracy.  Sometimes I think it is important for us to reflect on that.</p><p> I would like to make another point about electoral reform.  I think it was touched on by Deputy O'Dowd.  After the Abbeylara judgment, we could not conduct inquiries in the Oireachtas in a certain fashion.  When that was put to the people, they said "No".  They decided not to give all of these powers to politicians.  That was fair enough.  Notwithstanding the problems with the ballot paper in the Seanad referendum, which were mentioned by Deputy Maloney, I do not think the public wanted to give all of the power to people in the D&aacute;il either.  We can look at the mechanics and where things could have been done better.  Regardless of whether we think the decisions ultimately made by the electorate are wise, we respect them and uphold them in our laws.</p><p> I think much of this relates to how we can get people to engage again.  When we were at the Constitutional Convention, it was suggested that we reduce the voting age and the age at which one can be a candidate in a Presidential election.  The people who made those suggestions believed that if we reduced the relevant ages, we would get more engagement and people would see the process as more relevant.  I do not agree with that.  I think there is something else to be tackled here.  People need to see the correlation between the peace and stability we enjoy in this country, compared to so many other countries, and the personal freedoms we have that are not enjoyed elsewhere.  We should have debates.  We are not always going to agree - that will be the way forever - but at least we have a vehicle to deal with it.  I definitely think an electoral commission would have a great role to play in this.</p><p> As I have described, attempts have been made to introduce many reforms.  In many cases, people have said they do not want them.  I do not think that is really what is bugging people.  What is bugging them is the economic pressure they are under.  Of course they do not want to see any sort of latchico-ism or all the sort of stuff that might have been associated with politics.  I just think we should celebrate our democracy and not be so cynical.  There are many people out there who are trying their very best.  Regardless of whether I disagree with people on a different political spectrum, I respect that they are trying their best as well.  That sort of conversation needs to be had.  I know that is not question; it is just a view.  I was one of the members of the Constitutional Convention.  We got a chance courtesy of Professor Farrell and a number of others to hear some expertise and professional contributions and to hear from citizens.  I think we have a lot to celebrate in this country.  Maybe we should remember that first and foremost.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to be out of the room for some time because of some of the demands of this place.  I strongly agree with the comments that have been made about the register of voters.  I agree with the witnesses and the speakers on this side who have said there are very serious problems in that regard.  This issue alone presents a very good case for having an electoral commission.</p> <p>  I would like to make two other points, the first of which was made by Dr. Reidy at the beginning of her presentation.  We need to recognise that we are a strong democracy and that we have a strong and long tradition of unbroken democracy.  I think there are just four or five countries in Europe that have had such a tradition since the time we became an independent state.  It is something we should cherish because it is not something any of us should take for granted.</p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the drawing of electoral boundaries.  It seems from what Deputy Maloney said to me that the witnesses may have touched on this.</p><p>At the moment, in some instances, they are drawn in a ridiculous way.  To take the area Deputy McLoughlin represents, the Sligo-Leitrim constituency will now have west Cavan and south Donegal in the same constituency as Enniscrone in the west of Sligo, which is ridiculous.  I could give other examples.  There is a good example where part of south Mayo was put into west Galway, which is another bit of lunacy.  If it had to be put into Galway, it would have made far more sense to put it in with east Galway because at least Tuam is nearby, which would be a centre.  I do not know whether the commission would be involved in trying to iron out that kind of ridiculous nonsense, which no retired politician who was involved would inflict on anybody.</p></speech>

I previously raised the issue of abuses involving the draft register of electors in my constituency at the last local elections, particularly at the Leitrim end of the constituency.  In particular, this concerns the number of people on the draft register who were actually out of the country but who were submitted for voting purposes.  While this issue has not been mentioned, it is vital that the abuses taking place with the registers are addressed.</p> <p>  Mr. John O'Dowd referred to bank tellers doing the counting.  I think we will keep the bankers out of elections, whatever else we might do.  Over the years, as I have seen first-hand at many local and national elections, the work done by the county council staff in the various constituencies is excellent.  They have worked extremely hard, they have the experience and the know-how and they have been working there for generations.  These people, both male and female, have done an excellent job over the years.  Why change something that has been very successful?  In the past, we had rate collectors who would have known everybody, including people's ages and when they came to voting age.  Unfortunately, we do not have a system like that at present.</p> <p>  Previous speakers said that nobody leaves their constituency offices without the Deputy or staff checking to see if they are on the register.</p></speech>

I check the register before they leave in order to know if they are on the register.</p> <p>  There is a problem in every constituency with regard to rentals, particularly in built-up areas, where it can be very difficult to know the position.  Professor Marsh referred to the Swedish system but that would not work with us at all.  If all of the voters had voted by postal vote in advance of a three-week election campaign, we would nearly be redundant for that three weeks, which I would not appreciate.</p> <p>  We talked about electronic voting, which was a fiasco, both financially and politically.  I honestly believe we will never go back to that again after what has happened in this country.  I would be glad to hear the comments of the witnesses.</p></speech>

The one shining light in the electoral system seems to be the role of the returning officers.  The political parties and others are very pleased with their independence and integrity and the efficiency of their operations.  I do not think anybody advocates changing that aspect of the system.</p></speech>

Again, the data that have come back from that have been very strong in regard to the impartiality and effectiveness of the staff who are involved in the conduct of polling and the counting of votes.</p><p>There is not seen to be any difficulty there, which is why we talk about consolidating these functions and providing structures and guidance.

When we look at the audit of where independent electoral commissions exist, it is telling that they are more prominent in the newer democracies.  Clearly, although we are very quick to advise new democracies that they should have independent electoral commissions, we are a bit more slow to adopt them ourselves.  Perhaps we should start thinking about following our own advice.</p></speech>

In many ways, the Indian commission has set the standards.  It can ensure that people who live in tin huts by the side of the road are registered to vote and get to vote without any difficulty.  That rather puts the problems we have in Ireland into perspective.  The Indian commission also introduced electronic voting very successfully.</p></speech>

There would be more work for academics.</p> <p>  On a cautionary note, we should not see an electoral commission as a panacea for people's lack of involvement in politics.  I would suggest the reason people are not involved in politics is that they do not think it matters.  They only think it matters if the candidate they vote for makes a difference.  Otherwise, many will ask themselves why they should bother.  It may be good that it does not make a difference.  If there is a choice between two politicians, both of whom are going to do sensible things, why bother choosing?  If, from the voter's point of view, one politician is going to be a disaster and the other is going to be sensible, that is the time to vote.</p> <p>  Turnout is affected more by whether people think it is worth it.  On the whole, they think it is worth it when politicians are more active.  We see that turnout is highest in those areas where politicians probably do the most to get involved with the community.  We see it in referendums, when the pattern of voting is entirely different from the pattern for elections.  It is down to the activities of politicians and they, not an electoral commission, can get people out to vote.  An electoral commission can do all sorts of good work to facilitate voting.  </p> <p>  The two countries with electoral commissions which I mentioned in my submission have electronic voting.  Curiously enough, both Scotland and New Zealand use exactly the same electoral system as us.  Perhaps under the advice of their electoral commissions, they had the good sense to give people ballot papers to fill in by hand.  They then scanned the ballot papers and counted them electronically.  They do not need bank tellers. Well, perhaps they do - that is how bank tellers deal with our money.</p></speech>

I presume enough has been said about the electoral register.  We have been speaking about it <i>ad infinitum</i>and the witnesses do not want to hear what is wrong with it from me again.  There is a lot right with it but a lot to be done.  Accuracy is best.</p><p>On the setting up of an independent commission, we need a definition of &quot;independent&quot;.  We must ensure that everybody is independent.  Political scientists vary.  Professor Marsh mentioned one's point of view.  Obviously, political scientists are independent but, very often, what happens with science, particularly in an electoral register where boundaries are being drawn, is that the people go out the window and the science comes in the door.  There is splitting of parishes right down the middle and it does not produce the best result for the people.  It produces the best result numerically, to serve the population in proportion to the number of Deputies, but on the ground it may not be the best.</p><p>That has to be a significant consideration for any commission examining the electoral register system.</p><p> Professor Michael Marsh spoke about being on the register and how it is important for people to vote.  In some countries, there is a penalty for not voting which is another measure which should be looked at.  It would make people think about it.  "Why bother?" might be one argument.  Why not bother if it is important to everybody else?  It is important to vote as everyone has a valuable point of view.  Some people may think it is not worth their while to vote but it is important.</p><p> I was in the Citywest Hotel the night they used electronic voting in an election and a former Minister learned she did not regain her seat.  It was an awful shock to the system.  That electronic voting system had no obvious countdown or backtrail.  If these were included in an electronic voting system, I cannot see how it would not work as it would be fast and much more efficient.  However, electronic voting has a bad name.  It is ingrained in the psyche that electronic voting is bad and, as some say, it also takes the fun out of elections.</p></speech>

What is the best international model to which we should aspire?  Is there a way of enhancing the <i>status quo</i>without departing from it?</p><p>From my experience in the Cork South-West Constituency, there has been a conscientious franchise operation there, seldom having a controversy.  Former rate collectors, for example, are still temporary franchise people and are very good at unscientifically adding people to the register.  That is a significant human resource which might not be the case in other areas.</p><p>A former environment Minister, Dick Roche, tried to confront this issue several years ago but it backfired.  It was a problem because of the number of individual local authorities involved and inconsistencies in approach.  It was difficult to find a single consistent solution to this.

One of the risks that the committee&rsquo;s process runs is if one goes too much into the detail of how to do X and Y, then the big objective is missed.

We discussed with George Bain the experience in Northern Ireland, which is not perfect by any means.  It struck us, in compiling the 2008 study, that Northern Ireland would be the logical place to start.  The broad principle in use there is a single, nationwide register which tries to track the identity of the individual and uses not only national insurance numbers but various forms of other information, including drivers' registration, etc.  What one must do is try to triangulate on the identity of the individual using a variety of sources rather than relying on any particular measure.  It struck us that, rather than trying to invent a totally new system, it would be sensible for the electoral commission to look at the Northern Ireland system as the basis for a system to operate down here.</p></speech>

This includes such matters as the electoral system and the major question as to when elections will take place.  It could be interesting to tease out in a little more detail the intersection between broad questions of electoral policy and certain technical elements of how elections are conducted <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the electoral registration system or practices such as electronic voting.  For example, it could tease out the extent to which it is the role of the electoral commission to recommend policy and the areas in which it has scope to introduce policy.<br/><br/>Rather than specifically considering each individual area, perhaps the electoral commission should consider the point at which broad electoral policy meets technical election issues and who is responsible for what.  One of the issues that repeatedly arises is that all kinds of developments take place in the electoral area and we must wait for legislation.  I refer, for example, to the role of the Internet and social media.  In what space does the electoral commission have the capacity to respond to these types of developments and in what space does one rely on Parliament to lay the groundwork or set the framework within which decisions can be taken?</p></speech>

The meeting took place in Brussels on 12 May, with an agenda dominated by discussions relating to the investment plan for Europe, the draft conclusions on the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, in-depth reviews and the 2015 Ageing Report.  Ministers discussed progress in the negotiations with the European Parliament on the Commission proposals for the European fund for strategic investments, EFSI.  As members know, the EFSI is central to the Commission's &euro;315 billion investment plan for Europe.  The aim was to finalise negotiations by the end of May.</p> <p>  The Council adopted the draft conclusions on the in-depth reviews of macroeconomic imbalances in 16 member states, agreeing that this was a useful exercise to better examine and discuss the economic policies of member states because it allowed for improved transparency and feedback on the Commission's analysis.  All 16 of the examined member states are experiencing macroeconomic imbalances of varying degrees and the analysis shows that many of the imbalances experienced in Ireland are legacy impacts of the crisis and are in the process of unwinding.  The Commission was invited to produce focused recommendations for the members states to help address these macroeconomic imbalances and the need for policy action and a strong commitment to structural reforms in all member states was underlined.  Ireland remains committed to progress and has appropriate policies in place to address these recommendations, which are set out in the medium-term economic strategy.</p> <p>  The Council welcomed the overall progress made in addressing the 2014-15 country-specific and euro area recommendations, but recognised that reform implementation needed to be stepped up to address the individual policy challenges facing member states and to ensure swift and sustainable economic recovery.  The 2015-16 country-specific recommendations were published in mid-May and form part of the June ECOFIN agenda.  The Commission was advised to focus on areas of macroeconomic significance where there was an urgent need for action in order to give these issues more visibility in the member states' national political debates.</p> <p>  Ministers endorsed the 2015 Ageing Report, which deals with age-related expenditure projections for member states over the 2013-60 period.  As a result of recent reforms and more benign demographic developments projected for the EU as a whole, the projected increase in the total age-related expenditure over that period is now lower than the 2012 projection.  The Council adopted conclusions concerning how the economic and financial crisis had put a significant burden on public finances and led to rising deficits and debt levels.  The Council also stressed the need for appropriate growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and further implementation of structural reforms in order to enhance the sustainability of public finances.</p> <p>  The Council invited the Economic Policy Committee to update its analysis of the economic and budgetary implications of population ageing by autumn 2018 on the basis of new population projections to be provided by EUROSTAT and the national statistical institutions.  EUROSTAT has also been asked to provide annual updates of its population projections systematically, in particular as regards migration flows, to be used in the short to medium-term forecast horizon.  This ongoing work will ensure that adequate information is available to policy makers in a timely fashion and will allow appropriate policies to be developed and put in place.</p><p>The June ECOFIN meeting will be the final Council under the Latvian Presidency.  I acknowledge the success of the Latvian Presidency and the progress it has made.  Luxembourg will take over the Presidency role on 1 July and I wish it every success.</p><p> I remind members that the agenda provided is a draft and changes in content and the order of the discussion may still be made before the meeting.  Ambassadors are meeting tomorrow to consider the draft agenda, which is busy in content as matters stand.  I am aware that some items will change and I will draw members' attention to these as I work through them.</p><p> The Council will begin by considering legislative deliberations.  This takes place in public session and based on the draft of the agenda, eight items are scheduled for discussion.  These are: the approval of the list of "A" items, which are matters to be taken without discussion; the common system of value added tax as regards the treatment of vouchers, which has been withdrawn from the agenda; the common system of value added tax for the standard VAT return, which has also been withdrawn owing to the absence of agreement; administrative co-operation concerning a proposal for a directive on mandatory and automatic exchange of information on cross-border tax rulings; the interest and royalties directive regarding a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different member states; the investment plan for Europe known as the European Fund for Strategic Infrastructure, EFSI; banking structural reform, namely, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council on structural measures improving the resilience of European Union credit institutions; and any other business.</p><p> In terms of the common system of value added tax as regards the treatment of vouchers, this proposal is designed to modernise VAT rules on vouchers.  The proposal is driven by the increasing sophistication and functionality of vouchers, especially electronic vouchers, and the need for a consistent approach in light of different VAT treatments that have developed across member states.  Such treatments may be contributing to double taxation or non-taxation in the cross-border context, that is, where vouchers are issued in one member state but used by consumers in another member state.  While technically complex, the measure will further improve the functioning of the Single Market and lead to increased revenues to exchequers across Europe.  I understand that the Presidency will not put forward the proposal for discussion at ECOFIN as further work is required at official level.</p><p> With regard to the common system of value added tax for the standard VAT return, the Commission has withdrawn this proposal and the item will be removed from the agenda as a common approach is not possible at this time.  </p><p> Regarding administrative co-operation concerning the proposal for a directive on mandatory and automatic exchange of information on cross-border tax rulings, this proposal will provide for the mandatory automatic exchange of information regarding advance cross-border rulings and advance pricing arrangements.  The latter are a particular type of advance cross-border ruling used in the area of transfer pricing.  The proposal on this month's ECOFIN agenda is the second amendment to the directive on administrative co-operation and was published by the Commission on 18 March as part of a tax transparency package.  At this ECOFIN meeting, we will receive a state-of-play report from the Presidency on the progress at technical level on this file.  My officials will continue to engage with the other member states in the Council working parties to progress the technical work necessary to ensure agreement on this important issue.  In general, Ireland is favourably disposed towards the proposal.</p><p> The interest and royalties directive was agreed in 2003.  The purpose of the directive was to reduce a barrier to trade between member states by removing withholding tax on interest and royalty payments between member states, thereby avoiding double taxation where the recipient member state taxes the same income.  In 2011, in response to concerns that the directive was being abused, the Commission proposed to amend it to provide that it would only apply where the recipient member state applies a certain level, namely, a minimum amount, of taxation to the interest and royalty payments.  The Latvian Presidency has continued the work on this directive and has proposed to separate the two live issues on this dossier relating to the introduction of a general anti-avoidance rule and the issue of minimum levels of taxation.  The purpose of this split is to progress the much less contentious issue of the general anti-avoidance rule and prioritise agreement on this anti-abuse element.  Ireland supports the approach to split the proposal.  </p><p> Regarding the investment plan for Europe, the European Fund for Strategic Infrastructure, EFSI, was also discussed at the May ECOFIN meeting.  This item has been placed on the agenda to endorse the political agreement reached recently with the European Parliament on the regulation for the EFSI.  The Latvian Presidency deserves praise for its work in managing the negotiation over a short space of time.  Like all member states, Ireland is keen to see EFSI activities that benefit our economy and the EU economy as a whole.</p><p> On banking structural reform, this proposal is critical to addressing the banks that are considered to be too big to fail as it will make such banks more resolvable by separating proprietary trading, that is, banks trading on their own account and, in particular, other high-risk trading activity from normal retail activity.  The separation would only be mandatory for those banks with significant trading activities and would only apply to the largest and most complex European Union banks with significant trading activities, namely, those European banks deemed to be of global systemic importance or those exceeding certain thresholds, for example, &euro;30 billion in assets and trading activities exceeding &euro;70 billion in value or 10% of the bank's total assets.  Council negotiations have been ongoing for the best part of a year and the Latvian Presidency aims to secure Council agreement on this issue.  The measure would not apply to Irish banks, although we have a strong interest in seeing how it applies to European banks now that we are on the verge of banking union. </p><p> On non-legislative activities, based on the draft agenda before us, there are ten items scheduled for discussion.  These are: the approval of the list of "A" items, which are items to be taken without discussion; implementation of the banking union; the adoption of the Council conclusion on capital markets union; endorsement of the ECOFIN report to the European Council on tax issues and the report by finance Ministers on tax issues in the framework of the Euro Plus Pact; Council conclusions on, and endorsement of, a report on the code of conduct on business taxation; the contribution to the European Council meeting of 25 and 26 June, namely, the European semester, which will consider the 2015 national reform programmes and stability or convergence programmes for each member state and approve the recommendations in respect of these programmes; the approval of the implementation of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of member states whose currency is the euro; an opportunity will be provided to discuss the report prepared by the five Presidents if this becomes available in time; a report to the European Council on broad economic policy guidelines; the adoption of Council decisions on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact; and any other business.</p><p> Good progress has been made on the implementation of the banking union.  The single supervisory mechanism, SSM, which came into effect on 4 November 2014, will ensure the European Union's policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner.  The key outstanding implementation issues for all banking union member states are the transposition of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, and the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement, IGA, to the single resolution mechanism.  On the IGA, the Government has approved the draft heads for ratification and the pre-legislative scrutiny process has been completed.  Work is on track to bring this legislation to the Oireachtas in the early autumn to meet the deadline of December. </p><p> Capital markets union aims to put in place alternative sources of funding through the development of a more balanced and diversified European financial system which complements bank based financing with deep and developed capital markets.</p><p>At the June ECOFIN, Ministers will have an exchange of views and adopt the draft Council conclusions on the capital markets union initiative.  The draft conclusions are broad-ranging, covering issues such as the need to promote an equity culture, the need to break down barriers to the development of cross-border capital markets, and the greater role for the insurance and pensions sector in long-term infrastructure projects.  This will prepare the ground for the Commission action plan due out in September.</p><p> The next three items - the ECOFIN report to the European Council on tax issues, the report by finance Ministers on tax issues in the framework of the Euro Plus pact and a report on the code of conduct on business taxation are all expected to be taken as "A" items and therefore endorsed without discussion.  The code of conduct report, which deals with business taxation, particularly harmful tax competition, is a regular item at the end of each Presidency.  This report has been prepared by the code of conduct group on business taxation.</p><p> The next item is the contribution to the European Council meeting and the European semester.  The committee will be aware that the European semester process has been in operation since 2011 and is a regime for economic surveillance.  As Ireland was in the EU-IMF programme until December 2013, Ireland did not fully participate in the first three semester cycles.  However, since December 2013, Ireland has been fully participating in the semester process, which is part of the normalisation of our position as a post-programme country.  As the committee will be aware, the annual semester process is part of the new economic governance regime of the European Union which has been established to underpin sound public finances, sustainable and inclusive growth and the correction of macroeconomic imbalances across the European Union.</p><p> The European semester has two phases, the first of which is horizontal and the second of which is more country-specific.  Broad horizontal guidance was provided by the European Heads of State and Government at the European Council in March, and then the process became more country-specific in orientation.  For Ireland's part, in April, my Department submitted Ireland's stability programme to the Commission.  The Department of the Taoiseach then submitted the national reform programme on structural reforms and measures to boost growth and jobs, also in April.</p><p> The Commission then assessed all member states' documents and, following bilateral engagement with the member states, issued country-specific recommendations on 13 May to all member states except for Greece.  The CSR proposals are intended to provide specific tailored guidance to each recipient member state on how to achieve sound public finances, what structural reforms should be implemented to achieve smart sustainable growth, and how to correct macroeconomic imbalances.  As we are strongly committed to continuing progress in restoring financial stability, fiscal sustainability and economic growth, we welcome the country-specific recommendations, as they will facilitate us in achieving this and will support the polices set out in the recent spring economic statement.  The Commission confirms that Ireland is on track to correct its excessive deficit in 2015.  On the basis of information in the 2015 stability programme, recalculated according to the commonly agreed methodology, progress towards the medium-term objective in 2016 is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  For 2015, Ireland has received a reduced number of country-specific recommendations, which are consistent with existing Government policies.  We note that the areas covered this year follow on from those of last year, covering public finances, health care, social inclusion and mortgage arrears, with particular reference to non-performing loans.</p><p> In addition to approving the tailored recommendations to each member state, Ministers will also discuss key aspects and themes from member states' stability and convergence programmes and the Commission's horizontal guidance for the euro area, which is presented in the form of a set of country-specific recommendations for the euro area as a whole.  We welcome the euro area's country-specific recommendations, which are largely consistent with the Irish position, and we share the focus on ensuring that member states work together to put in place and maintain the necessary conditions for stability, growth and jobs.</p><p> The objective of next Friday's ECOFIN meeting is to approve the recommendations for member states.  It is intended that these recommendations will be endorsed by the June European Council and finally adopted by finance Ministers at the July ECOFIN Council.</p><p> In terms of the report on implementation of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the member states whose currency is the euro, the debate on improving economic governance in the euro area represents the resumption of a process which began at the height of the crisis in June 2012.  A report by the presidents of the Commission, Euro Summit, the Eurogroup and the ECB - the four presidents, which recently became known as the five presidents, as the European Parliament President has become more formally involved in the process - and the Commission's "A Blueprint for a Deep and Genuine Economic and Monetary Union" pointed the way to a proposed deepening of co-ordination in the areas of banking, economic policy and fiscal policy.</p><p> Ireland is among the member states which believes that we need to focus on full implementation of reforms agreed in recent years before embarking on an overly ambitious roadmap of significant change.  Our main emphasis now has to be on economic growth - that is, growth based not only on sound public finances and ongoing structural reform, but also driven by productive investment.  We need economic growth at a rate sufficient to get people back to work as well as to re-establish the commitment of our citizens to the European ideal.</p><p> Ministers will also discuss the report to the European Council on the broad economic policy guidelines.  These guidelines enable the economic policies of the member states to be co-ordinated in order to achieve joint objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  They also form the basis for any country-specific recommendations that the Council may address to the member states.</p><p> Finally, on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ministers will discuss member states' compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, particularly with regard to the excessive deficit procedure, EDP.  The discussion will focus on Council recommendations to extend the deadline for the United Kingdom to correct its excessive deficit by two years, and to abrogate the EDP for Poland and Malta.  Abrogation of Ireland's EDP should occur next year, as abrogation of an EDP occurs in the year following compliance with the fiscal targets set out.  We will then be subject to the rules of the preventive arm of the pact from 2016 onwards.</p><p> With regard to Finland, based on the European Commission spring forecasts, Finland was deemed not to have complied with the deficit and debt criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact.  However, Finland's stability programme update was submitted on a no-policy-change basis due to parliamentary elections in April.  The new government will submit a fiscal plan and stability programme for 2016&ndash;2019 by September 2015.  Progress will be reassessed in September and a decision then made on whether or not to open up an EDP.</p><p>  I trust the Chairman found the summary of last month's ECOFIN meeting and the outline of this month's ECOFIN agenda informative.  I believe they give a good insight into the current issues before the Council.  I thank the committee for its attention.  At this point, I will be happy to respond to any questions or observations from the committee members.</p></speech>

I will ask the most obvious question about his proposed meeting.  I am sure that everyone who listened to his speech was struck by the elephant in the room that he chose not to mention.  Why was there no mention of the Greek situation?  If the Eurogroup of finance Ministers believe that the impact of an unsatisfactory end to Greece's economic adjustment programme at the end of June will be confined to the 17 euro countries, I fail to understand why Greece is not central to the meeting.</p></speech>

The only way that the ECOFIN Council will discuss Greece is in terms of a report by the president of the Eurogroup, which he will provide at the start of the meeting.  He will report on what happened at the Eurogroup meeting.  It is the Eurogroup that will discuss Greece.  The president of the Eurogroup, Mr. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance Minister, will report to ECOFIN at the start of its meeting, but it is not an agenda item.  I have no problem with Deputy Fleming discussing Greece now.  I do not have much light to cast on the situation.  I am doing what the committee requested me to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015061600002#E00700"><p>The formal agenda.  Perhaps it is a matter for consideration, given the fact that some issues that are not on the formal agenda might be discussed.  For future reference, there might be a mechanism to have such a debate.</p> <p>  I will ask two questions briefly, as our time is limited.  The Minister mentioned the issue of banks that were too big to fail.  I have a problem with that concept, but how many banks in the EU are considered too big to fail?  How many of those are in Ireland?  How many trade in the IFSC?  The Minister also mentioned the single resolution mechanism.  Does it apply to a separate group?  There are set criteria.  Is the mechanism meant for a group other than those banks that are too big to fail?  If banks are too big to fail, must domestic taxpayers pick up the tab?  Is it only when the taxpayer fails that the single resolution mechanism for providing assistance at EU level can be used?  Are we accepting in our framework the principle of a bank being too big to fail without even examining each case?  The domestic taxpayer in whatever the country will be caught again.  How can the Minister expect the banks to learn lessons if they will always have the safety net of the single resolution mechanism?  Sometimes, it might be right to let a bank fail, even if it is big.</p></speech>

It became the conversation point, in that people believed that banks were too big to fail.  The American authorities then allowed Lehman Brothers to fail.  The phrase has no legal status and no bank in Europe is too big to fail.  What is being done here is so that banks can be resolved less expensively.  If there is a residual piece that must be bailed out by the taxpayers of Europe rather than the taxpayers of an individual country, a division is being made in terms of larger banks between the activities in which they indulge for their profitability and their functions as retails banks in supplying to individuals and small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, the credit streams that countries need to grow economically.</p> <p>  A version of this approach arose several years ago when we were discussing the first run of the banking crisis, with investment banking separate from retail banking.  The purpose of the current approach is to reduce the piece that must be resolved subsequently.</p></speech>

It is just one sentence.  The Minister stated that the common system of VAT for the standard VAT return was not progressing.  Which country will lose as a result of that system not progressing?  Will we gain or lose?  There must be some winners or losers in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI, companies that have branches and group companies in the EU.  Some countries must gain under the status quo while others might lose under the new arrangement.</p></speech>

I will not refer to any of the jargon, but I will take up his comment that he would not mind questions on Greece.  Yesterday, we met Commissioner Jonathan Hill.  The Minister and I briefly discussed the visit beforehand.  The Commissioner was interesting.  We discussed a possible Brxit and Grxit.  Given the Greek situation is a delicate stage, it is generally agreed that Greece falsified its position and lied its way into the euro.  What is the Minister's take on this?  Can we keep Greece in the club while returning it to the drachma?  Are there possible adverse impacts for us?  Deputy Rabbitte might correct me but, on balance, the Commissioner seemed inclined to believe that Greece could still be held within it, if there was the political will.  We would be interested in the Minister's view.</p></speech>

They have suffered a great deal for a long time.  They have experienced a level of suffering that we did not even though our community had to make many sacrifices.  This is the first point that I would make.</p> <p>  I have great regrets that Greece, which was on the cusp of recovery at the start of 2015, has returned to recession.</p><p>On the hopes of an arrangement being made between the European creditor countries and the Greek authorities, no paper is available to me at the current time that suggests we will have any paper-based discussion at the meeting of the Eurogroup on Thursday.  No negotiation is proceeding at the current time.  In the middle of last week it looked as if we were on the cusp of an arrangement, but that dissipated, as the committee is probably aware from newspaper reports, and there is no proposal on the table.  While there will be some discussion on Greece, in the absence of paper generated by the institutions formerly called the troika, there will not be a substantive discussion on it.</p></speech>

After that meeting a common paper was put forward.  There might not have been a commonality of view, but there was an agreed text, which was offered to the Greek authorities, and it seemed as though it was acceptable from the reports we got back.  It then went off the rails again for reasons with which I am not totally <i>au fait</i>.</p></speech>

The triggers are always the repayment dates for Greece, of which there were four in the month of June for the IMF.  There is small print in IMF contract documents and there is at least one precedent that if a country owes a number of repayments to the IMF in the one month, it can bundle them and put them to the end of the month.  There was a decision to do that.  Even if a repayment was not made at the end of June, there would not be an immediate default.  It would be considered to be arrears due for another calendar month.  That would not create a crisis.  The problem is not in that area.  Rather, the problem arises if Greece needs extra money not to default, because in certain countries such as Germany and Finland there has to be a parliamentary process to vote extra money.  Other parliaments, including ours, are going into recess in July, and because of the recess in Germany and other countries, very little space would be available to conduct the necessary parliamentary process to vote the money from individual counties or authorise the money under the legal authorisations required in other countries if an agreement was reached with Greece.</p> <p>  In terms of payments, about &euro;3.5 billion is due to the ECB on 20 July.  As a result of the parliamentary process necessary, we will reach the endpoint before 20 July.</p></speech>

When the negotiations appeared at first to be successful and then went off the rails again, the IMF withdrew from the negotiations.  That does not mean it is out.  People withdraw from negotiations and come back again.  What is absolute is that the timeframe is now very tight and, even with the best will in the world, accidents can happen.</p></speech>

Its representatives also mentioned the fact that GDP is forecast to rise by 17.3% between 2016 and 2020 but Government consumption would only rise by 5.7%, meaning State spending as a proportion of GDP would actually shrink.  Is that the objective of the Government?</p> <p>  I asked the fiscal council what the level of Government investment in the economy should be.  Its delegates said it should be 4% but the Government's projection is for a decrease from 1.8% to 1.5% in that timescale.  That would mean the capital stock of the country would suffer as a result.</p></speech>

If it said, "Great Government - throw your hats into the air.  Three cheers for the Government.", I do not think it would be doing its job.  That does not mean that, while it exercises its independent view, I as Minister for Finance have to agree with it.  It made a statement to the effect that we would not meet European fiscal rules.  The referee on European fiscal rules is the Commission and the Commission has already said we will meet both of them.  The Commission put out new forecasts after the spring statement was published.  We knew they were coming out and that they would be more optimistic than the ones we had in the spring statement but we could not prejudge them and had to put in what we had.  The argument of the fiscal council is that we will not reduce the structural deficit by more that 0.5% each year, which is the rule, and the spring statement said we would reduce it by 0.3% but it failed to note that, a couple of weeks afterwards, the Commission put out new forecasts.  The Commission's view, which it has made public, is that we will not adjust by 0.3% but by 0.8% in 2016, which would be well ahead of the requirement to adjust by more than 0.5% in the year.  I do not know why the fiscal council was not aware of that.  It is the Commission that decides whether we meet the target or not.</p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council also seemed to imply that we did not take any account of demographic changes but there is &euro;300 million for demographic changes.</p></speech>

The next Government is reaching out to 2020.  We gave very specific indicators of the budget for 2016 but we said that, beyond that, we had identified the fiscal space.  The projections are on a no policy change basis so the policy changes will be a matter for the Minister for Finance on the day he brings in the budget.  If he has a four or five year mandate, he can indicate for the full period but it is anti-democratic for a Minister, when an election is due within 12 months, to prescribe the details of budgets for the next five years.  I am, however, outlining the fiscal space in accordance with the fiscal rules.</p> <p>  The fiscal council also said we will correct excessive deficits this year and that is a very positive statement.  I do not have a lot of quarrel with the fiscal council's overall analysis and I share its overall analysis.  I think the council is very important and I admire its work, which is difficult.  It is independent but so am I, apart from being accountable to Deputies in the Parliament. </p></speech>

The fiscal council suggests it is unwise to use the fiscal space of &euro;1.2 billion in next year's budget but that &euro;750 million would be more appropriate.  Does the Deputy think that macroeconomics is such a refined art that the spending of an extra &euro;450 million will ruin a country with a budget in excess of &euro;50 billion?  The amount of money it has identified as being between its position and my position for 2016 seems within a margin of error and it is certainly around the figure by which the Department of Health overruns its Estimate in most years.  I do not get the argument but that is not to say the fiscal council does not do a good job and, generally, it is in the same space as I am in terms of the management of fiscal affairs.  We are obliged to reply to the fiscal council's submission and we will do so in detail in the next couple of weeks.  We will then publish our reply on the website.</p></speech>

I contend strongly that the negotiations from the point of view of the European institutions are not being carried out in a frame of mind consistent with negotiations between partners to achieve a mutually beneficial solution.  They are being carried out to inflict humiliation on the Greek Government and the Greek people in order to send a message across Europe not to take a risk with Podemos in Spain or governments of the Left in Ireland or Portugal.  The European institutions have not taken seriously any of the significant concessions made by Syriza in the course of negotiations and they are not negotiating seriously to find an agreement.  Does the Minister concur with that analysis or does he think there is just no agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015061600002#G02300"><p>The institutions are negotiating in good faith and a number of examples have appeared in the media without contradiction.  One of the key requirements for the Greek authorities is that the primary surplus of 4.5%, which was originally required, would no longer be required.  That was a huge concession by the European institutions.  As colleagues know, a primary surplus is the surplus a country has if it does not have to make any debt repayments and the surplus exists to make the debt sustainable.  As I understand it, they have offered a much lower primary surplus, at 1% for 2015 escalating to 3.5% by 2017-2018, but they have moved away from the primary requirement.</p><p>I am using that only as an example to suggest that, from what I have read in the media, which was not contradicted by either side, there is a genuine effort by the institutions to reach a middle position.  I was talking to colleagues on the telephone last week and it appeared to them, according to their information from Brussels, that we were on the cusp of an agreement.</p></speech>

In terms of the primary surplus, Syriza and the Greek Government have moved on a rise in value added tax, VAT, on postponing the rise in the minimum wage, collective bargaining, pensions and a whole range of issues but the line from the institutions is that the other side is not seriously willing to negotiate.  Is there not politics at play here?  Is it not just the same as when the Minister talks about looking after our interest?  Are those not the interests of the Government as opposed to the people?</p></speech>

We do not have an Irish representative at the technical talks but nor does any other country.  The negotiations involve the representatives of the three institutions and of the Greek Government.  By the middle of last week, all information emanating publicly and privately suggested that both sides were compromising.  I cannot endorse the individual items the Deputy mentions.  Within that range of items, there was certainly movement by the Greek authorities.  There was a corresponding movement from the institutions and by late Wednesday evening it looked as if it was moving towards resolution of the issue with an agreement but that is not the position now.  When the Greek Prime Minister spoke in the Greek Parliament on Friday night last, it was quite clear the situation had changed.  The gap now seems to be again unbridgeable.</p></speech>

Is that just debt write-downs for Greece or is the Minister against them for Ireland, if they were to be offered, or if we were to get them if we asked for them, or is it debt write-downs only for tremendously rich private individuals paid for by the taxpayer and not for the country?  Is it not the case that our interests coincide with the interests of ordinary people in Greece?  We have similar targets on primary surplus from the troika and the EU institutions.  We spend a similar percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, on our interest on our debt every year.  We have similar high levels of debt, although the Greek debt is higher.  Do we not have a common interest, within that framework, of lower primary surplus targets and reduced debt?</p></speech>

They are rhetorical questions to make political points.  As I stated at the start of the process we are engaged in now, we stated our position very early on at the first meeting where this was discussed in the Eurogroup and ECOFIN.  At the meeting, and publicly, I stated the Irish position was that we want Greece to stay in the euro and we are opposed to any write-downs of Greek nominal debt.  We also went on to say that we appreciated the difficulty of Greece, the amount of sacrifices made and the amount of suffering incurred by many ordinary individuals in Greece.  We said we were willing to participate in a negotiation which would alleviate the burden and that there are other ways to do that rather than nominal write-downs.</p></speech>

Would it not be in our interest that there would be a European debt conference and a process of write-down of unsustainable debt?  I do not understand how it is not in our interests that we have our own debt written down, together with that of Greece, Spain, Portugal, etc.</p></speech>

I told the Greek Finance Minister that he should look at the way we resolved our problems when we were refused a write-down on the private debt element.  We resolved our problems by getting very long extensions of the maturities of the official loans to Ireland.  We got all the margins removed, relating to the moral persuasion issue and came down to very low interest rates on the debt.  We negotiated a separate arrangement to replace the promissory note.  That was before the Deputy won the by-election.  We were obliged to pay &euro;3.1 billion every March.  That was going to go on for more than a decade, then diminishing amounts for another decade.  We negotiated to reduce the burden of debt.  Our debt peaked at 123% of GDP last year.  It will be 109% at the end of this year.</p> <p>  I hope to break the 100% with the measures we are taking in the budget, which will be announced on 13 October for the end of 2016.  If we are down to 100% or 99% at the end of 2016 and the eurozone average is 94.5%, we will be very near the average.  That is not taking into account any sale of assets or bank shares or anything like that, or the adjustments which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will make in early July when it takes new ways of calculating GDP into account.  That, I believe, will run in a small way to our advantage as well.  We negotiated.</p> <p>  I have no animus towards the Greek people.  I like the Greek people.  I get on reasonably well with the Greek Finance Minister but I would prefer if he did not interfere in Irish politics and start making noises of approval about Sinn F&eacute;in.  I do not make noises of approval about his political opponents.  That being said, he is a reasonable man to talk to and he is an interesting person.  The issue is that he damages the balance sheet of every European country if he insists on the write-down of debt on a nominal basis.  On the other hand, if he negotiates an extension on maturities and a lowering of interest rates, even though Greek interest rates are already very low on official debt, there is scope there.  There is also scope on the primary surplus, which has already been conceded by the institutions.  In these negotiations, to get something one has to give something.  That is the way we approached it. </p></speech>

We are not getting the details of the gap.  We are not supposed to be talking about conflicting sides.  In a negotiation between a nightwatchman and an employer, arguably they are conflicting sides.  We are talking about people who are supposed to be partners.  Greece is supposed to be a partner in the European Union.  All sides are supposed to be working towards a resolution that is in the best interests of all, yet it is being framed, as the Minister has just framed it, as some sort of hostile negotiation that we cannot get the details of.  I find that suspicious, to put it mildly.  I believe the reason we cannot get details of the gap from the Minister or the Commissioner is that if we did get them we would discover the EU is being vindictive, that this is a question of trying to politically discipline the Greek Government and send a signal that we are not going to appear to give any ground to a government which has demanded an end to austerity.</p><p>Is that not the reason?

I am not in favour of austerity.  I finished austerity in Ireland in the last budget.  We increased no taxes and imposed no further expenditure cuts.  There is no austerity regime in this country.  Austerity was a means to an end and we are all glad it is over.  It is the same in every European country, whether in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Italy or Greece.  There are governments of various shapes, sizes and colours all over Europe and many of them would not fit into what one particular country would regard as the model government, but we work with everybody, and so do the institutions.  The trouble about Jonathan Hill or me answering the Deputy's question is, first, that I am not party to the details of the negotiations, because they are not being carried out at a political level.</p></speech>

The bigger problem is that while I can access the position of the institutions and can get reasonable information, I do not know what the Greek position is, because many of the Greek statistics are fictional.  That makes it very difficult, if one does not know the position of the interlocutors.  There are always two sides when creditors are negotiating with debtors.  That does not mean there is no goodwill and that the interests of Greece as a whole are not being taken into account by the institutions, but both sides have to give.</p></speech>

Greece has a primary surplus.  It is not spending more than it is taking in.</p></speech>

The only issue at stake is the payment of the debt.  Yet the one thing Europe is saying, even though Greece is more or less in balance and may still have a slight surplus, is that it must pay the debt, whatever it takes and no matter how much suffering it may inflict, and that Europe is willing to allow the possibility of a Greek exit from the eurozone over that.  The Minister is telling me he does not even know the details.</p></speech>

European countries that contributed to Greece's two programmes went to their parliaments and then the parliamentarians went to their people and told them that they were giving loans to Greece which would be paid back.  That is what they told their taxpayers and they are accountable to their taxpayers.  We are not in for a lot of money, so it is not as big a political issue here, but the taxpayers and the parliaments of the European creditor countries were given a commitment that what was involved was a repayable loan.</p> <p>  To give another flavour of what is going on, I have heard the finance Ministers of at least five smaller countries asking how they can get more money for Greece when the Greek minimum wage is higher than that in their own country and when the pension proposed for Greece is significantly higher and the age at which it kicks in lower than what we can achieve in our own country.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is a politician.  How does one tell the finance Ministers of small northern European states to go to their parliaments and their taxpayers looking for more money for countries that, on the face of it, have better policy positions than they have at home?</p></speech>

I take the Minister's point, but I disagree with it and it is very revealing.  What the Minister is saying now, and he is giving us a little more information, is that there actually is a vindictive agenda.  As if Greece has not taken enough punishment, when one looks at the humanitarian indexes of that country, we are not going to allow a situation where they have anything resembling a half-decent minimum wage or pensions that might be a little bit better, supposedly, than those elsewhere.  We are going to hammer them down.  There is no solidarity there.  The attitude is that we are going to hammer them down because we consider them to have too much.  How anybody could think that anybody in Greece, other than the very rich, has too much is beyond me.  I have a final question-----</p></speech>

There is great solidarity between the member states of Europe, all 27 of them, and the Greek Government and the Greek people.  That solidarity has been proven in two separate programmes where European taxpayers contributed &euro;350 million to Greece, which would have gone down long ago if it had not been for the solidarity shown by European taxpayers.  The goodwill is there and it has been proved.  They are involved in real negotiations again because everyone knows the Greek situation has to be alleviated and they are prepared to do a deal on that.  However, I cannot envisage a world where, if one pays money, one does not pay it back and still gets more money.  Even if the present Greek situation were resolved, they need a contract or a third programme, and who is going to give it to them if they refuse point blank to make any effort to repay the &euro;350 million they already owe?</p></speech>

They talk about external threats and then they talk about the disastrous rise in rents, property prices, and so on, and the threat it represents.  The way to address that is through major capital investment in housing in order to provide a supply and bring down the costs, to make it affordable and to deal with what is now a major macro-economic threat, never mind a humanitarian crisis, in this country.  Is it not the case that we cannot do that because next year we are paying &euro;8 billion in debt interest?</p></speech>

They are priorities of the Government, as I described earlier.  I hope to have debt under 100% of GDP by the end of 2016.  It is not the fact that we have to repay a great deal of interest each year that prevents us from putting extra money into capital investment, it is the tightness of the fiscal rules.  It is the tightness of the fiscal rules that enables us to reduce the debt, but if we spend the money, it will not reduce the debt.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Noel Harrington, Se&aacute;n Kenny and Michael Fitzmaurice and Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  This meeting is being carried live on UPC channel 207, eVision channel 504 and Sky channel 574.  The item for discussion is the single electricity market, SEM, committee regarding the North-South interconnector and the purpose of the meeting is to engage with the committee, the decision-making body which governs the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, in respect of the North-South interconnector.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Jenny Pyper, chair of SEM and chief executive officer of the utility regulator; Mr. Garrett Blaney, member of SEM and chairman of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER; and Mr. Robert O'Rourke, CER.  Initially, we requested the presence of Mr. Odd H&aring;kon Hoels&aelig;ter but I understand he was not available.  Perhaps Mr. Blaney will clarify that for us.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also remind witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.

It is a great opportunity for us to explain the functioning of the single electricity market and the importance of the North-South interconnector for us.  I will explain our roles and my own role specifically.  I am the chairman of the CER, which is responsible for the regulation of the energy markets in the Republic and which is accountable to the committee under legislation.  Ms Pyper is a guest.  She is the utility regulator chief executive officer and chairman of the SEM committee but she does not have a statutory basis in this State.  We are thankful that she is able to join us and explain some of the SEM functioning and the importance of some of the elements of this discussion for Northern Ireland.</p><p>I will use the slides just to run through the position regarding how the single electricity market functions and to discuss the role of the SEM committee and the importance of the second North-South interconnector in the context of the proper functioning of the market and of minimising costs to consumers in general across the island.</p><p> The single electricity market is quite a unique project at a European level.  The slide on the screen shows a picture of Ireland at night and is designed to try to show the committee how important this project is at European level.  The only other market in Europe that has approached anything like the level of integration we have achieved is the Iberian model involving Spain and Portugal.  Nowhere outside this island has there been the same level of co-operation and co-ordination or has a similar legislative basis been put in place in order to bring two markets together to operate as one.  The single electricity market is unique because it involves two member states - one a part of the United Kingdom and the Republic - and two currencies, namely, sterling in the North and the euro in the South.  The market is based on one common set of rules.  These are not joint rules, rather a single set of rules governs the market right across the island.  There is a single committee - the Single Electricity Market, SEM, committee - which makes decisions on those rules and any changes to them.  The success of the market since it was established in 2007 is measured by the fact that there has been significant investment on the island and significant efficiencies have also been achieved for consumers.  It has, therefore, attracted further investment, secured supplies for consumers and assisted in keeping costs down.</p><p> I will now explain some of the mechanics of the single electricity market.  It is based on legislation that was enacted in 2007.  At that time, the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended so the governing legislation was passed by the D&aacute;il and the Parliament at Westminster.  This is linked to an intergovernmental agreement - a memorandum of understanding, MOU - between both Governments.  That agreement is the firm basis for the operation of the market.  The SEM committee was established under the legislation to which I refer in order to ensure strong regulatory oversight.  Many commentators have referred to the transparency of the market and how useful it has been for the players involved and in terms of ensuring efficiencies that benefit consumers.  We have 3,500 MW of invested plant.  I will refer, in a moment, to the types of plant that have been invested in the market.  To give members a sense of what is involved, typically in the region of &euro;3 billion trades through the market on an annual basis.  This is, therefore, a significant part of the all-island economy.  Electricity provision is not just important for industry, it is also an industry in its own right.  The single electricity market is a cornerstone of the latter.</p><p> I will not discuss the individual plants but the slide on screen shows the amounts invested in each.  A general trend has been investment across the island in new, efficient and low-emissions plant.  Between renewables and gas, we have invested a great deal in efficient plant and we have also managed to close some inefficient plant.  The single electricity market has had a good impact from the point of view of the environment, as well in terms of the economy and security of supply.</p><p> As is always the case, we cannot rest on our laurels in the context of the market.  There has been a significant push at European level to bring together markets across the Union and to encourage further integration of energy markets.  As a result of new EU legislation, we are required to change the current market.  This is an obligation which has been placed upon us but we are keen to try to use it to ensure more efficiencies and lower costs for consumers where possible.  Obviously, we need to reflect Government targets.  Those targets, North and South, are aligned at present at 40%.  However, this is subject to review.  I will discuss that in greater detail in a moment.  We are also keen - as regulators across the island, North and South - to ensure that there is downward pressure regarding the prices charged to consumers.  The latter are currently under ongoing pressure as regard costs and we would like to see what we can do to reduce this.</p><p> The grid roll-out - this brings me to the second North-South interconnector - is critical to the efficient functioning of the market.  There have been significant investment programmes in respect of the grid.</p><p>Perhaps I will go back into the history of the networks' development.  If one goes back in the annals of time, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland had completely separate systems with one limited interconnection, that is, the current North-South interconnector and in planning terms, it always was planned historically as two separate systems.  The importance of the second North-South connection is it will begin to integrate the two network systems and will ensure there is a proper backbone right across the island for the efficient trade of power.  We regulate that as a natural monopoly in both jurisdictions and do what we can to try to ensure these costs to consumers are minimised.  We certainly only allow those costs that are incurred efficiently to flow through to consumers and to end up in consumers' bills.  As members are aware, the current process regarding the second North-South interconnector is a typical example of where planning and land access are becoming major issues in the development of this infrastructure.</p><p> While I will not labour on the subject of key drivers, they obviously are security and quality of supply and renewable development.  However, a key element in this regard is the efficiency of the market.  The North-South interconnector is key to ensuring the cost to consumers' bills is kept down and I will try to explain where that additional cost arises from the North-South interconnector.  As I mentioned, we have quite an aggressive target for renewables by 2020.  The targets North and South are aligned at present but are subject to review in both jurisdictions as we move beyond 2020.  At present, there is a 40% renewables target in electricity across the island and the North-South interconnector is helpful in its delivery, as well as in respect of security of supply and cost provisions for consumers.</p><p> To explain why the North-South interconnector is quite important with regard to the efficient operation of the market, the first point is the market schedules generators in order that the cheapest generators are scheduled to run to meet the demands of customers and through sophisticated software, it automatically ensures the cheapest generators are programmed to run.  The problem, when we have constraints and congestion on the network and, clearly, the North-South link is the major point of congestion on the network, is that more expensive generators must run than otherwise would run.  This adds an additional cost to consumers across the island.  On a conservative basis, we think this cost is at least &euro;10 million per annum at present and believe it will rise to approximately &euro;20 million.  A number of figures are available in this regard and the ESRI has carried out an independent study in which it suggests the figure could be as much as &euro;30 million per annum.  However, we have done this on a conservative basis and are comfortable that the cost it imposes on consumers is at least &euro;10 million.  Moreover, this is a current cost that is rising and once we go beyond 2020 to 2030, this cost could rise to as much as &euro;40 million to &euro;60 million, again depending on market conditions at the time.  However, this cost is set to rise significantly and as regulators, we obviously are concerned that this second North-South interconnector should be developed as early as possible to minimise the cost from a consumer review.  I will now hand over to Ms Jenny Pyper, who will go through the rest of the presentation.</p></speech>

I wish to reinforce Mr. Blaney's comments about the unique nature of the single electricity market and the close co-operation between his team in the Commission for Energy Regulation and mine in the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator.  Clearly, the North-South interconnector is a crucial item of infrastructure for both jurisdictions and therefore is a crucial issue for both regulatory authorities.  Mr. Blaney has touched on the benefits from an all-island perspective and a key issue obviously concerns improving security of supply.  This is a particular issue for Northern Ireland and I will say a little more about that, if I may, when dealing with a subsequent slide.  Security of supply is one thing that everyone takes for granted but keeping the lights on and electricity flowing has been cited by the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Institute of Directors as the number one issue for businesses and economic development both North and South.  Consequently, while it is crucial for the entire island, there is an essential nature to it regarding Northern Ireland, to which I will come on.  As for the second key issue regarding renewable power generation, we have seen considerable growth in renewables.</p><p>This has been facilitated by the single electricity market.  However, the second North-South interconnector is crucial for future development and growth in renewables and the contribution they can make as an efficient generation source.</p><p> Mr. Blaney spoke about the efficiency of the market and noted that the costs in terms of constraints were currently of the order of &euro;10 million.  To put this in a slightly different context, the overall economic benefits that could flow from a second North-South interconnector could be of the order of &euro;40 million by 2030 or thereabouts.  There is a particular locational benefit in Ireland in terms of network reinforcement in the north east. </p><p> I do not know whether members can see the slide but it should be clearer in document provided in the packs.  I will take a moment to quickly explain what it shows.  To put it in the simplest way possible, when the red line extending across the graph is crossed, it means essentially that the lights will go out in Northern Ireland.  This applies to all points below the red line, whereas all points above the red line indicate we have ample generation to meet our needs.  The purple line represents excess generation in the Republic of Ireland.  The blue line, which is much closer to the critical red line, represents the position in Northern Ireland.  The green-yellow line at the top of the graph represents the overall position on the island.  As members will note, this line shows that as we move into the 2020s, there is plenty of generation on the island as a whole.  I ask them to focus on the blue line showing the position in Northern Ireland.  It indicates that the position is set to become critical in 2021 when a number of generating units are required to close to meet European emission requirements.  The graph shows generation in Northern Ireland dipping below the red line in 2021, indicating that security of supply will become critical from that point onwards, despite the fact that we will have plenty of generation on the island in 2021.</p><p> A particular problem also arises in the short term for Northern Ireland.  As members will note, the blue line dips close to the "lights out" red line from 2016 onwards.  At that point, Northern Ireland only has a surplus of approximately 200 MW.  If only one of the three large generating units in Northern Ireland experiences a problem which knocks out approximately 50% of its output, generation in Northern Ireland will dip below the red line.  The arrow extending from 2016 to 2018 represents additional capacity that Northern Ireland has procured already to ensure we keep the lights on.  Consumers in Northern Ireland are, therefore, already committed to paying approximately &euro;10 million per annum from 2016 to 2018, inclusive, to keep the lights on and ensure we have sufficient security of supply during the period when the Moyle interconnector is being repaired.  The position moving forward to 2021 becomes much more critical.  If the second North-South interconnector is not in place at that point, we will have a very significant problem in the North.</p><p> In speaking about this slide, I should apologise for the absence of a crucial bullet point which provides the total project cost of the North-South interconnector, including overhead line, land acquisition, substation and other costs.  The total project cost is &euro;286 million, an important number and the one on which we would like members to focus.  This figure is subject to regulatory review.  Mr. Blaney's office and my office will separately review the Capex expenditure of both EirGrid and the system operator in Northern Ireland to ensure only efficiently incurred expenditure will be allowed.</p><p> As we move forward into the new market, there is an assumption that the second North-South interconnector will be in place and its costs will be recovered from consumers.</p><p>The final PowerPoint slide represents what is traditionally called the regulators&rsquo; trilemma, namely, the three significant issues they always have to balance.  These comprise the cost benefits of ensuring security of supply, keeping downward pressure on prices and ensuring long-term sustainability.  From a regulatory perspective, the arguments in favour of the North-South interconnector address all three areas.  It contributes significantly to improving security of supply, particularly in Northern Ireland, as well as in the long term for the island as a whole.  It provides the opportunity to maximise sustainability and renewables on an all-island basis.  The second North-South interconnector is also crucial for the market in terms of creating the best possible conditions to drive down prices.</p><p> From the perspective of the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation and the all-island single electricity market committee, providing the North-South interconnector at the lowest possible cost to consumers is absolutely essential.</p></speech>

I note from the PowerPoint slide on security of supply that it points out how close we will be to the lights staying on or going off if the second interconnector does not go ahead.  The interconnector will not be up and running by 2016.  What is the plan to keep security of supply in 2016?</p> <p>  We have discussed the issues around the interconnector and the areas in which the pylons will go through.  If it does not go ahead, is there a plan B in which extra generation could be built in the Northern Ireland or through connections with other countries?</p></speech>

That represents the period where we have procured additional capacity of 250 MW from one of our generators, AES, just to make sure we do not risk the lights going out.  One can see from the graph that in 2016 the blue line dips down to 200 MW.  Northern Ireland is dependent on three large thermal units.  If a problem arises with one of those that could knock out a significant proportion of its generational capability, then we are in difficulty.  As a security of supply measure, working with the system operators and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, we have procured additional capacity to see us through that period while the Moyle interconnector is being repaired.  That is being paid for by Northern Ireland consumers separately.  It has no implications for Irish consumers and is adding &euro;5 or &euro;6 to every Northern Ireland domestic bill.  That is to keep it in a healthy position for the short term.</p> <p>  Regarding a plan B, regulators are always looking for the most efficient and least cost way of ensuring they get that trilemma balance right.  Even if we were to build additional generating capacity in Northern Ireland, it would still have an impact on the all-island market.  Those constraints on electricity flowing, being traded and providing security of supply, as well as efficiency benefits to the all-island market, would still be there because there is limited ability for the power to flow between North and South.  Both Northern Ireland and Irish consumers would pay by not having the benefits of those constraints being released.</p> <p>  It will be an option for Northern Ireland politicians to consider whether to pay for additional generating capacity in Northern Ireland after 2020, if the second North-South interconnector is not in place.</p><p>As this is an all-island issue, there is a direct impact for consumers in the Republic.  It is important to understand that, while the security of supply concerns do not directly apply to us - we probably have more comfort in the Republic in terms of the capacity available for generation - there is an argument that we have an excess that cannot flow to Northern Ireland because the second interconnector is not available at the moment, which is imposing costs on consumers.  This extra cost, which we think at minimum is about &euro;10 million per annum, is the primary concern from the Republic's point of view.</p></speech>

Essentially, AES has agreed to refurbish a number of old units and bring them back into service as a temporary measure, but it is an expensive way of ensuring security of supply.</p> <p>  From the all-island perspective, it is not just the security of supply issues that are of concern post-2020 or 2021.  As Mr. Blaney has said, we are working to create a new integrated single electricity market to meet European requirements.  The North-South interconnector is an essential element in allowing the efficiencies of an integrated market to flow.  In respect of a plan B, if we do not have the second North-South interconnector in place, it will have implications in terms of the design of the integrated single electricity market and could risk introducing further inefficiencies into the market design, which would add to costs for consumers North and South.</p></speech>

There is a European process identifying key areas of infrastructure that need to be built, known as "projects of common interest", and this project is one of a small number across Europe that have been identified as such.  These projects are regarded as key to making sure that markets operate efficiently.</p></speech>

A total cost of &euro;286 million was mentioned.  The message the witnesses are sending is that it is a key project, which has been mentioned at the highest level in European and is seen as a massive piece of infrastructure for the integration of markets.  The biggest issue with this project is how it is being constructed.  EirGrid appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago and said it was technically possible to underground it.  From what the witnesses have said, this is a vital piece of infrastructure for the whole of the island, which we must welcome because for a long time, we have been looking for a whole-of-Ireland approach to many issues.</p> <p>  This is a major piece of infrastructure but the biggest issue in this State, in particular for the people of Counties Monaghan and Meath, is the way in which it is being constructed.  Surely, if it is of such vital importance for the island of Ireland and at a European level, it is high time EirGrid accepted the evidence it gave this committee a few weeks ago, namely, that it is technically possible to underground it.  Given its importance, it should be build in the best possible way to ensure minimal objections.</p> <p>  In respect of the amount of energy that is in the system at the moment, both witnesses are saying the Republic of Ireland has excess supply.</p><p>Will wind energy, which is being developed right across the country, add further to the over-supply?  I come from a farming background and in any sector of farming which is over-supplied, the first thing that happens is there is a massive reduction in the price to the consumer or the price given to the primary producer.  If there is an over-supply in this regard, why do not we not see a direct reduction in prices to consumers, be they businesses or households, within the Irish State?  If the witnesses would deal with those points, we can take it from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garrett Blaney" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061600002#J00200"><p>I will try to answer both questions.  On the question of whether it should be built underground or overhead, this has been looked at on a number of occasions by a number of different bodies.  The first report was done in 2008 by Ecofys, having been commissioned by the Government.  EirGrid had its own analysis done by PB Power and this was published in 2009.  An expert independent commission was set up by the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and it published a report in 2012.</p> <p>  To clarify, the independent expert commission's view was that it was not technically possible to build this as an AC line and that it would have to be built as a DC line.  To explain this difference between AC and DC, AC would work in anyone's house whereas DC is the voltage used in a phone or a standard device and is at much higher levels.  Therefore, AC needs to be converted to DC in a very large conversion station, such as we already have for the east-west interconnector, which committee members can visit if they want to see what one looks like.  There is a special cable for DC which is made in only a small number of factories in the world.  This underground DC cable power is then transported to another convertor, which has to reconvert from DC back to AC in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  There are physical characteristics that sort of sterilise the corridor between these two convertor stations.  It does not allow any connections at that point, so it would sterilise that area for new investment.  We are seeing - this will flow into the demand question - a lot of new data centres and very interesting new loads coming into the Irish system that are helping increase demand at the moment and that are also good for the economy in general, although our interest is primarily the impact on consumers.  The HVDC solution is more expensive, and it was the view of the independent commission that it is typically three times the cost.  Its view and international precedents show it will give less function than an AC cable, so one would pay more but get less.</p> <p>  Our concern is from a cost point of view, and this is obviously a significant increase in cost.  We were in front of this committee previously on this issue and we have written to the committee setting out our view on the differences in cost between overhead and underground.  If the three projects in Ireland were converted from overhead to underground, it could add something like 3% to the consumer's bill over the next 50 years.  These are significant extra costs from a consumer point of view.</p> <p>  We also need to look at our statutory function.  We are looking at this purely in terms of what we are set up to look at under statute, which is the cost to the consumer and the impact on security of supply.  Obviously, land use, visual amenity and all of those planning issues are a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la; my understanding is that it was submitted on 9 June and a consultation is starting today, run by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is helpful this committee is raising the profile and allowing all the affected parties to engage in the planning.  However, we are limited very much to our statutory function and we obviously do not want to take a view on planning functions, given there is another statutory State agency there to deal with the planning function.  We need to let it get on and do its job.</p></speech>

When EirGrid was with us, we talked about the feasibility of construction from a technical point of view.</p><p>Certainly, what I got from that meeting was that it was technically possible to put the North-South interconnector underground.  The point I am making is that I think people accept the need for the North-South interconnector.  The biggest issue they have with it relates to how it is going to be constructed within the environment - the hills and valleys - that will be affected.  If it is of such importance, maybe it is time we looked realistically at putting it underground.</p></speech>

The issue raised by the expert commission related to distance.  It is possible to put short stretches of AC underground.  There are numerous examples of that in the electricity system.  The problem arises when undergrounding is done over a long distance.  Technical problems arise with the cable and it is not possible to operate it.  All I am doing is sharing with the Deputy the view of the expert commission as published in its report.  The view of the commission was that it would be three times the cost.  PB Power had a higher figure than that.  I suppose we are limited in our technical expertise.  I am relaying figures that are out there in the public domain from technical experts.  Clearly, it is possible to put short elements of cable underground.  The cost of that is much less than the cost of the HVDC solution.  It is a matter for the planning authorities.  It is under planning at the moment.  I would really relay it to that.</p> <p>  I wish to come back to the Deputy's important question about the excess capacity in the system at present.  The various investments that have been made are set out in the table.  The market has been good for investment.  The unprecedented downturn in the economy here in the Republic had a direct impact on demand.  There is a close correlation between the level of economic activity in a country and the level of demand for electricity.  We had seen a reduction of approximately 10% since the peak in 2007 or 2008, but we are now seeing a turnaround.  The increase in economic activity is having a positive impact on future demand growth.  As I mentioned earlier, some large new demand sources, such as data centres, are coming in.  Obviously, we want to make sure the country is ready to bring in new foreign direct investment and we have the infrastructure to underpin that.</p> <p>  An interesting debate about decarbonisation is taking place internationally.  The extent to which we should move away from fossil fuels and move towards the use of electricity for electric vehicles and heating in the home, etc., is difficult to assess.  There is more uncertainty about future demand today than there was historically.  We need to make sure we do not find ourselves back in the difficult situation we were in ten years ago, when we were fighting year-on-year to make sure we had enough capacity to keep the lights on here in the Republic.  I think we should have some comfort that there is extra capacity there.  We will constantly be looking for opportunities to see how that extra capacity can result in lower costs to consumers.  Today, a lower cost is associated with having that extra capacity than with not having it.  This was part of the design criteria for the integrated single electricity market.  In that context, we will look to see whether we can seek further efficiencies in the market.  As the Deputy has rightly said, many consumers are still facing very difficult times as they try to pay their bills.  As regulators, we are conscious that we need to ensure the costs that are imposed on every electricity consumer in the country are kept as low as possible.</p></speech>

Is it fact or fiction that the more renewables such as wind come on the system, the more the system has to be upgraded to take it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garrett Blaney" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061600002#K00400"><p>I sit on the board of regulators across Europe.  One of the questions we have asked as regulators at European level relates to the cost of renewable delivery across Europe.  Ireland has had a fairly good track record to date.  We have ended up with a lower cost because onshore wind in Ireland to date has had a much lower cost than many of the other technologies that have been applied across Europe.  We have ended up paying less in percentage terms for our renewables than most places.  I think Norway and Finland are better than us, but virtually every other country in Europe is paying more for its renewables.  We need to be careful not to presume that more and more wind on the system is the way to go forward.</p><p>We have a role in terms of advising the Minister and have advised him to consider a least-cost approach to renewable development.  That means looking at all of the possible renewable technologies and going for those that are cheapest.  It may or may not result in more wind in the system.  </p><p> Other technologies, such as solar power, are becoming a lot cheaper and more competitive, based on equipment prices.  Our view is that we should try to do whatever entails the least cost, including the network costs.  There are extra elements in the network that had to be strengthened as a result of wind in the system, notwithstanding that the support for wind in Ireland has been a lot cheaper than support for renewables elsewhere.  The Deputy is correct that we have to ensure we are constantly vigilant and do not lose sight of the cost element of renewables and the infrastructure to support them, something of which we are very mindful.  Obviously, renewables are a matter for the Minister and the respective Departments in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  All we can do is advise Ministers of the policy.  Our current advise is to try to minimise cost from a renewables point of view.  </p></speech>

Having listened to the presentation and following on from Deputy Moynihan's questions, I cannot help but draw the conclusion that what is essentially being proposed to be constructed on a North-South basis is an energy one-way street that will predominantly benefit the economy of Northern Ireland in the short to medium term.  This one-way energy street is being developed, as Deputy Moynihan said, with much pain south of the Border, with cables starting somewhere in County Meath and lattice structures going across the landscape into drumlin country in County Monaghan and across the Border into County Tyrone to a receiving station which, presumably, will then go underground.  </p> <p>  The bulk of the lattices, structures and infrastructure will be in place south of the Border.  The bulk of the undergrounding and benefit will be North of the Border.  I do not want to be partitionist in any sense because this issue is probably being discussed in the Northern Ireland Assembly and I am sure the anti-partitionist party there is fully supportive of the interconnector due to the benefits it will bring to the economy of Northern Ireland.  What benefits will it bring to the people of Counties Meath and Monaghan who will have to look at these things?</p> <p>  I come from a part of the country, the mid-west, which already has such things.  It is festooned with lattice structures, which will not be taken down.  Somebody raised a very legitimate point with me recently.  If all of the interconnectors will be underground in the north, south, east, west or wherever, what about those already in existence from Loop Head in County Clare, into Tipperary, across Limerick, Laois and Offaly and into Dublin?  From my point of view, the real risk area from an energy security point of view is Northern Ireland.  I accept the fact that we are now consuming less than 20% of what we did at the height of the boom in the South.  However, in the interim we have also developed a number of power stations, most recently Great Island in Wexford.  One in Mayo has also come on stream.  In my county, Limerick, wind farms have been constructed.</p> <p>  We south of the Border are getting our act together.  What are those North of the Border doing, apart from asking the people in Counties Meath and Monaghan to put up with lattice structures?  I know we are all part of the European Single Market and are supposed to be on board the European train, with which I have no difficulty.  However, I am not happy with the concept of an energy one-way street being constructed.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that Northern Ireland is dependent on three thermal energy producing facilities and if one of them goes, it is at risk.  If one had gone at any stage in the recent past it would have been at major risk.  What has Northern Ireland been doing up to now, within the United Kingdom, for example, to meet its energy needs?  Why is EirGrid ploughing ahead in some of the most picturesque and historic landscapes in the county?  It stated it was not concerned about the facility in the west, which might go underground, as might that in the south.</p><p>Let us call a spade a spade - they will not benefit from it.  It is the people and the economy of the Six Counties which will benefit.  What is in it for the consumers of Meath and Monaghan?</p></speech>

It is clear from the Deputy's questions that I have not got the right message across.  It is not solely a benefit to Northern Ireland - the benefit is all-island.  The benefit to the consumer in the Republic of Ireland is significant and will grow over time.  I was at the launch last week of the investment in Great Island and this and other investments would not have happened if we had had a smaller, more constrained market only in the Republic of Ireland.  From an investment and efficiency point of view it is essential to have a bigger market in which to invest.  The cost benefits, amounting to reductions of &euro;10 million, are equally shared across the island and the cost of the interconnector is shared 50-50.</p> <p>  The benefits are significant for the Republic and are growing with the potential for new investment to come once the infrastructure is in place, even in the Meath and Monaghan areas when the new lines come in.  There have been power plants looking at those locations but in the past there were infrastructural constraints.  </p></speech>

It is clear from Mr. Blaney's answer to Deputy Moynihan's question that, as sure as there is a sun in the sky, consumers will not benefit from all this additional capacity in Ireland.  Even with the lower cost of coal and oil, consumers have not benefited because electricity producers say they buy 18 months in advance of a kettle in Limerick or elsewhere being plugged in.  They say they bought oil at a peak 18 months ago and that consumers will have to wait 18 months to get a reduction in their electricity prices.  Mr. Blaney's office should press them on this but pigs will fly before it happens.</p> <p>  Ireland could produce enough electricity for the entire European Union but the bill coming in the door will never go down and that is what the consumer is interested in.  Let us be realistic.  It will not go down because there will be some excuse about buying coal in an expensive commodities market, shipping costs going up or a new health and safety measure.  The only thing I am interested in is how much the electricity bill for consumers will be, whether it comes from the ESB, Airtricity or anybody else.  We are exporting electricity to the United Kingdom and we may well export it to France when it builds a cable under St. George's Channel.  We can put a cable between France and Wexford but cannot put one between Meath and Tyrone.  </p> <p>  I know the difference between AC and DC but most householders do not give a hoot about them - they think they refer to a band from the 1980s.  They are also interested in whether they will have to look upon structures that are a blight on the landscape, whether it will benefit the local economy and whether the bill coming in the door will be any less.  Mr. Blaney knows as well as I do that that is not going to happen.  No matter how much extra capacity is produced and exported to the United Kingdom, ultimately the consumer in Ireland will not be better off in any way.  The only thing they will have is a monstrosity crossing 50 or 60 miles from Meath to the Border where it will go underground.  It is absolutely bizarre that the benefit will be felt where the cable goes underground. </p></speech>

The metric for us to follow is the one which measures improvements in our competitiveness as an economy.  Costs are increasing in numerous different areas right across the European Union and we want to ensure Ireland is low cost, relative to our peers, by keeping our costs as low as we can and the core reason for building the North-South interconnector at the lowest cost is to minimise the extra pressure on the bills to the consumer.  It is clear that undergrounding adds a significant, measurable increase to the consumer's bill.</p><p>The Deputy is right that consumers are struggling already trying to pay their bills.

It takes the cheapest generators in Northern Ireland and the Republic and they are scheduled to run in the market.  On top of that, there is a constraint in the grid, particularly the North-South constraint.  Those cheapest generators cannot run because they cannot physically get the power from the generation directly to the consumer, because the network will not allow it, so other, more expensive plant must be run.  Regardless of the level of surplus, that must still be done.  More expensive plant, which burn more oil or coal, or whatever fuel they use, add extra cost, which goes directly to the consumer's bill.  All those costs are delivered directly to the consumer.  It is not something the consumer absorbs, it hits their bill directly.</p></speech>

I imagine it should be imposed on the suppliers of electricity if this infrastructure is being provided on an all-island basis.  The producers and the providers are the main beneficiaries because they will ultimately sell it to their consumers.  These are the people who are lobbying intensively for this.  They want it because they want to export electricity and are putting huge pressure on EirGrid and everybody else to get this built.  I think there is a need for reverse pressure.  If this infrastructure is built, what is in it for the State and the Irish consumer?  To be honest, I am woolly about what is in it.  There may be a benefit but all things being equal, there may not.  If the  price of Polish coal increases and Moneypoint has to increase its tariff, the response will be "sorry, lads, we could not do anything for you".  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

We will ensure that the benefits arising from the North-South interconnector being built flow through to the consumers.  Regardless of what happens on gas or coal prices, or whatever else, the price may go up or down depending on the world prices of those commodities, there will still be a benefit from the North-South interconnector.  We will ensure that consumers in the North and in the South will see that benefit.</p></speech>

The presentation was not what one would have assumed.  The topic for discussion was the basis for putting the North-South interconnector underground but that was not the presentation which was a restatement of the need for a single energy market on the island.  There are very few people who do not understand the need for a single energy market on the island; I certainly do.  We would be damn poor neighbours if we did not.  If there are energy problems in any part of the island and there is capacity in another part to help address that issue, we should help, provided we are not being disadvantaged in so doing.  I see the sense behind the proposal.  I would go so far as to say that if we have additional capacity and there is an EU market, we should be looking at that, again provided the consumer in Ireland is not being screwed in that regard.</p> <p>  Perhaps the representatives are not the people who should be answering the following question.  If the technical advice is that two converter stations are needed and the representatives say the space between those two converters must be a sterile area and if a major data centre was coming on stream that it would not be possible to have a connection to it, why can the two converter stations not be located in the same place on the Border so that there is no sterile area?  Would that not permit undergrounding in both jurisdictions and minimise the sterile area?  Perhaps the representatives are not the people to whom I should address this question but I think it is a question that needs to be asked.  The representatives also say that the overall cost of the interconnector is &euro;286 million.  Is that in sterling or euro?</p></speech>

Of what is the balance made up?</p> <p>  The witnesses' estimate was that there would be a 5% additional cost to consumers if the interconnector were undergrounded, and that there are technical limitations.  Could those technical limitations and additional cost factors be addressed by a one-site two-converter station based some place on the Border?  Is that technically possible, or are they the right people to answer those questions?</p> <p>  Chairman, if the meeting is not over by 1.45 p.m., I will have to go, because I have questions with the Minister at 2 p.m.</p></speech>

We gave the background in the presentation so that the committee could understand the context of the need for the second interconnector.  In terms of the technical issue, I will attempt a layman's description of it, but Deputy Colreavy would probably need to go back to EirGrid if he wants to get a detailed technical analysis of his proposal.  My understanding is that the problem is length.  With AC, one can only do a certain length underground before one hits technical problems, and at lengths beyond that one must use DC.  Clearly, if one were to put the two converter stations beside each other at the Border, one would still have long lines underground and the same technical problems.  I would refer the Deputy to EirGrid if he wants to get into more of the technical detail, but it is not possible or practical to have the two converter stations beside each other.  It would preclude the need for them in the first place.  One would end up with everything underground, and it would not work.</p> <p>  With regard to the sterile area, this is because one cannot connect DC lines to the electricity system; only AC lines can be connected.  If standard pylons go through an area, it is relatively easy to take the cables from the pylon down into a substation and back up onto the pylons.  When the connector is underground as a DC cable, a converter station is needed, and once we go beyond a converter station at each end, the complexity becomes much more significant.  DC systems are much more difficult to run and there are some fundamentals, such as whether one can switch the current on and off, that one can do easily with AC but that become a major problem with DC.  I apologise, as I am not the technical expert here.  I am trying to give a layman's view of the process.  If Deputy Colreavy has any further questions, I suggest that EirGrid would be able to explain it more efficiently for him.</p></speech>

It is not something that we encourage financially.  However, we should be doing so, particularly in terms of renewable energy.  Does this conversation have an impact on those of us who would like to see more emphasis on microgeneration?</p></speech>

We are interested in cost, which is a big issue for us in everything, including the sort of renewable technologies that are being used.  What is interesting about microgeneration is that cost differences have significantly decreased and microgeneration is probably a lot cheaper today than it was even five or ten years ago.  It may be that its time is coming.  Maybe microgeneration is the new lowest-cost renewable technology for the future.  That is very much a question for the Minister and for renewable policy.  The North-South interconnector is neutral on it.  It allows for better flows of electricity across the island.  I cannot see how it would have any adverse effect on microgeneration.  I am not sure that it has any particular positive benefits, other than allowing it to be a little more efficient if there is a surplus of microgeneration.  The difference, one way or another, for microgeneration is not particularly measurable.</p></speech>

Previous speakers asked what are the benefits to southern Ireland if we have, as they state, energy that is surplus to requirements.</p><p>We have an interconnector, which I know, because I live close to the Border, was out of commission for quite some time.  What alternative supply did Northern Ireland have?  I am sure Northern Ireland benefited at peak times from the interconnector with Scotland or Great Britain.  What is the total megawatt demand in Northern Ireland?</p><p> I can envisage what will happen in years to come is that we will be part of the European grid.  I know the benefits of helping one another at times of peak demand.  I did not realise we have a surplus but can also access supplies from elsewhere.</p><p> We have interviewed representatives from EirGrid as well as those who have objected to its proposals.  Without a shadow of doubt, the people of counties Monaghan, Kildare and Meath want the cables to be put underground rather than having an overhead supply going through some of their picturesque townlands.</p><p> There is an interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland and between Dublin and north Wales.  Is there a DC, direct current, cable connection between both countries, because obviously there are convertor requirement stations in both Dublin and Holyhead and between Dublin and Scotland?</p><p> I can confirm what Deputy Moynihan said.  I am not saying that we were assured but we were led to believe that it was physically possible to ensure that the North-South interconnector would be located underground.  The cost comes in at &euro;1.7 billion, but we got different estimates of what it would cost to put it underground.  At one stage it was suggested that it would be ten or eleven times more expensive to construct an underground facility.  It should go underground to satisfy the people of counties Kildare, Meath and Monaghan, whether that is up along one side of the M1 to Dundalk and then over into County Tyrone.  That is the only proposal that people will accept.  </p><p> There is a question of sustainability and the importance of being able to access additional supply at peak periods, but the people of counties Kildare, Meath and Monaghan must be listened to, irrespective of the costs which should be spread out over 20 to 30 years.  That is not a big ask.  I worked with the ESB and I never recall the cost of electricity coming down in spite of fluctuations in the price of gas and oil.    </p><p> I am not aware of the figure for peak demand in Northern Ireland and how that figure compares with the figures for the South.  Why is the second interconnector between the two countries much larger than the interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland; between Dublin and Wales and many other interconnectors on the European grid?</p></speech>

As he will know, the existing North-South interconnector has had a slightly chequered history.  The predominant direction of flow of the existing North-South interconnector is North to South.  In the past when there have been shortages of capacity, particularly in Dublin, the flow from North to South has helped to keep the lights on in Ireland.</p></speech>

As new plant has come on and, as Mr. Blaney mentioned, new investment has come through, the situation has changed in terms of the supply.  Partly that is due to the fact that we have a single market.  Before 2007 we had two small separate markets, neither of which was particularly efficient.  We now have a single market that maximises opportunities to drive down costs on an all-island basis.  I have not heard any commentators state it would have been better if we had not created the single electricity market.  No matter what a person's political persuasion is, everyone can see the obvious efficiencies and benefits one gets from moving two small inefficient markets to a single, larger and efficient market.  It is the creation of that larger market, from 2007 on, that has sent market signals about where investment is needed.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Donovan asked about what Northern Ireland was doing and why it was not investing separately.  A single market sends signals about the need for investment on the island and the success of that is shown on the graph which illustrates a significant capacity availability on the island.  The difficulty for us is that we cannot share that electricity without a second North-South interconnector.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the Moyle interconnector.  I remember only too well, having worked previously on government policy as a civil servant in Northern Ireland, the Moyle interconnector was built, primarily, to help drive down prices in the very small Northern Ireland market before SEM was created.  At the time the cost of electricity in Northern Ireland was high but the cost of electricity in Scotland was lower.  As a result, the suppliers in Scotland simply priced up in response to what was happening in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the initiative did not drive down prices but it provided an opportunity for security of supply.</p> <p>  What we have done now, in creating this unique market and which Northern Ireland entered into as an equal partner with Ireland, was to create and send signals on having an all-island supply.  The difficulty that has arisen is that the two transmission networks were never planned on an all-island basis.  Northern Ireland had its own small transmission network and Ireland had its transmission network.  The single electricity market now gives us an opportunity to plan and look at investment on an all-island basis and achieve efficiencies.  Those efficiencies are the numbers that Mr. Blaney talked about.  The inefficiencies, or the constraint costs, that we are bearing at the moment are of the order of about &euro;10 million - that is a conservative estimate - rising to &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million over the next 20 years.  Customers could get those savings but we are not getting them.  We assumed that we would get some of them in SEM because we assumed that the second North-South interconnector would be built sooner.  The opportunity still exists to access those costs.  The challenge going forward is to see how we can get those costs at that same time we make investments in and plans for the new more efficient integrated single electricity market.  </p> <p>  The Senator also asked what is the total demand in Northern Ireland.  It is of the order of about 1,800 MW and the Irish demand is 6,000 MW.</p></speech>

That means there are between 1,500 MW to 1,800 MW in the North and 6,000 MW in the South.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the HVDC interconnectors.  There are two HVDC interconnectors, one is in Scotland and one is in the Republic.  They both have nominally 500 MW capacity.  Obviously, they connect to the market in Great Britain, which is ten times bigger.  It is 60,000 MW or 70,000 MW maximum demand, compared with the much smaller capacity on this island.</p></speech>

Currently, we have 6,000 MW and they have 1,800 MW.  Am I right in saying that the second interconnector will have twice the carrying capacity of the interconnectors between Wales and Scotland?</p></speech>

It may be slightly greater in AC than DC, but it is not that much greater.  A Deputy spoke earlier about one-way flow.  The important point is that this is not a one-way flow.  This is a two-way flow, and the flows work depending on what is most efficient for consumers across the island.  Sometimes it will flow north; sometimes it will flow south.  It depends on the generators that are available, but it is always there to schedule the lowest cost for the consumer.  It is very much a two-way flow, and the two-way flow means that consumers on all parts of the island can benefit from the interconnector.</p> <p>  This has been sized after detailed planning studies.  They have looked at the various flows across the island.  They have done extensive scenarios, and this was the most efficient size identified as part of that planning process.  I am confident that it is not too small or too large but that it is the efficient size that comes out of the standard planning calculation.</p></speech>

Am I right in saying there will be no pylons required for this second interconnector in Northern Ireland, or have there been any objections to this in Northern Ireland as we have had down here?</p></speech>

That is not my understanding.  My understanding is that this entire interconnector is overhead on both sides of the Border.

One of the numbers we heard about in earlier hearings on this was that overhead transmission involves losses of between 15% and 20%.  The longer the length of transmission, the greater the loss.  Do we have the figure on that this afternoon?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-16a.518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garrett Blaney" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061600002#S01600"><p>I do not have direct figures for losses.  I refer the Senator to EirGrid as the technical expert on that.  Obviously, from a regulatory point of view we are keen that it does what it can to try to minimise losses.  Losses are a cost to the consumer.  There is always a loss in every transmission cable.  The degree of loss depends on the selection of the transformers and the type of conductor they use, but I refer the Senator to the technical experts in EirGrid if he is looking for an exact figure on losses.</p><p>If the plan before us is that a large amount of electricity is to be generated in the South and transmitted to the North with those losses, that is an important number for our calculations here.  It would be quite sizable and makes the case for the relative attractiveness of undergrounding when one takes into account the social cost members of pylons, which members have spoken about, plus the transmission losses.<br/><br/>The other issue raised is why Northern Ireland has only three stations for 1.8 million people.  If we are not measuring the social cost of transmitting electricity over very long distances - and, in fact, there is a substantial loss of energy when we are doing that - it may be that wind turbines should be placed close to Coolkeeragh or Kilroot or wherever.  It may be that it would be more efficient for coal to go to Derry to generate electricity rather than going to Moneypoint to generate electricity that is then sent by wire to Northern Ireland with losses.  This project is so unpopular in Meath, Monaghan and north County Dublin that it is damaging the image of the energy industry.  As Deputy Patrick O'Donovan said, people do not expect to see any reduction in costs.  If it will cost consumers 3% extra on their bills to do without the pylons while having more electricity generated in Northern Ireland close to where it is consumed, we should look at those options.  It must be the same to bring in the coal, and the wind is the same.  One simply takes into account the full costs of transmission and locates the power stations near the centres of demand.  Given that we have about 40 generating plants for 4.8 million people here, three in Northern Ireland seems very few.  Is that the source of the problem?  We know the South has huge excess generating capacity.  Colm McCarthy described it very well in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>yesterday and he is a former director of the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  Some of that generating capacity should have been built in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

With regard to losses, there is no indication of this from anything we have seen.  The AC line proposed by EirGrid which is the subject of the planning application is a fairly standard one.  It is the same as the AC lines we have across the country.  It is a 400 kV line, similar to the ones running from Moneypoint across to Dublin.  There is no indication that the losses are any different from those we have around the rest of the country.  It is fairly clear from what we have seen that if we moved to an underground DC configuration, losses would be increased.  There would be an increased cost to consumers in losses.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms Pyper with regard to the general discussion on Northern Ireland.  The broad principle of the single electricity market is that generators are free to go wherever they want on the island that is most efficient for them.  If one wants to build a large coal-fired plant and the largest deep-sea port is on the Shannon, one goes to the Shannon.  If Mayo is the best place for wind resources, one goes there.  If one wants to look at solar energy and solar energy is best in the south east, one goes there.  Where generators sit on the system generally is unconstrained.  I will hand over to Ms Pyper to talk about the specifics of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

There are two in the east of the province, where the population demand is, and there is the ESB station at Coolkeeragh in Derry.  Since the single electricity market was put in place, we have seen a trebling of investment in renewables in Northern Ireland.  There are approximately 775 MW of renewable generating power installed, which is bigger than any of those individual power stations.  As such, wind contributes approximately 20% of Northern Ireland's capacity, which is not insignificant.  It is playing an increasing role, not only in terms of meeting Northern Ireland's needs but also in terms of contributing to the single electricity market.  If we had not entered into the single electricity market in 2007 and if Northern Ireland had remained a separate small market, we would undoubtedly have seen different patterns of investment for Northern Ireland simply to meet its needs on its own.</p><p>The simple act of committing to and entering into the single market on the island has sent a strong signal to investors, namely, here is a single market system in which they can make investments.  The signal is not that specific investment is needed in Northern Ireland.  If we do not have a second North-South interconnector and the Northern Irish Government must call for investment in generation solely in Northern Ireland, we risk decoupling all of the benefits of the single market.  That is where a regulator should be, with the market sending signals about where investment is needed.  The market has sent the signal that the island as a whole needs investment.  That investment has been made and there is capacity.  It is just not able to go to where it is required.  This is the underlying economic premise for the North-South interconnector.</p></speech>

As an addendum, the Erne was a joint project from before many of the people in the room were born.  Does it provide any distribution capacity in the west of the province?  The ESB and the old Northern Ireland Electricity Service, NIES, co-operated on it for many decades.  I imagine that there is a transmission network based in Ballyshannon.</p></speech>

Some distribution cables go across the Border in the west, but they are not sufficient to tie the two systems together.  We cannot rely on them, although they allow for some power flows at a distribution level across the Border, typically in the west.  The Erne is a relatively small project compared with the size of modern generators, for example, the new Great Island plant that opened last week and produces 430 MW.  I cannot remember the exact capacity of the Erne project, but it is relatively small.  The system and the economy have grown.  If we want a modern economy, we must have an infrastructure that supports it.</p></speech>

We will need to revert to our evidence on whether it is 15%, 17% or 20% of electricity that is lost in transmission.  The greater the loss, the longer the transmission line.  How does this compare with the 3% increase in bills that would result if some of the network went underground?  We will do our sums on that the next day.</p></speech>

At the outset, I mentioned Mr. Odd H&aring;kon Hoels&aelig;ter, who I believe is from Norway.</p></speech>

The SEM committee's composition is set up in legislation.  There are three voting members.  The three commissioners of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, of whom I am one, sit on that committee and we have one vote in its decision making.  Ms Pyper, as the CEO of the Utility Regulator, UR, is the chair on a rotating basis.  The committee has other members from the UR, who have the second vote <i>en bloc</i>.<br/><br/>The legislation was insightful.  Notwithstanding the good relationship between the two bodies, it envisaged that disagreement on an issue could arise.  It requires an independent member and a deputy independent member to ensure continuous decision making.  That has been helpful.<br/><br/>The committee has had a number of independent and deputy independent members.  The current independent member is Mr. Odd H&aring;kon Hoels&aelig;ter, who joined us in recent years.  His vast experience from Norway has been helpful in our decision making.  The deputy independent member is Professor David Newbery of Cambridge University.  They help our decision making, but when the joint committee asked us to attend as the SEM committee, we chose to do so as the key entities, namely, the chairs of the UR and CER, so as to provide a proper reflection of the SEM committee.<br/><br/>Mr. Odd H&aring;kon Hoels&aelig;ter had a previous role.  I mentioned the independent commission that was set up by the Government some time back.  He had a role as one of its members.</p><p>In this context, he had a view on the North-South interconnector.  If the committee is minded to seek guidance from this independent commission, I suggest it asks the Minister and Department as it is outside our remit.  Our remit is regulation as set out in statute.</p></speech>

It is important that we highlight these concerns and discuss them as it is our role to do so and we will do it to the best of our ability.</p></speech>
