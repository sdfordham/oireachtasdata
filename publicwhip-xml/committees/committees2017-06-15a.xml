However, when we asked a further question, we found out that some properties had yet to be fully transferred.  For example, the St. Anne's Lenaboy property in the Taylor's Hill district of Galway, with which I am familiar, has not been handed over.  It is mentioned at the bottom of the document.  The last list we received suggested it had been handed over in 2009.  Where we do we go now if we do not keep chasing it?  We are being given pieces of information.</p></speech>

I would like to pick up on Deputy Catherine Connolly's important point about the deterioration of buildings that are lying idle.  A former primary school in Trim, County Meath has been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills, but nothing is happening.  The property is to be used by the education and training board for the Educate Together school in Trim which is operating from a golf club four miles outside the town.  I have raised the issue in the D&aacute;il with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It has now been discovered that the cost of fitting out the school exceeds what it was thought it would be.  The children are staying in the golf club on the Kildalkey Road.  Deputy Catherine Connolly's point is extremely well made.  There is no point in having a scenario in which property deteriorates before it is transferred to the extent that it is worth absolutely nothing to anybody.  The building control unit in the Department that analyses these properties does not provide a proper costing of what is required to make schools habitable for children when they are transferred.  One part of the Department is not speaking to another.</p></speech>

Are there impediments to making the investments needed if there is no clear title?  It is possible that, in the absence of a clear title, a Department will not fund an upgrade that is needed.</p></speech>

This information was requested by the committee on 31 May.  Is this correspondence noted?  I think we dealt with the matter yesterday and will deal with it again next Tuesday.</p> <p>  No. 565B is correspondence, dated 7 June 2017, from Mr. Ed Sibley, director of credit institution supervision in the Central Bank, in response to the committee's request for further information on the bank's review of certain allegations about an Irish credit institution that was referred to in email correspondence on 27 September 2016 and to queries regarding Bank of Ireland collateral arrangements.  The correspondence will be noted and published.</p><p>No. 568B, is correspondence, dated 2 June 2017, from Professor Patrick O'Shea, President of University College Cork, UCC, enclosing trust fund financial statements for 2014 and 2015.  This information about the non-consolidation of trust fund accounts was requested by the committee.  It is noted.</p><p> No. 574B, is correspondence, dated 8 June 2017, from the same Patrick O'Shea, President of UCC, and Catherine Day, chairperson of the UCC governing body, in relation to UCC's acquisition of the Irish Management Institute and the "Morning Ireland" programme on 26 May 2017.  This is noted.   The president will be before the committee on 22 June.</p><p> No. 575B, is correspondence, dated 9 June 2017, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the information requested from the committee at the meeting of 31 May 2017 regarding the interim audit of financial controls at the Garda College, Templemore.  This is noted. </p><p> No. 578B, is correspondence, dated 9 June 2017, from Graham Love, chief executive, Higher Education Authority, HEA, regarding the HEA review of the spin out and sale of FeedHenry and other spin-out companies from the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group.  The terms of reference for the proposed external review are enclosed.  This is noted. </p><p> No. 585B, is correspondence, dated 13 June 2017, from Noel Waters, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, with follow-ups from the meeting of 31 May 2017 with members of management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is noted. </p><p> No. 588B, is correspondence, dated 14 June 2017, from the Health Service Executive, HSE, with clarification points on the Grace case.  This will be covered in the first part of our meeting today.</p><p> Category C is correspondence from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 529C is carried over from the meeting on 1 June 2017, also Nos. 556C, dated 31 May 2017, from Deputy Catherine Murphy and 572C, dated 25 May 2017.</p><p> There is correspondence, dated 11 May 2017, from an individual regarding matters relating to a protected disclosure to the Irish Prison Service.  The individual has indicated he has received an apology from the director general of the Irish Prison Service.  He made a recommendation to the Irish Prison Service to appoint a protected disclosures manager and has asked the committee to support his recommendation, to support persons making protected disclosures, and to summon the director general of the Irish Prison Service to explain why it would appoint a judge to conduct a review and then ignore the judge&rsquo;s findings.  We will probably have to consider this again, but for the time being I propose we request a response from the Irish Prison Service regarding the recommendation to appoint a protected disclosures manager.  I request an update from the Irish Prison Service regarding the implementation of the review mentioned, and we might return to this.  I presume many members of the committee are receiving correspondence from this individual.  I certainly have.  Some of the allegations are very serious.  We will ask for an update on these two matters and will follow up on them later.  It is worthy of our attention. </p><p> No. 549C is correspondence, dated 29 May 2017, from an individual writing on behalf of a children and youth action based group in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city regarding the use of public funds for youth services in the area.  The group wrote to Deputy McDonald in 2015.  This is a policy matter not within the remit of the committee and I propose the correspondence be referred to the relevant sectoral committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 550C is correspondence, dated 28 May 2017, addressed to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and copied to the committee concerning a letter sent to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, responsible for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, regarding an audit of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, in 2016.  We will note that. </p><p> No. 551C is correspondence, dated 26 May 2017, from an individual making comments relating to greed and a lack of accountability in the public sector.  That is noted.</p><p> No. 552C is correspondence, dated 30 May 2017, from an individual relating to procurement processes in respect of the Eircode system.  The letter alleges the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment was misled by An Post.  An Post is not within the remit of this committee so I propose we refer this correspondence to the communications committee which may wish to proceed and consider the matter further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 557C is correspondence, dated 31 May 2017, from Deputy Catherine Murphy enclosing an email from an individual regarding the appointment process for a coroner in south and east Kerry.  The appointment of coroners is the responsibility of local authorities, but I propose to refer the matter to the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The individual obviously had a grievance about the process.</p><p> No. 559C is correspondence, dated 29 May 2017, from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform providing an update about a minute of the Minister following publication of a review of the Courts Service Spectrum growth fund.  The matter is more relevant to the Courts Service which will be before the committee on 13 July.  I suggest we make the Courts Service aware that this matter will be discussed on the day.  We will also send a copy to the individual who raised the matter.  This is noted.</p><p> No. 564C is correspondence, dated 6 June 2017, from the whistleblower in the Grace case who met the committee on 25 May 2017, enclosing a note about the matters discussed at that meeting. This is noted.  A further note was received very late last night.  Members will need time to consider the latest item, and if there are matters arising that we need to put to the HSE, we will put them in writing based on the letter we received.  It is a fairly detailed letter and we certainly need time to consider it.  I presume people will raise elements of it here today.</p></speech>

We will do that.  The HSE does not have it either so maybe we will give time to everyone to consider it for a few minutes.  We will get copies printed and give some to the witnesses and to committee members and we will take ten minutes to consider it.  We know that the witnesses cannot be 100% comprehensive about this.</p></speech>

It is important that everyone read it.  We will take time to read it when we finish dealing with the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 566C is correspondence, dated 7 June 2017, from the chairman of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, stating that it will engage with the commission of investigation into the sale of Project Eagle and that no information given to the committee in their responses was wrong.  This is noted.</p> <p>  No. 567C is correspondence, dated 7 June 2017, from Deputy Catherine Connolly regarding queries in respect of the overall settlement in the Grace case.  These questions were forwarded to the HSE and it is expected they will be responded to as part of today&rsquo;s meeting.  That is noted.</p> <p>  No. 569C is correspondence, dated 17 May 2017, from an individual relating to the ownership of Dundalk greyhound track and Bord na gCon grants for the track and Horse Racing Ireland grants for an all-weather horse racing track.  This is a very interesting note.  I propose we write to Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland to request clarity and information on the provision of grants to Dundalk greyhound track.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  No. 570C is anonymous correspondence, dated 29 May 2017, about the building of a boat on school premises in Carraroe, County Galway.  We will refer this to the Department of Education and Skills to request a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  No. 571C is correspondence, dated 26 May 2017, from an individual alleging that the committee was misled by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the legal advice obtained by the County Leitrim Vocational Educational Committee, VEC.  The individual previously wrote to the committee and the correspondence was forwarded to the Department requesting a response on 13 April 2017.  We await a response and the secretariat will follow that up.  This is noted.</p><p> No. 573C is correspondence, dated 30 May 2017, from Deputy Thomas Broughan.  It relates to the PARC Road Safety Group's analysis of replies to parliamentary questions from the Deputy by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The analysis relates to information on offences of holding a mobile phone while driving, for speeding and for drink-driving.  We will note that.</p><p> No. 577C is correspondence, dated 9 June 2017, from Noel Waters, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, confirming the attendance of officials for yesterday's meeting.  We will note that.</p><p> Nos. 579C, 580C, 581C and 582C include correspondence to Deputy Cullinane - 579C - dated 30 May 2017.  It is from a councillor in Cavan County Council regarding the arrangements for an office lease for Cavan Vocational Education Committee, VEC.  The additional correspondence, namely, Nos. 580C, 581C and 582C, supports the councillor's request for the matter to be reviewed.  I propose to write to the Department of Education and Skills to request a response in the first instance.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Five accounts and statements received are shown on the screens.  They include those of the HSE, which is before us today.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland received a clear audit opinion.  Sport Ireland also got a clear audit opinion.  The National Asset Management Agency got a clear audit opinion but attention was drawn to disclosures by NAMA of non-competitive procurement in 2016 to the value of &euro;3.5 million.

The HSE got a clear audit opinion.  Attention was drawn to disclosures by the HSE regarding a significant level of non-competitive procurement.  There was a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in relation to 49% by value of a sample of payments worth &euro;30.8 million.  That is quite significant.</p></speech>

On Thursday, 6 July we have the Department of Finance and then the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That will be interesting given the joining of those Ministries.

Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the Health Service Executive has been given the correspondence but said he cannot be expected to answer questions on this today.  He was asked to provide clarification on issues raised but the HSE refused to take this today.  I presume it will respond in writing.  Mr. O'Brien has said he does not have the time to prepare.

First, however, we will deal with the clarification from Mr. Tony O'Brien relating to evidence given to the committee on the &quot;Grace&quot; case.  We agreed yesterday to keep this part of the meeting to an hour and we must be mindful that a commission of investigation has been established and we should allow it to do its work.  We have given Mr. O'Brien the opportunity to provide any further clarification after his last appearance on this topic and to provide a response to questions forwarded by the committee following its meeting in private with the whistleblower in the Grace case, along with any other related questions.  We can provide a transcript of this meeting and any further information to the commission in due course with the agreement of the committee, and I am sure that will not be an issue.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, and thank him for attending today.  He is accompanied by Mr. Ray Mitchell from the parliamentary affairs section and Mr. Dara Purcell from the office of the director general for this first session.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the objectives of such policies.</p><p> Finally, members are reminded of the longstanding ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Mr. O'Brien, would you like to make some opening comments or go directly to clarifying questions from the members?</p></speech>

Indeed, I have been mindful in preparing my answers for the committee.</p> <p>  I wrote to the committee in letters dated 23 May 2017 and 14 June 2017.  Answers to specific questions raised by members of the committee via the secretariat have been responded to.

The first relates to the last time Mr. O'Brien was before the committee.  At the time there was a conversation about the freedom of information request from certain journalists.  Specifically, RTE journalists tabled extensive FOI requests.  Mr. O'Brien said in his response that if RTE had made a more comprehensive request in respect of local interaction between the HSE and the Garda at the time, then the response RTE would have received would have been different.  It seems that RTE did make such a request but that the HSE wrote back to RTE stating that the broadcaster had to limit the scope of the questions.  Is Mr. O'Brien aware of that?  If that is the case, does Mr. O'Brien need to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

There is one thing that I would like to make clear, because I think there may have been an ambiguity about it when we were here before.  The coverage of the matter by the programme, that is to say, the "This Week" programme, which made the FOI request, was of course accurate in respect of the coverage.  The issue I referred to was other reportage that included a headline on the RTE news website implying that there had been no contact at all.</p></speech>

This included dates and the areas of the HSE that the requester wanted the information from.  That is certainly the case.  The documentation we provided makes that clear.</p></speech>

One of the issues raised was funding for the Waterford Intellectual Disability Association.  This was one of the organisations providing care for Grace.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One is the funding provided for the care of the person we refer to as Grace.  The other is the other funding relating to the other aspects of the funding relationship between the HSE and that area and the organisation.  I have made a clear commitment that if this review indicates that there was unfair treatment, then it would be put right and dealt with.</p></speech>

The question I asked was whether a view was ever expressed, to the knowledge of Mr. O'Brien, by anyone in the HSE to the effect that the organisation providing the service, the service provider, should fund-raise to provide the level of care that Grace needed because the money requested by that organisation was not forthcoming.</p></speech>

I understand they say their estimation of the cost of providing the service for Grace would have been &euro;100,000.  They were told by the HSE that it would be &euro;50,000.  We need to bear in mind that this is for one-on-one support for someone who has been neglected by the State in the eyes of many people.  The representatives of the organisation were then told that they needed to fund-raise to cover the additional costs.  Does Mr. O'Brien accept that this would be a difficult situation for the service provider as well as being very unfair given the history of this issue?</p></speech>

In other words, there is an issue about where an urgent requirement arises.  In that situation, they went for what is often referred to as a mini-competition <i>de novo</i>.  In future, that will not be necessary because a framework agreement has been in place since 2015 whereby a total of 18 service providers are placed on a framework.  Commissioners of review within the HSE can draw down from that framework when required using what is known as the negotiated procurement procedures.

The reason drafts are issued is so that feedback can be considered, and it is usual that there would be a number of iterations of a report before a finalised report is produced.  Formal comments were provided by persons in the HSE to whom the draft was provided on 9 June.  Yesterday, in response to an inquiry from my office, Deloitte confirmed that the report has not been finalised at this time as the section relating to the financing of the service provider by the HSE has not been finalised.  To clarify, there are two parts to the review.  One relates specifically to funding concerning the person we call Grace and the second part relates to the wider financial relationship.</p></speech>

Since the previous time Mr. O'Brien was before the committee, we were expecting the report to be issued imminently.  We then had a meeting in private session with the whistleblower, and then there was a High Court case, which came as a bit of a surprise to some of us.  I do not think that was referred to at the particular meeting in February or March, but the High Court case was heard within days of that meeting.  I want to refer to the High Court case.

It was being managed by the State Claims Agency and there had been significant interaction, probably using the same base source of data for the terms of settlement.

That was what was followed in this case.  I was absolutely clear at the end of January and in early February of 2016.  The Deputy will recall that there was an issue about apologies and so on.  I intervened and made a full apology, personally, to everyone involved and I made it clear that this was not to be dealt with in an adversarial manner.</p></speech>

As Deputy Connolly said, three specific items are being addressed in terms of the clarification that has been provided by the HSE.  However, in our discussions this morning, we must remember that these are three specific items concerning the care of a human being.  That sometimes gets forgotten in the context of these debates.  I must say at the outset that this committee by its very nature is not one given to emotion, as can be seen at this or any other meeting, but the passion of the whistleblower when she addressed us last month is something that should have been heard by Mr. O'Brien.  Indeed, I would have loved all senior managers in Departments to have heard her.  Despite all the adverse circumstances she faced, she showed no bitterness but instead showed resilience and professional determination.  She reminded all of us that the person in question, Grace, feels loved and knows love.  That is sometimes forgotten when we are discussing facts, figures, underpayments and so forth.  I just wanted to put that on the record.</p> <p>  I will now turn to that funding issue, which is the first point on the correspondence.  It is a simple question as to whether there had been underfunding or a cut to the funding of the service provider since 2010, but it is amazing how long it took to get to an acknowledgement of that fact from the HSE.  Even at that, the language used is not precise.  The HSE refers to an acknowledgement that the funding was "not sufficient".  It does not refer to a cut or to underfunding.  Why did the HSE go to war with this small agency, which it will not name, in terms of underfunding?</p></speech>

There are two parts to this.  One is whether there was sufficient funding provided for Grace's care.  It has been acknowledged by the HSE, in a settlement agreed and approved by the President of the High Court, that there should be additional funding of &euro;600,000 retrospectively provided to the service provider.  The second part is whether other aspects of the agency's funding were adversely affected as a result of the relationship between it and the local representatives of the HSE in the context of their whistleblowing.  That is the second part of the Deloitte review.  When I have that, I will have an objective opinion as to whether this agency was penalised more generally, underfunded or cut - whatever terms we want to use - in ways that do not relate to the issue of insufficient funding being provided for the care of Grace.</p></speech>

In terms of the acceptance of underfunding, does Mr. O'Brien accept that repeated communications beginning in 2009 pointed out that insufficient funding was being provided for the level of care and psychological care required and for the trauma this person suffered, and that double the amount of funding was needed?  Does Mr. O'Brien accept that those communications were sent?  From my understanding, internal audits in 2014 deemed the funding to be sufficient.</p></speech>

Minutes of the HSE meeting held on 12 November 2009 discuss the need to remind the small agency that it was entirely reliant on HSE funding which was perhaps a reminder to stop the whistleblower pursuing this further, a bit like Donald Trump telling James Comey that he hopes Comey will not pursue an inquiry.

I was expressly asked by the former chairman of this committee, Deputy McGuinness, at the conclusion of the final meeting of this committee during the previous D&aacute;il, to enquire into whether this agency had been adequately funded or penalised or any other negative thing that may have happened as a result of whistleblowers being from that agency.  I undertook to this committee to engage in an external review and that is why it is happening.</p></speech>

I am talking about the Grace case in particular, what happened in that case and the length of time it took.  A witness attended a private meeting of this committee a couple of weeks ago.  To listen to that person give the details of what happened to a child left in that situation for 24 years in the area from which I come would bring tears from a stone.  As a senior executive of the HSE, does Mr. O'Brien take responsibility for any form of neglect by the HSE or for the agency not doing its job or for not making sure this person was treated in the manner she should have been during those 24 years?</p></speech>

I am already on the record as having accepted that and having comprehensively apologised for it, and a formal apology agreed with the wards of court office has been issued in regard to this matter.  There has never been any ambiguity or doubt about that.</p></speech>

Was anyone taken to task over the neglect, the wasted time and that this was allowed to happen under their watch?  Was anyone ever questioned or forced to pay a cost for it?</p></speech>

I identified a group of people about whom I had specific concerns when I read the Devine report and I reported that to this committee at the beginning of February 2016.  I indicated then and until quite recently that it was my understanding that they had all retired or left the public service.  I corrected that on the day before my most recent appearance before this committee by saying that I had new information in regard to one of those people that indicated that he or she was still engaged in the public service.  The person was working for Tusla.  There are others outside of those five who are mentioned in the Devine report as having some role in this general matter and who are also still in public service.</p></speech>

One part is in relation to the funding of Grace, though to some extent that is a little bit moot because it has been dealt with through a court settlement.  However, it will tell me how we got to that position.  The second is about the wider funding relationship and whether the fact that this organisation had the whistleblowers within it led to any negative approach towards the funder.  The wider questions the Deputy is asking are really matters that will be dealt with and resolved through the work of the Farrelly commission.</p></speech>

Is that an oversight on the part of the HSE?  Does Mr. O'Brien wish to take this opportunity to apologise to the whistleblower?  I am sure that will be important on his part.  It is my understanding, although I may be wrong, that until now the HSE, as a corporate body, and Mr. O'Brien, as its director general, have not given an apology to the whistleblower.</p></speech>

The agreement does deal with future costs and so on.</p> <p>  The second part is in relation to whether there was discrimination against the service provider.

I accept the HSE has commissioned this report and is seeking to expedite its publication.  I accept the role of Mr. Purcell and Mr. Mitchell.  I asked Mr. O'Brien whether anyone on behalf of the HSE, as a corporate body, had sought to influence the report or offered a critique of its terms of reference, in other words, if Deloitte had gone beyond its terms of reference.  Mr. O'Brien answered "No" to those questions.  He stated, however, that there were obviously individuals in his organisation who may be party to the work that the independent author of the report is doing, may have been working in the HSE and may have been part of decision making at the time and they might have offered an opinion but he, his staff and people representing him have not offered an opinion.  Has anybody above local level in the HSE, namely, anyone other than those persons who would have been subject to the decision making at the time in the Grace case, offered an opinion on the draft report?</p></speech>

I do not wish to tell Mr. O'Brien what was said when the whistleblower came before a private meeting of this committee for 90 minutes.  Given the wider treatment of the whistleblower, there would also be merit in the HSE apologising, not just for the way the funding element was handled but for how the person was treated from the moment they came forward until today.</p></speech>

Exchequer funding represents the largest source of income for the HSE and amounted to &euro;13.5 billion in 2016.  Changes introduced by the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014 required the HSE to deliver services within the grant funding allocated to it annually by the Oireachtas.  A deficit in 2015 of &euro;7.9 million was brought forward and met from the 2016 Exchequer grant funding.  The HSE incurred an operating deficit of &euro;10.3 million in 2016 which, likewise, was carried forward and met from its 2017 Exchequer grant allocation.  Income from patient charges in hospitals accounted for approximately 3% or &euro;450 million of the HSE&rsquo;s total income in 2016.  Three quarters of the total, &euro;335 million, was derived from charges imposed on private patients in HSE hospitals and other care settings.  Other income totalling &euro;611 million includes employee pension contributions and pension related deductions from staff salaries which the HSE retains.</p><p> As shown in Figure 2, the HSE incurred expenditure totalling &euro;14.58 billion in 2016.  Approximately 80% of this expenditure was spread across three main areas.  HSE pay and pensions accounted for just over one third of the expenditure totalling &euro;5.1 billion; grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies accounted for just over one quarter, or &euro;3.8 billion, of the expenditure, while expenditure on primary care and medical card schemes accounted for one fifth, or just under &euro;3 billion, of the expenditure.  The HSE enters service arrangements with a wide range of service providers under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Agencies funded in this manner vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community-based organisations providing personal social care services.  The audit report on the 2016 financial statements drew attention to weaknesses acknowledged by the HSE in its oversight and monitoring of grants to these agencies.  The statement on internal financial control discloses that 2016 service arrangements and grant aid agreements with a number of agencies had not been put in place by the end of April 2016; evidence of regular monitoring meetings and review of periodic financial reporting was not documented on file; there was no evidence in a number of cases of the receipt of funded agencies' annual audited financial statements and-or their review by the HSE, and that a number of funded agencies had not complied with public procurement guidelines or public sector pay policies.  </p><p> The audit report on both sets of financial statements drew attention to a significant level of non-competitive procurement by the HSE.  This is consistent with our audit findings in earlier years, on which I reported previously.  We examined a sample of procurements worth &euro;30.8 million in five HSE operating units in 2016 and found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement processes in relation to 49% by value of the sample.  Similarly, an examination of a sample of procurements worth &euro;29.6 million in five HSE units in 2015 found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in relation to 30% by value.  The HSE&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control outlines the steps being taken to deal with these matters.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer and interim deputy director general; Ms. Mairead Dolan, assistant chief financial officer, finance division; and Mr. Ray Mitchell in his usual role.  As we submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting, I will confine my opening remarks to the following issues.  </p> <p>  On the financial outturn for 2016, following discussions which commenced in May 2016, a Revised Health Estimate was approved by the Oireachtas on 7 July, with an additional &euro;500 million notified to the HSE as part of the revision.  This represented a significant commitment to ensuring health and social care services would be placed on a more sustainable financial footing for 2016 and marked a move away from the practice of allocating supplementary funding at year end.  The annual financial statements for 2016 reported a combined, revenue and capital, income and expenditure, surplus of &euro;12.4 million before the impact of the first charge mechanism.  The result after the first charge related to 2015 was a combined surplus of &euro;4.7 million.</p> <p>  On the financial outturn for 2015, the 2015 annual financial statements reported a combined, revenue and capital, income and expenditure, deficit of &euro;7.7 million, which, under the principles of first charge, was reflected in the financial statements for 2016.  This was after a total of &euro;649 million had been provided in supplementary funding for the financial year 2015.  It included &euro;212 million in net Supplementary Estimates for the HSE in respect of projected deficits in areas within its direct control which were reflective of financial performance challenges related primarily to cost pressures within acute hospitals and disability services and &euro;437 million for overruns in respect of the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, pensions and the States Claims Agency, as well additional funding for new initiatives approved after the HSE national service plan was finalised such as waiting list and winter planning initiatives.  The &euro;437 million represents approximately two thirds of the total supplementary funding for 2015 and does not reflect any adverse financial performance by the HSE.  </p> <p>  To put the HSE's financial performance in recent years in context, looking back over the nine years from 2008 to 2016, there has been &euro;500 million in net Supplementary Estimates for the HSE for areas within its direct control which are reflective of financial performance challenges.  This equates to 0.46% of the total original net Vote over the period of &euro;108.512 billion.  Also, there was &euro;791 million in Supplementary Estimates to the HSE for the PCRS for medical cards, GP fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, including the dental treatment services scheme.  This equates to 0.73% of the total original net Vote of &euro;108.512 billion over the period.  There was &euro;1,948 million in Supplementary Estimates to the HSE for Exchequer related and other items outside the control of the HSE.  This equates to 1.8% of the total original net Vote over the period.  Further details for the years 2008 to 2016, inclusive, have been provided in the briefing submitted.</p> <p>  On non-compliant procurement, the scale and complexity of the HSE's overall procurement activity are such that it will take a sustained focus for a number of years to ensure high levels of compliance.  This is a key focus for the HSE.  It continues to progress a number of initiatives which are organised around three key themes: supporting infrastructure, including training, improving data analytics, etc.; sourcing - putting in place additional contracts and frameworks; and compliance - supporting services to move towards compliance with contracts and frameworks.</p><p>Further details in respect of the steps being taken to address the issue of non-compliant procurement are contained in the statement of internal financial control within the 2016 annual financial statements.</p><p> In the context of monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies in 2016, just under &euro;3.8 billion of the HSE's total expenditure related to grants to over 2,000 outside agencies.  These range from the large voluntary hospitals and disability organisations to small local community-based agencies.  Weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of these grants to outside agencies have been identified.</p><p> The HSE continues to progress the necessary medium to long-term actions to address these weaknesses.  Those actions are co-ordinated nationally by the HSE compliance unit established in 2014.  This unit is supporting the development of improved grant oversight by our community health care organisations and hospital groups.  This improved oversight is intended to raise the level of compliance by grant-funded agencies within the HSE&rsquo;s governance framework.  An example of the actions already taken is the external review of governance arrangements in respect of all section 38 providers.  That review is under way.</p><p> Further detail regarding the steps being taken to address the issue of weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies are published in the statement of internal financial control within the 2016 annual financial statements.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's reporting is, therefore, timely and will assist the HSE in managing these key areas of focus.  This concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

He is very welcome.  This is a very good exercise and I welcome both of the officials who accompany Mr. O'Brien.  It is very good that the Health Service Executive is before the committee to account.  The HSE has had a clean audit, which is good, but it is subject to two very serious modifications.  I shall come to those, and the section 38 and section 39 issues, but first I have a general query.  The total budget of the HSE for 2016 was almost &euro;15 billion.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The task given by the Oireachtas to the Health Service Executive is to receive the estimate set out on budget day, translate that into a service plan, migrate the service plan into implementation during the course of the year and live within budget.  This was the first year in which that was possible, subject to the significant Revised Estimate as agreed by this Oireachtas.</p> <p> As the Sl&aacute;intecare report published by another Oireachtas committee has made clear, there are policy opportunities - which will be debated in due course by Government and the Oireachtas - to transform the way the health care system is organised.  To change it subjectively-----</p></speech>

I agree with him about that and we are part of the D&aacute;il and we know that.  Is the budget that the HSE receives sufficient to deliver the service or is it inevitable collateral damage that patients are sitting on trolleys for two or three days in hospitals in Galway?  On occasion, it varies up and down but we can accept that it could be two days on a trolley.  We can take any hospital.  I do not wish to be parochial.  What is happening with this funding?  Does the HSE just accept it?  I am not in any way laying blame, I am asking.  Does it upset Mr. O'Brien that he has this budget and yet there are people in those situations?  I use Galway as an example.  There are huge waiting lists, one MRI scanner in a centre of excellence and so on.  It could be any hospital.  How does Mr. O'Brien-----</p></speech>

As with other health systems, there will always be people on trolleys.  The question is about how long they are there.  In the UK's NHS, for example, the standard is that a person should either be seen and discharged or seen and admitted - that is, no longer on a trolley - within four hours.  We could move to that way of thinking about things, but there are always going to be patients on trolleys.</p></speech>

However we have never reached an opportunity to really develop our community and primary care services to the point where we can remodel our acute hospital system.  It is clear that the funding we have and the way we are organised currently are inadequate to meet the health care needs of Irish society.  This is evidenced by access issues such as the inability obtain services, time spent on waiting lists and time spent on trolleys.  Demand for services is growing and even though our capacity is increasing, there is a continuing mismatch.</p></speech>

In my opinion, there is a mismatch - and I have articulated this to other Oireachtas committees - between the proportion of revenue that is spent on health and the proportion of the capital budget that is spent on health.  There is also the collective reality for the entire State that prior to the economic collapse it was intended to invest in capital health infrastructure at roughly double the rate we have been able to afford as a result of that collapse.  This is compounded in health by the fact that in what we understood - perhaps incorrectly - to be the economic boom time, there was quite a significant investment in equipment, much of which is now at the end of its serviceable life.  There is a huge capital requirement there.</p></speech>

The amount relating to these projects is &euro;30 million.  The figure has gone up from the previous year and the situation has become worse.

In order to explain the fundamental reason, we would point to the fact that we have been unable in recent years, especially in the recession years, to invest sufficiently in our overall procurement capacity.

We look at this in terms of three overall aspects.</p> <p>  The first is the overall infrastructure.  We must have sufficient staff in procurement and sufficient data tools.  This is despite the lack of a single financial procurement system.  We have to put in significant training.  That is the infrastructure aspect.  We have done considerable work to improve that.  The second aspect relates to sourcing.  We simply cannot have compliance with procurement if we do not have sufficient contracts.  We have a target for the coming two or three years to get to over 80% compliance in respect of our &euro;2.2. billion in procurement spending.</p> <p>  Our procurement team has indicated that the international evidence suggests if we are at over 85% compliance, then we are in best-practice territory.  If the rate is between 55% and 65%, then we are in the average range.  If the rate is less than 35%, then the rating is poor.

As an organisation that is largely a provider of social and health care services, we were prioritising the provision of service staff and front-line staff.  In a different question on those 45 staff, I might be asked why the number of clerical and administrative staff has increased.  Those 45 procurement staff - albeit they are professionals in procurement and they are essential - are not regarded as front-line clinical staff.  They are in the cohort of administration and clerical staff.  The question of why is answered.</p> <p>  Deputy Connolly referred to things worsening based on the 2015 report, which stated that non-compliance was 30%, and the 2016 report, which stated that non-compliance was 49%.  This is derived from looking at the sample.  The significant difference between those two figures is that when the 2015 audit was done, our national agency contract was still live.  When the 2016 audit was done, that contract had run out of time.  We were putting in place its replacement.  We were delayed on that.</p> <p>  Let us consider the &euro;16 million relating to non-compliance.  In 2016, the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at an adjusted value of &euro;31 million.  A total of &euro;16 million of that was non-compliant.  Of that &euro;16 million a total of &euro;4 million was agency contract.  We now have in place a national agency contract.  Had we not been delayed on that-----</p></speech>

It was delayed for both stakeholder interests and a variety of practical reasons.  I do not have the details before me.  However, it is a complex contract.  It amounts to hundreds of millions of euro per year over several years and, therefore, there is a certain complexity to it.  The reality is that it was delayed but is now in place.  Had it been in place for this sample, it would have brought the non-compliance rate down to approximately 38%, which is still somewhat higher than last year but there is no great difference.  I hope that explains the difference between the samples from the two years.</p></speech>

There is a difficulty with sampling in the HSE.  Since there are different procurement and financial systems, it is not possible to take a random sample across the entire organisation and test it.  If we were able to do that, the figures that would come out could be scaled up as being representative of the entire organisation.  However, we have to pick certain operational units and examine procurement at a local level.  The figures that come out and changes in the figures from year to year are not necessarily indicative of a trend.  There may be trends in the data but we cannot tell what those trends are.  It could be that the situation across the HSE improves from year to year but because of the way we have to sample, it may look like it got worse.  That is a difficulty in interpreting the figures.</p></speech>

We would say this would have flattered the organisation.  There is a co-ordinated central national approach.  I mentioned the infrastructure piece, including the staff, and the push to get more contracts in place.  The third piece is to support compliance with those contracts.  We have built a small compliance improvement team whose aim is to assist each of our service divisions - our nine big community health care organisations and seven hospital groups - to review their current purchasing and contracting arrangements and existing contracts, see whether they can be brought into partial or full compliance, and ensure that we flesh out fully the sourcing plan for the coming years.</p></speech>

In 2014, again as part of our overall governance framework, the HSE instituted an annual compliance statement for the section 38 organisations.  That requires their boards and chairs to state things in writing to the HSE around governance and a range of other issues.  An obvious question is how do we know so-----</p></speech>

Obviously, it is important for us to be clear that while the HSE acknowledges its responsibility around grants, the key responsibility for ensuring good governance and good controls inside a voluntary organisation rests with the board of that organisation.</p></speech>

Console was a section 39 agency.  Some of the same principles apply.  Just to be clear, our role in terms of Console was to ensure, first and foremost, that we were getting value for money and the services for which we were paying.  The HSE was satisfied that it was getting the services from Console for which it paid.  The governance arrangements within Console are absolutely a matter of concern for the HSE and we certainly do not deny that.  They are also a matter of concern for the board of Console so if the Deputy is asking me how we are seeking to improve our overall governance and monitoring, which the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced, I can tell her that we are taking a number of steps.</p> <p>  We have an overall governance framework, a national central compliance unit which administers that and provides support to us and a series of agreements in varying levels of detail depending on whether we are providing funding of over or less than &euro;250,000.  The annual compliance statement for the section 38 agencies has been in place from 2014 and we extended it to the larger section 39 organisations for 2016 - all those organisations over receiving over &euro;3 million - so that is about 54 more agencies.  Those two together represent north of 90% of the total funding we give to those agencies.  We are carrying out the Deloitte external review of the section 38 organisations.  That is intended to become a five-year cyclical piece.  The area where we are in most difficulty, particularly when one gets to the volume of section 39 organisations, is in having sufficient capacity within our CHOs to be able to monitor those arrangements effectively.</p></speech>

The 16 larger voluntary organisations are administered by five of the seven hospital groups so the numbers are not significant.  Obviously, the issues are significant.  When one gets towards the 2,000 section 39 organisations, whichever way one wants to cut it, there are an awful lot of organisations our nine community health care organisations have to administer the relationship with.  Part of our current efforts involve trying to ensure we have enough capacity in those nine community health care organisations to physically be able to conduct, record and minute all of the meetings necessary with those organisations.  Obviously, our community health organisations are often primarily focused on securing services for individuals or finding residential or respite places.  What we want to do, and what we must invest in, involves not preventing them focusing their time on getting those services, but also ensuring they have sufficient capacity so that they can conduct the relationship management and contract management with these organisations starting with the larger ones.  We accept that we have a capacity issue which we are moving to address but, again, like the procurement-----</p></speech>

I thank them for their presence.  Earlier, Mr. O'Brien rightly said that he could not be expected to be across the detail of what is happening in every hospital and I would not expect him to be.  Luckily for me, I do know the detail concerning University Hospital Waterford.</p><p>I put down parliamentary questions almost every week to keep myself acquainted with what is happening there.  I want to use the examples of what is happening in Waterford, because I am familiar with them, in order to frame questions which have a national implication.  I will start with the outsourcing of patients, whereby patients who are on waiting lists in certain hospitals are outsourced to other hospitals because capacity simply is not there in the original hospitals.  One of the responses I got back to a parliamentary question on outsourcing in University Hospital Waterford was that, in 2013, the total number of patients who were outsourced - this refers to OPD patients - was 3,085.  That had increased to 6,203 by 2015 and, in fact, has gone up again in 2016.  That is a 100% increase in the number of patients who are being outsourced.</p><p> First, has the HSE done an analysis of whether it costs more to outsource patients in the first instance?  There would certainly be a cost that is not being taken into account by the patient who will have to travel and incur costs, but is there a greater cost to the organisation?  Second, when patients are outsourced, how is that paid for?  Is it paid for by the hospital that refers the patient or by the hospital that provides the treatment?  Let us bear in mind that many of these patients are outsourced to private facilities in different parts of the State, including the Mater Private in Cork, St. Francis Private Hospital, Beacon Hospital in Sandyford, Barringtons Hospital, Aut Even Hospital and Whitfield Clinic.  Most of the outsourcing, including of many patients in my area, has been done to private hospitals so my question is obvious.  Has the HSE done any analysis of its cost effectiveness?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061500002#V00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the thoughtful and informed question.  The practice of treating patients elsewhere, other than in the primary hospital, is often generally referred to as outsourcing.  We tend to use that term only for transfer into the private sector but I know that, locally, they think of outsourcing even if patients go to another public hospital.  I think the figures used by the Deputy encompass both.</p> <p>  Where we have capacity to meet an unmet need in one hospital in another hospital, we regard it as good practice to utilise the resources of the second hospital.  For example, recently there would have been a significant shift of provision of service in orthopaedics from Waterford to Cappagh in order to deal with a long-term waiting list issue and, more recently again, in the cardiac area, Cork University Hospital has been addressing the needs of some long waiters as well.  That is clearly an increasingly efficient use of the public resource and is always beneficial both to the patients and to the system.</p> <p>  Where there is what we essentially regard as outsourcing, which is to the private sector, that is always done on the basis of an appropriately procured service and best value for money is obtained.  Most importantly, the driver is to ensure that patients who are in need of outpatient assessment, and-or inpatient or day-case treatment they would not otherwise get in a timely way, do get it.  Therefore, overall, we regard that as offering value for money.</p></speech>

Obviously, in situations where we have spare capacity in public hospitals in one area, and I would imagine this is part of the logic of the hospital groups that have been established, it would make sense for patients who are waiting longer in one hospital to be seen in another public hospital where there is capacity.</p></speech>

What I am trying to understand is situations where we do not have capacity.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned orthopaedics as one example but there are many examples not just in Waterford, but across all public hospitals where there are capacity issues and patients are then being treated in private hospitals.  Has the HSE done any cost analysis in regard to whether it would be better to put the capacity into the original hospitals to enable them to treat those patients, rather than having to pay for those patients to be treated in private hospitals?  I am not asking from a patient perspective, which is important and I would always put myself in the shoes of a patient as I know most people do not want to travel, but from a cost perspective.  Mr. O'Brien is the officer accountable to us.  Has his organisation done an analysis of the cost of treating patients in private hospitals as opposed to putting the capacity into the public hospitals?</p></speech>

For example, if we have a long-term vacancy for a rare speciality consultant that we have not been able to fill, then there is not really a good public sector benchmark that one can use because there is not a reality about having that available.</p></speech>

Again, I will give examples in University Hospital Waterford because I have those figures.  In 2012, the total agency spend by the hospital was &euro;1,648,000, in 2013 it was &euro;3,597,000, and in 2014 it was &euro;6,289,000.  It reduced slightly in 2015 to &euro;5,145,000 but went back up close to &euro;6 million in 2016.  Therefore, agency spend was approximately &euro;1.6 million and increased to almost &euro;6 million, which is a significant increase.  Is it costing taxpayers more to hire agency staff as opposed to direct employment in the public service?</p></speech>

Our preference is that agencies should only be used at the margins.  There will always be some requirement for agencies and, indeed, all of our hospitals have a conversion target in-year, which Mr. Mulvany will speak to in greater detail.</p></speech>

Maybe in the past this was due to recruitment problems, the embargo and so on.  Whatever the reason, there was a quadrupling of agency spend at University Hospital Waterford.  I am trying to understand if that is costing us more, as taxpayers.</p></speech>

Where it is most worrying is in regard to medical costs, where agency is more like 14% of our total pay cost.  While I do not have the specific figures for Waterford, I would hazard a guess that it is an increase in medical agency, which is a large part of the driver.  Generally speaking, I can say for almost any grade that the cost of agency versus the cost of flat-rate hours - the normal hours - is definitely higher.</p></speech>

Again, I want to stick with examples from University Hospital Waterford as I am familiar with it.</p><p>To ensure Mr. O'Brien was not blindsided, I signalled before the meeting that I would be putting this issue to him.  I am trying to understand the relationship between policy, which he is not here to answer for as it is an issue for the Minister, operational matters and costs of funding.  I have been following the process of the deployment of a mobile cath lab to treat cardiac patients at University Hospital Waterford for some time and am still unable to understand it.  My understanding is that an announcement was made by the Minister in January that this would happen.  A couple of weeks later, a business case was developed by the hospital management and sent to the South/South West hospital group.  The group then sent it in January to the HSE, the Department or both.  Four months later, nothing had happened and no decision had been made.  At the time that the business model was developed, 580 patients were awaiting cardiac procedures at University Hospital Waterford.  The hospital then entered into a service level agreement with hospitals in Cork and 380 of those patients are now being seen in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and a private hospital in Cork.  If Mr. O'Brien will bear with me, I want to understand the process.  At the time when the mobile cath lab was needed most, when the business case was made and the demand was greater, no decision was made.  Even though it seems the Minister had made the decision, the hospital was not given approval to go to the procurement stage.  The hospital has today stated it will be given that approval next week and that will then involve a procurement process.  I am trying to understand the relationship between policy and decision making.  Mr. O'Brien can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.  If the Minister were to make a policy decision that the deployment of a mobile cath lab could be one of several options used to reduce cardiac care, would it then be up to the HSE and the Department to make an operational decision as to whether that is necessary at any given time?  Can Mr. O'Brien explain the decision-making process and who is responsible for what?  I want to ask about procurement also.  That is the real reason I am asking this but we will come to that presently.  Can the witness explain the decision-making process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.690" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061500002#W00200"><p>As Deputy Cullinane knows, the process includes the Herity report, which looked at demand versus capacity issues for cardiac catheterisation for the population served by University Hospital Waterford and recommended that capacity should be increased to achieve equilibrium between likely demand and likely capacity in the future.  Since that time, the Minister identified as a policy priority, as he is entitled to, that that capacity should become equalised.  In order to do so, we have commenced the process of recruiting additional staff to enable the hours of operation of the existing cardiac cath lab to be extended.  In view of some of the issues we discussed earlier in terms of agency staff and recruitment, that is likely to be a longish process.  The practical way in which capacity can be increased in the meantime is by bringing on site a private provider to provide staff and a temporary additional cardiac cath lab.  As I said, this has been identified as a ministerial priority.  At group level, there has been an effort to deal with the backlog through facilitating patients to travel to CUH, as Deputy Cullinane described.  As he has agreed, a significant number of patients have been treated who otherwise would not yet have received their treatment.  As a result of that, a procurement process, which I will not talk about until the Deputy has asked his questions, will soon commence to give effect to the provision of a temporary deployment of a mobile staffed cardiac catheterisation laboratory for a brief period at University Hospital Waterford.</p></speech>

There seem to be ongoing issues in regard to compliance and procurement rules within the HSE.  We have had many examples - I do not know how many - where the Comptroller and Auditor General has given a qualified reporting of accounts because of breaches of procurement rules in the HSE.  In this instance, can the witness say what will happen in terms of procurement?</p></speech>

In this case, it is fortunate that this is not the first time we have deployed cardiac catheterisation mobile units and consequently we have a valid framework in place.  That provides for a number of pre-qualified suppliers, each of which, when a hospital wishes to draw down, is invited to take part in what is colloquially called a mini-competition.  The suppliers are pre-qualified through open tender to take part in the mini-competition against each other.  It is intended to commence that mini-competition within the framework in the next few days.  That will be validly procured.  If that were subsequently included in the sampling by the Comptroller and Auditor General, subject to the view he reached, I would be satisfied that it would be deemed to be procurement-compliant, provided all steps are followed correctly.</p></speech>

The letter says that following the Dublin review the acute hospitals policy division 3 asked the acute coronary syndrome, ACS, programme to review the arrangements for the provision of primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, nationally and to make recommendations.  This was in 2015.  At the time, it was intended that the review would be completed in three months.  That never happened.  The programme for Government was then published which provided for a review to be conducted in regard to Waterford, which was done, as the witness is aware.  A person was commissioned to do a body of work.  The letter goes on to say that it would be necessary to bring forward the Waterford element of the review but would be important to ensure that the results of the Waterford review be fed in as appropriate to the national review.  Is it Mr. O'Brien's understanding that there was a review in Dublin, following which the HSE decided to undertake a national review?  The programme for Government contained a specific commitment in regard to Waterford, which review has been completed and will feed into the national review.  Is that national review currently under way?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien might also remember that, because of the nature of the issues raised, the internal audit found that there were systemic problems in the HSE's relationship with the organisations and service level agreements in question.  Since then, there have been issues with GLEN, St. John of God and so on.  The problem does not seem to have gone away.  Now, there are problems with other sections 38 and 39 organisations.  What improvements in processes have been made by the HSE to ensure that these types of situation do not recur repeatedly?  We do not want to deal with these issues time and again.  It is taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  I will put a number of specific questions.  Was GLEN funded by the HSE?  I will get to my questions on St. John of God, which is funded by the HSE, later.

Under it, the board and chair of a voluntary body have to provide a list of assurances to us regarding governance, risk management and a variety of other matters.  It started in 2014 with the section 38 agencies and was extended in 2016 to those section 39 bodies in receipt of more than &euro;3 million per annum, approximately 455 organisations.  I would have to check the exact timing but we have also instituted an external review by Deloitte of section 38 organisations.  I am certain that we have at least brought forward the completion date of that review from the end of 2018 to the end of 2017.  Based on a number of internal reports, we have also written to all board chairs advising them and their boards of some common issues that have been appearing.  We are seeking to improve capacity within our CHOs so that, where engagement is a problem, they have sufficient resources to engage more frequently with some of the voluntary organisations, given that there are more than 2,000 of the latter in total.</p></speech>

A significant pay policy exercise was undertaken to require all of them to come back into line.  The committee was heavily involved with one section 38 body, a particular hospital in Dublin, as members may recall.</p> <p>  Following an internal whistleblowing, there is now an audit concerning the way in which certain individuals at St. John of God had their pay regularised.  Members may be familiar with what is alleged.  A significant forensic internal audit is being carried out and is almost complete in the sense that the feedback process is under way.

These services rely very heavily on fund-raising by parents and other supporters.  When public attention is drawn to the additional payments, there is a detrimental impact on people's trust, and this affects the charitable side of the organisation, resulting in an additional loss of funds which can be raised.  When something like this happens, does the HSE calculate it in its service model?</p></speech>

The most significant example I can give goes back to where this all began, namely, the Central Remedial Clinic, which was in the eye of the storm in respect of this issue three years ago.  The revelations about financial arrangements caused a total collapse in private and voluntary funding to the CRC.  We were careful to rehabilitate the CRC as a voluntary body capable of having the confidence of service users.  That has occurred here and our aim in dealing with this includes, first of all, preserving and, where possible, improving the services to service users of St. John of God, who are at the heart of our concern.  Second, we try to bring any organisation we fund which is not currently in compliance with public pay policy fully into compliance.  The other thing we are doing is trying to ensure sustainability by looking at the organisation in the round, for which a process is already in play and is examining the issues.  We cannot divorce our attitude to the totality of a service from the issues of concern about how decisions are made at the highest level in an organisation.</p></speech>

Every arrangement has a signed document specifying the funding and the range, type and quantum of services to be provided and is arrived at as part of a process in which the particular circumstances are examined.

Mr. Mulvany said people making themselves available as agency nurses are perhaps not making themselves available to be directly employed.  The HSE pays the agency a fee.  Has any work been done on the amount paid to the nurse?  Is it known?  Obviously it varies from agency to agency.  To what extent has the lower rate of pay in the more recent recruitment been a factor in people opting for agencies as opposed to being directly employed?</p></speech>

It applies to all the grades, including nursing.  The rate of pay is known.  There used to be a blue card, so it is very obvious what the nursing rate of pay is.  While I am not an expert in HR, I understand that in recent years legislation has progressively made the requirement to ensure agency members of staff are at least getting a rate of pay comparable to those directly employed.  The issue is there is an additional payment and there is a commission and VAT on top.</p></speech>

Some of this has been in the news recently with regard to what happens when people present through accident and emergency departments.  I had cause to write to the Minister six weeks ago and I received a reply from the Department of Health last week, dated 31 May.  I have a general question, but I want to set the scene in this regard.  The case describes how the situation has evolved.  A person presented to me, and I am using it as an example.  I documented the example and went to the Minister for Health.  This person presented at an accident and emergency department.  Someone followed the person around with a clipboard asking whether the person had health insurance.  It got to the point where a medic had to be called because the person's blood pressure became a problem.  The person documented to me the follow-up, including after leaving the hospital.  To be perfectly honest, I was alarmed at the behaviour.  The reply I received detailed that operational procedures are managed by the HSE, which has no centrally held policy to direct individual hospitals on the completion and signing of private health insurance forms.  It stated individual hospitals may have developed their own standard operating procedures in respect of the completion and signing of the forms, but this information is not collated, nor held centrally, by the HSE.  The reply stated it is considered that the application of these operational procedures should be sensitive to the health status of patients while in hospital.  We can see why this would be the response.  It also stated the HSE has been asked to investigate this particular case and come back to me.</p> <p>  Obviously, individual hospitals are looking at their own budgets, and if there is going to be a shortfall, a more aggressive approach may well be taken in respect of this.  In the case I documented, the person's health was compromised by the approach made at a very vulnerable point.  Is the HSE developing central procedures on this?  What pressure, if any, is the HSE putting on hospitals to come up with specific incomes through private health insurance in respect of this particular aspect.</p></speech>

It is also a very difficult time for the individual patients and their families.  Most of our staff are always doing their absolute best.  We could not and do not condone any situation where a patient would be harassed, and it is regrettable if anyone perceived they were, so that needs to be investigated and followed up.  That said, our general policy in terms of interacting with patients would not allow for that.  It does not require necessarily a separate specific policy when we are speaking to them about insurance matters.  If that incident occurred, it will be investigated.  It should not have happened.  We suggest it is not the norm and is not what our staff come to work to do every day.</p> <p>  With regard to the budget, I remind people the charges we are speaking about were introduced under 2013 legislation.  This means they are legal embodiments of policy.  We are obliged to raise them.  The funding of the health service assumes we raise them.  Approximately 7% to 8% of the total costs of the 48 hospitals in the health service hospital division is supported by the increments raised from the private health insurance charge.  The majority of this comes from people who enter the system through the emergency route.  That said-----</p></speech>

I do not have the figure.  It is more than 50% and I think it is more than two thirds.  We can give the Deputy the figure.  It comes through the emergency route.  This is what the legislation and policy states.</p> <p>  As regards aggressive approaches when people are falling short on income, that is not what we seek.  Last year, our acute hospital division and finance division conducted a significant exercise, with external support.  We sampled 14 hospitals and looked at all their income processes.  We have given it back to the hospitals to implement process improvements.  None of the process improvements involves deliberately harassing patients.  Our expectation is if income shortfalls are occurring, and the reasons they are occurring include the actions of some insurers, hospitals will make sure they implement process improvements as best they can to maintain their income.  It stops there.</p></speech>

I do not imagine the person who came to me was just picked out of the blue.  It must have been the approach of the individual hospital and it was aggressive.  There is no doubt in my mind it was aggressive.  Then we heard other stories.  I went privately to the Minister and gave the information to him and said I was concerned about this.  Then I heard others on the radio saying exactly the same thing.  Mr. Mulvany has stated it is not HSE policy that there is this aggressive approach.</p></speech>

At present, I am carrying out performance meetings with a number of hospitals on their financial performance and I am specifically excluding from this the issue of health insurance generated income.  I am certainly not putting any pressure on any hospitals in relation to this particular question, even though there are variances on that income against original budgets.  Our performance dialogue is much more on the expenditure side, specifically because of this issue.  In our performance process we are not pressuring the hospitals to do better or to do more on this.  With regard to the traditional levying of insurance charges for elective treatment, we do pressure them to make sure they do not allow forms to go out of date.  It is a discussion we have had here many times.</p><p>This is obviously a new component.  There is no pressure within the organisation, undue pressure or pressure to maximise this form of income.  It is a reality that it is a line in the budget because that is the way the budget is received.</p></speech>

The figure is an estimate.  Part of the reason it has gone up by &euro;400 million is that there has been a change in the rate of return included in the actuarial assessment from 3% to 1%.  Effectively, we are back to the discount rate being applied to actuarial assumptions.  It is the same argument in pension liabilities being estimated.  There can be a lot of fluctuations, depending on the assumptions used.  Part of the concern is that if one were to make provision for all of these things, there would be major jumps from year to year that could be very significant.  Even in an account as big as the HSE's, it can distort the financial performance in the year.  That is the argument against it.</p></speech>

He mentioned pensions.  They are probably all marked, but this is separate from pensions.</p></speech>

We are all familiar with cases taken in which there was fault at birth and claims are settled as a consequence.  Sometimes they are unavoidable, but sometimes people seek services rather than a payment.  If it was felt services would be provided throughout the lifetime of the person damaged, that might well change the approach to being litigious in having to provide for the person cncerned.  There is a relationship between people believing they have to go to court and the provision of services.  Is this factored in in an actuarial assessment?</p></speech>

We are working with the State Claims Agency to take a different approach, particularly the issue to which the Deputy refers, the catastrophic birth injury which typically gives rise to some of the largest settlements.  Historically and, to some extent, currently, part of the valuation of a claim is about the services to be provided following the catastrophic incident and their adequacy.  Through our primary care and disability services divisions and in discussions with the State Claims Agency, we are working to become increasingly proactive in addressing these health care needs, notwithstanding the fact that there may be the prospect of litigation or it is in train.  Fundamentally, irrespective of litigation, we are the health and social care service of the State and need to be proactive in meeting these health care needs, however they arose.  There is a view that our role and that of the State Claims Agency will be influenced by this, but most importantly, it can make the consequences of an adverse event less traumatising than they might otherwise be by building a better relationship between the local health service and the parents who suffered the event.  I have to admit and acknowledge do so freely that historically it has not been the hallmark of the way things have been done and that this has led to very long running, long outstanding high value claims by people who have suffered not only the consequences of an adverse event but also a damaged relationship with the health care system in the interim.</p> <p>  On the small print, it is my understanding we have not formally gone to print.

In many jurisdictions, in some of these catastrophic birth injuries, and there is a certain irreducible rate of them, some in that category, some as a result of poor profession practice, it is not necessary to prove negligence or to go to court in order to do that.

Without any new claims, we are saying that the cases on hand, at the rate we are paying them, and these people have already suffered a catastrophic incident, it will take ten years before the cases on hand as at last December are paid out.  That is what I find unacceptable.  The director general knows that I am from Portlaoise where we have had recent cases.

First, I note the significance of the budget we are discussing, namely, &euro;14.5 billion.  Earlier, Deputy Connolly referred to University Hospital Galway and how things can have an impact on so many aspects of our lives.  Last night I was dealing with an application relating to a small project in Navan for school completion, which the HSE will, hopefully, fund as well.  It is a case of going from something very big to something very small, taking into account the manner of how the HSE impacts across so many aspects of our lives.  It is important to note as well that HSE expenditure does not just relate to primary medical care but also to the school completion programme, which in the case I mentioned will hopefully keep troubled teenagers in school.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany spoke about the plan concerning procurement.  He gave 2020 as the date by which he hopes to see matters resolved.  Could he elaborate on the plan a bit more in terms of the complexities involved in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.936" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061500002#FF00500"><p>One of the complexities for the HSE is its sheer size and scale, and as the Deputy alluded to, the breadth of its activities which cover most citizens in some shape or form and there are very few services across health and personal social care that we do not provide.  The intention is to get north of &euro;2.2 billion worth of procurable spend up to and then beyond 80% compliance, which would be good or best practice.  What is involved in that is drawing up a large number of procurement contracts or frameworks or both in the coming years.  The director general has explained what frameworks are.  To put the issue in some context, on average in recent years we are losing just north of &euro;100 million worth of contracts every year in terms of them coming out of date.</p><p>Our aim is to make a net gain of &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million a year, which means we have to put in place &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million a year in contracts over the next number of years.  As we sit here today, we have roughly &euro;1.1 billion under contract.  We are trying to get north of the &euro;2.2 billion mark by making up the roughly &euro;100 million a year which we lose due to contracts expiring and exceeding that by &euro;300 million to &euro;400 million in net terms.  That leaves us with &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million a year in contracts.  There is significant work in that, which is why we have made the investment in the additional 45 staff in sourcing, which is the part of our procurement team that does contracts and procurement frameworks.  </p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not obliged to set that out.</p></speech>

We are also improving our data capacity and in the background, we are also working towards a single national financial system.  It may not be in place by 2020 but I am satisfied that we should have achieved our targets in terms of getting to and beyond that &euro;2.2 billion by then.</p></speech>

He mentioned the compliance unit.  Mr. O'Brien also mentioned the weakness in monitoring.  What is the extent of the potential for monitoring?  If we look at the Console situation, Mr. O'Brien made a particular point that this agency was held up to international acclaim because of the work that it was doing.  Who was to know that such misappropriation of funds was happening, given that in its primary role it was held to such acclaim?  The witness talks about weaknesses in monitoring and the oversight of grants.  What is the potential extent of financial exposure to the organisation?  </p> <p>  As for the change of approach since Console, I am aware Mr. Mulvany has noted that staff have been added, but has there been a change of approach as well, given what I have said about the work that Console was doing?  The job they were doing primarily was acclaimed but the misappropriation of funds was happening on a different level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061500002#GG00800"><p>The Console case is a particularly interesting one from our point of view.  Even looked at retrospectively, it is clear that the services we were buying were being provided and at a reasonable cost.  We were a relatively small part of the overall Console picture.  Even if we had put significantly more resources into the active monitoring of the delivery of the bit that we were funding, I do not believe that would have precluded, prevented or eliminated the risk.  In the other part of its business, Console could have done whatever it was doing.</p> <p>  We interface with many section 39 agencies and are connected with them in respect of only a fraction of their businesses.  We obviously do not have wider regulatory powers or authorities.  As we discussed at the time, there was a particular dynamic there.  This was an organisation that was getting a clean audit certificate from a registered auditor.  If we were ever to conclude that we could not rely on such audit processes we would have a fundamental problem.  However good we are at monitoring the use of our resources, it would not preclude the type of thing that happened in the other part of that organisation's business.  I do not believe that the HSE can get into the business of seeking to regulate beyond what it is buying.  Our focus is clearly on ensuring systematically that we are getting the service that we are paying for to the standard we expect and at a reasonable cost in those agencies with which we have a relatively small relationship in the context of their total size.  That is why we have tended to have a tapered approach where we focus more attention on those that are public bodies, or section 38s, and those with who we have a substantial financial relationship, which is likely to be greater than 50% of their activity or represents a significant sum of public money beyond a certain threshold.  We have a tiered approach.  </p> <p>  We have established the central compliance unit, which has 12 staff members but our focus now is on ensuring that each of our nine community health organisations, CHOs, has developed within itself the effective capacity to monitor the grant agreements for which it is responsible.  We do not believe, given the wide distribution of entities that we fund, that this is sensibly done at central level.  It obviously must be done to central standard and with central oversight, but it must be done on the ground.  If we are funding the project to which the Deputy referred, it will have a relationship with the relevant community health organisation and no one at the centre will have particular visibility of that.  It is really about developing capacity. </p> <p>  The CHO is a relatively new structure and needs capacity in a number of areas, of which this is one.  In conjunction with the chief officers of those CHOs, we are currently carrying out a fairly intensive discussion to establish what they need to do their jobs most effectively and then we will have to go into the business of providing that to them.  </p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany spoke of adding an extra 45 staff into the procurement department.  That does take a little time in that we have to secure both the cash, the headroom and the prioritisation in order to do it.  We are doing that against a background of competing priorities for staffing and so on.  </p></speech>

However, if we were to devote the requisite level of resources to go through compliance processes and audits with organisations about aspects of their business to which we are not connected, we would be diverting resources away from securing our resources in section 38 organisations and in organisations that we have a more material relationship with.</p></speech>

The legislation is quite clear and differential.  Section 38 organisations are providing services for and on behalf of the HSE.  In the case of section 39 organisations, we are making a contribution towards services they are providing that are aligned with our own objectives and goals.  That does not mean that we are not interested in their governance, as the director general has said, particularly in the larger agencies.  However, we are not the Charities Regulator.  We are not the regulator of the sector.  As one goes down the scale of the smaller organisations, to which we may still be giving substantial amounts of money as &euro;200,000 is a substantial sum for most people, for us to get involved in effectively inspecting and auditing some of those is simply not practical.  Several of the practices that have been reported in the media will not show up on a review of a set of accounts.  It may or may not show up in an audit.  In some cases they should show up.  They may not show up even if there is the normal level of performance meetings with such an organisation per yer.  At &euro;200,000 per year, our guideline requires one to three meetings per year.  One will not necessarily pick up on the type of issues that have become systemic.  That is why we have written to all the chairs of the boards to state that without wanting it to appear as though we are not taking responsibility for that for which we are responsible, the fundamental responsibility for ensuring there is good governance inside each of those 2,000 organisations lies with the boards of those organisations.  They are the people who control it, not the HSE.  That is without trying to avoid anything for which we are responsible.</p></speech>

An aspect I want to touch on is those directly employed in home help.  The numbers there have gone from 3,700 in 2014 to just 3,100 last year, which is a 14% reduction.  One of the biggest issues coming across our desks relates to the quandary of people being approved for home care packages but not having the staff available to implement what was approved.  Can the HSE expand on where the issue is with the reduction of the staff who are directly employed in home help?</p></speech>

We fund a large amount of home help provision through section 39 providers which do not appear in our own staff census numbers.  We also fund the provision of home help through private for-profit or not-for-profit organisations.  We are spending more money now than we were in the past on home help.  If I am right, we are providing 10.5 million hours of home help albeit to 49,000 people.  If one works that out, it is an average of four hours per week.  That is not sufficient to meet the entire need and demand out there but it is the total level of resources that is available.  There are issues in terms of getting sufficient staff numbers to provide hours.  It is a combination of having reached the resource capacity or, where we have resources, a lack of available staff.  We will provide directly or through a private actor.</p></speech>

It funds these services to ensure they are part of the health service.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the Supplementary Estimate in 2015 for disability services.  Last week in my constituency of Meath the issue of adult disability services was a very prominent matter.  It was covered extensively by the local media.  The issues were location and transport funded by the HSE.  The transport aspect was the toughest for the parents of the young adults involved.  In some cases, young adults were on a bus for over an hour and three quarters during a journey which should only take 15 minutes.  That was because of the route being taken.  That was provided by a particular service provider who the HSE was funding.  In the context of internal reviews of what the HSE is getting for its money, it is clearly unacceptable that young adults with intellectual disabilities are spending that long on a bus.  They would be in Wexford more quickly than they were getting home.  These are particularly vulnerable people.</p></speech>

Where there is a settlement, the hospital expects to get paid.  That is provided for under legislation.  It is &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million.  If we add in the voluntaries which are not in our accounts, it is perhaps twice that for a full year.  As such, it is a relatively small part of the overall income for hospitals.</p></speech>

An issue that pops up consistently is where the fire service co-ordinates with the paramedic service.  This is ambulance dispatch units and their interaction with local fire services.  In terms of the policy across the board, it seems to be a particular problem in my own county where there is a lack of synergy between agencies where ambulance dispatch units liaise with the fire service in road traffic collisions.  There are instances in other counties where there is a good synergy.  Can the HSE explain the problems relating to that?</p></speech>

I accept what the Deputy says but I do not have operational knowledge of it.  Typically, all calls to the National Ambulance Service are routed through our national emergency operations centre and that centre liaises with the relevant control centre of each fire service.  As Deputy Cassells is telling me there is an issue in Meath, I will certainly take that away.  My experience generally is that the interface is good.  Clearly, there is room for improvement in Meath and we will take that on board.</p></speech>

I ask for that to be followed up because it is a recurring issue.  Fire services in Meath have actually won international competitions.  My own home town hosted an international competition only two weeks ago for road traffic collision teams.  However, the synergy does not exist between the paramedics and fire services in Meath, which has been a particular source of irritation for the fire services.</p></speech>

I have a final question on the capital side.  I noticed in the report that there were references to the Letterkenny situation, namely, how much was paid in insurance and the deficit that was left as a result.  This is going somewhere else in terms of the broader capital plan.  How will the deficit that was left be funded and what is its impact on other aspects of the capital plan?</p></speech>

That is in part because we are rebuilding as new and in some cases better and expanded.  As such, there will be a draw and it will be part of the overall prioritisation within the capital plan.  If we spend it there rather than somewhere else, it will not be available for other aspects of the capital plan.</p></speech>

My particular interest in this regards the shelving or otherwise of the proposed regional hospital in Navan.  In 2011, Deputy Regina Doherty, Minister for Employment and Social Protection as of last night, and Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Damien English extensively highlighted that this would be built within five years.  This open pledge was made on the front pages of newspapers in my constituency a week before a general election in 2011.  That is a statement by them, I do not expect Mr. Mulvany to comment on that.  In the context of that very public pledge, however, I ask Mr. Mulvany if there was ever any attempt to ascertain the particular resources available to the HSE to implement such a pledge.</p></speech>

There have never been resources available within the overall capital plan nor a specific policy decision to build a hospital there, nor the working out of the possible implications that would have for other hospitals in the region.  The reason that hospital was first mooted was as an all-encompassing level 3 or level 4 hospital for what was at the time covered by five hospitals in the north-east region.  There are things that come with having a single large hospital that are not yet visible in policy and certainly not funded in a region such as that, which would have implications for the other hospitals.  Those issues have never been fully resolved.  I will not comment on the Deputy's-----</p></speech>

I have asked parliamentary questions about this.  Is there any plan whatever for a regional hospital or is it dead, given first, the reconfiguration and second, what Mr. Mulvany has said about there not having been any funding set aside for it?</p></speech>

I may not be aware of it.  I am aware that Navan hospital is in a different hospital group.  The hospital groups are largely contained in a report which we would consider to be Government policy.  Navan sits in the Ireland East group and the other hospitals in what was the north east are in the RCSI group.  Whether that mitigates against a hospital in the future or not, I cannot tell.</p></speech>

Given that, could I get a note on the potential for the development of the five acres beside Our Lady's Hospital in Navan which the HSE acquired from Meath County Council some 16 years ago?  It now lies idle.  It is derelict and unsightly.  It is an extensive site in the middle of a town.  The HSE purchased it in 2001, and has owned it for 16 years.

I have tabled parliamentary questions on a case involving physiotherapy services.  I want the witnesses to respond specifically and generally to the example I will give.  A person retired from or left a physiotherapy post in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua i gCro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta.  We received a series of letters indicating the post would be filled in due course.  Subsequently, either last week or the week before last, we were informed the matter was with the national office in Dublin.  The national office then decided the post would not be filled and people from Connemara could travel to Galway city for physiotherapy if they were in the priority 1 category.  We could forget about patients in priorities 2, 3 and 4, however.  Does the HSE stand over this decision involving a vital physiotherapy post in the heart of the Gaeltacht?  I am informed that when a post remains vacant, as in this case, it is eliminated because it has not been filled.</p></speech>

There is a general requirement for any organisation in the public service to look at its overall posts.  I am not talking about the specific post raised by the Deputy.  We said we would give the Deputy a specific answer to her specific question.  There is a general requirement on us, on behalf of the public, to use the resources and to look at posts and reprioritise posts from time to time.  That always works out well and is positively received by whoever we reprioritise a post in favour of and never by those who we reprioritse it against.

Mr. O'Brien might bear that in mind when he answers it in written form.  I have pursued this issue through correspondence and parliamentary questions since last August.  That is that.</p> <p>  I will return to whether the health service has adequate funding and the collateral damage of having people on trolleys and long waiting lists.  I left this room to take a telephone call, which is very unusual for me.  The details of the call were that virtually for the fourth week in a row, a person has been refused admission to the psychiatric unit in Galway, threatening serious harm to himself or herself - I will not identify the person.  This is the fourth week in a row that patients - it has been a different person each week - has been refused admission.  Again, I am not asking the witnesses to comment on a specific person.  This is, however, an ongoing saga in the psychiatric unit in Galway, which is not fit for purpose and is refusing seriously ill people admission.</p> <p>  I started off my contribution by making a point with which I will also finish.  How can Mr. O'Brien stand over a health service with its budget which is literally turning people in crisis in Galway city away from the door?  Has this matter been brought to his attention in recent weeks?  Have urgent representations been made to him?  Is he aware that the Mental Health Commission has taken the unusual step of going back into the hospital following its annual visit? </p></speech>

First, health care is one of the most emotive issues for people.  We are public representatives and we deal with people every day, and I am sure Mr. O'Brien respects that.  Issues relating to mental health services capacity, supporting children with disabilities, patients lying on hospital trolleys and people waiting longer than 18 months for an outpatient appointment are real.  They are not imagined, so when we put questions that are robust, it is because people expect us to hold those who are responsible for the provision of health care to account.  They expect us to do that.  If we do not do that, we are not doing our job.  The robustness of our questions, while it might frustrate Mr. O'Brien at times, is driven by the fact that people expect it.  Unfortunately, as Mr. O'Brien has said himself, the health service is not perfect.  There are people who are not getting the quality of care they need because of systemic problems in the health system.  I am just offering that up as an observation and I hope Mr. O'Brien can accept it as it is intended.</p> <p>  I will now move to the issue of supporting children with disabilities and early intervention.  Again, I gave Mr. O'Brien prior notice that I was going to raise this and a number of other issues.  I have to give Mr. O'Brien a local example because that is what I am familiar with, but it helps to frame the issue in a national context.  There are two different levels to the service provision for children with disabilities.  Early intervention is for those from birth to six years and then there is the service for six to 18 year olds.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There are difficulties in recruitment.  I had a meeting recently, as did other Oireachtas Members, with the HSE's disability team in Waterford which covers both Waterford and Wexford.  The team told me there are not enough training places for child psychologists.  The training places are provided by Trinity College, UCD and UCC in the main.  There are 50 placements which are all full every year, and that is where one of the problems lies.</p><p>What action does the HSE take and what interaction is there between it and education or training providers to make sure that when these problems arise and it finds that it cannot recruit or that there are not enough places, there are more placements to make sure the medium to long-term solution is in place?  Will Mr. O'Brien address that issue first?</p></speech>

It seeks to match our future requirements for various health care professionals with access to programmes developed in the education sector.  It is slightly different for medical professionals.  We do this on a direct basis with the training scheme providers.  For others, largely developed through the third level education sector, allied health professionals and so on, it is the Department of Health that takes the lead.</p></speech>

It would have some relationship with autism but not exclusively.</p></speech>

There is a two-pronged approach.  For our part, we have initiated an operational review to look at how well, or otherwise, we are using our resources.  For its part, the Department of Health, on behalf of the Minister for Health who was recently reappointed, has set up a policy review.  The two reviews will dovetail in a process designed particularly to improve early diagnosis and access to relevant interventional and supportive therapies, recognising that we have a national deficit in that area.</p></speech>

I have been told by Mr. O'Brien's staff that those aged between zero and six years are waiting on average for 18 months to see an occupational therapist and that those aged between six and 18 years are waiting three years.  The number of dietician posts is 0.5 in Waterford and Wexford.  There is a shortage of physiotherapists.  I am being told that children aged from zero to six years in need of early intervention are simply not receiving the services they should be receiving in parts of the country because of capacity problems.  There are some services for those aged between 16 and 18 years that are not being provided at all.  What I am trying to figure out is if this is an ongoing problem in terms of recruitment, how it is not being addressed.  It has been ongoing for years.  I have been hearing about these problems for years and I am trying to figure out what funding solutions are being put in place and what policy solutions are in place to deal with them.</p></speech>

For example, there are no baseline staff numbers based on need; therefore, there is no stipulation that we need X number of child psychologists per X number of children in need.  It is all based on existing staff posts, which is why we have a problem in some parts of the country.  In Waterford there are 2.6 child psychologist posts.  Is that part of the problem?  The professionals are telling me that, in other areas of the mental health service, this is not the case and that the numbers are based on baseline need.  In these areas, however, it is not.</p></speech>

If we were to add the totality of need and supply nationally, talking about the match between needs and supply, we would note that they would not match.  In addition, there would be variable disparities in terms of how big the mismatch would be in different parts of the country, but I do not believe it is the case that there is anywhere which is over-resourced and other places which are under-resourced.  Universally, it is a story of under-provision.  I do not think we find ourselves on any point with a different analysis in that respect.</p> <p>  As in the case of the national cancer strategy and A Vision for Change, one needs an operational approach and a public policy position agreed to by the Government, the Oireachtas and so on that is evidence based, leads to a clear policy, matched either by reprioritised funding or new funding and which can then be operationalised over a given period in the health service.  Where we have done this, we have seen significant improvements.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned an 18-month wait.  In order that we are clear that we are on the same page, let me state that when I became director general, we were measuring them out to four years.  I am very keenly aware of the importance of improving the way the health service performs.  That is the reason I am doing the job.  I do not have a problem with robust questions.

There were approximately 210 posts nationally and the calculations were made based on the level of provision nationally.  I have a very strong memory of it because, of the 210 posts - I think it was 210 - nearly 60 were in my area, which demonstrates that an area which is growing will be catching up.  It is not very surprising that that is the profile.  Are all of the posts permanent?  Were they filled?  Are there associated vacancies?  Has the process been repeated?</p></speech>

We do take an adaptive approach.  Sometimes, believe it or not, the offer of a permanent contract can scare somebody off.  If they will only accept - I know it is bizarre - what they regard as a temporary contract, that is what they get, but the post itself is permanent.  My understanding is that those posts were all initially filled and there will have been turnover.  They are part of the core estate.  We can check that.</p></speech>

I had a number of other questions I wanted to ask.</p> <p>  Obviously, the history of the health boards goes back to the mid-19th century.  Change has been incremental.  There still appears to be a great deal of fragmentation in the HSE.  It can be quite difficult to find services or even figure out funding.  I recently put a question to every Department about the hiring of private investigators - it does not matter that that was the subject.  It is a good way of testing to see how effective it is.  The one organisation that has been most difficult to get responses back from has been the HSE.  I first tabled the question in April.  Following email exchanges, we narrowed down the question.  We were told there were seven different ledgers.  We narrowed it down again and now, in mid-June, we have gone back with another question.  That is my experience of how hard it is to find information.  There is certainly a dysfunction in being able to retrieve information, including financial information, because this related to a payment.  I know it is necessary to invest in administrative systems in order to save time, etc.  Using this as an example, what needs to change to pull that together?  What is happening?  What is the investment?</p></speech>

In 2003, Professor Niamh Brennan published her report, known as the Brennan report.  It was one of two reports that gave way to the establishment of the HSE.  The Brennan commission's report was a report into the financial systems essentially.  I suspect the Chairman probably read it carefully at the time.  It pointed out a number of things.  It outlined the financial systems that would be needed to provide effective information flows and financial control in a nationally organised health service.  In parallel with that, the Prospectus report was published.  This was the one that recommended the establishment of the HSE.  At the time, therefore, the Government had something saying, "Here's what a shiny health service can do for you at a national level and here are the systems it would need to make it work."  This was done; this was never done.  When the HSE was created it was, in my opinion, systematically starved of the types of systems it would need in order to be an effective single national organisation.  On the day I came into my job, I had two things on my desk.  One was my warrant as an Accounting Officer.  It told me I was personally responsible for everything financial in the HSE.  The other was a report that told me that the HSE's financial systems were entirely unfit for purpose.  It was a happy day.</p> <p>  The experience the Deputy is having in getting that answer is precisely because there is no single financial system.  On that date, I established the financial reform programme, which I called my single highest non-clinical priority, in order to give the health system a financial management system.  I am glad to tell the committee that we received approval to proceed with it on Tuesday of this week.  What is it called?</p></speech>

Now, it is not a one-year project; it is a multi-year project.  It would mean that, as we go forward, questions like the Deputy's would be simple to answer.  In a sense, what one has in systems terms is the HSE was created out of 54 different organisations.  We still do not have all 54 visible in the organisation but there are about eight or nine visible organisations inside in system terms and that makes it difficult.</p> <p>  If the Deputy finds that frustrating, which I am sure she does, she should imagine how frustrating we find it trying to run that organisation.  It feeds into issues of procurement, it feeds into issues of staffing and it feeds into all sorts of financial management-----</p></speech>

Somebody asked Mr. O'Brien about his salary and he said it is on the public record.  I only use that as a benchmark against some of the issues regarding St. John of Gods.  The same kinds of things arose with Rehab.  Newspaper articles have outlined some salaries, including one in the region of &euro;240,000 to &euro;249,000.  Four other people have salaries of &euro;200,000 to &euro;239,000.</p><p>That exceeds Mr. O'Brien's own salary.  As a benchmark from a subset organisation then, those salaries seem to be very high indeed.  As this is a section 38 organisation, there are pension liabilities.  There have been increases but I do not know if these increases concern only salaries or also pensions.  Are there or could there be unknown pension liabilities as a consequence of the actions of St. John of God's?</p></speech>

I know that this is the Public Accounts Committee but funding and service provision are opposite sides of the same coin.  From newspaper reports and from talking to recipients of the service, there is a very definite feeling that the services are on a knife edge. There is a Catch-22 situation in that the HSE is trying to regularise issues in this particular organisation.  In one particular case some of the donors are looking for their money back, which they did not intend to be used in the way it was.  Whether that can happen is not for us to decide but I am just making the point.  The people about whom I am most concerned are the sometimes very elderly parents of St. John of God's service recipients.  Can we be absolutely sure that while this issue is being considered there will not be any loss of services to the people who need them?  This would be as a result of St. John of God's being in difficulty because they are finding it hard to fundraise.  I am really not concerned about the service provider.  I am concerned about the service recipient here.  I really have serious concerns about this.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, however, our aim in this is to address the issues in a way that ensures the continuation of those services.  We are very much aware that a lot of people depend on, and some have very high regard for, the services they get from St. John of God's, and that there are a lot of staff is St. John of God's who do a very good job.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues and our aim is to address them.  There are governance issues within St. John of God's in our view, though they have their own perspective on this.  There is the outcome of the internal audit report around public pay policy.  St. John of God's also has service issues, difficulties it is addressing with HIQA, the regulator.  It has submitted an improvement plan to HIQA and that is being monitored.  Furthermore, it has financial issues.  Again, we disagree with St. John of God's when it comes to the figure they view as their deficit or under-funding.  We are working through a process with them around that and we intend to do some forensic accounting work into this matter.  We do not accept the level of deficit or under-funding that they talk about.  Our longer-term plan acknowledges the need to invest further in their services, but in the new type of services, the decongregated services that we want, and not just in the current services.  </p></speech>

We had a service provider say that it was under-funded for a very vulnerable person who ultimately ended up getting a judgment in the High Court.  The priority is not the service provider, it is the service user.  There is a stark contrast between the service being provided by that particular service provider to some people and to others and I know of some cases very close to me.  In Stewarts Hospital for example, there are more and better services, there is transport provision and there are after-school facilities.  Everything like that in St. John of God's always costs extra money.  Is the HSE withholding any money as a consequence of the assessment?</p></speech>

We have a standard provision for trying to bring about the earlier and appropriate signing of our service level agreements.  Starting with the larger agencies, this means that if a service level agreement has not been signed by the end of February we start to hold 20% of the cash from that organisation.  I know that at least one derogation or extension to that was sought by and approved for St. John of God's but I do not know where they are with this today.  I repeat that our aim is to work through the various issues with St. John of God's and to maintain and help improve the services overall.  We know that means greater investment over time.  We cannot simply respond, however, to every service provider that says that it needs more money.  There has to be a process that we go through.  I do not know whether a direct comparison between the services and the funding of St. John of God's and Stewarts Hospital, for example, is fair and reasonable.  Our disability division, however, has done and is doing a lot of work to try to get much closer to what are the underlying costs and investments necessary to support better quality services.</p></speech>

When this top-up issue first emerged, the organisation that was front and centre was the Central Remedial Clinic.  We took some extraordinary action on that entity, it went through the wars and it has now emerged from them.  At no point were the services to its clients ever curtailed, downgraded or jeopardised.  It is now in the position where it has won some kind of an award for the quality of its governance processes at board level.  We will see this through.  We will do so in the interests of the clients, the service users and their families.  This is going to be a robust engagement because it has to be.</p></speech>

We are not saying that that gave St. John of God's a huge amount of money for discretionary spend but what we are saying is that we have demonstrated that we are willing to support existing services to give them time to make the necessary changes.  The investment has to be to improve services for the clients, however, and it is only the clients that we are concerned about.</p></speech>

The amount of money that we pay to those hospitals is in that figure.

We put a lot of money into reducing the number of patients whose discharge had been delayed and that was predominantly, although not exclusively, a Dublin problem.  As a result of this effort, this year for the first time the large model-four hospitals, which in Dublin are the five big voluntaries, have seen a significant improvement in their trolley situation whereas the model-three hospitals, some of those with which members might be more familiar and which tend to be smaller, did not have that problem, did not get the benefit of it and, relatively speaking, tended to look worse.  What happens on trolleys is not particularly a function of what goes on in the hospital.  It is more a function of what goes on in the community around it.</p></speech>

First of all, the 80% target, according to a demand capacity review called Lightfoot, which we published, is largely used for urban populations such as greater Manchester.  With our population distribution and density, we would need to train north of 50% of our entire population as first responders to consistently meet that target.  The difference between the two years is that the international classification for blue light ambulance calls changed so that more calls go into that delta category than used to be the case.</p></speech>

This is an international ambulance emergency dispatch coding system.  These represent the great majority of calls where we see ambulances arriving at high speed with blue lights or emergency response vehicles.  Due to an international change in classification slightly more calls now go into that category than used to be the case.  This is a greater number of calls with roughly the same number of ambulances, therefore there has been a negative impact on the percentage compliance with that target.</p></speech>

What we do now is that, every year, we have a couple of central tax people who report in to my role.  We now do a targeted review, which is a continuation of the risk-based review, where we pick a sample every year and we go through all of the major items where we might consider that we had seen risks before.  We work with our colleagues across the HSE and with the Revenue and we do our own internal audit of a very detailed sample.  Over the past couple of years, that work has created a significant amount of visibility across the organisation of the need to be compliant.  It therefore has reduced the level of non-compliance and therefore the level of payments that we would have had to make to the Revenue in the past number of years.  The amount of tax that the HSE actually pays has now reduced very significantly as a result of that work.</p></speech>

I know those who came on got the option of making a contribution to bring their pensions up to speed.  If one was being paid a fraction of the minimum wage when it was introduced, one was in no position to do so.  Even though they worked as home helps, they have only got pension contributions since then.  Very few of them could afford to buy the extra years.  I will ask the Department of Health how many years on from that we are.  The fact that it can still be said here today and that they are not shown on the census of HSE employees shows a begrudging attitude to home helps.  Does Mr. Mulvany see what I am getting at?  They feel it at every step along the way.  If they are not even included in the overall HSE figure, it does not show them the same dignity as everyone else.  Does Mr. Mulvany take my point?</p></speech>

First, the reporting arrangements bear no relation to how we feel about the home helps.  We are very clear that they are valued members of staff.  They are typically not shown, by agreement, in the reporting to the Department.  That may give flexibilities or not, I do not know, but one does not imply any issue with the other.  We value these staff members.</p></speech>

On page 9, the total staff number is given as 107,000.  They are excluded from the chart on page 9.  They are not even included in the early part of the accounts.  Mr. Mulvany understands what I am saying.  I am sorry, I am covering a few points here.  The reason I linked that to the long-term residential care is that the latter is obviously increasing and the home help figure is decreasing.</p> <p>  Regarding page 163, the witnesses may be able to clarify a myth.  At the bottom of that page, there is a summary analysis of pay costs.  The total HSE pay costs for 2016 are listed as &euro;4.833 billion and then there is agency pay of &euro;277 million, together totalling &euro;5.11 billion.  That agency figures represents less than 5% of the total HSE bill.</p></speech>

I hear much about agency staffing costs, in terms of hospitals and so on.  I have heard this from the home helps.  They say that they are being shoved aside and that agency staff are being brought in to do the home help.  That does happen.  One hears about the costs to hospitals.  I am sure it is said at every forum throughout the country.  We hear about the cost of hiring agency nurses.  We hear about the cost of agency staff every day of the week.  I know it is &euro;277 million, but it is only 5% of the payroll bill.  From listening to the public commentary, one would almost believe it is 30% of the payroll.

I have two issues.  One is home help, which I have touched on.  My colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, would have received the detailed letter from Mr. Ray Mitchell in the past few days.  We asked for the home helps by region per month in 2016 and for the figures available for 2017, and we got the figures for January and February of 2017.  We just received it last week.  That showed that in the two-month period of January and February of 2017, as compared to January and February 2016, there was a reduction of 50,019 home help hours nationally.  Laois-Offaly saw a reduction of 15,383 hours.  Thirty per cent of the entire cut happened in that region.  I ask Mr. Mulvany to provide a detailed note on what happened.  I do not expect him to know it here now.  It does not include the home care packages.  It is strictly home help hours.  Mr. Mitchell will be familiar with the letter that was issued to Deputy Billy Kelleher recently.</p> <p>  The last thing I will ask Mr. Mulvany is to send me a detailed note on where we are on the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  At the minute, something is on the Minister's desk on the accident and emergency unit.  We know progress has been made on the maternity unit.  There was major concern regarding the ongoing uncertainty about the accident and emergency.  I ask him to send us a note.  I am not asking Mr. Mulvany to say anything special here now.</p> <p>  I think we are done.  On behalf of myself and my absent colleagues who were here earlier today, I thank all the witnesses from the HSE, the Department of Health and the Comptroller and Auditor General for their attendance and the material supplied today.  As Chairman, I agree to dispose of the 2015 and 2016 accounts and financial statements of the HSE.  We have now disposed of them, but we still expect to receive the information we requested.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Niall Collins.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials.  I thank her for facilitating the taking of Committee Stage of the Bill today as originally scheduled.  It is appreciated.  Before we begin our consideration of the Bill, on behalf of the committee and all of its members, I congratulate her on her new appointment.  We wish her well and look forward to working with her in the future.  I also thank the former Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, for her contribution and work with the committee.  I wish her well in her new role.</p> <p>  I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or left in airplane mode for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings, even when left in silent mode.</p> <p>  No amendments have been tabled to the Bill and it is intended to conclude Committee Stage today.

Its work in the area of jobs, enterprise and innovation is extremely important.  I am very excited to have been appointed Minister and very much look forward to working with the Chairman and members.</p> <p>  Section 2 provides for amendments to section 1 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by amending the definition of "articles of precious metal" to add palladium and mixed precious metals and including a definition to cover hallmarking in assay offices outside of the State, as well as a definition of "forged hallmark".  I intend to submit an amendment on Report Stage to add "mixed articles of a precious and non-precious metal" to the definitions in the Act.  This is being done on foot of requests to include such articles to ensure the precious metal part of such articles will be properly hallmarked and that the non-precious metal will be clearly visible and marked also.  Given the technical nature of the Bill, such an amendment will result in consequential amendments to other sections, including sections 3 and 12.  I inform the committee that these amendments will also be submitted on Report Stage.</p></speech>

My sister is a jeweller.  The Assay Office plays such an important role in the life of the jewellery business.  I have considered the Bill in detail and spoken to members of Retail Jewellers of Ireland, all of whom are very happy with the Bill which is essential.  There are gold and silver and different levels of fineness such as nine-carat and 18-carat gold, but the new metal palladium which is used mostly in men's wedding rings has not yet been recognised in legislation.  Therefore, the Bill is very important and I am supportive of it from a personal point of view.</p></speech>

It is very important, when one buys a piece of jewellery, that a hallmark be on it.  If it is nine-carat gold, the stamp reads "375".  It is only when one works in the business one realises how important it is to be able to authenticate the article being bought or sold.</p></speech>

Regarding the issue of sponsors' marks, provisions had been made in the Bill, in section 10(a)(ii), to transfer the approval of sponsors' marks from the assay master to the Company of Goldsmiths, the body under which the Assay Office operates.  Since the Bill was published, it is now considered to be more preferable to delete this provision to ensure there are no possible governance issues and that the Assay Office and the assay master will maintain their independence from the Company of Goldsmiths in this matter.  I will submit an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Our Chairman, Mr. Billy Hannigan, Deputy General Secretary of the PSEU, wished to be here today but, unfortunately, is unable to attend.  I am accompanied by Ms Lily Toner who is one of our members.  She has not been given the opportunity to leave a survivor pension to her wife.<br/><br/>Some of our group are elderly and ill and cannot be here today.  Some of them did not wish to come because they are still fearful of public exposure.  This is the first time that there has been an opportunity such as this for a public discussion on survivor pensions for same-sex couples.<br/><br/>We fully support the provision in head 14 of the Bill that provides a survivor pension for Dr. David Parris and remedies the injustice that he suffered.  We deplore the exclusion from the head of a small group of people who are in the same position as him.  We propose amendments to head 14 that are intended to rectify that anomaly and give practical effect to marriage equality.  The amendments are accompanied by explanatory notes and are dated 12 June.  An earlier version dated 28 May may be disregarded by the committee.  The amendments we propose are restricted in scope and are intended to apply only to this small and diminishing group.  There have been no new members since 1984.<br/><br/>We set out our case in our letters dated 28 May and 8 June that we sent to the committee.  I hope that members have received them.  Our central point is that our situation is unfair and our injustice is the same as that of Dr. Parris.  He was locked out of his pension scheme because he could not marry his husband before he was 60 years of age.  People like Ms Toner are locked out of her pension scheme because she could not marry her wife before her retirement.  It is unclear why a distinction was made in head 14 between people in the same position as Dr. Parris and people in same position as Ms Toner.  It is also difficult to understand why two years after the referendum we are here today.<br/><br/>We believe that the purpose of the constitutional amendment, and the reason that the people voted for it in such numbers, was to give same sex spouses the benefits and comforts that people in opposite sex marriages have always enjoyed, and that Article 41 of the Constitution protects.  The people did not vote for partial equality or to keep special disadvantages for same-sex couples.  Marriage cannot be separated from the benefits that it brings.  Among the advantages of marriage has always been the opportunity to provide for one's family in life as in death.<br/><br/>The contention has been advanced that because, in 1984, some of our members who were in the public service did not accept the option of a survivor's pension for an opposite-sex spouse, acquired after retirement, they were forever disqualified from a survivor pension for a same-sex spouse.  To even propose that shows a deep lack of understanding of the circumstances for gay and lesbian people in that period.<br/><br/>In 1982, when a young man was beaten to death in Fairview Park in Dublin because he was gay, the trial judge said that the crime could not be viewed as serious manslaughter, and the perpetrators received suspended sentences.  Yet it is being suggested that at that time, and in that atmosphere, gay and lesbian people were required to make a final decision about their survivor pensions that would bind them, for the rest of their lives, in a pension scheme that was designed for opposite sex marriages only.<br/><br/>In 1984 the idea that there could be same-sex marriage would have been ludicrous, including to the State itself when it made the offer.  One gay member has told me that he opted to benefit from an imaginary wife because he was fearful that if he did not do so he would be identified as homosexual, by his co-workers and employers, and passed over for promotion.<br/><br/>We have set out in our letter to the committee dated 8 June why we believe that our proposal will not cause unfairness to opposite sex couples, and this point have been raised.  This includes persons who were prohibited from marriage by reason of the lack of divorce.  FOI requests have ascertained that in the 20 years since the introduction of divorce, only one or possibly two persons who were affected by the lack of divorce have made application to any Department to change the option they had made.  Their requests were successful.  The reason for this lack applications is that anyone who was affected by the absence of divorce had ample opportunities, under the pension scheme rules, to obtain a survivor pension.  We have listed the opportunities in our costings paper at footnote (e) for paragraph 6.  <br/><br/>As regards the potential costs if our proposal is accepted, we have already furnished the committee with our calculations.  They demonstrate that the cost would be minimal because of the very limited number of persons who would be eligible to benefit. <br/><br/>The State, it seems, has accepted in head 14,<b></b>that changing an existing pension rule that is deeply unfair to gay and lesbian employees is the right thing to do, and will not be a cause of any general uncertainty.  There is no reason to adopt a different attitude to our proposal to change an unfair rule.<br/><br/>In terms of the amendments, section 73A of head 14 effectively disallows any condition in a pension scheme that requires employees to have married or entered into a civil partnership before a certain age in order to obtain a pension for their spouse or civil partner.  By adding the two words &quot;or retired&quot; to the section our amendment effectively disallows any condition in a pension scheme that requires employees to have married or entered into a civil partnership before retirement in order to obtain a pension for their spouse or civil partner.  The amendment is shorter and clearer than our earlier wording dated 28 May but it has the same effect.  We would not have a problem with an improvement of our wording that might be suggested as long as it achieves the purpose intended by our proposal.  <br/><br/>Yesterday we received a copy of the response given to the committee by the Department of Social Protection.  Having read it I spoke at length to Department officials.</p><p>There was a misunderstanding in that response, based on the mistaken belief that the original pension scheme to which most of our members belong does not have a spouse and dependant benefit.  It does have a spouse and dependant benefit, but it is only available if the member marries before retirement.  Following that clarification, we seem to have reached a common understanding with the Department of Social Protection that head 14 is intended to cover those gay and lesbian people in the original scheme who have retired and who were unable to marry before their retirement.  However, putting that understanding into the Bill, where it will pass through several hands, is another matter.  In order to guard against an unexpected change of mind from any source, it is very important that the committee make a formal recommendation that our group be clearly included in the scope of head 14.  I believe that such a recommendation would ensure its passage.  <br/><br/>Another issue which calls for remedy concerns gay and lesbian public servants who, following the constitutional amendment, have an entitlement to a survivor pension for their same-sex spouse but whose survivor pensions are not being calculated on the entirety of their service.  One of our members, Annette McCabe, whose case featured in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>recently and who is an ordinary level HSE employee, has been told that she is in this position.  Whether this should be remedied by administrative action or by legislation is a matter for the Department, but we strongly urge that it be resolved speedily because of her serious health problems.  She will not benefit from head 14.  I suggest that the committee recommend that where a person has a right to a same-sex survivor pension, it should be based on the whole of her service record.<br/><br/>Pension Equality wants to be made redundant.  We want an Ireland where there is no need to have gay and lesbian campaign groups for any reason.  I hope the committee will make us redundant.  Ms Lily Toner would like to say a few words about her own personal experience of the pension schemes.</p></speech>

I started my career in the telephone exchange as a telephonist.  I am sure the committee will be aware that in 1979 we walked the streets for 19 weeks.  Included in that action was our fight for equal pay.  For all of my working life I have been involved in trade unions.  We fought for everything.  Women were always on the back foot in terms of equality.  Now, I find myself at 64 years of age trying to get justice for women or men of my age who are trying to find equality in all aspects of their working lives and careers, especially in our retirement and, as Mr. Courtney has already said, in our ill health as we get older.  Our time is limited.  We are not going to live forever.  We are all of a certain age.  I just wished to make that point, but it is also about pride.  It is about the pride of having something to leave to someone - to leave something to the spouse with whom one has walked the road.  In many cases over the years that road was walked in secret and in fear.  Justice needs to be served.  I do not wish to take up too much time, but I wish to express the personal feelings around how one lives one's life, how one hides oneself and how one is afraid to come out because of everything - whether real or imagined - that was there.  There is an espoused theory but, even since marriage equality, the theory that was in use is still there and there is still a sense of it.  This committee can show us that it means what it says and that we can be helped.</p></speech>

Just before I go to Mr. Kennedy I want to mention something from the point of view of the committee.  Mr. Courtney added more than was in his statement because we supplied him with the Departmental response and he took it further, which is fine.  Following today's meeting a transcript of what Mr. Courtney said will be sent to the Department for its written response to the committee so that we can consider it in full.  It is important that Mr. Courtney had the response in advance so that he could pursue it further, because when we get to Committee Stage of a Bill it gets technical and detailed and things needs to be precise.  From the committee's point of view, we will get a technical response to the discussion which Mr. Courtney had yesterday.   I thank him for that.</p></speech>

We are very happy to be here.  We have supplied the committee with our opening statement.  I will not go through it word for word, but I will just touch on the main points.  I am the Pensions Regulator and the chief executive of the Pensions Authority.  Mr. Pat O'Sullivan is our actuarial adviser and Mr. Colum Walsh is an assistant principal in our legal unit who has been working on the proposed changes to the pensions legislation on behalf of the authority.</p> <p>  I will start by briefly explaining who we are.  The Pensions Authority was established by the Pensions Act 1990.  This Act is the legislation that governs Irish pensions, so changes proposed in, for example, the current social welfare and pensions Bill, are actually amendments to the Pensions Act.  This Act provided for the establishment of what was then called the Pensions Board.  Our responsibilities include overseeing the operation and application of the Pensions Act, providing information and guidance on pensions to both the public and those involved in the operation of pensions, and to advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters related to pensions generally.  We are therefore responsible for the regulation of trustees of occupational schemes, both for defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.  Therefore, it will be our responsibility to enforce any changes that are made to legislation as a result of this Bill.</p> <p>  Many people do not realise how large Irish pension savings are.  The total assets of Irish pension schemes total approximately &euro;100 billion.  These schemes provide for approximately 415,000 current employees and 105,000 retired members who are currently receiving pensions.  Those numbers do not include pension schemes for civil and public servants, which are run on a pay-as-you-go basis and include approximately 360,000 further current employees.  </p> <p>  The rest of my statement will deal with defined benefit schemes because that is the subject matter of the Bill.  To make it clear, a defined benefit scheme is a scheme that is expressed in terms of people's earnings when they retire.  For example, a person might get one eightieth of his or her annual pay for every year he or she had been working when he or she retires.  A defined contribution scheme is a scheme where an agreed contribution is made by a person and their employer and, at retirement, his or her benefit is the value to which those contributions have built up.  Of the &euro;100 billion in pension schemes in Ireland, approximately &euro;58 billion is in respect of funded defined benefit schemes.  There are currently 628 of these schemes, including approximately 115,000 current employees.  Both the numbers and the membership of funded defined benefit schemes are falling.  The numbers have fallen in the last year.  That figure of 628 was about 666 a year ago.  If we look at 1992, there were 2,560 defined benefit schemes at that stage with approximately 200,000 active members.  Both the numbers of schemes and the membership have been falling pretty continuously over the last 25 years.  It is usual when an employer closes a defined benefit scheme that it would be replaced with a defined contribution scheme.  </p> <p>  To speak briefly about the rules which govern defined benefit schemes, every year defined benefit schemes are required to calculate the value of the benefits they have promised.  They then compare this value to the total assets of the scheme.  If there are not enough assets they have to take certain steps.  All this process is overseen by the Pensions Authority.  This yearly assessment must be done in accordance with a set of rules, and these rules are collectively known and the funding standard.  In many discussions about defined benefit schemes the phrase "the funding standard" will be heard.  That is the set of rules that apply to schemes to ascertain whether they have enough money to meet the promises they have made.  Where a scheme does not have enough assets the most common response is that the scheme trustees and the sponsoring employer will agree a recovery plan to eliminate the shortfall over an agreed period of time.  This recovery plan is known as a funding proposal - another bit of jargon.  That is the name in the legislation.</p><p>Usually a funding proposal involves additional contributions by the employer.  Sometimes it may involve additional member contributions and sometimes the funding proposal may involve cuts to the benefits that have already been promised.  However, those agreements are voluntary under current legislation.  If no agreement can be reached and if a funding proposal cannot be signed off, the scheme may eventually be wound up.  In such a case, if there is a shortfall, there is usually no obligation on the employer to make up the shortfall unless, in rare cases, the rules of the scheme oblige it to do so.  It is important to point out that there have been many cases where employers have paid off some or all of the shortfall, but there is no legal obligation.</p><p> There is a reference in the letter the committee received from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, to a number of changes that the Pensions Authority is considering to the funding standard.  I will briefly discuss those.  There are three changes under consideration at present.  The first is a change to the calculation of the risk reserve within the funding standard.  This will make the funding standard slightly easier on schemes that have taken steps to manage carefully their investment risk.  The second change is a procedural change relating to a funding proposal which is paying off or closing a deficit.  Where there is a funding proposal in place and it goes off track for whatever reason, we are looking at making it simpler for the trustees and employer to agree changes to that funding proposal to restore the scheme.  The third change we are considering is to examine the funding standard calculations.  The funding standard calculations in respect of members who have already retired are based on how much it would cost to pay an insurance company to take over responsibility for paying those pensions.  Questions have been raised about whether the current calculations reflect the actual cost that would arise if that transfer was made.  There are concerns that the current funding standard calculations might overestimate that cost, so we are examining whether we can improve those calculations to make them more accurate.</p><p> I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Maeve McElwee, and we are here to represent the views of IBEC members.  The committee will be aware that IBEC is the country's main business representative organisation.  It has 7,500 members across all sectors of the economy and they employ approximately 70% of the private sector workforce.  Many of our members have an interest in issues relating to defined benefit pensions and the legislation under discussion today.<br/><br/>Our concerns relate specifically to Part 3, the amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, heads 12 and 13, which will have unintended and negative consequences for employers and scheme members.  Head 12 proposes an obligation on employers sponsoring defined benefit pension schemes to give 12 months notice of their intention to cease contributions and head 13 proposes that the Pensions Authority can determine a legally enforceable schedule of contributions that will restore defined benefit schemes which do not satisfy the funding standard.<br/><br/>Most defined benefit pension schemes are established under a trust deed.  The employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to meet certain duties and liabilities on a voluntary basis.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to a pension scheme or to accept liability for any deficits.  We have just heard the comments on that from the Pensions Authority.  This Bill will turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and potentially jeopardise the viability of businesses which are unable to absorb this extra cost.  IBEC shares the Government&rsquo;s ambition to protect scheme members, to encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and to prevent employers who will not pay, as opposed to those who cannot pay, from walking away from the schemes they sponsor.  However, we also recognise that it can be very difficult to put forward legislative proposals which will have the desired effects without any negative implications.  This area of pensions is quite technical and the issues are not amenable to easy solutions.  While it may seem that a few simple changes could provide scheme members with the level of security they want, the unintended consequences can be damaging and far-reaching.<br/><br/>IBEC is particularly concerned that the provisions, first, could be unfair on employers who have voluntarily set up defined benefit schemes and invested significant resources over time to maintain them.  The previously voluntary commitments under these schemes would become mandatory, whereas there would be no corresponding obligation on employers who had set up defined contribution schemes or who had no pension schemes.<br/><br/>Second, we believe the provisions would destabilise ongoing efforts of many employers and trustees to support and deliver on the pension promise made to scheme members.<b></b>The experience of recent years has demonstrated that this process is best managed through discussion and negotiation between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement on the steps required to secure scheme viability.  These steps may include a mix of measures such as increased employer and member contributions, which have been commonplace, longer working and changed benefits.  This painstaking process of supporting schemes to gradually move to a more appropriate funding level may not attract the same media attention as a small number of high profile scheme closures.  However, it is more likely to secure sustainable member benefits than additional regulation.<br/><br/>Third, we believe the provisions would impose an extra funding burden on the employer.  While the proposals might appear to improve scheme security, in many cases the pension liabilities and the investment risk assumed would be too big for a company to support.  It could jeopardise the viability of the business and the jobs of those employed.  There are also a small number of significant companies sponsoring schemes without a balance of cost provision.  This means that the employer contribution is fixed under the scheme rules.  This legislation would now mean that those companies would have to assume large pension liabilities onto their balance sheets.  This could have significant commercial and financial implications for those organisations.<br/><br/>Further, we believe the provisions will accelerate the closure of defined benefit schemes in the private sector.  The experience in the UK is that the introduction of &quot;debt-on-employers&quot; in 2005 has been widely blamed for the quickening pace of closure of the UK&rsquo;s 6,000 remaining private sector defined benefit schemes.  The director of a leading academic think-tank has said:</p><blockquote>Despite the major increase in pension rules over the last 10 years, aimed at protecting the consumer and encouraging better retirement saving, there has been a significant drop in the membership of defined-benefit pension schemes, with many people on course for inadequate incomes in retirement.  Our once brilliant, flexible, final salary schemes have been killed off by over-regulation.  We will all live to regret this.</blockquote> <p>We fear a similar situation playing out in Ireland.<br/><br/>Finally, we believe the provisions will result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger members.  In some cases preventing an insolvent scheme from winding up can result in its ongoing deterioration before inevitable closure, with older members using up the assets before younger members retire.  IBEC therefore believes that the result of the changes proposed in this Bill, which have been designed to protect the position of defined benefit pension members, would deliver the opposite of that.  The Pensions Authority has spoken about its proposals to allow for some additional flexibility for defined benefit schemes and to tackle some difficulties with the current operation of the minimum funding standard.  Given that this in many cases is the root cause of the difficulties encountered by the schemes, the proposal should be given time for implementation before going further down the legislative route.<br/><br/>We urge committee members to recommend that the flawed provisions we have mentioned be removed from the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.</p></speech>

The heads of the Bill have been published and there is a clear intention.  Is there a timeliness to this being done?  In other words, are there negative consequences from the Bill now that what is going to be done on defined benefit pensions has been flagged?</p><p> IBEC set out a case on moving from a voluntary to a mandatory scheme.  Has any financial analysis been carried out in respect of the additional cost to the providers of those schemes, that is, the companies IBEC represents?   Does Mr. Kennedy have an indication of what that might mean in financial terms?  I ask him to address those questions and I will then call colleagues for questions.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any analysis of the cost.  It has to be said that in the annual financial accounts of most, but not all, employers that have a defined benefit scheme, this is reflected in their balance sheets.  There are exceptions to that.  Those are accounting rules and not related to the Pensions Act or Irish statutory rules.  I am not aware of such an analysis, nor were we asked to undertake one.</p></speech>

Would that have been prudent and advisable?</p></speech>

We have statistics for the current financial situation of defined benefit schemes.  Of the 628 schemes to which I referred in my opening statement, of those schemes that have shortfalls, the total amount is approximately &euro;3.5 billion.  Some schemes are in surplus and others are in deficit.  The total amount involved in respect of those in deficit is in the region of &euro;3.5 billion.  Clearly, those deficits are specific to particular employers.  It is also important to say that those figures change over time.  In some of those schemes, things may work out better than was anticipated and the current deficit will turn out to partially heal itself through, for example, investment returns being better than expected or something of that nature.  On the other hand, some of those deficits may get worse or schemes that are currently in surplus may fall into deficit.  The current amount is about &euro;3.5 billion.  We have not carried out any company-specific analysis on whether one employer could afford the money involved while another could not because the Pensions Authority would not have the expertise to undertake that kind of analysis.</p></speech>

I am looking at the process in terms of where we are going.  Mr. Kennedy indicated there is a deficit totalling &euro;3.5 billion.  The system is changing from voluntary to mandatory schemes.

By that, I mean schemes which are not planned to close.  The legislation will not require money to be paid any sooner.  As the Chairman understands, an employer does not currently have an obligation to pay.  The legislation will mean that they will in the future.  Many employers pay shortfalls through funding proposals, as I explained.  The Bill will change things.  In the case of any schemes that wind up with deficits in the short term, employers will be obliged to pay those deficits.  That payment, depending on how the mechanism works out, may be a lump sum or it may take the form of payments spread over a number of years.  Under the new legislation, employers will be liable for such deficits and forced to make a contribution.  Under existing legislation, if that happens, employers have no legal liability although they may or may not choose to pay.</p></speech>

We have seen the impact of the winding down of many defined benefit schemes on workers who have paid into them all of their working lives and have been unfairly left out on a limb.  Some major and highly profitable businesses have wound down their defined benefit schemes.  That is why this Bill is so important.  Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a Bill to make it illegal for profitable companies to wind down their defined benefit schemes.  I will touch on some of those points.</p> <p>  I refer to the statement from Pension Equality.  I welcome the group.  When someone speaks from the heart and lays the facts before a committee, it is very powerful.  It is hard to believe that it has been two years since the passing of the marriage equality referendum, which was very important day for the State.  A serious anomaly has been left in place.  If we are serious about equality, we need to recognise that it is more than a word.  Rather, it involves action and everything which flows from that.  This is something that needs to be addressed irrespective of the concerns of the Pensions Authority and whether it affects one person, 100 people or 2 million.  It is fundamentally about equality.  Mr. Kennedy referred to the low numbers of people involved.  As I said, irrespective of whether it is one person or 1,000 people, equality is equality.  Out of interest, does the Pensions Authority know the numbers involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.1503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Courtney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017061500002#F01200"><p>We have estimated the number of people involved at about 20.  We did a detailed costing based on FOI requests, mainly to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Most of those affected by this particular anomaly are public servants - there are 300,000 public servants - and one or two are in private schemes.  It tends to be a public service problem.  I would be seriously surprised if any more than 20 people are affected because it involves older people and their opportunity to marry immediately after the referendum.  Not that many people are affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.1504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017061500002#F01300"><p>I thank Mr. Courtney.  That says it all.  The issue affects 20 people.  The financial implications of bringing into effect the real meaning of equality would be very small.  While we are dealing with heads of the Bill and it is to be hoped that the issues the witnesses outlined will be addressed once it is published.  If not, it is incumbent on members of this committee to bring forward amendments.  I will consider doing so.</p><p>We wait with great anticipation for the actual Bill to be published.  Again, I thank the delegation for attending.</p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a pensions Bill against a backdrop where defined benefit schemes in many large companies - most recently that in Irish Life, which had a large surplus and was never in deficit - are being wound down and replaced with defined contribution schemes.  Essentially, it is robbing the employees who have paid into these schemes.  The companies in question, such as Independent News and Media, INM, and others, are highly profitable.  The Pensions Authority pointed out how there are now 628 defined benefit schemes compared to 2,560 in 1992.  We can see the direction in which this is going.  What is contained in the proposed Bill will move it from voluntary to mandatory.  Should it not be made illegal for profitable companies which are not in deficit to be able to wind down their defined benefit schemes?  Fundamentally, the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill would stop such companies from winding down their schemes.  I appreciate that the Pensions Authority has only been recently established.  Has it looked at any measures to tackle the winding down of defined benefit schemes?  Has IBEC examined the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation?  If so, will it comment on it?  IBEC is critical of what is being proposed but it has not put forward any tangible alternatives in respect of defined benefit schemes.  Has it any suggestions to stop these schemes being wound down?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-15a.1506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017061500002#G00200"><p>I am not an expert on pensions and I find them difficult.  I worked in An Post before I was elected and our own pension scheme was in trouble several years ago.  It was hard to understand the way it was run.  To my mind, defined benefit schemes were a significant step forward in the 1980s and 1990s from the point of view of the employer and the employee.  They were socially integrating, making employers responsible for their employees.  It is a terrible indictment that we are witnessing the move from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes.  This takes away responsibility from the employer and puts it on the shoulders of the employees.  Employees have a role to playing in this.  A number of options can be considered, such as an employer increasing liability, the company&rsquo;s assets or employees increasing their liability.</p> <p>  The idea of giving a year's notice of intention to cease contributions is important.  When we consider the cases of INM and Irish Life, it gives people a long time to sit down and work out rather than dealing with it overnight and saying the scheme will implode.  I recall what happened during the ESB dispute about its defined benefit scheme.  The idea behind it was that the ESB wanted to take the liability off its books to sell itself to the markets.  Obviously, that was turned around and the workers maintained the defined benefit scheme.</p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stated "This Bill will turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and potentially jeopardise the viability of businesses which are unable to absorb this extra cost."  Will the other witnesses comment on that?  It is an important point which should be taken on board.  How can the Pensions Authority look at ways of intervening during that period?  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien also made the point that over-regulation kills defined benefit schemes.  During the past ten years, however, they have been killed off by austerity, the crash and the 36% reduction in values.  It is about what the pension funds invest in.  There has to be more of an examination of where the money is invested to protect it.</p> <p>  On the issue of pensions equality raised by Mr. Courtney and Ms Toner, it is straightforward and should be dealt with easily.  We should not be fighting over it.  If we can get clarity in respect of the matter, it would be important to ensure it is also clear in the legislation.  They raised the case of Annette McCabe.  Will they send more information to the committee on that case in order that we might deal with it?</p></speech>

In particular, it involves such a small and well-defined group.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Kennedy indicate whether the proposed amendments are emanating from the Pensions Authority or from the Department?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien heard my questioning of Mr. Kennedy about the cost involved and the impact on business.  I was very taken with Mr. O'Brien's statement to the effect that, "IBEC shares the Government&rsquo;s ambition to protect scheme members, to encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and to prevent employers who will not pay, as opposed to those who cannot pay ...".  My concern relates to how we might bridge that gap in a voluntary system?  I have grave concerns regarding the move from a voluntary to a mandatory system, particularly in light of the fact that the costings associated with such a move and the ability of companies to bear those costs have not been ascertained.  That is significant work which should have been done.  On the other hand, Mr. Fergal O&rsquo;Brien clearly outlined the will-not-pay versus the cannot-pay scenario.  How does he envisage that gap being bridged in the absence of legislation?</p><p>Perhaps we will start with Mr. O'Brien.  He can address the questions posed by colleagues as well as myself.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comments.  His core question relates to what has been happening with defined benefit schemes, why they are in decline and what can be done to stop that.  Deputy Collins also mentioned these issues in her contribution.  The world has changed dramatically over the past ten or 15 years.  A range of financial market issues have put unsustainable pressure on these schemes.  The scale and type of financial commitments businesses are faced with are a multiple of what they would have planned for when they established the schemes.  There have been significant changes in demographics and life expectancy.  There is a mix of other reasons, including regulation, which has made it more difficult for employers to continue to support schemes.  The dynamic and the facts have changed entirely.  This is a global phenomenon; it is not only an Irish phenomenon.  I mentioned the position in the UK and there are similar scenarios internationally.</p> <p>  It is also important to recognise that, from a public sector perspective at policy level, it has been recognised that final salary defined benefit schemes will not be affordable in the future.  That change has been made.  We no longer have a defined benefit final salary scheme for entrants into the public sector.  Even at the level of the State, therefore, the unsustainability of final salary defined benefit schemes has been recognised and, unfortunately, they are in decline for a range of reasons.  They have become unsustainable for the State and individual businesses.  However, many employers want to sustain such schemes and we should do everything we can to support them and not to disadvantage them.  The core of our concerns about the proposed legislation is that it is patently unfair to a particular subset of businesses that have voluntarily entered into a scheme commitment with employees to make that mandatory.  They enter into the arrangement on that basis.  This is very much a retrospective change to a small subset of employers that, working with their employees, are trying to provide the best retirement option and trying to navigate that in a complex and changing world in the management of liabilities of defined benefit schemes.  Other employers have defined contribution schemes and they will not be affected, while many employers have no schemes at all, which is a much broader policy issue.  However, for employers that have been trying to support their employees for their retirement in the best possible way, the State will retrospectively impose additional regulation, cost and significant risk into those businesses.</p> <p>  IBEC wants viable schemes whereby employers want to maintain them and work with their employees to do so.  We want an environment that can support the schemes for as long as possible but we also have to recognise the obligation on us all to protect businesses and employees who are not scheme members, which is increasingly becoming the reality.  The vast majority of defined benefit schemes are closed to new membership.  I do not know what are the numbers but only a small number of schemes are open to new members.  There is an obligation on these businesses to their deferred members, retired members, active members and non-scheme member employees, who also have to be taken into account.  That all has to be seen in the round in the context of what have become unsustainable liabilities.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked whether we would support the Sinn F&eacute;in suggestion that the winding down of defined benefit schemes should be made illegal.  We would not support that suggestion, even where companies are profitable.  They could be profitable but there could be a detrimental impact on non-scheme member employees in terms of their future reward prospects and job creation.  The company might survive but it would not be able to provide the same remuneration to non-scheme member employees and would it able to increase employment, expand and invest in the future of the business in a productive and competitive way than if it were able to wind down a scheme that had become unsustainable.  It would be damaging for those businesses, the employees, and, ultimately, the economy.  We do not support the Sinn F&eacute;in suggestion.</p></speech>

I refer to Irish Life because it has one of the more high-profile schemes.  It has a huge surplus and there has been no engagement with employees.  The company is proceeding to wind the scheme down.  Does IBEC support that?</p></speech>

That is what is happening every day and IBEC supports many of those members to do that.

There are significant equality issues in the treatment of staff on defined benefit schemes and those on defined contribution schemes.  It behoves employers, therefore, to engage throughout the process and, in general, that is what happens.  As Mr. O'Brien said, there may be individual exceptions but it is not the generality because obviously what one wants to see a good work environment continuing.  Employers that have engaged with defined benefit pension schemes typically provide benefits over and above what they are required to and, therefore, they are keen to ensure they maintain the good working relationship those schemes have generated for the business.  However, they have to deal with existing financial pressures on them.</p></speech>

We welcome the suggested changes by the Pensions Authority to support businesses that wish to maintain defined benefit schemes.</p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's comments, we are concerned that we do not see evidence of sufficient regulatory assessment of the impact of the proposed legislative changes.  We would like a much more comprehensive assessment of the unintended consequences of the proposed Bill.  It will accelerate a decline in defined benefit schemes.  These are voluntary schemes.  Why would any employer in their right mind continue to be involved in these schemes when they become mandatory and have excessive regulation associated with them?  We are concerned about creating an environment that will make it entirely unsustainable for employers to continue to support defined benefit schemes.</p> <p>  We have made a significant point about a subset of companies and the Pensions Authority has mentioned the accounting standards issues in this context.  That reinforces the need for a proper regulatory impact assessment of the proposed changes because this goes beyond the Pensions Act issues and those the authority will examine.  They require much more of a whole-of-Government consideration of the proposed changes but if they result in substantial additional debt going on to the balance sheets of companies, that will not be without commercial implications and potential risk to them.</p><p>From what we have heard, we do not think the issue has been sufficiently looked at right across Government.  That would concern us.  At its core, we very much concur with the view that we do not see the evidence of a proper impact assessment here of the implications of the proposed changes.</p><p> We may have covered some of the points mentioned by Deputy Joan Collins.  The matter is multifaceted and a range of factors are in play as to why we have seen such a demise in defined benefit schemes.  It is the reality of the State, as an employer, and it has accepted that it is not affordable to maintain final salary defined benefit schemes.  It is the reality of what has happened.  We have seen that in other public sector employment cases internationally as well.  To force a subset of private sector employers to continue with final salary defined benefit schemes would be absolutely unfair.</p><p> The Chairman asked about supporting companies that want to continue to fund defined benefit schemes and the matter of those who cannot pay versus those who will not pay.  We continue to urge that regulation and funding standards be made as sensible and as appropriate as possible for the realities of the market we now have, particularly with regard to the measuring liabilities.  It is the best way to try to maintain sustainability of the defined benefit schemes we have.  We are happy to engage on further legislative suggestions around company obligations but we want them to be properly assessed in advance in terms of a potential impact.  We are not bringing further solutions to the committee today.</p></speech>

The negative impact would be seen across a whole sector, which is a problem when it is a voluntary rather than mandatory process.  It is a core issue as to how we deal with those companies who have not played ball or been co-operative; they will not pay rather than cannot pay.  In a voluntary capacity, that is an out for them.  These are the competing issues.</p></speech>

We have a particular subset of companies who have gone well beyond their statutory obligations to support their employees.  We now see that subset of companies being disadvantaged and losing very significant competitive advantage to a company with a defined contribution scheme or a company with no scheme at all.</p></speech>

It came from the Department and the Minister and it did not originate from the Pensions Authority.</p> <p>  Another question was what we have done in the Pensions Authority to address the reduction of defined benefit numbers over 25 years.  To be clear, the role of the Pensions Authority is to ensure the Pensions Act is obeyed, to put it at its very simplest.  That Act specifies that if a company has a pension scheme, it must follow certain rules.  It does not say that a pension scheme must be set up, and currently it does not specify that a pension scheme cannot be closed.  The role of the Pensions Authority, as defined in legislation since it was set up, has been limited to overseeing the pension schemes that exist.  More broadly and less formally, it would be fair to say the question of whether employers set up pension schemes, as well as the level of benefits and contributions involved, etc., is seen and understood as an industrial relations issue rather than a pensions legislation issue.  It is clearly arguable that if this legislation goes through, that will change.  Until now, the question of whether there should be a pension and how much that pension should be has been an industrial relations matter for negotiation between employers and employee representatives.  We have not had a role in that.  Over the 25 years, as schemes have closed and others have been set up, it has not fallen under our responsibility.  There is nothing in the Pensions Act to give us power to intervene in that space.</p> <p>  There is the question of the ability of an employer to absorb the cost if this legislation goes through.  Our understanding of the proposed legislation is that the Pensions Authority's role would be limited to ascertaining how much a scheme needs to meet obligations and imposing that as an obligation on the employer.  The ability of the employer to afford that amount is not intended to be part of the Pension Authority's remit.  I should say two things in passing about that.  If it did come within our remit, it would require a change in the way we do things and we would certainly need to acquire more expertise.  It is a very complex issue.  There is a more general point that would also have to be borne in mind.  If ability to pay becomes a feature of the employer's obligation, it would also be necessary to decide that if an employer cannot afford pension scheme deficits, how will those deficits be dealt with?  It would not be enough to say the employer does not have to pay the full amount but the pension scheme must be left open in any event.  If the pension scheme is going to provide the benefits promised in the rules, the money must come from somewhere.  Ultimately, one must make the decision as to whether somebody pays the money or people lose the benefits.  There is no third way and it would have to be addressed if we went down that route.  Obviously, I am not arguing for or against it but the matters must be taken into account.  With the legislation as proposed, our responsibility does not include assessing the employer's ability to pay but rather what is required to pay the benefits promised in the scheme rules.</p> <p>  Should profitable companies be allowed to wind up schemes?  This is a question for the Oireachtas and the Government rather than the Pensions Authority.  The authority is a regulator.  It is a very specific question but I suggest there is a broader question.  It is not just about winding up schemes and the question goes to whether employers should provide pensions and if profitability is relevant.  There have been various suggestions for mandatory or auto-enrolment universal pension schemes.  That question goes to that kind of space.  It is not a question for us as a Government agency and pensions regulator.  It is a much broader question.</p></speech>

In the main, they would be technical adjustments where a regulation could be improved with a certain change.  As I stated at the outset, we have the role of advising the Minister for Social Protection on pensions matters.  For example, currently we are in discussions with the Minister and the Department about changes in general to how defined contribution pension schemes are provided to make the system work better.  The issue of who gets pensions and whether schemes should be mandatory or voluntary is a Government matter rather than one for the authority, as a regulator.</p></speech>

He has made that point very clear, that it is not his role and not contained in the legislation.  What is the Pensions Authority's view of the proposed scheme?  The Pensions Authority did not ask for these regulations to be introduced.  How does it view them?</p></speech>

I am not trying to avoid the Chairman's question but it is not black and white.  There are advantages and disadvantages.  I think many of those have been rehearsed.  It obviously improves security of members.  If employers are obliged to pay in more money, then there will be more money in the pensions scheme for these benefits.  On the other hand, there is the issue, as IBEC has raised, about how these were voluntary arrangements.  Is it or is it not right to change voluntary into mandatory?  I am just saying that is an issue but am not pronouncing on it.  There will be an issue whereby some employers will be able to afford their obligations while others will not.  It is the Pension Authority's view that there are pros and cons and we have identified them in reports we have produced previously.  The decision about whether on balance it is an appropriate thing to do is a Government policy issue and is not for us to decide.</p></speech>

Mr. Kennedy is clearly able to indicate the number of schemes, the decline of the schemes, and the risk here is that there is a move from a voluntary basis, and there are proposed amendments without any reference to ability to pay.  I have made the point to Mr. O'Brien that companies with the ability to pay have walked away from what we would have viewed as their obligations.  There is, however, a concern for companies that cannot pay.  The viability of those schemes and those companies is an issue.  Considering this is legislation that the Pensions Authority did not look for, on balance does Mr. Kennedy view this as a positive or a negative?</p></speech>

It is clear from our discussions this morning that there has not been sufficient impact assessment of these proposed changes.  It is clear that the ability of businesses to pay mandatory demands will not be a factor in setting those demands.  The risks associated with challenging the viability of businesses, threatening jobs in them or threatening the future earnings and career prospects of their employees, even if they do not lose their jobs, are very significant.  The reality is that we do not know the answers.  In the absence of that information on and understanding of the complexity of all of these issues, these measures and proposals should be dropped for now.  They need much more in-depth scrutiny.</p></speech>

I am not trying to catch him or anything like that but I want to put it as simply and directly as possible.  I asked him whether there was an issue around the timeliness of this legislation.  My concern is there is something of a conflict, in that the cost of business has not been analysed.  It has come across both from Mr. Kennedy and Mr. O'Brien that the cost has not been analysed and nor has the consequent impact that may or may not have.  However, now that the signal has been cleared to the effect that there will be a move from a voluntary to a mandatory situation, does the passage of time cause risk to the existing scheme?  In other words, could operators of schemes start winding them down or so forth in this period where there is a proposal for legislation but not enactment?  If we prolong the process, does it create additional risk?</p></speech>

I know of no specific issues but then people would not necessarily tell me.  If an employer sponsoring a scheme that currently has a deficit thought that this legislation, for whatever reason, was going to impose an obligation it did not want or could not afford to bear, it might consider taking the steps to wind up the scheme or withdraw its support from the scheme.  The details would depend on the specific scheme rules before this legislation came into place.  That is a step some employers might be considering.</p></speech>

From my perspective, I do not think that is a fair assessment of this morning's proceedings.  There is clearly a huge issue here.  Irrespective of delay in this or in any legislation, defined benefit schemes have been plummeting since 1992.  We have the figures to hand.  Doing nothing is simply not an option in my book.  A number of legislative items have been brought forward, this being the most recent.  Again, I have put forward the proposition that the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation that was brought forward clearly has the mechanisms to stop the profitable companies from winding down their schemes.  I have outlined many examples that are in the media, including the examples of Irish Life, Independent News and Media and many others that unfairly, with no consultation with their employees, are winding down their schemes.  Doing nothing is not an option.  There may be some concerns around this.  Giving 12 months' notice, as this Bill currently outlines and proposes, is fair enough.</p> <p>  I put it to IBEC in particular - because there was not a clear "Yes" or "No" in response to the question that I put to IBEC - that if it is opposed to this legislation going forward, would it support the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation?  If the organisation has not seen it, I would gladly pass it along.  It makes amendments to the Pensions Act, specifically where a healthy sponsor shall not be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  Second, it provides that for these purposes, a healthy sponsor means an employer that either has positive net revenue or has a parent company with positive net revenue.  Its clear intention is to stop the profitable companies from walking away from their employees that are engaged in a scheme.  We are not talking about future schemes or curtailing those but about current schemes that are in operation and stopping profitable companies from walking away.  I put that question directly to IBEC, because I take on board what the Pensions Authority is saying.</p></speech>

I started in 1973 when I was 20 or 21 years of age.  It was explained to us that the pension scheme was built into our basic pay.  I cannot remember off the top of my head what the percentage was.  It was never a physical thing that could be seen on the payslip that this contribution was for the pension.  Things started to change in 1981.  It was put to everyone whether they would or not.  I knew I was gay so there was no way that I was going to pay in or that I wanted to stay in this scheme.  It was not until 1984 that it was again put to us whether we wanted to stay in the scheme and pay the contribution.  For us at that time, however, there was never going to be marriage or children so what was the point?  In answer to the Deputy's question, the pension was built into our basic salary without us knowing exactly what it was.  It was never physically on the payslip, if the Deputy knows what I mean.</p></speech>
