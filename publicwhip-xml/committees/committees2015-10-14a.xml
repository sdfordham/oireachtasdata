However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges  against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after this meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask everybody to ensure their mobile telephones are either turned off or switched to flight mode, otherwise they interfere with the broadcast equipment.</p><p>As stated, today's topic is the lack of availability of activation services and other supports for unemployed people who are not on the live register.  As a committee, we have discussed this matter on a number of occasions.  Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Clare Daly, Ryan and Conaghan, Senator Moloney and I all requested that we should have meetings on it.  This is an important topic for many members.  Obviously, constituents raise the issue in circumstances where they may not fit into the live register in the sense that they could become activated.  Members are concerned at how the current system excludes certain categories of people from valuable opportunities to re-engage with the labour market.</p><p>For an update on this matter I am pleased to welcome from the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, INOU, Mr. John Stewart and Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien, and from the Department of Social, Mr. John McKeon, Mr. Tom Lehane and Mr. Niall Egan.  I invite Mr. John Stewart to make the presentation on behalf of the INOU.</p></speech>

Access to a comprehensive and professional employment service and supports is absolutely essential to facilitate unemployed people in getting back to work.  Unfortunately, we cannot say that all unemployed people who are in receipt of an unemployment payment have access to such a service.  Unfortunately, unemployed people not in receipt of an unemployment payment who are not on the live register are even further down the queue in terms of being able to access such a service.  I invite my colleague, Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien, who drafted our submission to take us through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015101400002#E00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  As the committee is keenly aware, there are a number of reasons people would not be on the live register.  They may be in receipt of another payment, such as a disability payment, a lone parent family payment or a jobseeker's benefit payment, but may not have met the means test criteria, or they may have been self-employed and did not meet the mean test criteria and, therefore, did not gain access to a jobseeker's allowance payment or they may be a qualified adult to another person's payment.  For all these reasons, accessing the services that have been rolled out recently to people on the live register are not available to those groups.</p> <p>  It is an issue that was raised at our annual delegate conference in 2011 where the general branch, which is the part of the organisation that represents unemployed people who can be in receipt of all the aforementioned payments or none, was to ensure access for unemployed people not included in the live register to the full range of employment, training and education supports, including training allowances and other supports.  The call was that the full service would be available to everybody of working age.  We regard this as a matter that needs to be addressed urgently and, in particular, must be included in Pathways to Work 2016-2010.  Access to programmes must be based on wider criteria than a person's live register status.  Programme participants must be given the wherewithal to support their engagement.  Also, the public employment service, which is the responsibility of the Department, must develop the capacity to respond to the needs of all people of working age seeking employment.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, up to budget 2010 people could access a F&Aacute;S training scheme and a training allowance, which ceased in that budget, of &euro;204.30.  In subsequent budgets, the amount was cut and now stands at &euro;188 for anybody on the live register.  That is a single payment.  For those aged 25 and under, the maximum payment is &euro;160.  We are concerned at the level of that payment.  For those on the live register who can access these supports, we would regard them as insufficient to meet people's needs.  Currently, unemployed people not on the live register can access a very limited range of supports.  A limited walk-in service is available at some Intreo offices but in our experience it does not always materialise.  Clarity is needed on this issue in order that people know where they stand and what they can access.   </p> <p>  Since 2010, the activation landscape has changed considerably with F&Aacute;S employment and community services being the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection, its training services are with education and training boards and oversight for further education and training rests with SOLAS.  Those are very significant changes that have taken place. </p> <p>  In 2012, the Government published Pathways to Work, which has been revisited in 2013 and 2015.  There are five strands to it.  In the most recent reiteration, the strands were listed as incentivising employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed, better engagement with unemployed people, greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for those who are long-term unemployed, incentivising the take-up of employment opportunities by unemployed jobseekers, and completing the reform agenda.  It is interesting to note that in 2012, when Pathways to Work was first published, regular engagement with unemployed people was first on the list while engaging with employers was fourth on the list.</p> <p>  As a member of the labour market council, the INOU is aware of the increased engagement with employers, which we regard as critical to ensuring the employment needs of unemployed people are met, and the roll-out of the employment and youth activation charter to give an impetus to this work.  However, we are concerned that much of the focus has been on the larger employers when in the Irish labour market smaller employers are a key employer.  There is a challenge around how smaller employers are engaged with and, in particular, how the local Intreo office is engaging with local employers and encouraging them to look to the live register and to look to employ people not on the live register as potential employees.</p><p>The feedback we have had is that the experience of some smaller employers has been less than positive in that regard, which needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>As we have noted, a criticism of the Pathways to Work strategy has been its sole focus on the live register and not focusing on everybody of working age, as it needs to.  That needs to be addressed.  One of the concerns we have about the one-parent family payment, which has not been included in the presentation because we presumed colleagues in the National Women's Council of Ireland would address it, is that people have been taken from one payment and slotted or almost slotted into another.  The terms and conditions for the jobseeker's allowance are not as good as they would have been for people on the one-parent family payment, particularly those making the welfare to work journey.  That is not the way to proceed and we need an inclusive employment service that can adapt and address the needs of people looking to that service for support, with the capacity to do so.  That issue should be addressed in the forthcoming Pathways to Work scheme.<br/><br/>The current scheme has an action around developing and evaluating options to extend employment services to people not on the live register and to improve the promotion and communication of existing activation options.  It is important that further work should be done in this regard, meaning it will be embedded very clearly and in strong language around equality and social inclusion, in the coming Pathways to Work document.<br/><br/>To address people's concerns, the coming Pathways to Work document should detail how it will incorporate positive duty.  That is something we would very much like to see implemented.  It arises from the Act that established the Equality and Human Rights Commission.  It is very much a duty on public sector bodies to spell out how they will deal with and eliminate discrimination, and how they will ensure that people accessing services and employed in the bodies will not face discrimination.  That puts a duty on the Department and Pathways to Work to consider how its design can be inclusive of everybody and not be discriminatory.  That would be very important.<br/><br/>In rolling out and providing the best services to people, it is very important that the front-line staff have the capacity and knowledge to develop the service and match people with the most appropriate opportunity.  We remain concerned that this is not always the case and people may not always get the opportunity to avail of services and supports that would be relevant to them, helping them access a job.  A critical part of this is developing a service that is person-centred and which has the capacity to get to know the person, meet their needs and assess options.  Some people are closer to the labour market than others.  What role does education and training play in meeting those needs and what role do employment programmes fill?  When people have engaged in activation measures, what happens next and how can the service support people in accessing a decent job?<br/><br/>In August, the Central Statistics Office published work relating to equality grounds from the quarterly national household survey.  As members no doubt know, the equality grounds in the Employment Equality Act and Equal Status Act were used and even though unemployment, <i>per se</i>, economic status or social origin are not among the grounds in the equality legislation, people's employment status was used.  As a result, the second-highest reported issue that came to the fore was unemployment.  Of people reporting discrimination, 23% reported discrimination because they were unemployed.  These people may be in receipt of a payment, such as a working age payment or a jobseeker's payment.  That is a challenge to be addressed.  The highest reported issue at 28% came from people of non-white ethnic backgrounds, who reported experience of discrimination.  In examining those figures, it is striking that a higher proportion of men highlighted discrimination when seeking work, at 31%, whereas for women the experience tended to be more in the workplace.  These are issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Similarly, age is an issue raised with us by people who are long-term unemployed and older.  They may be well-qualified with good experience but find it very difficult to access employment because of ageism in the labour market.</p><p> There are issues we can consider that Ireland has been actively involved with at the United Nations and to which it has signed up.  We can take these on board to try to create a recovery that is inclusive of everybody.  I am talking about the 17 sustainable development goals.  Of particular interest to us is goal 4, which relates to inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities.  Lifelong learning is particularly critical for people who may be on the margins of the labour market and who have experience of low-paid welfare.  Goal 8 speaks of promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all, with goal 10 aiming to reduce inequality within and among countries.  As part of that goal, target 10.2 seeks to "empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status".   Likewise, target 10.3 strives to "ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard".  It is critical to be mindful of those goals as we seek to address the issue before us today and look to the rolling out and development of a new Pathways to Work document.  We must ensure that the employment service we are creating is first class and inclusive of everybody of working age looking to it for support.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015101400002#G00200"><p>I thank members for the invitation to discuss the availability of activation services and other supports for unemployed people who are not on the live register.  Members have received copies of my speaking note.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Niall Egan, principal officer with responsibility for jobseeker and lone-parent income support policy, and Mr. Tom Lehane, an assistant principal officer in our Dublin division who deals with jobseekers, employers and staff on a daily basis.  He may be able to address particular issues that might arise during the discussion.</p> <p>  In speaking about activation policy, it is useful to distinguish between the activation process that applies to people receiving jobseeker payments and the broader concept of employment services and programmes available not only to registered jobseekers but also to other groups.  The activation process relates to how the public employment service proactively engages with people who are unemployed, who declare themselves to be fully available for work and who are in receipt of a jobseeker payment.  An essential element of this approach is the concept of "rights and responsibilities".  People who are unemployed and seeking work have a right to receive an income support and assistance from the public employment services but they also have a responsibility, indeed an obligation, to engage with these services.  Compulsory engagement with the Intreo service constitutes part of the conditionality for receipt of jobseeker payments.  Registered jobseekers must attend for interview with a case officer if called on to do so and penalty rate reductions may be applied to their welfare payments if they fail to meet these obligations or to take up reasonable offers of supports such as training.  In addition, their payment may be fully withdrawn if a deciding officer forms the view that their behaviour indicates they are not available for and actively seeking work.</p> <p>  Employment services relate primarily to the assistance Intreo gives to clients, primarily through case worker support and guidance, in the search for suitable work.  As I have already indicated, engagement with these services is compulsory for recipients of jobseeker payments.  The services are not, however, limited to people in receipt of jobseeker payments and are available to any client who goes to an Intreo office seeking assistance in finding work.  Finally, the employment service can help clients to access a range of employment and training programmes administered either by the Department or through the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies.</p><p> Employment programmes provided directly or funded by the Department of Social Protection include schemes such as community employment, T&uacute;s, Gateway and JobBridge.  In addition, the Department provides a range of employment incentives such as JobsPlus and in-work income supports such as family income supplement, FIS, and the back to work family dividend.  Although participation on a small number of the employment programmes is limited to recipients of jobseeker payments, in general they are accessible to recipients of a wide range of welfare payments.  Some of these programmes are also accessible to persons who are not in receipt of any welfare payment, though participation on such programmes will not entitle such clients to receive welfare payments or training allowances while participating.</p><p> The key objective of activation policy is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency, and on whom the State imposes an obligation to be genuinely available for and seeking work as a condition for receipt of payment.  This policy objective was set in the context of the massive increase in the numbers of unemployed people on job-seekers payments that took place between 2007 and 2012.  During this period, the live register rose from 160,000 to 450,000.  In that context, it was necessary to prioritise scarce resources in respect of those in receipt of a qualifying welfare payment whose payment was conditional on engaging, if and as requested, with the public employment service.  Accordingly, activation services by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  Notwithstanding the focus of activation policy on unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker payments, many services are available, as I have said, to people who are in receipt of other, or no, social welfare payments.  It may be useful to outline the situation in respect of two of the main groups involved.</p><p> As regards recipients of disability allowance, the current policy in respect of people with disabilities who present at an Intreo centre requesting employment services is that they are to be referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo, at the local employment service, LES, or at one of the EmployAbility service providers funded by the Department of Social Protection.  For such persons in receipt of disability or illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis and is not a requirement for their payment.  A caseworker working with a person with a disability can arrange access for that client to most of the range of services and programmes that are available to people on jobseeker payments.  This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the back to education allowance, and SOLAS training for unemployed people.  Exceptions include the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy, the MOMENTUM training intervention and T&uacute;s, all of which were specifically designed for long-term recipients of jobseeker payments.  In addition, however, the caseworker can arrange access to a range of other services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other jobseekers.  In 2014, the Department spent &euro;34 million on the provision of various employment supports, excluding the specialist training provided by SOLAS, for people with disabilities.  These include EmployAbility, to which I have already referred, which is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market.  The supported employment service provided by EmployAbility is an employment and recruitment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in that market.  This service provides a range of supports to employers and people with a disability through the use of job coaches.  It is implemented by sponsor organisations that employ the job coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate objective is that the employee becomes independent of job coach support.</p><p> The wage subsidy scheme, WSS, is a demand-led programme, the purpose of which is to increase the number of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  WSS provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 21 hours per week.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.  The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39-hour week.  This payment is not time-limited and is paid for the full period of employment of the individual concerned.  This is significantly more attractive than the equivalent payment under JobsPlus for people in receipt of jobseeker payments under which the maximum amount payable is &euro;5,000 per annum for a limit of two years.  New applicants for WSS who are currently on disability allowance may also apply for a disability allowance disregard in conjunction with the WSS, provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.   This disregard of &euro;120 per week is double that of the equivalent jobseeker disregard and, in addition, the withdrawal or taper rate in also more attractive than that of the jobseeker payment.</p><p>There are a number of other employment supports for people with disabilities, including grants for workplace equipment adaptation.</p><p> Community employment, CE, eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as those for other jobseeker groups.  The aim behind this is to encourage participation.  Those on jobseeker payments must generally be aged over 25 and in receipt of a payment for a year or more.  A person in receipt of disability allowance who is aged 18 or over can be in receipt of their payment for one week and still be eligible for CE.</p><p> Apart from having access to the range of training programmes, other than Momentum, for unemployed people provided through SOLAS, people with disabilities also have access to a specialist training programme provision specific to their needs.  The key additional features of that specialist vocational training, is that the programmes are generally of longer duration, have improved trainer-learner ratios and use specially qualified staff and specially adapted equipment.  Overall, therefore, people with disabilities have access to a range of services comparable, and in most cases superior, to the range available to those on the live register.  The principal difference in approach is that engagement with these services is entirely on a voluntary basis for people with disabilities.</p><p> I will turn now to recipients of the one-parent family payment, OFP.  As with people with disabilities, the current situation in respect of those on lone-parent payments who present at a DSP office needing activation or intervention-type supports, is that they are referred to a caseworker within Intreo or at the LES.  For persons in receipt of lone-parent payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis; it is not a requirement for their payment.  A case officer working with a lone parent can arrange access for that client to virtually the full range of services and programmes that are available to people on jobseeker payments, including the in-work income supports of FIS and the back to work family dividend.  The only exceptions are JobsPlus, Momentum and T&uacute;s.</p><p> One-parent family payment eligibility has been recently restricted to lone parents whose youngest child is under seven years of age.  For people who are not cohabiting with another adult and whose youngest child is aged between seven and 13 years, inclusive, the OPF payment has been replaced by the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  This is a special arrangement under the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, or JA, scheme that aims to support lone parents into the workforce while they have young children.  This is known as the jobseeker's allowance transitional, JST, payment.  The arrangements for JST recognise the need to promote engagement and incentivise work for this group of clients, while also acknowledging the child care issues for persons who are parenting alone.  These lone parents will still have caring responsibilities for young children and, as a result, may not be able to meet all of the conditionality provisions that apply to the JA scheme, which currently require all JA recipients to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  To address their needs, the JST provides access to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, effectively with reduced conditionality.  This means they are exempt from having to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work and from the four-days-in-seven working rule.  That allows this group of clients to receive income support continue, to work and/or take up employment, and receive access to employment supports from the Department in order to support them to become job ready.</p><p> At the same time, engagement with the Intreo service is a requirement for continued receipt of JST.  The engagement, commencing with a group information session-----</p></speech>

In summary, people with children under seven years of age have access to virtually the full range of services.  The principal difference is that engagement is voluntary rather than compulsory.</p> <p>  A final group sometimes identified as being outside the scope of existing supports is made up of working-age adults who are qualified adult dependants on a primary claimant&rsquo;s jobseeker payment.  This payment has no conditionality in respect of the qualified adult himself or herself being unemployed.  Indeed, it is estimated that approximately 40% of those involved are actually in employment.  Nevertheless, qualified adults who are not the primary claimant on a jobseeker claim can access the full range of employment services and programmes and become full participants in the activation regime, if they voluntarily self-identify as unemployed and register for a jobseeker payment in their own right.  This will bring with it both the responsibilities and rights, in terms of employment services and programmes, that attach to jobseeker payments.</p><p>The Pathways to Work 2015 strategy includes a commitment to develop and evaluate actions to extend services, as resources allow, to people not on the live register and improve the promotion and communication of existing activation options.  As outlined, some steps have already been taken through the reform of the one-parent family payment and the introduction of JST.  Further measures are now being considered as to how activation can be extended to other people of working age in the context of the development of an updated Pathways to Work strategy for the five-year period 2016 to 2020.  In this regard, the Department initiated a consultation programme during the summer in the form of an online survey of approximately 200 stakeholders and held a consultation forum for stakeholders on 9 October.  The inputs received through this process are now being collated.  Inputs are still welcome and can be sent to the following email address, .  It is intended that an updated Pathways to Work strategy taking account of the inputs received will be drafted and submitted to Government by January of 2016.<br/><br/>We are happy to answer questions and provide any additional material that members require.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015101400002#K00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They have captured some of the groups that have no access to some of the activation programmes.  Disability groups and lone parents were mentioned but there are many other groups which are not fully reflected.  For example, there are adult dependants.  While the latter can apply for a payment in their own right, for various reasons they do not.  Some of it is to do with culture or the way families are structured but those people are unemployed or underemployed because most are stay-at-home mothers and fathers.  Until such time as they receive a payment in their own right, they do not appear on the live register and have no access to programmes which could encourage them to get work or improve the possibility of their gaining employment, especially in circumstances where they have been out of the workplace for some time.  There are others who are adult dependants in some ways but who are not in receipt of a payment in that regard.  They are in family situations where, in most cases, the husband's income exceeds the threshold.  As such, the person cannot receive some social welfare payment and has no access.  In many cases, these people are stuck with whatever educational qualifications or employability standards they had initially.  There are others who are working a low number of hours.  I refer to people who work for two hours or three hours, five days a week.  It is not all lone parents.  I know of a case which I have raised before of a woman who works two hours a day.  She owns her own home because she inherited it.  She does not want to change her work but wants to access some payment to recognise it.  She receives nothing because she is working five days a week albeit only two hours a day.  She gets &euro;100 and spends &euro;20 to get to work.  Without the work she has, she says her sanity would go.</p> <p>  Another group that has been brought to my attention, the plight of which I have raised here before, is that comprising carers.  There are many carers whose caring role is coming to an end either because the cared-for person is nearing the end of life or is getting better.  The carer is stuck in a situation where he or she does not have access to some of the activation programmes he or she might have been able to access until he or she finishes caring or is in receipt of a new payment for a full year and then starts to upskill.  There are others.  Some of them are recognisable people and some of that has been recognised here.</p><p>Not all of these people want money.  It is not about money.  Some of them want to be out of the house and some of them want to contribute to society and to be meaningful.  In community employment terms, there are many people who are adult dependants and staying at home and who have skills.  They may be nearing what we have set as a timeframe in terms of the age and they want to contribute.  However, because they are dependant adults and not in receipt of payments, we do not encourage them to get involved in community employment or its equivalent.</p><p> We have an opportunity now.  The Department and, possibly, the Minister are looking at it.  Our activation numbers are approximately 80,000.  As such, there are 80,000 not on the live register.  We have 80,000 places.  As the economy improves, rather than reducing the activation provision available, we should keep it open to capture the lone parents and people with disabilities to whom the witnesses referred, but also the group I refer to who have never been captured.  That would enhance their employability if that is what they wish or help them to gain some benefit in terms of community employment, which would be ideal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015101400002#L00200"><p>I thank Ms O'Brien and Mr. Stewart for coming in.  I also thank the departmental officials who are really good for coming in whenever we request them to answer our questions.  This is an issue I have been raising constantly since I was elected to the Seanad.  These guys here will say, "She is off again like a broken record", as I have been fighting the cause of some of these people constantly.</p> <p>  One group I have always fought for is the self-employed.  They are totally underestimated in this country.  During the recession when things went bad for them, some of them were able to access jobseeker's allowance, but they are one of the only groups who do not get a credit while in receipt of that payment.  Those on farm assist payments also do not get a credit.  It will have a detrimental effect on their pensions when they come to pensionable age.  I have been told the reason is that because they are self-employed, they only have to pay so much money to get 52 contributions for the year.  However, when one is on jobseeker's allowance and has no income coming in, one needs a credited contribution.  I have asked the guys to look at that to get a credited contribution for the self-employed.  It is vital for them.  They cannot access the family income supplement, which is also completely unfair.  The self-employed create a lot of jobs.  It may not be the big jobs the multinationals create, but two or three jobs here and there are vital.</p> <p>  We mentioned the under-25s and their payment.  I was a bit disappointed that the budget made no provision for a bit more money for them.  Different commentators will have different ideas on this and say one should always be better off working than unemployed and that this motivates the young to get involved in activation.  However, when one lives in rural Ireland and the jobs are in the cities, one has to travel for interviews.  The cost to young people of going through the interview process is substantial.  That is why I would have liked to see that issue addressed.</p> <p>  We spoke about women in the home.  This is another hobby-horse of mine.  Today, women who are caring for their children have a homemaker's credit, which stops when the youngest child is 14.  Can the officials from the Department tell the committee if there is any measure whereby we write to those women when their children are 14 to say that the homemaker's credit is finishing and invite them to engage with the Department to obtain unemployment benefit or, if a woman does not qualify for that, a credited contribution to maintain her pension entitlements going forward?  I was delighted to see in the budget that the home-carer's tax credit has increased and that the amount a person can earn outside the home while retaining the credit has increased to approximately &euro;7,000.</p><p> We spoke about lone parents and the transitional payments.  I was delighted when the official stated that the lone parents who had children under seven could engage in the activation process, but it is not widely known that they can.  I suppose they are not presenting every week to the social welfare office and are somewhat forgotten.  It would be no harm for the Department to write to anyone who is on the one-parent family payment with children under the age of seven stating that the Intreo office is open to them and they can avail of these services.</p><p> There are two anomalies that I have come across, one of which was with the internships.  Someone who was on the community employment scheme for years eventually accessed an internship and was delighted with it.  He had &euro;50 extra a week and he was delighted, and there was the prospect of a job at the end of it.  All was going well until the man had a massive heart attack.  He had to leave his internship and go on illness benefit - not disability allowance - because he had put up a contribution during the community employment schemes.  He lost his entitlement to the fuel allowance.  He lost his entitlement to the Christmas bonus.  He lost his entitlement to the top-up on the SUSI special grant rate because he is now on a short-term payment.  I battled the case and got him onto disability allowance, and he had all of these restored.  It is an anomaly.  Nobody who has been unemployed for the number of years that he was - five or six years - should have had to go through that.  He should not have lost all those entitlements.</p><p> The other anomaly arose this week, and I am still dealing with it.  A man who was on jobseeker's benefit had an accident and went onto illness benefit, but wanted to go back to education.  He got an adult education course of four years' duration and was delighted with himself.  When he went to see his case worker in early August, he was told, "Come in the week before you go to college and we will sort you out."  He went in the week before to see his education officer, but was still on illness benefit.  He started college on 14 September.  He was signed off illness benefit on 14 September.  He saw his case officer and he saw his education officer, who approved his back to education allowance, but suddenly it was taken away from him.  He is now left in limbo with nothing.  He went down to apply for jobseeker's allowance the week before he went to college and was given an appointment for the week after, but now he is being told, "Too late - you were not on jobseeker's allowance when you went back to education."  He will have to either drop out of the course, which he may never go back to, or defer it for a year and hope to go back next year.  We are now saying to this man, "Come and draw from the State for another extra year and then we will give you four years."  It is wrong.  We need to use a little discretion to help the likes of this person.  I have loads more to say, but it is not fair to take up the whole time and I will let someone else speak.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.</p></speech>

It really has transformed.  At one time, going to the dole office was quite a frightening encounter - I remember going myself.  That whole approach has been cast off and the system is far more dynamic.  It is far more like a partnership.</p> <p>  I have a great deal of respect for the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, INOU, the group that spoke first.  Such groups have played a significant role in all sorts of ways, perhaps most significantly in civilising this exchange between those seeking unemployment assistance and staff in the Department.  That whole encounter has been transformed.  That is my own experience of it from living in Ballyfermot, where I talk to people.  I remember going to the labour exchange myself on many occasions, but from talking to those who now use the service, there is no fear or trembling going in as to what will happen, what the staff will say and whether they will be down at one's house.  All of this has changed remarkably for the better.</p><p> I note the work Ms O'Brien is doing.  She has a long record in that area.  I was involved in initiating the old local employment service in Ballyfermot 30 years ago.  I note the credibility she has brought to her work, for example, how she helped re-engineer the services to change the outlook of officials towards the unemployed.  That outlook has changed remarkably and it is rarely commented on.  It is important that we pay tribute to those who were involved in changing that because the unemployed need help rather than, as was the practice, a stern approach.</p><p> I wonder what the witnesses think of that process of change.  What was the dynamic that triggered it?  As professionals in that service, how do the officials experience and evaluate that and how do they see that trend developing?  Will it continue?  Will it bring in newer dimensions in terms of communicating with those seeking a way out of unemployment?</p></speech>

As the Chair indicated at the start, it is a topic that we all encounter on a regular basis in our clinic work.</p> <p>  The officials have gone through the various categories of those who are not on the live register but the one I encounter most, and probably encountered to a greater degree a couple of years ago, is the person who became unemployed and, because of a means test involving a spouse, could not avail of anything.  In summary, can the officials clarify what that category of person can and cannot avail of?</p> <p>  The INOU has requested that these categories be dealt with in the new framework, Pathways to Work.  We all hope that could happen, and it is encouraging that is in there.  There is, however, conditionality in the use of the phrase "as resources allow".  That is the way out.</p> <p>  In terms of the consultation around the conference this week, who will draft the new framework?  Will it be these officials?  What would be their advice to the Minister about whether the various categories we have talked about could be included at that stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015101400002#N00300"><p>I will do my best to pick up the questions.  As usual, if I do not pick up something or leave something out, the members can come back to me, either now or later, and we will do our best.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of dependent adults previously.  He raised the issue of qualified adults who are not necessarily aware that they can split their claim and have access to services, and that, even if they are aware, they may not feel inclined to do so for cultural or social reasons.  We recognise that as an issue.  In the strong feedback that came to us in the consultation process, the second priority item was to increase awareness among jobseekers, including qualified adults, and employers of the available supports.  What the Department can probably do in that space is make strong efforts to make recipients aware that the option of splitting the claim is available and make it easy to do it.  I am not too sure there is much we can do about the embedded cultural biases relating to gender roles in Irish society and most western European societies.  That is a longer-haul issue for society as a whole which goes back to education, family upbringing and all kinds of matters, but we can do our bit in terms of increasing awareness.</p><p> One of the issues that we have been asked to look at before, and we have taken a small step that way but we will look at it in more detail as part of Pathways to Work 2016, is whether we can allow a qualified adult who splits his or her claim and separates it out to include their time as a qualified adult to qualify for access to the full range of schemes and services.  The back to education allowance has already been adapted.  Therefore, such persons can access the back to education allowance and do not have to wait nine months if they have already been a qualified adult.  Certainly one of the issues that is under strong consideration for the next instalment of Pathways to Work is whether that should be standard.  We have noted the suggestions that have come from this committee in this regard and we have also received suggestions from other stakeholders.  That is certainly in the pot, if I can put it that way.  There is a long list of things to be considered and we have received a long list from the committee today.  Obviously, it is a question for the Government to decide how much of that long list will end up being on the shortlist.</p><p> In terms of those who are not qualified and are dependant on income, there are two categories which are children in the home and the adult dependant who may not qualify for a claim because of his or her spouse's income.  Perhaps Mr. Egan will talk about the adult dependant.  I will talk about the question of children, which is one I get a lot.  To give the figures in terms of a means test or assessing whether an 18 year old who lives at home will get access to jobseeker's allowance and his parents are working, if it is a typical two child family and the family has a typical mortgage, because there is a disregard for mortgage payments, pension payments, health insurance payments and so on, it is the net income that is looked at and the gross income would have to be in excess of &euro;100,000 in a typical two child family for the child not to have access to at least some element of a payment.  It might be a small amount that is available because it would be reduced.  The proportion of people who live in households where the income is more than &euro;100,000 is very low.  In terms of prioritising resources, one would have to say that the people who are in those households, and one would be up at the high 90% before one would get there in terms of income distribution, probably have other networks and access to supports and other resources.  If one is going to priorities resources, it would not necessarily be top of our list.  That is something the Minister will consider and we will see in that regard.  Perhaps Mr. Egan will comment on the qualified adult or the adult who cannot qualify for payment because of spousal means.</p></speech>

From an assistance perspective, in terms of our working age payments, to satisfy the means test the household income is taken into account.  As Mr. McKeon has outlined, where a household income is in excess of the threshold, an adult dependant would not qualify for a payment in their own right.  Our primary role is to provide income support.  Under the jobseeker's allowance scheme, that person or household is deemed to have sufficient means.  As Mr. McKeon alluded to in his presentation and as referenced, however, that person can access the vast majority of supports of our Intreo office, although admittedly not all of them.  When a person participates in an education and training course, it is currently the situation that he or she will not qualify for a training allowance payment.  I must be clear about that.  It may have been Ms O'Brien who referenced the fact this changed in 2012 in terms of entitlement to a welfare payment indicated or was a passport to get an entitlement to an education and training board allowance or a F&Aacute;S training allowance as it was then.</p></speech>

Mr. Egan has answered his question to a large extent.  Such people have access to all of the training and education programmes but they do not get the training allowance.  People with credits, in addition, would have access to some of the employment programmes.  It depends on whether a person has credits.  There are people who would have access to some of the employment programmes but not all of them.  They might not have access to the schemes that are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed, such as T&uacute;s and MOMENTUM, but they would have access to the other schemes.</p></speech>

As Mr. Egan has pointed out, employment services are available to everybody.  Any person should be able to walk in and be provided with a service.  I take the point made by Ms O'Brien that such a situation is not the universal experience.  We are doing our best to improve that experience.  People should be scheduled to meet a case officer to develop a personal progression plan and be told about the services that are available.  Earlier, we were asked to tell people who may be unemployed but not in receipt of any payment that they can still come into the office and deal with us, and we will let them know what is available.  Improving awareness of the services available is something that we will seek to have included in the next Pathways policy.  A wide range of services are available but people are unaware of them.  In the past, when we had the tsunami of unemployment, if we had built awareness and told people to come to us, then they would have had to stand at the end of a queue.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh has pointed out, as the number of unemployed people diminishes, we have a greater capacity to respond to those who would have been called voluntary engagers in the old F&Aacute;S days.  We now have the scope to build awareness up to a certain level and respond to people as they come to us.</p> <p>  A question was asked about carers.  It is important to recognise that carers have a significant income disregard at present and there have been significant changes in terms of the hours they can work while still claiming a carer's payment.  A lot of carers are involved in some employment.  I do not have the exact percentages with me but I know that they would be involved in employment while providing care.  It might be part-time employment, but they receive an income disregard as a consequence.  That option is available to all carers.  Awareness might be an issue.  We must let other carers know that they can work 15 hours a week and there is a fairly generous income disregard.  As carers come to the end of their caring duties, they should visit an Intreo office and we will see what can be done.</p></speech>

It is something that we will consider in the context of the next Pathways document.  The rate of unemployment has fallen, and the long-term unemployment rate is falling faster than the general rate, but there are still a lot of long-term unemployed people for whom we must provide.  These are issues for the Minister to consider.  For the next year or two there will still be a lot of pressure in terms of priority access to those spaces among those who are long-term unemployed, which is natural.  These matters will be taken into account.</p> <p>  Senator Moloney asked about self-employed people.  The issue with self-employed people is that they do not have automatic access to jobseeker's benefit, which then raises the issue of access to credits, because credits are generally associated with moving from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance.  The vast majority of such people - more than 80% - do get jobseeker's allowance.  In other words, they satisfy the means test.</p><p>The vast majority of people who were self-employed and who do not have the resources to look after themselves will get support from the State.</p></speech>

This is totally different from the case of anyone else.  Ms O'Brien raised the issue of people who could not transition from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance.  These people can access credits.  However, self-employed people cannot do so for some strange reason.</p></speech>

I think it relates primarily to the underlying level of PRSI paid while self-employed.  An employee pays PRSI at a higher rate than a self-employed person and has access to additional services as a consequence.  In that sense, he gets credit.  Self-employed people do not.  Does Mr. Egan wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

That is why, as Ms O'Brien said, we typically see jobseeker's benefit individuals going on to jobseeker's credits if they have sufficient means.  The self-employed are different.  If a self-employed person has sufficient credits in his own right, he would qualify for a credit payment.  In the vast majority of cases, however, that would not be the case.</p></speech>

If she gives me the details on the individual cases, it will help in our consideration of them.  With regard to the a person going from community employment to JobBridge and then becoming ill and not having access, it sounds like an anomaly that we need to tackle.  I absolutely agree on that.</p> <p>  On the question of people on illness benefit having access to schemes, the illness benefit scheme is meant to be a short-term scheme, primarily for people who are ill and cannot work.  That might be more difficult in terms of saying people who are on illness benefit should have access to schemes and services.</p></speech>

I said a person on illness benefit can access the back-to-education allowance but must be on the illness benefit for two years.  However, the individual in question was on illness benefit on a short-term basis, perhaps for 13 months.  He went to his caseworker six weeks before the day of starting college and nobody advised him properly.  He has been left high and dry.  I can give the delegates his exact details and PPS number.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what he said about the INOU.  The INOU has played a very important role in the changes and has worked with the Department doing customer research, etc., for us.  It keeps us honest and on our toes.  It is a useful service to have.  I commend the organisation on its work.  It does it in a very civilised way, which makes it even more effective.</p> <p>  Unemployment triggered the process of change.  With unemployment of 4%, we could have processes and systems in which gaps are not necessarily visible.  When unemployment increases to 15.2%, the flaws in the system become very apparent.  The flaws were probably pointed out before, to be fair, but they were not that material in terms of impacts.  Suddenly they became material in impact and must be dealt with.  That is what triggered the change.  The process is not by any means finished.</p><p>It is an ongoing process of change.  Whether it will ever be fully finished is another matter.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have been doing this for about four to five years now, we are still in a period of fairly intense change.</p><p> We were asked for our views and advice for the Minister and who will be drafting.  The feedback from our consultation process is that the Department has a challenge.  The term used was "the broadening and deepening challenge".  This is language adopted from Europe.  On the one hand, we have to deepen the service by improving the quality.  There is a sense that during recent years, we have been through a period in which we have been responding to process inefficiencies, changing processes, focusing on throughput and dealing with the big volume.  We now need to consider embedding and deepening the quality of the service.  At the same time, we must recognise that there is a need to broaden the service to the kinds of cohorts discussed here today.  The next phase involves striking a balance between continuing to deepen it and at the same time broadening it.  That will be the challenge in the next phase of drafting.  The drafting will be done within the Department of Social Protection working with other Departments, such as the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Certainly, the drafts will be considered by the Government and the Labour Market Council, of which Ms O'Brien is a member.  Then they will be brought to the Government.  Our intention is to bring them to the Government no later than January of next year.  The Government will then decide on the final content.  That is the usual process; officials draft and Government decides.  However, we will be drafting in as consultative a way as we can, bearing in mind that ultimately it is a Government decision.  I believe I have covered everything.  I may not have.</p></speech>

Clearly, it is not straightforward, as Senator O'Donnell would recognise.  It is becoming increasingly complex as different programmes are rolled out.  Of course, we welcome those programmes.  Participation is linked to certain criteria such as live register status.  We have for a long time encouraged the Department to make information available in as simple a form as possible in order that people understand what they are entitled to, the qualifying criteria, the payments, etc.  That is work the INOU does itself.  It is very important.</p> <p>  Some of the points Mr. McKeon made on the access people not currently in receipt of a jobseeker's payment have to various programmes and services are useful.  Clearly, we are not saying people who are not in receipt of a jobseeker's payment are not entitled to access any supports or programmes because clearly we know they are.  Unfortunately however, a significant cohort is not entitled.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to some who are very much unemployed and who would not have made the transition, for example, from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance and who have a strong sense that they are not now entitled to anything.</p> <p>  It is important that the INOU and the Department continue to provide information on what people qualify for and specifically on the services available.  Mr. McKeon touched earlier on the communication around that.  It is very important.  This reflects a number of conversations we had while the Intreo service was being rolled out.  There is a sense that, in some ways, the Department was not publicising what we regard as a potentially very useful service and its positive aspects.  There are some services that people can access but many do not know they are available.  Some might take the initiative and walk into an Intreo office and receive good information or signposting on what might be available locally, but others do not.  There is certainly a sense that the Department needs to do more outreach work to promote the services available and actively encourage people to find out what is available, avail of it and obtain whatever advice and information is available.  That is very important.  A positive and strong public information campaign on some of these issues is important.  As an organisation, we are anxious to work with the Department on this.</p><p> Deputy Conaghan made a point about the changes that unemployed people undoubtedly experienced with the new Intreo service.  Mr. McKeon mentioned the work that we have done on researching people's experiences.  The second phase of that work involves their experiences with local employment services.  However, I would not underestimate the challenges that remain.  We still find ourselves advocating on behalf of people who, for a variety of reasons, are either not receiving the service they believe they are entitled to or are finding themselves increasingly struggling to access payments.  This accounts for a significant amount of our work.  While the service has changed in terms of how it is structured and so on, and this is very welcome, the change has not been universal, and issues remain.  For example, training is needed for Department of Social Protection staff.  That training should be ongoing.  The situation has improved, but we still receive feedback to the effect that, unfortunately, the service is not always as it should be.</p></speech>

If Intreo and the Department want a real sense of what people experience when they go to the offices, they need to survey people on an ongoing basis.  Perhaps the witnesses can tell me whether this next happens - I do not believe that it does yet - but it would be wonderful to attend an Intreo office to be told that I am a customer and my input is valued and to be asked to fill out a form, which would be examined with a view to bringing about changes, including the training to which Mr. Stewart referred.  In trying to improve the service, I would love to see this happening.</p></speech>

I had not noticed something like this before, although it has probably been in other material that has appeared on my desk.  The figure is nearly double that of the live register.  The potential supply of labour statistics seem to capture the type of people about whom I am talking.  They might also capture others.  I understand the demands on the Department, but when spare capacity emerges in the labour activation measures that were put in place in recent years, instead of reducing that capacity, could we consider whether they might be used to capture people who are underemployed, unemployed or dependent adults.</p> <p>  I welcome the clarification about people being able to access education schemes.  I know of a number of those.  While some people can work, what others want is access to a scheme because they are seeking qualifications, not to be sent directly into the workplace.  A number of schemes are limited in terms of hours, so it is good that this matter is being examined.</p> <p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland, which I had hoped would attend this meeting, stated in its pre-budget submission that there was a need to calculate unemployment or availability for work on the basis of hours and not days.  I also made this point.  Some people are underemployed and, as such, do not qualify for payments.  It is not because of their incomes, but because their employments are spread over a number of days.</p><p>Although this suggestion would require a major change in the calculations, it was only a few years ago that another major change was made, namely, that relating to the number of days worked to allow someone to qualify.  The problem is that we did not move from days worked or not worked to hours worked.  This might be discussed at a later date.</p><p> While signing on for credits is fine, how many people in the group to which I referred cannot even do that and, as such, have no access?  I referred on a number of people on the presumption that they could sign on for credits but I was not 100% sure.  God knows how long I have been dealing with people but if even I cannot determine whether someone who appears before me will qualify for a credit, the normal Joe or Josephine will find it difficult.  I welcome the departmental officials' increased awareness of the need to split the claim.  If people understood that no income would be lost, the Department would see more people.  Simple clarification of this and a range of issues would help everyone.</p></speech>

I am delighted that Mr. McKeon has outlined the wide range of services that are available for people with disabilities.  The problem is that they were not mentioned in the Action Plan for Jobs.  I raised this omission at the time, as we must always look for the ability and not the disability.  Just because someone is in a wheelchair does not mean that he or she cannot come in here and do a decent day's work.  Unless people's disabilities are severe, they are well able to work and want to work.  There are officers in the employment offices to help people with disabilities.</p> <p>  I have always advocated the return of CERT courses.  An extended member of my family would not be the greatest academic but he could cook for Ireland.  That is his niche, so I have always encouraged him to develop it.  I was delighted last Friday when I attended the official opening of the refurbished Kerry College of Further Education in Tralee and found that it ran a course for chefs.  One does not need to go through the CAO process to apply.  Perhaps the Department of Social Protection should promote courses like these for people who may not want to return to university or academic surroundings when a more practical setting would suit them.  We should promote these skills alongside more structured education.</p></speech>

That is important.  To address another point, the National Women's Council of Ireland was invited to attend but was not able to do so this time.  Compared with other countries, a high percentage of women here are not working.  Our processes are not reaching many women.  We need to do more about that.</p> <p>  I encounter many young people, so I am not sure that I agree with the suggestion that, if their parents are over the threshold but not well off, they can access services.  Sometimes, a young adult might not see eye to eye with or be supported by his or her parents.</p><p>The other situation I have dealt with is that of parents who are absolutely tearing their hair out trying to get young people to engage, but it is difficult because, since they are not in the system, they do not qualify for the payment.  It is very hard when one tries to get the person to sign on for credits.  In the past there has been a lack of knowledge in some social welfare offices about people&rsquo;s entitlement to sign on for credits.  It is worth thinking about having a poster in every social welfare office which explains who can sign on for credits and what signing on for credits can do in terms of eligibility for schemes such as JobBridge.  The use of social media can be a cheap way to carry out promotional campaigns, and social media are where younger people are at.  This is another thing the Department should think about.</p></speech>

It happens that even in the advertising of simple information we think we are communicating but we are really not, and that is why people are falling between stools.  Communications plays an enormous part and the use of social media by our Intreo offices is important.  There has been an incredible amount of work done through the Intreo offices and services to try to get people back to their sense of self and a sense of worth.  It is always the communication that falls down &ndash; there is a presumption that it is happening when it is not.  I am presuming that this may be one of the outcomes of the INOU report, which will be very interesting.  It is not as though the Department does not want to see things happening, but we do not communicate very simply, informatively or imaginatively to those people who most need it because there is a presumption that they know what is happening, although they may not.</p></speech>

I apologise for my absence during the presentations.  Men and women who have stayed at home to look after their children are one of the most common issues that Members face in constituency offices.  When the kids are raised the parent might look to return to the workforce by reskilling or retraining, but find that there is absolutely nothing available because one of the partners is working and bringing in an income.  It is a huge issue.  I have seen people break down in my office as they feel there is no future for them, there is no help and nobody wants them to work.  These are people who have done a service to the State in raising their children and bringing them to an age at which they have left the nest.  The parent wants another chance to go back out working again and contributing to the community.  We know that age discrimination does exist in the workforce.  Whether we like it or not, it is there.  For these people to have a hope of retraining, they need the State to step in.  I believe there used to be Departments that would help in retraining and re-educating these people to go back into the workforce, but with the recession this assistance was taken away.  As the economy grows and as things get better, we need to look at putting these services back in place.  I have also been pushing this same issue for years for the self-employed - another concern that has just been pushed into a corner and forgotten about.  We should definitely should look at this through social protection and start a new system for these people.</p></speech>

The issue is about cultural and societal attitudes towards age and long-term unemployment.  This is why there are schemes such as JobsPlus and MOMENTUM, which are specifically targeted at people who are long-term unemployed.  Anybody has access to the public employment service but they do not necessarily have access to every employment programme.  They do have access to the training and education programmes provided by the State but they may not have access to the training allowance that is sometimes paid to people who are on a social welfare payment and go on a training programme.  If a person has means, then they would not have access to the training allowance.  There may be a charge levied for access to VEC further education programmes but in the case of the training centres, the F&Aacute;S programmes as they were known, there is no charge.  That is the current position.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan made reference to surveys. The Department is currently in the process of a survey.

For example, I know from the industry in which I worked previously that when a person receives a service in a mobile phone shop, he or she will, within a day, receive a text to rate that service between one and five.  We are examining that kind of approach.  The responses to that approach are more immediate but the structured survey by experienced researchers is the best way to gauge feedback.  The Department has also just evaluated the tender so a contractor will be appointed very soon to conduct a metrically based analysis of the difference in impact between those clients served in Intreo centres and clients still served in offices not yet Intreo.  There are very few of those but we can research from when we started and track progression.  It will be interesting to see what that kind of econometric analysis indicates.  Personally, I am more interested in the client experience response but we shall see what is the outcome</p> <p>  I agree that the potential of additional people entering the labour force creates interesting data and it gets more interesting the lower the unemployment rate falls because one is moving from a situation of labour oversupply to one of labour constraint.  In counting the relative ratios for that kind of measure in Ireland compared to the rest of Europe, Ireland is not out of line regarding the ratio of the potential additional labour force to the number of people who are registered unemployed.</p> <p>  Female participation in the labour force is also an issue across Europe.  The participation rate of females in the labour force in Ireland is measured by the standard of those aged 15 years and over.  We actually have a higher level of female participation than the average across the member states of the EU and it is growing.  One of the things affecting the data - and it will probably grow a bit faster -  is that the participation rate generally in Ireland has fallen, even though female participation has grown slightly.</p><p>The fall in the participation rate is entirely accounted for by people staying in education longer.  The fall in participation is entirely in the under-25 age group.  It will be interesting to see, as the economy recovers, whether that reverses and whether people were staying on in education because they had no employment opportunities when they left school.  The very early, tentative indications are that it is holding.  Over the past five years, the norm has been for almost everyone to go on to further education.  It looks like that will hold, notwithstanding a recovery.  It is very tentative and we should be conscious that we are only in the early days.  I take the suggestions on social media and better information in our offices.  That is something we will continue to look at.  We have Twitter and Facebook accounts.  They are not the most followed accounts in the world so we need to look at what we can do about that.</p></speech>

Sometimes we run into issues - sometimes we do not - when we want to invite jobseekers to a free job fair where there are employers and sometimes eyebrows are raised about whether we should use the contact detail we have to advise them.  The Department's view is that we can and should and that it is proper.  There has been no determination on it.</p></speech>

There is nothing like simple information in an office - simple, clear information on a wall.  The Minister was here four years ago when we had this conversation about the creative aspects of communication that could be used.  It was used very successfully by the banks in their good and very bad days.  It is simple, informative, clever information that we can see is necessary.  There is nothing even like the shop notice board.  The number of people who will find something on a board in a shop and get a job from it is surprising.  To use simple information in an Intreo office or where people congregate is the best way to do it.  Twitter will not save the world.  It is etherised.  I do not think only looking at social media is the right way to go.  There are other very different ways.</p></speech>

Someone else who is trying to get back into the labour force and who is perhaps coming from a position of care is likely to answer "no" to the second question because it may take them longer than two weeks to organise whatever it is they need to organise.  Likewise, someone who has a transport issue may not be able to take up work in the next two weeks.  That is why we find the potential supply of labour figure very useful because it captures people who answer "yes" to those two questions, people who answer "no" to one or other of them, and people who are working part-time but would like to be working more hours.  It captures the extent of the challenge that faces us in terms of all the people who would seek work if everything was working out for them.</p></speech>

There will be a question and answer session with members, who may be coming and going as there is so much going on today.  This will be an interesting session.  Members will not make speeches - they should keep them for the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.<br/><br/>Before we begin, witnesses should note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded that under the rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am the executive director of BeLonG To youth service.  BeLonG To is Ireland's national  lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, youth organisation.  We aim to support and resource LGBT young people through a range of different services and supports around the country.</p> <p>  Our drug service is unique in that it is the only service in the country which works with LGBT populations around their drug use.  The service is a long lasting service, set up in 2007 on foot of research which showed some complexity of drug uses in LGBT populations.  It is funded since 2007 through the North Inner City Drugs Task Force, the support for which we are very grateful.  To explain the rationale behind our submission, I am delighted to welcome my colleague, Mr. Gerard Roe, BeLonG To's drugs and alcohol education and outreach worker.</p></speech>

BeLonG To's submission advocates in favour of altering the current approach to sanctions for the possession of a certain amount of drugs for personal use.  We believe it is in the best interests of LGBT young people, and indeed all young people, that legislative change is needed to address how we treat those who are found in possession of drugs for their personal use.</p> <p>  Studies have revealed that drug use is widespread among LGBT young people and is more prevalent than in the general youth population.  Findings from our research indicate that LGBT young people are two to five times more likely to consume drugs than their heterosexual counterparts.</p> <p>  Many LGBT young people experience different forms of discrimination and social exclusion, most visibly in the form of homophobic and transphobic bullying.  As a result, LGBT young people are often likely to suffer from poor mental health and experience high levels of suicide ideation, self-harm and problems with alcohol and drugs use.  Statistics also illustrate a correlation between mental health and drug use.  With such high levels of drug use and mental health issues among this population, surely the response needs to be dealt with as a health issue rather than one of criminal justice.</p> <p>  From my unique position as the sole drugs worker for the LGBT community, I have seen how current practice and legislation impacts negatively on my target audience.  BeLonG To is not geographically bound.  The young people who seek support through our services come from all different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.  In my experience, it is mostly working class young people who come into contact with the criminal justice system.  They are more likely to be stopped and searched and to be found in possession of drugs for personal use and therefore most likely to be criminalised.  The criminalisation of drug use often lends itself to the stigma that surrounds it.  We believe that decriminalising drugs for personal use will lift the barriers and stigma surrounding drugs and drug use.</p><p>The resources used to criminalise the possession and use of drugs could then be redirected into good evidence based education, harm reduction treatment and smart campaigns.</p><p> The intention of current legislation is to outlaw and prevent people from using drugs but, as the research shows, it has not achieved this.  Drug use and the availability of drugs is widespread across all sections of society.  It is realistic to think that with drug use at such high levels it has now become a public health issue and should be treated as such.  My local expertise is backed up by international evidence.  Portugal, reacting to having one of the highest rates of drug use in Europe, decriminalised all drugs in 2001.  The report of the Irish delegation to Portugal has shown that there has been significant societal impact since decriminalisation.</p><p> While it is still illegal to possess and sell drugs in Portugal, there has been a significant decrease in drug related crime, overdose, HIV and drug use, especially among the youth population.  It is of no surprise that other countries are now following suit, treating drug use as a public health issue instead of one of criminal justice.  International bodies such as the World Health Organisation and the European Convention on Human Rights also call for the decriminalisation.</p><p> I will conclude by saying that BeLonG To is in favour of altering Ireland's current approach to the possession of limited quantities of certain drugs.  In our experience, current legislation actually prevents LGBT young people from seeking support for their drug use for fear of criminal sanction.  LGBT young people are also less inclined to disclose or discuss their drug use due to the stigma that surrounds criminality, drugs and addiction.  We believe that while the current legislation has been set up to outlaw and prevent drug use it has not achieved this in Ireland.  International evidence has shown that the stated aims and objectives of prohibition of illegal drugs have not been successful.</p><p> We now have a unique opportunity to learn from the approach taken in Portugal and move towards a future that treats drugs users in a more humane and dignified way by addressing drug use and addiction as primarily a health issue.  We need to have an effective drugs strategy that complements a new and effective drugs policy or we run the risk of continuing to fail.  To quote the delegation report on the visit to Portugal,  &ldquo;It takes a lot to make an honest person to become a criminal&rdquo;.</p></speech>

I thank the members for their attention to what we are trying to promote.  Our task force covers the area from Clontarf, Howth, Darndale, parts of Baldoyle and some of the Dublin 3 and Dublin 5 areas.  At local level we are mandated to implement, in as far as we can, the National Substance Misuse Strategy.</p> <p>  I have been involved in this work for some time.  The argument I would put forward at this stage is that it is time for society to look in new ways at the how addiction is seen and treated.  This is something I have come to slowly, but now is the time to place this whole debate into the health space.</p> <p>  When I was in the  Department this issue arose on two occasions.  There was extreme reluctance to go down that route and the war on drugs was constantly mentioned, in here and elsewhere.  I never believed in the war on drugs.  There is a huge complexity attached to that whole debate and we need to mediate it.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have a key role in that regard.  Addiction should be treated as a public health issue and I believe there are the beginnings of acceptance for that argument.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for helping to open up the debate and we will gladly contribute to it.</p> <p>  Criminality stems from addiction, it is not the other way around.  Anybody who represents a community which is in any way disadvantaged will be aware that the incidence of criminality and disadvantage are all closely linked together.  Any changes in the law on decriminalising drugs for personal use should be part of a broad public health review.  We are probably ready at this stage to hold that debate in Ireland but it needs to be careful and thoughtful.</p><p>Something introduced in another jurisdiction is not the strongest argument going for introducing it in Ireland but there is sufficient evidence available that it helps the person likely to be a victim of substance misuse if there is another approach to their treatment and the criminal justice system is not strictly part of it.  In the same way that we have managed to devise sanctions for the overuse and misuse of alcohol, I have no doubt that the same approach can be adopted in tackling abuse and misuse of substances such as cannabis and others.</p><p> To allay public fears, we must make the distinction between decriminalisation and legalisation as these are two very separate arguments.  It would be futile for us to try fighting in public on the merits of one over the other.  Strategies have been developed in Ireland for some time and some people in this room were pioneers in how the process was driven through the years.  They know that the best routes forward are enlightened ones.</p><p> I will use the task force we represent as an example.  The most recent figures available from the Garda indicate that 79% of detections are for simple possession, with 80% of detections in the most disadvantaged parts of the task force area.  The total number of detections were 557, with 445 from the parts of the constituency that would be regarded as most disadvantaged.  There is no point in decriminalising certain categories of drugs unless that is done in conjunction with other changes in tackling addiction.  That is down to resourcing, and there must be a serious increase in the level of resourcing across the board.  It is very easy to trot this out but evidence can be made available.  The Health Research Board and other research bodies have much evidence accumulated over ten or 15 years to demonstrate that any point we make can be backed up.</p><p> Resources need to be found to change the culture that facilitates and normalises addiction.  Certain parts of large urban areas in this city and others see, regrettably, very young children introduced to substances that lead rapidly to addiction at a very young age.  Programmes grounded in the primary sector, for example, must be implemented seriously and in a widespread fashion.  I urge this committee to encourage the educational sector to be much more proactive in the way it approaches the implementation of the strategy, both at a local and a national level.  There is a wide variety of programmes.</p><p> In future, we can learn from other countries and particularly what has been done when they have gone down the decriminalisation route.  We must adopt a humane and health-focused approach for people apprehended with cannabis for personal consumption and treat those people as patients rather than criminals.  Law enforcement resources must be targeted at drug suppliers and gangland crime.  Task forces are well positioned to identify needs and engage communities but, ideally, policy changes are needed to support those in addiction and punish those engaged in criminality.</p></speech>

I am the founder of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, SSDP, in University College, Cork, and the National University of Ireland, Galway.  I co-authored today's submission to the committee.  My professional experience working in drug policy includes five years working with youth non-governmental organisations, four months with the Pompidou group at the Council of Europe, of which Ireland is a member state, and several consultations in the United Nations.  Currently, I am an adviser to SSDP and the director of Help Not Harm.</p><p>Our current approach to drug policy in Ireland is a failure.  This point is indisputable.  There is, on average, one drug-related overdose in Ireland every day, which is almost twice the number of fatal road crash incidents.  The national student drug survey indicates that one in two third level students have consumed cannabis in the past 12 months alone.  Drugs have never been easier and cheaper to obtain in every town, village and city in the country, from Donegal to Cork.  In Ireland, we have arrested 140,000 people for drug possession over the past ten years, making up 75% of all drug arrests.  That is 40 arrests every day for possessing small amounts of drugs.  A conviction has serious ramifications for a young person's life and the lives of those living in poverty, as the committee well knows.  A conviction may restrict education, work and travel.  Research from the University of Essex indicates that people with cannabis convictions have 19% lower average lifetime earnings than those who do not.  Criminalisation therefore contributes to poverty, stigmatises one in two students and it is not saving lives.  A case we came across as recently as last night, through our own members, is that of a young person convicted for possessing cannabis worth &euro;2.</p><p> Insanity, as defined by Albert Einstein, is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  It is time for Ireland to bring its drug policy into the 21st century.  At SSDP, we recommend the decriminalisation of personal drug possession in a holistic approach that includes education and treatment, in light of the committee's report on its trip to Lisbon last June.  Many countries have taken this approach already and I commend the committee for investigating the Portuguese example.  Ireland has 15 times as many drug-related deaths as Portugal, which has the lowest incidence among all European Union countries.  As a result of decriminalising drugs in Portugal in 2001, HIV rates have halved and there has been a reduction in injecting drug use and drug use by minors.</p><p> With austerity, a number of Garda stations in the country have closed but somehow we are actively investing scarce resources into arresting 40 people per day on non-violent personal drug possession charges.  We do not arrest 40 people per day for hard, violent crime, and the excuse given is that there are not enough resources.  We must redistribute Garda resources and determine who is a bigger threat to society.  Is it the college student smoking cannabis in his bedroom or the gangs roaming our streets?  If a politician wants to be seen as tough on crime, this is the perfect opportunity.  We will vote for anybody who comes forward to support decriminalisation.</p><p> All drug use, including alcohol consumption, is only problematic for approximately 10% of people, according to Columbus State University.  We do not criminalise people who consume alcohol in a harmful way and instead we help them.  We should do the same with all drugs.  Current drug policy does not prevent drug use but it does prevent people getting help.  If our goal is to minimise harm and save lives, the evidence from Portugal indicates that a more balanced, social and just approach with decriminalisation is the minimum solution.  With the national drugs strategy due for renewal, we hope the committee will consider our proposals.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

As we outlined in our submission, decriminalisation of personal possession is certainly a very positive step to take towards battling the problems associated with drugs in our country today.  However, it is important to be honest about the shortcomings of decriminalisation and seriously explore the possibility of legalisation and strict regulation of drugs.</p> <p>  The knee-jerk response to any mention of legalisation of drugs is fear that it would increase availability.  This is not true.  Drugs are incredibly easy to find in any town in this country, despite their illegality.  What we currently have is an entirely unregulated black market for drugs.  It is precisely because drug use is risky that we want to explore a regulated market.</p> <p>  It is essential to accept that large sections of our society engage in illegal drug use.  This will always be the case, whether it is a nurse smoking a joint after a stressful day, a student taking ecstasy at a party, an artist taking LSD because he or she is curious about the perceptions of reality or a homeless heroin user trying to forget the pain of his or her early life.  We can shake our heads and wonder why people engage in activities that seem irresponsible and pointless to some of us or we can accept that some people will always engage in risky behaviour.  We should allow them to do so without being branded criminals or greatly increasing that risk by the fact that the only drugs available are of unknown origin and purity.</p> <p>  We have a chance to create a correctly regulated drug market, learning from the mistakes made with alcohol and cigarettes.  There should be strictly regulated marketing, with no pushing of products or sponsoring of sporting events.</p><p> Many countries around the world have realised that the war on drugs is not working, and governments are starting to take action.  From Portugal to Uruguay and from Colorado to Washington, Governments are investigating new approaches.  It is time for us to seriously consider moving the control of drugs from criminal gangs to the governments who are supposed to have our best interests at heart.  Legalisation and regulation are the only way to do this.</p></speech>

Second, it is important to indicate that the views expressed in this submission are those of the ACJRD in its independent capacity and are not those of the ACJRD members' organisations or their employers.  I propose to present a r&eacute;sum&eacute; as required, but before doing so I wish to state that I am very obliged to both Professor Catherine Comiskey and Denis Murray for assisting the ACJRD in compiling this submission.  Mr. Murray is a family therapist.  Ms Comiskey is a professor who has kindly agreed to attend today to assist the committee with her very broad research knowledge and statistics on this area, for which I thank her.<br/><br/>Initially, in the ACJRD submission, we raised some queries about the Lisbon document.  We pointed out that it might be useful to the discussion to have the following: more data on the less positive or negative results of the Portuguese policy; empirical evidence to support the contention that the criminalisation of addicts was counterproductive and prevented them from seeking help; the metrics that determine what &quot;personal use&quot; quantities might be; the resource implications in Portugal of reporting to the Commission for Addiction Dissuasion; information on whether the Portuguese State has power to require treatment, the type of follow-up treatment and how it might work; data showing that users gained full-time employment and did not go back to drugs, which was mentioned in the report, but without supporting data; and statistical analysis of the outcome in Portugal over the past 15 years.  <br/><br/>In relation to literature reviews in this area, ACJRD would like to point to its 2013 annual conference paper, entitled Preventable Harm: Criminal Justice, Communities &amp;amp; Civil Society, which examined the matter before today's committee.  On a previous occasion we made presentations on the relationship between gangland crime and drugs, which we feel ought to influence this particular discussion.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to research, I am obliged to Professor Comiskey, who will elucidate this matter later on.  Research conducted by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol has indicated that the use of illegal drugs is widespread and spans all age groups in Irish society.  A NACDA report in 2009 demonstrates that in 2006, the number of persons who used opiates in this country was over 20,000, which means 7.2 persons per 1,000 of population.  International research has shown that treatment for opiate use works, but more is needed in terms of rehabilitation and recovery.  It also demonstrates that access to drug treatment reduced levels of crime and improved social functioning.  The ROSIE Study, which was<b></b>conducted in Ireland by Professor Comiskey, is indicative of a similar position in this jurisdiction.<br/><br/>In terms of the promotion of health and well-being, we support what Mr. Carey said a few moments ago about the necessity for a health framework.  A study carried out by Youth Work Ireland in Cork in 2011 indicated that social interventions, rather than a medical or legal approach, offered the best outcomes.  Also, family therapists reporting on the outcomes of regular contact with the Garda by young people with regard to purchasing alcohol, around which there is a lack of regulation, have suggested that there is a need to promote health and well-being if a policy of decriminalisation of certain drugs is to be pursued.  Family therapists also suggested, in terms of adolescent addiction services, that they had a preference for putting resources into early intervention and protective or preventative measures.  Furthermore, statistics from the HSE for 2013, which are in the submission, show that a high and increasing level of contact with young people who have multiple addiction support needs must involve the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and child protection services.</p><p>Issues of self-esteem, indebtedness, poor school attendance, lack of motivation, memory loss and mental health concerns are often minimised by young people as separate from their substance use.  The changing profile of drug use presents challenges to services in terms of establishing a broad range of treatment responses.  A study by the Family Support Network of Ireland highlights that intimidation and threats of violence are increasing among families whose members have drug-related debts.  A study comparing various therapeutic responses revealed that multi-dimensional family therapy, MDFT, produced better outcomes for young people.  </p><p> In conclusion, we suggest that we need more empirical data on how the Portuguese experience worked out.  We need to learn from literature review and research, both nationally and internationally.  Primarily, treatment is key for drug addiction, and there is a correlation between treatment and reduced crime rates.  Plus, any proposed decriminalisation must be done within a health and well-being promotion framework.  Adolescents are already a particularly vulnerable group with respect to addiction, requiring early intervention and protective or preventative measures.  They require a singular focus in the context of any proposed decriminalisation of the use of certain drugs.  All of those matters have huge resource implications, as previous speakers have mentioned, and that is a view that we support.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the IPRT is not a drug treatment service organisation, but we support progressive reform of the penal system, with imprisonment used as a last resort. Over the years we have observed, in research, the intimate connections between drug use and offending behaviour.  It is important to point out that the IPRT understands decriminalisation, as opposed to legalisation, to be a reform of the law that would abolish criminal sanctions in respect of the act of possession, but would continue to enforce a prohibitionist regime by shifting the response to a civil or administrative or, ideally, a health-based response.</p> <p>  IPRT firmly holds four views on the issue.  First, a focus on addressing the root causes of personal drug misuse would be more cost-effective and socially effective than continuing to expend enormous resources on criminalisation and, in some cases, imprisonment.  Second, low-risk offenders, including those found in possession of drugs, could be safely and efficiently removed from the criminal justice system, which would reduce some of the pressure on prison places and resources.  Third, and crucially, moves to decriminalise certain drug-related offences must be met with investment in evidence-informed substance misuse services, treatments and interventions in the community, because decriminalisation cannot happen in isolation.  The last point, which is very dear to our hearts, and which I do not think will be raised by other witnesses, is that securing employment or training and the ability to rebuild one's life after committing an offence, after conviction or after addiction is crucial to breaking the cycle of offending.  With the Portuguese model, no conviction was recorded when somebody came into contact with the committee on dissuasion.  Along with enacting effective spent convictions legislation, we would see that aspect as essential in any model designated for decriminalisation.</p> <p>  To adopt decriminalisation as an approach does not imply that drug use or abuse is not a serious issue or one that does not demand a response.  Instead, it recognises that drug use is an issue that demands an effective response.  Using a criminal justice response, which includes prison, to tackle a chronic relapsing condition such as drug addiction is counterproductive for the individual and the community.  Criminalising possession is not supported by strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing the number of repeat possession offences, and it compounds the cycle of disadvantage.</p> <p>  It is important to note the consensus with regard to international research.  One finding by many major national and international bodies is that there is no link between the severity of punishment and the level of drug use in society.  In 2012, the Release centre launched a report analysing 21 jurisdictions that had decriminalised possession of all or some drugs and found no increase in the prevalence of drug use.  That finding has been echoed and amplified by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and, most recently, by the UK Home Office in its 2014 policy paper.  There is consensus that decriminalisation has no impact on drug use, but it would have an impact on the wastage of resources within the Irish criminal justice system in terms of Garda time, court time and prison resources.  When the committee considers this issue it must look not only at the offence position but at that first interaction with the criminal justice system.  Addiction or the use of drugs can contribute to other drug-related offences, such as theft and shoplifting, which often arise in relation to drug use.</p><p>A very common sanction in regard to drug possession would be a court ordered fine.  We are aware that in 2014 more than 9,000 people were imprisoned for failure to pay a court ordered fine.  That flow of entries into and out of the prison system not only has an impact on admissions and accommodation for the Irish prison system but also has an impact on such things as security.  Transience in the prison population, caused by high rates of committal on short sentences, increases the risk of illegal drugs entering the system and creates an unstable environment in which it is more difficult to maintain good order.</p><p> We know from the Release report that the Portuguese experience was that while in 1994, 44% of prisoners were incarcerated for drug related offences, in less than ten years that number had halved to 21%.  This resulted in a major reduction in prison overcrowding in Portuguese prisons.  In our view, decriminalisation would reduce some of the strains on the prison system but also reduce the number of drug users circulating within that system.</p><p> The cost of prison is enormous - &euro;70,000 per year per prisoner, not including education, court time or prison time.  To use the full force of the criminal justice apparatus is an expensive and ineffective response to personal drug possession and it potentially diverts resources away from services and supports and Garda time that could be used much more effectively to address the more serious offences and offending.</p><p> I mentioned the impact of the Portuguese approach and the fact that no criminal conviction was recorded in those cases.  We would simply reiterate that along with effective spent convictions legislation, which we still do not have, this would be a crucial part of the system of decriminalisation.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust views the introduction of this model, if properly researched, properly resourced and properly operationalised, as one which has very strong potential to represent an innovative and cost-effective response to drug misuse and related offending.</p></speech>

We welcome this opportunity to draw attention to a few points which we ask the committee to consider when drafting any strategy in this area.</p> <p>  The Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW, founded in 1971, is the national organisation of professional social workers in the Republic with more than 1,000 members.  As social workers we work in partnership with individuals, families and groups experiencing marginalisation, disadvantage, social and emotional difficulties.  We view the client in the context of the society or system in which they exist and not solely as an individual.</p> <p>  Our key recommendations are that drug treatment services actively prioritise adults who are parents for treatment, both outpatient and inpatient.  Effective treatment of the parent can and does have positive impacts on the health, welfare, and safety of the child. The Hidden Harm report in Northern Ireland highlighted that parental problem drug misuse can and does cause serious harm to children at every age from conception to adulthood.  Children are at higher risk of emotional and physical neglect or abuse, poverty and material deprivation, and poor physical and mental health in adulthood.</p> <p>  We recommend that part of the existing homeless services provide accommodation and associated services exclusively to pregnant women and their partners or to parents who are in treatment and are caring for newborns.  The Child Care Act 1991 highlights that the welfare of the child should be of paramount consideration.  A commitment from homeless services to allocate, provide and prioritise accommodation specifically for families would be welcomed.</p> <p>  Our association recommends that the number of short-term beds which are set aside for stabilisation purposes be increased.  We recommend that domestic violence services offering emergency accommodation offer placement to those with drug issues who are engaged in treatment.  A number of the services which provide emergency accommodation request that those who are offered placement are "stable in drug treatment".  Imposing such a condition continues to leave women who are often already vulnerable, further isolated and without access to a service which we firmly believe would be of huge benefit.  While the progress of those attending treatment obviously varies in the level of stability they are achieving, the fact that individuals have committed to a programme is a clear indication of motivation towards rehabilitation.</p><p>We recommend that homeless services set aside a residential service or services admitting those who have entered into drug treatment residential programmes and have successfully completed them.  Many former drug users find themselves homeless after completing rehabilitation.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to voice our views.  I welcome any comments which members may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Geoghegan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015101400002#K00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  Merchants Quay Ireland welcomes the opportunity to make an input into this debate.  We appreciate it is a topical debate and one that engenders a large range of emotional and ideological responses.  Merchants Quay Ireland is a national drug treatment service and provides services across the spectrum of drug misuse from crisis intervention services through to detox, community detox, residential detox, residential rehabilitation, aftercare and some social housing.  As such, any input we have into the debate is specifically from a drug treatment perspective as this is where our experience and expertise lie.</p> <p>  Merchants Quay Ireland views addiction as primarily a health and social issue and as such believes that it is best dealt with in the health and social care system.  It is our firm belief, based on our many years of experience, that diverting drug users from the criminal justice system into drug treatment services is by far and away the most effective way of addressing the drugs problem.  In this regard, as a number of the earlier presenters have mentioned, there is strong evidence, both from Irish and international research, that engagement in drug treatment leads to significant and sustained reductions in drug use, drug related crime and anti-social behaviour.  Professor Catherine Comiskey can speak much more fully about the ROSIE study on drug treatment outcomes which was conducted in Ireland under the auspices of the national advisory committee on drugs.  It showed that where there was engagement in drug treatment, regardless of what type of modality people engaged in, whether crisis services, day services, residential services, and regardless of whether it was a harm reduction approach or a total abstinence approach, there were still significant gains right across the spectrum in terms of health, social functioning, relationships and reductions in crime.  Ms Deirdre Malone mentioned the British Home Office.  Its cost-benefit analysis on drug treatment provision estimated that for every &pound;1 spent on treatment there was a &pound;3 saving in terms of criminal justice costs and that saving increased significantly when health and social costs were taken into account.</p> <p>  We see the decriminalisation of the possession of a limited amount of certain drugs as a positive mechanism for diverting people from the criminal justice system into the health and social care services.  I reiterate some of the other points.  The fact that possession of a limited amount of certain drugs for personal use would not be a criminal offence does not mean there would not be intervention with the person.  It simply means that rather than a criminal justice sanction being made, a public health intervention would be made with the person.  It is important to realise that.  In this way, decriminalisation has the potential to impact positively in a number of ways, first, by diverting people into drug treatment and support services at a much earlier stage in their using career.  It is important to remember in terms of drugs and drug use that it is not a one-size-fits all approach.  There is a plethora of drugs and people use them in all different ways.  In terms of engaging with people, the earlier this can be done the better the outcomes.</p><p> The second element, post-drug treatment, is something on which a number of people have touched.  Decriminalisation has the potential to remove one of the most significant barriers to reintegration for those in recovery.  We know, unfortunately, that during the course of their drug use so many drug users come in contact with the criminal justice system and often acquire convictions, either for drug use or related matters.  There is no facility in Ireland to enable these convictions to become spent, which is contrary to the Government's policy on drugs.  The national drugs strategy has a specific rehabilitation pillar which places emphasis on reintegration into society.  It is universally accepted that the best outcome for drug users, including those engaged in crime, is rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  However, the rehabilitation process is severely hampered.  It is nonsense to invest huge amounts of money in trying to engage people in drug treatment, as well as encouraging them to reintegrate into society, when there is such a significant barrier which repeatedly knocks them back in terms of employment, insurance, travel, their own self-esteem and how they feel.  That matter is really important.</p><p> In summary, I would like to highlight a couple of points.  Decriminalisation has the potential to direct drug users out of the criminal justice system and into drug treatment.  In its own way, that would relieve the burden on the criminal justice system, including in overcrowded prisons, the courts which are run ragged and, to some extent, the Garda.  Equally important, for people who are experiencing problems or using drugs, it would increase their access to and contact with drug treatment services.  Other significant public health gains would come out of this, including a reduction in the spread of hepatitis and HIV.  Our experiences during the years have shown us that the criminalisation of drug use does not act as a deterrent when somebody decides to start using drugs.  It does, however, impact significantly on them when they try to stop using them.  From a treatment perspective, therefore, we would welcome this initiative.</p></speech>

When we debated the matter, we discovered that we did not have a Minister of State with responsibility for dealing with the drugs problem.  When we subsequently wrote to the Taoiseach, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was appointed as a result.  I know that the former Minister, Mr. Pat Carey, did great work in this role.  We also travelled to Portugal to assess what was happening there; therefore, all of this flowing from that work.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

The IHCA has decided to make a submission on this issue because we were concerned about a lack of balance in the debate to date.  The public discussion on drug decriminalisation or legalisation appears to have looked at the positive results of liberalisation as opposed to perceived negative consequences.</p> <p>  We fully accept that obtaining a criminal record for the use of a drug brings with it significant adverse consequences which would be removed with decriminalisation.  However, the risk of a criminal record may act as a deterrent to drug use for some people.  It has been noted that decriminalisation is a risk factor for future use and a concern exists that decriminalisation is simply one step along the way to the legalisation and production of drugs.</p> <p>  Increased use of any drug  is likely to result in increased need for accessible treatment and there has been little planning or resourcing for this.  Any treatment should be readily available prior to changing a law to facilitate increased drug usage.</p> <p>  We are concerned that the debate focuses on rights without offering adequate consideration of the harmful effects of drug use.  Many drugs have specific harms, but taken as a whole, they generally do affect one&rsquo;s capacity to function normally when intoxicated.  The emergence of the new psychoactive substances has been noted with concern by many clinicians in Ireland and abroad.  One of the major selling points of these substances is the fact that they can be marketed as legal for some time until legislation can be put in place to deal with their distribution and use.  The fact that they are legal has been reported as one of the factors that people consider when they use the substance.  We feel it is important that the negative effects of substance use, as well as perceived positive effects, are discussed in the public domain.</p> <p>  In  the Netherlands, prevalence data on use of cannabis and other drugs concluded that the policy of depenalisation did not increase the prevalence of cannabis use.  However, they did detect a significant escalation in use of cannabis following the commercialisation of cannabis via coffee shops.</p> <p>  Much has been said about Portugal.  In 2001, Portugal introduced a new law which significantly changed the legal response to drug users.  They ended criminal sanctions for drug possession for personal use but  developed commissions for the dissuasion of drug addiction to direct drug users into treatment.  At the same time, they also developed a drug strategy, similar to our own national drugs strategy, which is likely to have had an impact on the current situation in Portugal.  The Portuguese model  is viewed by some as an unqualified success but there are divergent views on this.  For example, the Cato report said it was a resounding success, while the APLD report considered it a failure.  Both reports have been objectively reviewed and both appear to be very selective in the data which they chose to report.  It has also been argued that the policy of decriminalisation may result in more people entering treatment.  Two other factors need to be considered in relation to this.  First, the commissions for the dissuasion of drug addiction, CEDTs, in Portugal mandated that approximately one third of the people referred to them had to enter treatment because they were deemed to be addicted to the possessed substance.  Second, it has also been suggested that the decriminalisation of drug use made people more willing to seek help from health professionals.  There is evidence that some measures of the level of drug-related harm deteriorated after the new policy was introduced in Portugal.  There was an escalation in deaths linked to substances other than heroin.  There was also an escalation in cannabis use among teenagers.  Our point here is that people can reach different conclusions based on which data they choose to interpret.</p> <p>  There is a constantly evolving picture in the United States concerning drugs, specifically cannabis.  Different states having differing approaches to cannabis in relation to decriminalisation, medicinal use only, full legalisation or prohibition.  Future research from this area will give us an opportunity to examine how these approaches impact on rates of drug use and attitudes among people over time.  This is why we feel we should not rush into this decision but take the opportunity presented by the change in legislation in other countries to assess the impact on drug trends, population health, and society in general.</p> <p>  In the past, the Government has utilised the National Advisory Committee on Drugs - now the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol - to provide scholarly reports on various contentious topics, including harm reduction approaches and dual diagnosis.</p><p>There is an opportunity now to commission a piece of independent, evidence-based research to inform legislators of the intricacies of the proposed approach in this area.  The probability that decriminalisation will result in increased treatment entry is to be welcomed.  However, decriminalising any substance gives some tacit consent to its use and, by extension, the State has a moral responsibility to manage the potential negative health impact for at least some of the people who use those drugs.  This requires proactive planning by treatment commissioners and treatment providers, which has not occurred to date.</p><p> As the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 draws to a close, we are strongly of the view that these factors should be taken into account in developing any new national strategy for 2016 onwards.  We very much welcome being at the table for these discussions because treatment provision for people with drug-related problems has gone off the agenda in recent times.</p></speech>

I am the director of the Ana Liffey Drug Project.  For anyone unfamiliar with the project, it is an non-governmental organisation whose core work is providing direct social and medical services, mostly to active drug users.  We work within a harm reduction ethos, in line with the overall objective of our current national drugs strategy, by seeking to tackle the harm caused by drug use.  We are almost entirely funded by the State or statutory agencies and we are very grateful for that support.  I am accompanied today by my colleague, Mr. Marcus Keane, who is head of policy and advocacy.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it to discuss this important topic.  Having worked in addiction or related services for more than 20 years, I believe the prevailing sentiment regarding drug policy among those who deliver services in Ireland is more positive than I have ever seen.  There is a widespread and honest recognition that our current approach is not as effective as it could or should be, accompanied by a willingness to consider other approaches.  That this committee is discussing the issue of decriminalisation of possession offences is indicative of the current mood and is to be both commended and welcomed.  The fact that possession of certain drugs is a criminal offence makes this committee an appropriate forum for the current discussion, but the evidence internationally is overwhelmingly in favour of drug policy in general shifting from a criminal justice footing to a health footing.  The simple fact is that criminalising people who use drugs enjoys the twin distinctions of being both expensive and ineffective. </p> <p>  This is a useful starting point for a discussion on decriminalisation.  As a policy response, what does criminalisation of possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use achieve?  The objective, presumably, is that should be a deterrent, intended to reduce demand.  However, there is no evidence it is effective in that goal.  The committee has seen this at first hand in the case of the Portuguese experience.  Contrary to predictions, the sky has not fallen in there and that country is not overrun with drug addicts and drug tourists.  As the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, notes, drug prevalence rates in Portugal have not confirmed the theory that decriminalisation, or a less punitive approach, leads to increased use.  Indeed, it seems that criminalisation - or decriminalisation, for that matter - is not significantly linked to demand. </p> <p>  Given that this is the case, the question becomes one of whether criminalisation is the best policy response to the problems associated with possession of drugs for personal use.  The answer to that must be "No".  In fact, criminalisation does nothing to address the issues citizens face which have led them to be in possession of drugs in the first place, nor does it serve to protect society at large.  All it does is simply punish a behaviour.  While it should and must be acknowledged that judges and other officers of court are all too aware of the issues surrounding drug use and do what they can to approach personal drug use from a humane perspective, it must equally be acknowledged that this is not their role.  The criminal justice system is simply not the appropriate system to deal with what is undeniably a health and social issue. </p> <p>  This leads me to my second point, which is to tell the committee about the people we work with at Ana Liffey.  In general, they are problematic drug users, many of whom are also dealing with comorbid issues such as homelessness, mental health diagnoses and physical health diagnoses.  It is a group with complex needs and the fact that possession of drugs is not criminalised does nothing to discourage these people's drug use.  Criminalisation, however, further stigmatise them unnecessarily.  Although people are not dissuaded from their drug use by the existence of the law, they are afraid of the consequences of breaking the law.  I have met people who were scared to seek help because of the fear of criminalisation.  Whether or not they are correct in these beliefs is immaterial; the fact is their beliefs are honestly held and real and act as a barrier to their getting help.</p><p>Thus, the question for me is not whether the <i>status quo </i>of criminalisation for possession should be maintained &ndash; it is ineffective at best and damaging at worst &ndash; but what should replace it.  Drugs can be harmful and drug use can cause great hardship to individuals, families and societies.  It is correct that we as a society have a response for people who are in possession of drugs.  The question is what it should be.  Ana Liffey is an organisation which is committed to reducing harm.  Consistent with that view, we support the implementation of policies that minimise harm.  The committee will be aware that the evidence from Portugal indicates reductions in problematic use, drug-related harms and criminal justice overcrowding.  As such, the Portuguese experience is instructive in terms of the general framing of any policy response.<br/><br/>However, we must look at the issues we face here and develop our own response to suit.  There are many factors to consider when deciding what such a policy might look like in practice.  The Ana Liffey Drug Project is happy to make further submissions to the committee on those possibilities if it would be of assistance.  I am satisfied, in general terms, that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work.  Complex problems require tailored solutions.  A person in possession of cannabis may require a different response from that which should apply to a person in possession of cocaine.  A person found in possession for the third time may require a different response from what should happen when a person is found in possession for the first time.  A problematic drug user may require a different approach from what is appropriate for an occasional drug user.<br/><br/>The important thing is that the approach is person-centred, rooted in health and directed towards realistic and helpful outcomes.  This is true not just of decriminalisation but of drugs policy as a whole.  Drugs policy has traditionally been driven by fear, morality and ideology.  This is no firm grounding, and we have reaped the results.  Instead, we need a drugs policy that is rooted in health and based on evidence, pragmatism and respect for every individual in society.  The criminalisation of simple possession meets none of those standards.</p></speech>

It makes life a lot simpler.  As Mr. Pat Carey said earlier, this discussion would not have happened a few years ago.  I am here on behalf of the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, which is a network of community-based organisations involved in dealing with the drugs issue, initially across Dublin but now across the country.  We have not yet got around to changing our name.  Twenty years ago, when we started working in communities, people locally were looking for a law and order approach to this issue.  They were very clear about that.  Even three or four years ago, we in CityWide would not have been debating the issue of decriminalisation and we certainly would not have had the vast majority of our groups in favour of it, which we do now.</p> <p>  There are two key changes that have taken place.  First, there is now a clarity about what we mean by "decriminalisation," which is to say there is a very clear distinction between decriminalisation and legalisation.  It is interesting to look back to what was happening 20 years ago.  Anyone who was around then will remember the street campaign whose slogan was "Addicts, we care; pushers beware."  Even 20 years ago, people were saying that.  We find that when we ask people, "Do you think a person should be deemed a criminal because he or she uses a drug?", the vast majority say, "No, we do not."  That is what we mean by decriminalisation - that we do not make a person a criminal because of his or her use of a drug.  It is not about drugs becoming legal; that clear distinction is well understood.</p> <p>  The other thing that has had a huge impact in changing people's minds is, as other speakers referred to, greater awareness about the impact of decriminalisation.  As part of our role nationally, we represent the Family Support Network and service users' network on national committees, as they do not have their own representation.  They report very clearly to us the stigma that is involved in being a criminal because of one's drug use, along with all the other things that go along with that.  Other speakers today referred to issues around employment and the barriers to work for people with a drug conviction.  One particular issue that is very relevant to the community sector is the increase in the prevalence of Garda vetting.  One cannot get a job of any description across social services, community services or voluntary services unless one receives Garda vetting clearance.  A lot of people we deal with will not even bother applying for clearance because they are convinced that if they have drug possession on their form, their application will not even be considered.  That is a very significant issue.</p> <p>  Several speakers referred to the concern many people have that decriminalising drug users will mean more people are more likely to use drugs.  However, evidence from the close to 30 countries that have introduced some form of decriminalisation does not back up that concern.</p><p>These countries have decriminalised drug use for very different reasons.  In Germany a case was brought to the federal court and the position was found to be unconstitutional under privacy laws.  In the Czech Republic they have done it for cost-efficiency reasons.  There are various different systems, but across the board no significant increase in drug use has been shown as a result.  It is important to make that point.</p><p> Portugal has been discussed a good deal.  The best thing about the Portuguese model is that those responsible do not over-claim for it.  They do not say decriminalisation is going to solve the drug problem.  What they say is that decriminalisation is one element of the drug policy.  That is crucial.  One of the issues raised by people who are concerned about decriminalisation is that the change would send a message, particularly to young people, that it is okay to misuse drugs.  In fact, the Portuguese system does not do that.  There is a clear intervention.  The key point is that the intervention is now taking place in the public health area rather than the criminal justice area.</p><p> There is another key aspect relating to Portugal.  Decriminalisation is not an answer of itself and it is not going to address all the issues we have discussed.  Some key points identified in Portugal chime with what we already know from the Irish experience.  They are worth reiterating because to some extent they have been forgotten.  First, services have been mentioned and they are crucial.  In the Portuguese set-up there is access to social work, social services and psychologists.  These are services we can only dream about.  Our level of services is a major issue.  That point has been made already.</p><p> Another point relates to inter-agency working.  We cannot provide a range of services without inter-agency co-operation.  We know that.  Indeed, our whole drug strategy is based on that.  We have said in a number of forums recently that inter-agency working is no longer supported in our system.  It is occurring less and less, and we are going back to silo thinking.  This will be an essential part of the package if we are going to decriminalise drug use.  The services must be organised on an inter-agency basis.</p><p> Another key aspect of the set-up in Portugal is the leadership.  I can never remember the title, but they have a director whose job is to ensure co-ordination and co-operation.  There has been a lack of leadership in Ireland in recent times.  You mentioned earlier, Chairman, about the new Minister of State.  We have a Minister of State who is leading strongly on the matter, but we do not have someone in a position on a day-to-day basis to follow up on inter-agency co-operation.  There is a major gap and it needs to be addressed.</p><p> The final aspect from Portugal is another thing we already know but have forgotten.  It relates to the connection between drug use, disadvantage and poverty, and the point that the underlying issues need to be addressed.  We should look at introducing decriminalisation and we should use the opportunity to effectively reinvigorate the drug strategy.  We already have all the principles in our strategy, but in recent years we have not seen them operating.  This would be a great opportunity to try to invigorate and return to the principles that have been effective in the past.</p></speech>

I thank all the speakers and groups who have contributed.  It is refreshing and important for us to hear their varied and wide experience and expertise in the area and to hear so many contributions.  I realise it is not universal and that there is a divergence of views, but many have spoken of the merits of moving to a health-based model as opposed to a purely criminal justice or penal model.</p> <p>  One question struck me following the intervention from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and Ms Quigley relating to the Portuguese experience.  I was not on our delegation that went to Portugal, but we got the impression that it was regarded as successful in terms of harm reduction and better outcomes for persons with chronic addiction.  Is that a fair assessment?  Someone raised the point that there was an alternative perspective on the Portuguese model.  I am keen to hear the views on that.</p></speech>

I have examined the figures relating to young people in particular.  We should keep in mind some of the relevant surveys, such as the health behaviour in school-age children surveys.</p><p>In Portugal there has been a gradual but consistent increase in cannabis use in particular.  It is now the most used drug among the young population there.  The change has arisen since 1999, when it first came in.  Indeed, the rate of cannabis use in Portugal has increased to the extent that it is now only a little below the rate for Ireland.  Therefore, we have an increasing pattern of drug use among young people in Portugal, whereas the Irish statistics for school-age children are on the way down.</p><p> There is a good deal about the Portuguese model that might be worth considering.  That is for sure and I think we need to do that.  However, we have spoken about ideology.  We should not rush in.  We need to stand back.  People have various views.  Not everyone is happy with the Portuguese model and not everyone is happy with the changes in the United States.  Certainly, there is a need to develop services in this country.  If we were to change the legal status of drugs without spending time developing the services then we are going to be in a difficult position.  If more people are using, then, as a percentage, we are going to have more people with difficulties and hence more treatment needs.</p><p> It is not clear-cut.  Depending on what they choose to pick out, people can use various data to support their argument.  It depends on ideology.  It is time for an independent assessment of the data and the studies available, not only those relating to Portugal but from other countries as well, because many jurisdictions are considering this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eamon Keenan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015101400002#Q00200"><p>Portugal is taking a very interesting approach.  Some elements of the drug-related harm-reduction approach are impressive and they certainly warrant examination.  However, to put it all down to a decision in 2001 to decriminalise drugs takes away from the fact that there has been major investment in treatment services in that country.  The Portuguese national drug policy was published in 1999.  It was amended in 2002 subsequent to the legislative change regarding the decriminalisation of drugs.  It is now the case that if a person has a problem with drugs in Portugal, he can get access to treatment at an early stage.  It is more than a question of one legislative change; it is an entire package of care.  As Dr. McCarney has said, people can pick out certain research to suit their arguments.  One of the major criticisms from inside Portugal in respect of the Cato report - the report that is most widely cited to show the benefits of Portugal's approach around decriminalisation - is to the effect that someone was brought in from America and stayed in the country for three weeks and then went back to America.  He then wrote a report of 36 pages and got himself into <i>The Economist</i>and onto the front page of <i>Time</i>magazine.  The argument is that he did not really reflect the nuances of what was going on in Portugal at the time.  It is very interesting and some elements of it are important and laudable, but we need to look at the evidence properly.</p></speech>

The statistics are clear in respect of problematic and injecting drug users and drug-related harm such as HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E.  All of those have clearly gone down.  I do not think there is any dispute on that point.  Therefore, for the most marginalised group of drug users, the evidence is clear.</p> <p>  I repeat the point that no one has ever claimed that decriminalisation alone is going to solve the problem.  We have to keep coming back to that point.  If we do not put in place the services then we will not see any difference.  It should be noted that Portugal is similar to Ireland in that the country has gone through a major recession.  The people there are honest about saying that the level of services they have now is not at the level of services they had previously.  All these factors need to be taken on board.  No one is claiming that decriminalisation on its own is going to be the change that makes all the difference.  However, the overall shift in the approach to policy is the key.  That is what decriminalisation is about.  It is about shifting from criminal to public health.  It does not hold that we will solve all the problems but simply that we will deal with the problems in a different framework.</p></speech>

A point was raised by Ms Quigley and the hospital consultants.  When we were in Portugal we met people working in front-line services.  They said straight out that they could do with more services.  At the same time, they had services and they were impressive.</p> <p>  Another point was made about independent research.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will always make decisions based on quality research and independent assessment.</p><p>We are interested not in good press, but in what works on the ground.  It is important to say that.</p><p> Mr. Roe's submission hit the nail on the head in relation to young people and LGBT.  He mentioned a figure that I need to ask him about.

Research carried out in 2007, which in effect laid the opportunity for the drug service to exist, showed that young adult LGBT people in Ireland were two to five times more likely to consume drugs than their heterosexual counterparts.  This comes from an array of factors.  There is the experiential or curiosity factor, as we know, but also psychological and other societal factors.  As I said in my submission, LGBT young people experience forms of discrimination and social exclusion and that could be one of the reasons for their drug use.</p></speech>

Mr. Carey touched on the need for a careful and thoughtful approach in Ireland.  On the resource issue, Mr. Carey said there is an important role for the education sector.  Can a programme or the education sector prevent a young child who is living in a very negative situation and who has very low self-esteem at age ten, 11, 12 or 13 years going down the road of drug addiction?  Is there such a successful programme nationally or internationally?</p></speech>

It would be futile to suggest that any one intervention could.  As a general criticism of the education sector, and it happened when I was in charge of the strategy also, it has never fully engaged in the full implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Whether it is because of caution or some other reason, I am not really sure.  Apart from initiatives like our own, such as strengthening families programmes, some of our work is going into classrooms on invitation.  However, the engagement of the education sector is marginal, which is unfortunate.  The pressures at second level seem to almost preclude any engagement at all apart, from time to time, in transition year.  Unless there is a joined-up inter-agency approach, the strategy will never have a chance to work.  It is getting ever more complex by the day.  It depends on resources.  A good deal of fresh new thinking needs to be embarked on.  That is why I welcome the debate on criminalisation.  It is not the panacea anywhere and we need to come to the best possible solution for the best possible number of people in addiction, but no one agency or Department can make significant or meaningful contribution to the complexities of substance misuse, whether it is alcohol cannabis or benzos.</p></speech>

It is absolutely crucial.  BeLonG To is here and I was at a meeting earlier in one of the youth services in the north inner city.  They have a crucial role to play, particularly in more disadvantaged areas to support young people who may be at risk or who are already using drugs.  It is one of the reasons we continue to argue that the young people's facilities services fund must be maintained as part of the national drugs strategy.  I emphasise that point.</p></speech>

Many of the young people we see begin to experiment with drugs and alcohol between the ages of eight and ten.  Research on the appreciation of alcohol as a positive thing between the ages of nine and 13 in an American city would suggest that is when it happens.  It ties in with a change in one's capacity to think in the abstract.</p><p>The influence of family and community has a big impact on how people think.  If they are exposed, we need to get in at a very early stage.  According to the statistics, 9% of females and 13% of males under the age of 13 admit to having been drunk at least once in the previous month.  They are alarming statistics.  If we are going to talk about education, it has to come in early.</p></speech>

That is certainly where one might get some early intervention.  We are now on our third generation of substance abusers in this country.  The NACDA has commissioned a study to look at the number of children living with substance abuse.  The ROSIE study showed that for every person in treatment, there was at least one child.  If we have 10,000 or more opiate users on methadone, it is guaranteed that there are at least 10,000 children living with substance abuse.  That is one way to look at it.</p></speech>

If one wants to connect with teenagers and young people, one has to acknowledge the fact that some people will use drugs sensibly without seeing negative consequences, while others will have such consequences.  It is important to be realistic about it in order to connect with people and not to say "Just say no".</p></speech>

After years of working to provide front-line services, does Mr. Geoghegan consider that the health and social care system is good for society and the broader State and community?  Are we taking it seriously enough in terms of the provision of resources for these services?</p></speech>

Dr. Eamon Keenan is involved in drug treatment from the HSE perspective and would say that waiting lists still exist for treatment.  Access to treatment in different parts of the country is highly problematic.  We do not have the resources to provide the treatment that is necessary.  Agencies like ours have to fund-raise in order to provide our detox services.  Ours is one of the few residential detox services in the State.  My overall view, based on my years of experience, is that addiction is part of the human condition.  There are certainly many arguments within the field as to whether it is a disease or a socially-learned behaviour.  I do not think it makes that much difference given that we are not going to find a magic cure whereby one will give someone a tablet which will instantly cure his or her addiction.  It is about how we as a society manage it.  If one is engaged with people and can try to deal with them on a human level in a health and social care setting, one will have more success than by criminalising people, which is unhelpful.  That is not to condone drug use.  I recognise like everybody that some people use drugs without gaining problems in the same way as some people have an occasional cigarette.  All drugs have the potential for harm, however.  It is better to deal with them within a support and social care setting rather than in a criminal justice setting.</p></speech>

They have moved from criminlisation to the health system.  In fact, they recommend that we do not even talk about decriminalisation.  They talk about moving to health rather than the criminal justice system.</p><p>Dr. Keenan wanted to come back in.</p></speech>

It is all very well having laudable documents and producing strategies - for example, the 2009 strategy - saying that alcohol is now part of an overall substance misuse strategy.  The reality is that the resources did not come with that laudable statement.  Therefore, there has not been any shift in respect of alcohol services across the country, apart from a few isolated pockets which have gone out of the way and, as Mr. Geoghan says, may be involved in fund raising.  Resources are key.  This requires money and needs to be properly resourced for people to access treatment.  We have a very good methadone delivery service in this country but there is much to be desired in respect of resources relating to cannabis, cocaine, the new psychoactive substances and alcohol.</p></speech>

I would have had a different view until I went to Portugal.  For all of the flaws that were pointed out to us in Portugal by the different people who presented to us, the general theme overall was that moving it into health was the appropriate thing to do.  We are now in an election cycle so we need to look at initiating the debate, as Mr. Carey quite rightly said.  The time is right.  Drug use is a nationwide phenomenon, not just an urban phenomenon.  I come from a rural part of a mainly rural constituency and I know that many of my neighbours use drugs on a recreational basis and I certainly would not consider them criminals.  I embrace the debate and think a mature and sensible approach will come out of our discussions as a committee.  When the national debate takes off, hopefully, we will adopt a sensible approach to dealing with the misuse of drugs.</p></speech>

Like Senator Conway, I had a very firm view about drugs and their use in the public domain, which has changed slightly.  I very much welcome the various groups coming in and, in particular their submissions, which I read yesterday.  The only outstanding question I have, which was touched on by Senator Conway, concerns what we do next.  Clearly, there is a great deal of research that needs to be done.  I am conscious of Ms Butler's contribution.  I am also conscious of the fact that our report is not empirical.  It is based on the observations of the committee members and the clerk to the committee who were present and on a number of documents that were provided to us.  The bottom line is that I believe either the Department of Health or the Department of Justice and Equality needs to have a full debate with the Portuguese authorities regarding how we can learn more from their model and put in the services that are there.  The only question I have, which is not directed at any one individual, relates to what we do next, aside from promoting or insisting that the Minister for Justice and Equality initiates some kind of cross-departmental approach to this with the Department of Health with a view to compiling more information so that we can take this matter further.</p></speech>

It will run through 2016.  What would be really useful in respect of the terms of reference would be an oversight committee for developing it and putting the issue of decriminalisation on the agenda.  The terms of reference for these kind of committees and processes can sometimes be quite conservative and based on the way we have done it before, so it would be really useful if the issue of decriminalisation was put on the agenda as part of the development of the new strategy with all the other issues we have talked about here.</p></speech>

In that strategy, one of the actions is conducting more research, and part of that research is a national rehabilitation study.  We could look at the decriminalisation and do some research on that.  We have already said we are going to look at the question of where we send people if we do decriminalise drugs.  We do not know which forms of rehabilitation work and which do not work, because that study, which is in the current strategy, was never acted upon.  It needs to be acted upon as a matter of urgency.  I suggest that the committee's next step is to do independent research on decriminalisation involving a longitudinal study and include the question of where we send these people if we do adopt this health model.  We know treatment works.  What about rehabilitation?</p></speech>

What I think would work well would be to use the time to do a piece of independent research looking at what models are out there and what best fits Ireland while simultaneously integrating the services around the country and conducting a gap analysis to see what is not there.  We can then go forward to put that together.  The independent research would need to have a time limit so that we have an endpoint at which we say that we will now make a decision about what to do.</p></speech>

That broad decision to move from one policy area to another would be the starting point.  Obviously, we are very much in favour of moving it to health.  In doing that, it is important to consider what the legal position in Ireland currently is: the possession of drugs that are scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is a criminal offence.  The 2010 Act relating to new psychoactive substances does not criminalise simple possession of those substances, so it is not as if it is a major shift in that regard.  The simple possession of certain substances is not criminalised.</p></speech>

Whatever the outcome, policy makers need to go back to 2007, when the NDRIC report was published.  The recommendations in that report need to be implemented.  They were not implemented, which has probably landed us where we are at this stage.  We need targeted resources and more professionalisation of this sector as quickly as resources permit.</p></speech>

The biggest issue here is that the legislators are far behind society.  We must face up to this issue.  The legislators need to get up to speed.  I firmly believe decriminalisation is the right way to go, but it is not the solution in itself.  If there is a focused policy shift towards decriminalisation, it then forces legislators and Governments of the day to look at the other policy issues that need to be implemented, such as the provision of treatment centres and rehabilitation.  That is where we need to go.  We need a broad opinion about where we would like to go and policies then need to follow that.  The national drugs strategy is contradictory in that it has a rehabilitation pillar but also a criminal justice element.</p><p>The policy, as it stands, does not lend itself to moving towards a decriminalisation scenario.  </p><p> The Irish Hospital Consultants Association said in its statement that it accepts that obtaining a criminal record for drug use brings about adverse consequences which would be removed with decriminalisation but that the risk of a criminal record can also act as a deterrent.  That may be the case with a very small number of people but there are other deterrents which we need to be considering and focusing on.  One is educating people, about which we have already spoken.  If we educate people on the dangers of consistent, harmful drug use, that can act as a deterrent.  I do not think the argument that the risk of a criminal record is a deterrent is good enough or should prevent us from moving to decriminalise drug use.  Indeed, I believe it is counter-productive.  It is not the case that one approach fits all.  We have been talking about the Portuguese, Dutch and Australian models but what we need is an Irish model.  We need an Irish model that works for us.  We can look at all of the models out there and take the best parts from each, but unless we develop an Irish model that deals with the Irish problem, we are not going to address it in any meaningful way.</p><p> When we talk about criminalisation, we are not just talking about people's inability to get a visa or a job.  I met a person at my office last week who had a minor conviction for drug use.  That person had received a letter from the local authority to the effect that he would not be considered for local authority housing for a period of two years because of that conviction.  That is crazy, particularly in the context of the current homeless crisis.  Criminalisation is one of the elements that leads to homelessness and mental health problems, as well as putting people at risk of becoming homeless.  Unless we move to a policy of decriminalisation, we are not forcing legislators or policy makers to look at anything other than the system that currently operates.</p></speech>

Spent convictions legislation was first debated and considered in 2006-2007.  It is now 2015 and we still have a Bill which has not been seen in over a year and a half.  That is a disgrace.  This is something we have campaigned on for many years.  In the absence of moving forward on decriminalisation, the spent convictions legislation must be enacted.  We get calls daily from people with convictions for minor offences who cannot move on with their lives and who, as Ms Quigley said, do not even try.  That obstacle relating to the jobs market is entirely at odds with the policy of this Government on rehabilitation.  The passage of that legislation must happen in the coming months.</p> <p>  There was a suggestion from Dr. Eamon Keenan that there may be some evidence that retaining criminalisation acts as a deterrent.  If criminalisation of drug possession was a deterrent, we would have far fewer people in our courts every day facing drug possession charges.  A study carried out by Release in respect of the position in 21 jurisdictions indicates that decriminalisation of possession of some or all drugs resulted in no increase in the prevalence of drug use.  Indeed, the World Health Organisation, WHO, agreed that there was no clear link between punitive enforcement and lower levels of drug use and that moves towards decriminalisation were not associated with increased drug use.  A British Home Office paper found that, looking across different countries, there was no apparent correlation between the toughness of a country's approach and the prevalence of adult drug use.  The idea that criminalisation has ever acted as a deterrent to possession is simply incorrect.</p></speech>

The latter is as valid as any other research.  We are not philosophically opposed to the idea of decriminalisation but there is a need for a balanced approach.  Any Irish model deserves to have some research done to see what would be the best approach here.</p><p> Having worked for quite a few years in St. Patrick's Institution, I rarely met a young person who was in there just because of possession of drugs.  There were other behaviours - including acquisitive crime and public order offences - associated with their drug use and often this was why they were in the criminal justice system.  Decriminalisation is not going to necessarily wipe the slate clean for everyone and that must be borne in mind.  It all comes down to providing services which can help people and there is across-the-board agreement on that here.  That common ground should be our focus.  </p><p> On the issue of the jobs market and employment, we cannot run away from the fact that if a person is using a drug that impacts upon memory, concentration, motivation, drive and application, that will have an impact on how well he or she might do in the pursuit of a job.  That is the reality of the situation.  However, if we have proper services to help people, to get them back into education and to motivate them to change their behaviour, that will be beneficial and we are all in agreement on that point.</p></speech>

Any policy that is developed must focus on that and must be informed by the work that is being done by adolescent addiction service providers and by their recommendation that education should focus on early intervention and preventative measures.  Some of the policies relating to restorative justice could be moved into that space.  Adolescents, as a particularly vulnerable group, must be a primary focus in the development and implementation of any policy.</p></speech>

Ms Malone and others spoke about the cost of keeping people in prison and a figure of &euro;69,000 per annum was mentioned.  It must be noted that unless we close down a prison, we do not make massive savings.  One must also take into account the costs associated with court cases, with garda&iacute; being tied up waiting for cases to be called, the work of the probation services and so forth, as well as those relating to the Prison Service.  In a decriminalisation scenario, we could move those resources into treatment, as has been suggested by many of today's witnesses but is there any way of quantifying that?  Could we say that if we move to this new model, a great deal of resources will be freed up which can be used for treatment, rehabilitation and prevention?</p></speech>

Work was done in the UK which showed that for every &pound;1 spent on treatment, &pound;3 is saved further down the line.  Research has been done on that question but how much more research do we do?  While I agree that we need to do some more, there is a lot of research already done from which we can benefit.</p></speech>

Let us not get caught up in figures.  If we can keep people out of the criminal justice system and divert that money into rehabilitation and treatment services, that is all well and good.  However, we must also realise that at the centre of all of this is an individual who may have a chronic addiction and that addiction could actually lead to a loss of life.  We should not just focus on how much it costs, in terms of treatment programmes and so forth.  We must look at it from a humane perspective as well.  That is why we must move to a public health focus rather than a criminal justice focus.</p></speech>

That is the background to the amendment.</p></speech>

I refer Deputy Mac Lochlainn to section 14(1)(c) which comprehends refusal to confiscate and which states, &quot;that compliance with the external confiscation order in relation to the offence that resulted in the making of that order would infringe the <i>ne bis in idem</i>principle&quot;.  It means a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime.  It is often referred to as the double-jeopardy principle.  In addition, subsection (1)(e) already states that &quot;the criminal conduct concerned was either committed outside the territory of the designated state concerned or committed wholly or partly in the State&quot;.  Each state only has jurisdiction over offences committed within its borders.  The new section 60E.(1)(a), which deals with refusal to execute external financial penalty order, states that an order would be refused where &quot;a financial penalty order has been made in the State against the defendant in respect of the conduct which resulted in the making of the external financial penalty order&quot;.  In addition, subsection (1)(e) provides for refusal where the criminal conduct concerned was either committed outside the territory of the designated state concerned or committed wholly or partly in the State.  A similar provision applies in regard to the EU-Japan mutual legal assistance agreement to which we are giving effect.  Article 11, grounds for refusal, provides that assistance will be refused where &quot;the person, who is subject to criminal investigations, prosecutions or other proceedings, including judicial proceedings, for which the assistance is requested, in the requesting State, has already been finally convicted or acquitted for the same facts in a Member State or Japan&quot;.</p><p>I should also point out to the Deputy that there is already a general provision in section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 - the legislation we are amending today - which provides that the procedures in dealing with such requests may not be contrary to the fundamental principles of the laws of the State, including the principle of <i>ne bis in idem</i>.  We have no difficulty with the thrust of the amendment but it is already catered for in this and other legislation.</p></speech>

On the issue of enhancing co-operation with other EU member states in the context of fighting crime, it is important that we again look closely at what is envisaged.  Enhanced mutual co-operation is essential for fighting crime, particularly in the context of international drugs gangs.  Horrific murders have been perpetrated in our own country in respect of such gangs.  This is a very serious issue for the State and its citizens and also for the international community.  That is why I support the principles of this legislation.  The horrific problem of people trafficking is also relevant here.  It is important that we constantly remind ourselves that this is going on and that people are being abused.  We have witnessed cases of this in our own State recently.  I raise these issues in the context of the broader issue of the implementation of this legislation.  People are suffering right across the European Union.</p></speech>

The committee has received a total of 152 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them to establish the admissibility of the petitions and to establish how best to progress a petition for consideration by the joint sub-committee.  Some 129 of the petitions received have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.  Of these, 61 were considered, a decision agreed upon and closed, 41 were inadmissible and, of the total figure, 51 were awaiting or still under consideration.</p> <p>  There is a total of nine petitions before us today.  Following discussion, the decisions of the joint sub-committee can be recorded in public session, where members will again be given the opportunity to make points in regard to the petitions.  The first petitions are in a group of three, comprising No. P00050/12, No. P00070/12 and No. P00071/12.  These are three petitions relating to the height of, and overhanging, trees and their impact on neighbouring properties.  It was agreed to group the three petitions together.  They all concern the need for legislation to regulate the height of trees and hedges and to provide a mechanism for the resolution of complaints in regard to overhanging trees and hedges without having to engage in prolonged and costly litigation, with the attendant risks.  Our committee has deliberated on this.  I will now call Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh to record our decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-10-14a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015101400002#D00200"><p>I would like to thank the secretariat for the work it has done on this, given there has been quite a lot of work over and back between different agencies and Departments.  The conclusion and the recommendation we are making is, once again, to recommend to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that it would carry out the following: to introduce legislation specifically dealing with the height and maintenance of trees and hedges or to consider amending section 108(3) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act to cater for the height of trees and hedges and procedures when dealing with disputes in regard to the issue; and to inform the Department that this committee is recommending that it implement one of the above as a matter of urgency.  We also recommend the following: the new or amended legislation should provide for height restrictions as to the specified height of a tree in a neighbouring garden, for example, no higher than 2 m; it should state that all attempts have been made between the neighbours to resolve the issues in advance of contacting the Department or local authority for assistance in reaching a solution to their issues; the Department or authority should then have the power to investigate the issue and, once satisfied, issue sanctions on the offending neighbour to resolve the issue and bring their tree or hedge in line with the required height, as set out in the legislation.  If there is still non-compliance, this should then go to mediation and, failing mediation, there should be an option to bring the individual before the courts and apply a penalty or a fine, similar to those imposed in the UK.</p> <p>  I believe it is important to do that because what we and the secretariat found is that there is a very haphazard approach from all of the different local authorities, none of which seem to have the same by-laws in regard to these issues.  Serious vexation has been caused in this area and some form of legislation is needed to deal with that.  That is our recommendation.  We also recommend that we close this petition as a matter of course and deem we have dealt with it fully.</p></speech>

We move on to No. P00029/14.  The petitioner is calling on the Government to introduce a child care tax credit in the upcoming budget, which obviously has now passed.  The petitioner advises of more than 1,000 supporting petitioners.  We had forwarded this matter to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  After a number of contacts with the Minister's office, we received a response.  What we are agreeing on this petition is that we would forward the response to the petitioner, given it is a substantial response and demonstrates some progress on the matter, and that we would close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We move to No. P00032/14.  The petitioner requested that the joint committee call on the Government to introduce a tax on lottery winnings in order to eliminate the universal social charge.  We considered this petition on 4 March of this year and agreed to forward to the petitioner correspondence from the Department of Finance, which advised that a tax on lottery winnings would not generate as much as USC.  The petitioner has accepted that assessment from the Department and is happy enough for the petition to be closed.  That is agreed by our members today.</p></speech>

People often say, "But if we did this...".  That we can give the research back and can give a cogent answer allows the person to say that it was worth doing.  It is a very small example of the fact the petitions committee is not that complex and that people can feel free to use this committee, if they have an idea they think would be relevant, given we can, quite promptly, come up with a solution.  It is a good example and I would like to thank the petitioner for engaging with us.</p></speech>

We often find that when petitioners get responses, they are happy with it.</p> <p>  We will move on to No. P00011/15.  The petitioner is concerned with the regularity of scanning during pregnancy.  The committee agreed to look at this as there could be a public service oversight issue.  However, as there appear to be errors in the text and there have been difficulties in contacting the petitioner, unfortunately, we have to close the petition at this stage.  It is agreed that we close it.</p> <p>  The next petitions are No. P00025/15, No. P00026/15 and No. P00027/15.  They are all related to the Syrian refugee crisis, although coming from different perspectives.  Our committee has agreed to correspond with the petitioners outlining that the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade have both given significant attention to these matters.  We will send on the transcripts of both committee hearings relevant to the subject matter.  We do not intend to reinvent the wheel as those committees have dealt with it comprehensively already.  Is it agreed that we close the petitions?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Certain commitments have been given by the Government and it is to be hoped they will be followed up on.  Plans are being drawn up, but, in a way, it was almost impossible for the petitioner to have seen any action because there was no place for it.  It is a good example of someone showing his or her enthusiasm and a desire to help, but the committee perhaps is not quite the right place for this to be observed.  Perhaps the petitioner might be sent a copy of the exchanges that have taken place in other committees and the evidence that commitments have been made by the Government to proceed and assist refugees in coming to the country.</p></speech>

We will send copies of the transcripts.  The Senator is correct in saying Irish citizens were probably ahead of others across Europe and their governments.  We have comprehensive transcripts to send to the petitioners who will be able to see that the Oireachtas has engaged significantly on the issue.  </p> <p>  We will now go into private session.  We will invite representatives of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman to join us.</p></speech>
