I welcome everybody to this meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  We are continuing our hearings on tackling childhood obesity.  We will now have presentations from Sport Ireland, <i>safe</i>food and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I welcome Mr. John Treacy, chief executive, and Dr. Una May, director of participation and ethics, from Sport Ireland, Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan, director of human health and nutrition, and Dr. Aileen McGloin, director of marketing and communications, <i>from safe</i>food, and Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary, and Ms Jackie Harrington, principal officer, from the Department of Employment and Social Affairs.  I thank them for joining us.  We also have Mr. David Gash, communications manager with Sport Ireland, in the Public Gallery.  I also welcome members and viewers who may be watching these proceedings on Oireachtas TV.</p><p>Before we commence, and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I also remind everybody present to turn off mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with our sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report on the meeting.  Television coverage and web-streaming may also be adversely affected.  I advise witnesses also that any submissions or statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After the presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I call Mr. Treacy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for giving me the opportunity to make this address.  Sport Ireland conducted a study of children&rsquo;s sport participation and physical activity in 2010.  The study referred to considerable international evidence highlighting the benefits of physical activity in children and young people.  It also identified that physical activity is important to children's current and future health and that adherence to physical activity guidelines produces a range of direct and indirect benefits.  Physical activity assists in the control of body weight by increasing energy expenditure and it helps children and young people achieve a healthy energy balance and avoid developing adult obesity.  It reduces the risks of developing premature cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer.  In addition, physical activity reduces depression, anxiety and enhances mood, self esteem and quality of life.</p> <p>  Participation in regular physical activity has been found to have a positive effect on behaviour, attention span and academic performance.  Physical inactivity, on the other hand, is a leading risk factor for poor health and is now identified by the World Health Organization, WHO, as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality.  It is estimated to be associated with 1 million deaths per year in the WHO European region.  The cost and consequences associated with physical inactivity are now becoming more obvious.  Estimates for the direct and indirect costs of physical inactivity are alarming.  Sport Ireland and Healthy Ireland have agreed to co-fund the follow up to the children's sports participation and physical activity study which will replicate the previous study and produce updated information.  We expect to have that published by November 2018.</p> <p>  The national physical activity guidelines recommend that children between the ages of two and 18 should be actively involved for 60 minutes of moderate to high intensity activity per day.  This activity should include muscle strengthening, flexibility and bone strengthening exercises at least three times a week.  The 2010 study found that 19% of primary school and 12% of post primary school children met the physical activity recommendations.  Girls are less likely than boys to meet them.  The likelihood of meeting the recommendations decreases with increasing age and one in four children were unfit, overweight or obese and had elevated blood pressure.  Importantly, the research found that children who met the physical activity recommendations and the guidelines of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity had the best health profile.  This study reinforces a considerable body of international evidence showing the health benefits of physical activity.  What really concerns Sport Ireland is the number of children at primary and secondary level who are not active and not meeting any physical activity recommendations.</p><p>The 2010 study found that even though many children were physically active in some capacity, for example, through PE classes or after-school sports, they were not meeting the physical activity guidelines.</p><p> There are more opportunities than ever for children and young people to engage in sport and physical activity.  While sport plays an important role in getting children active, it is not the only solution.  This is where Sport Ireland feels that the role of schools is of paramount importance.  Our view is that regular physical activity, through the delivery of PE classes, is as important a part of the school experience as reading, writing and mathematics.  It should start as soon as children begin primary school.  We can look at strong international models for this.  It is compulsory for primary schools in Denmark to offer an average of 45 minutes of physical activity per school day.  Similarly, PE classes are provided five days a week in Hungary.  While Sport Ireland welcomes the positive recent developments in the PE curriculum in the senior cycle, we feel that more needs to be done in this area to ensure PE becomes a core part of the school experience.  It is important for the new senior cycle PE initiative to be rolled out through the entire school system as a priority to increase physical activity levels and physical literacy among all children.  It is critical for the full implementation of the new curriculum to be sufficiently resourced to ensure the maximum potential for its success.</p><p> The role of parents cannot be overstated.  It is important for parents to ensure their children are kept physically active as part of a balanced lifestyle which incorporates nutrition.  We are well aware that some parents write notes to excuse their children from PE classes.  Parents need to take responsibility and be aware of the consequences of their children not engaging in physical activity.  Children need to get into good habits at an early age.  If this happens in the home and school environments, their chances of leading healthy lifestyles increase significantly.  Evidence from other research, including the national longitudinal study of children, Growing Up in Ireland, and the Healthy Ireland survey indicates that there is a strong socioeconomic gradient in obesity levels.  These findings emphasise the importance of focusing on individuals from lower socioeconomic groups around health behaviours such as physical activity and diet.  Sport Ireland has placed a particular emphasis on getting these groups active through dormant accounts funding, the local sports partnership network and the community sports hubs initiative, which we are rolling out around the country.  Increased investment in such initiatives is merited to reduce these health inequalities.</p><p> The publication of A Healthy Weight for Ireland, which is Healthy Ireland's obesity policy and action plan, is a welcome development in tackling childhood obesity in Ireland.  It is fantastic to see such reports highlighting the important role of physical activity.  Sport Ireland's view is that the effective interventions on physical activity identified in the policy should be delivered.  A fundamental principle of the local sports partnership network, which is an initiative of Sport Ireland, is to remove any barrier that prevents participation in sport.  In 2017, Sport Ireland allocated over &euro;6 million to the 29 local sports partnerships.  This resulted in approximately 340,000 people participating in 936 locally delivered participation programmes.  Our programmes targeted people with disabilities, women in sport and older groups and we saw increases in participation numbers among those groups.  That came through in the most recent edition of the Irish Sports Monitor.  This is an example of the huge role of direct intervention in this area.</p><p> The local sports partnerships are the most important drivers of the inter-agency approach at local level.  They can promote a positive environment at local level, in which physical activity becomes normal, and they can continuously explore new models of participation.  For this reason, the local sports partnerships are named as key partners across many of the action areas in the national physical activity plan.  Sport Ireland's local sports partnerships have a key role in delivering the 2017-2018 Healthy Ireland fund, with a specific focus on local actions to implement the national physical activity plan for Ireland.</p><p> Sport Ireland allocates dormant account funding to national governing bodies and local sports partnerships to support measures for disadvantaged communities under the national physical activity plan.  We welcome the allocation of &euro;4.4 million in dormant account funding to Sport Ireland at the end of 2017.  This funding compliments Sport Ireland's support for national governing bodies.  We are investing &euro;10.8 million in national governing bodies under various programmes to support participants and volunteers in a wide range of sports.  This core funding for national governing bodies covers the running of programmes for adults and children who engage in sport.  It is hugely significant and badly needed.</p><p> The tackling of obesity across all facets of society is a complex and multilayered issue.  It is clear from evidence that physical activity plays a major role in improving the overall health and well-being of our children.  The results of the 2010 study have fed into the physical activity plan around the setting of targets for increasing physical activity among children.  Sport Ireland is significantly involved in efforts under the national physical activity plan to increase participation in physical activity throughout the population, including among children.  Sport Ireland will continue to work with the Government and key stakeholders to provide more opportunities for young people to engage in sport and physical activity.</p><p> As I said earlier, many Departments are highlighting the importance of physical activity in their policy papers.  It is hugely significant.  Ten years ago, that would not have been the case.  It is on everyone's agenda.  Obviously, we would like to see more happening at school time.  This would be really important.  Children who are not sporty can be left behind if they lack confidence.  PE classes can help their confidence by giving them an opportunity to participate in a sport or physical activity that they can do well.  They might be able to run a mile.  If we are to ensure we attract every child in the classroom, we need to be innovative when it comes to those types of activities.  It is critical, as we go forward, to remember that not being able to kick a football should not exclude a child from physical activity.</p></speech>

We further realise that childhood obesity has been almost completely normalised.  We are no longer particularly impressed by the stark statistics.  We almost see this as an insoluble or inevitable situation.  A very interesting graph on the bottom of the short paper that we sent to the joint committee covers a period of almost 60 years from just before 1950 to just after 2000.  It shows how the average weight of boys, whom we took as an example, has increased over that time.  A 14 year old in 2000 was, on average, 14 kg or more than 2 stone heavier than a 14 year old in 1950.  All of that is not healthy.  Perhaps people were a little on the undernourished side in some regards in 1950, but we are over-nourished or unhealthily nourished now.  That is where childhood obesity is.</p> <p>  I would like to comment on the way we are nurturing our children from the beginning.  One in three pregnant women is overweight or obese.  This leads to all sorts of problems from a health perspective for the mother and for the child and places a much bigger burden on services.  There is increasing evidence of how much sugar and how few vegetables are in ready-to-eat baby and toddler foods.</p><p>Many primary schools have either an official or unofficial "no running" policy and no fridges for lunch storage.  They have no water fountains.  Many parents have mentioned the issue of lunch time interfering with play time, and it is something I experienced when my children were that age.  Who will pick lunch over play?  Children gobble something and put the rest into the lunch box before going out to play.  It is counter-productive in the context of nutrition goals and a healthy environment for children.  Parents struggle between one thing and another but two matters that have come to our attention.  The first is the ubiquitous nature of treats.  If children have their dinner, they get a treat but if they do not eat their dinner, they still get a treat.  There is a treats cupboard, there are children's parties with play areas and even some sports facilities where it is practically impossible to avoid these products.  The second matter relates to screen-based technology and the difficulty parents have with such devices.  This fits into the obesity epidemic.</p><p> Children in disadvantaged areas eat less nutritious diets and there is a much higher proportion of fast food outlets in those areas.  That gap is growing.  I live in Cork but this morning I travelled in from south Dublin.  Everything I saw looked rosy but that is not the full picture and the level of childhood obesity is growing in areas with people who are less advantaged.  We must act further in this respect.  Secondary schools are being targeted by fast food outlets with meal deals comprising carbohydrates, sugar and fat.  It is an ongoing problem.  It is the same with local shops and one cannot try to buy a bottle of milk or some petrol without being bombarded in newsagents, garage forecourts or supermarkets by these products.  Children and parents are having it tough in trying to stay at a reasonable weight and level of health.</p><p> We continue to be members of the Government's advisory and strategy groups dealing with weight matters.  The bottom line is there must be resourcing and implementation of A Healthy Weight for Ireland.  Much has been done but we are at a plateau with childhood obesity, so the word "stubborn" definitely comes into it.  We are at a ridiculously high level if one in four children is obese or overweight; if a primary school class has 30 children, seven of them are overweight or obese.  If that were any other disease or condition, we would be more alarmed than we are.  Although obesity is a disease, it does not require urgent treatment, and as a result, we find ourselves in the current position.  As members indicated, blood pressure issues and pre-diabetes are occurring in children aged five, six or 15.</p><p> We have proposed a number of recommendations we would like to highlight.  Without going into all of them, I can outline specific recommendations and we are particularly aware of their importance.  There should be a dedicated percentage of the overall obesity budget for prevention, as it always tends to get less emphasis than treatment.  Immediate treatment of extreme cases will always be an issue but unless we have a dedicated budget and resources for prevention, we will continue to have difficulties.  Within that budget we should establish an approach that from an obesity perspective would be in line with what we know contributes to obesity.  This includes diet and physical activity, with a ratio of 2:1.  Diet is the principal factor but I could not be more supportive of physical activity, not only from an obesity prevention and management perspective but from mental health and other perspectives.  It is nonetheless my job to emphasise that diet is twice as important as activity in the prevention and management of obesity.</p><p> How do we help parents?  Currently it is a handy approach to blame parents if their children are overweight.  That is simply not fair or accurate.  We must provide parenting skills in order that parents can negotiate pester power and the environment in which their children are harassed to eat and seek too many treats or food that is not particularly healthy.  Members emphasised the role of the parents in the community approach, and the approach is at this ground level.  Cooking from scratch at home, for example, can be helped with a number of community cooking problems, such as Cook It.  There are not enough of them and we need to fund and implement them as a norm in all communities, particularly those at less advantage.  There is less cooking from scratch in those areas.  Home economics in school should be approached in the same way as activity, with availability to all children.  One could argue it is a gender issue, apart from anything else, that leads to boys not having access.  It is also a normalisation issue.</p><p> There is the matter of schools recognising obesity.  Given that we have school uniforms labelled as being for the same ages but which are considerably bigger than they were 20 years ago, there has been a visual normalisation of what is healthy.  In the same way we look at eyes, ears, teeth and other indicators of growth in schools, we need to measure and weigh children as part of the development assessment routine.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. McGloin, who will deal with campaigns and how we have listened to parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aileen McGloin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#D00200"><p>The committee will have seen from our more detailed submission that we are very active in the childhood obesity area.  We have community food initiatives, food poverty initiatives, education resources and campaigns.  I will highlight the START campaign, which we launched last year in conjunction with Healthy Ireland, the HSE and partners in Northern Ireland in the form of the Public Health Agency.  It is important that this campaign has been co-created with the target audience.  We went to lower income areas throughout the country to ensure we spoke with the audience that would need us most.  We developed messages and a campaign that truly resonated with those people.  As Dr. Foley-Nolan pointed out, parents are under huge pressure and do not want to be told what to do by agencies.  They have busy lives and much responsibility.  We wanted to emphasise that every effort they make to improve a child's life from a physical activity and food perspective has an impact.  The motif was date-stamping a certain time when mum decided to switch to fruit or have a healthier breakfast.</p><p>It is all those tiny decisions throughout the day that make the difference between being healthy and being unhealthy as a family.  It is a five-year campaign with partners.  We want to get the messages out about eating fewer treats, consuming fewer sugary drinks, being more active, having less screen time and so on that are clear and consistent and go throughout all the touch points that are important in children's lives, namely GP surgeries, cr&egrave;ches, schools, hospitals and also through the media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Conlon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the matter of tackling childhood obesity.  One of the main roles of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is to promote active participation and inclusion in society through the provision of income supports.  In the context of childhood obesity, this Department administers the school meals programme which is a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage.  The programme provides funding towards the provision of food services to some 1,500 schools and organisations which benefits up to 250,000 children at a total cost of &euro;54 million in 2018.  An additional &euro;6.5 million was allocated to the programme as part of budget 2018. <br/><br/>In recognition of the benefits that this scheme provides to children Government has significantly increased its funding since 2012, increasing it from &euro;35 million to a current figure of &euro;54 million over a series of budgets, a 54% increase in that period.  In line with the national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the DEIS programme.  The additional funding provided under the scheme in recent years has supported the improvement of the scheme to DEIS schools and its extension to some schools outside of DEIS.  There is a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs within the scheme which provide positive outcomes for vulnerable children in respect of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.<br/><br/>Under the scheme, schools have a responsibility to implement healthy eating policies.  The new nutritional standards for school meals were devised and published under the auspices of Healthy Ireland in September 2017.  These standards were developed by a working group led by the health and well-being programme in the Department of Health, on which this Department was represented as were our colleagues in <i>safe</i>food.  The implementation of these standards will ensure children and young people are offered healthy, nutritious and balanced meals and snacks.  These standards will be fully implemented in all schools participating in the school meals scheme from September 2018 and build on the previous healthy eating guidelines.<br/><br/>In terms of compliance, schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records to the Department.  Expenditure on unhealthy food items is deducted from the following year&rsquo;s funding allocation.  The Department also undertakes on-site inspections of schools and part of this includes inspecting the type of food provided.  Some 1,260 schools and organisations have been inspected at this time.  Compliance with the new standards will form part of the inspection process from the 2018-19 academic year and also forms part of the service level agreement in place with each school/organisation in the scheme.<br/><br/>I assure the committee that the Department is committed to the ongoing development of the school meals programme and recognises that proper nutrition can improve children's ability to concentrate, improve disruptive behaviour, encourage school attendance and help in the fight against obesity.  I am confident the new nutrition standards will be a valuable resource in educating and supporting children to embrace healthy eating to grow and develop into healthy adults and to be a healthy weight.</p></speech>

It relates to the effectiveness of the idea of normal weight, whether it be a medical assessment or a reflection on history.  The <i>safe</i>food graph from 1950 to 2002 is alarming and shows a clear trend.  We continually look at food groups and that process is continuously changing in respect of how we assess whether it is good or bad.  In my lifetime I have heard that coffee is bad and tea is better, then I heard that tea is worse and coffee is better.  I have heard that one should not eat butter and then that one should because some of the fats in it are beneficial.  That progresses over a long period.  How reliable are predictions based on BMI charts or the idea of what an optimum weight for a child is at different stages of development, given that not only is food changing but we are also inherently healthier?  Is this a question that is more appropriate for the doctors?</p></speech>

It is a tangential issue to that which we are discussing but reliable sources tend to be less dramatic, vociferous and perhaps attractive in the short term such as the Government and dietician sources.  Currently, people who have done brief nutritional courses comment on this, that and the other, often based on their personal experience or on non-science.  There are also researchers who might do a very good piece of research and have a finding but we do not base guidelines on one piece of research.  There will always be debate but things have not changed as much as the headlines, particularly in the tabloids might suggest, and if we ate what our grannies ate, we would be doing pretty well.  I appreciate the perception but that is the reality.</p> <p>  Weight is not the only indicator of health.  We are talking about weight and height so some people are taller and bigger than others, so weight is not the only indicator.  However, weight in excess of the standard is related to poor health and non-communicable disease such as diabetes and cancer is the problem for our society rather than infections and so on.  We are talking about the role of weight at a population level, where at an individual level one must look at the whole picture of the person.</p></speech>

In the late 1940s, it would be correct to suggest that children in the post-war years were undernourished.</p><p>The data on which we base our current BMI standards was collected in the late 1980s or early 1990s, so at the point before the obesity explosion.  In a way, that kind of date-stamping of standards is correct for the kind of food environment that we live in now.  Even so, we have seen doubling and tripling of obesity rates.</p></speech>

All the research around cardiac health that is coming up at international level is changing around what the foods are.  Carbohydrates now seem to be the big fear, in terms of what people are taking in.  These are the types of things we need to make sure we do not eat too much of, and the portion sizes are really critical.  Many people do not see themselves as overweight so there is a misconception of what they might look like.  People realise they need to see their doctors, and get the regular physical fitness and health checks as part of their well-being.  The critical piece for me is that we are actually talking about people's health and children's health, which is a really critical issue.  We talk here about developing life habits, which is why we talk about physical activity being a life habit, about learning it and having the confidence early, and about the parents getting involved with the children.  All our research tells us that if the parents are involved in physical activity, there is a really good chance that the children will be involved in physical activity as well.  It is those types of patterns that we need.  We need to look at the environment in Ireland and how we can make it more conducive to physical activity.  They are all the pieces that have been happening around local government, in terms of how it can put more trails and greenways in and how we can make it easy for people to participate in physical activity.  It is changing the culture in Ireland.  As a sporting nation which follows sport, we also want to make sure people do it as well.  Ireland should be about gearing up for the next 50 years.  We are creating an environment where people and their children can involve themselves in physical activity, and it is part of what they do when they wake up in the morning or during the course of a day.</p></speech>

Their submissions are very interesting, and there are some very pragmatic and practical recommendations therein.  They are based on common sense but very often common sense is not applied when one is trying to conduct a public policy and a set of outcomes that have a beneficial effect for the general population.  We all have an instinctive view on what needs to happen, but then how is that translated into practical policies and actions?  That is what we are trying to get to the nub of here in this committee.  We are trying to come up with a report that has very practical suggestions.  The witnesses' recommendations are very beneficial to that process.</p> <p>  Before I question anybody, I want to congratulate Mr. John Treacy on his appointment as chairman of the board of Concern.  It is a very welcome appointment, which I think we would all wholeheartedly welcome.</p> <p>  On the Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study of 2010, the witness has openly acknowledged in his submission that now needs to be updated and made fit for purpose for 2018, 2019 and onwards.  Could I ask if the effects of the use of technology are mapped onto that study in any way?  Has the use and preponderance of technology in homes and society been examined?  The reason I ask is we are hearing technology has a massively negative impact on very basic activity levels in children, and other people who have submitted to this process here have said that.  Is that part of the study?</p></speech>

It is certainly something that needs to be looked at.  We would be acutely aware of it as well.  One of the things we looked at during that 2010 study was television time, so I would imagine the technology piece would be looked at as part of this study as well.  The number of hours children were watching television was a huge factor.  It was up to two hours a day.  One of the things I always make a point about is when kids are doing their leaving certificate and the parents will tell them they can stay out of sport for a while in order to concentrate on their studies.  What do they do?  They fill it by watching television.</p></speech>

Two hours of screen time seems almost nostalgic by today's standards, which is ironic.  If they are to report in November, which is only a few months away, and if that is not included in the study, it would be very useful for us to know, perhaps through Sport Ireland or one of the other stakeholders, whether the use of technology is being mapped onto those types of longitudinal studies.  It would be useful to us and our work here.</p> <p>  When we speak about obesity in Ireland, we speak about targeting lower socio-economic groups.  I often wonder how that happens in real terms.  Can Mr. Treacy give a practical example of a local sports partnership, of the 29 on the &euro;6 million budget line, where there is a clear targeting of a lower socio-economic group?</p></speech>

Their job is to go into disadvantaged areas and knock on doors, get people out and find the leaders in the community.  There are a number of programmes that we roll out, such as dormant account funding, setting up sports hubs and getting the communities and various clubs involved.  There are targeted areas and these hubs are in disadvantaged areas.  Some of the hubs are linking schools and clubs and all that type of work.</p></speech>

We have a few good examples.  One in Clonmel taps into work that was already under way, the development of the River Suir and the development of the greenway and blueway.  In acknowledging the challenges with the river, flooding issues and all the poor associations with the river, we invested funding through that in the development of a white-water canoeing facility.  As part of that, we have developed a community coaching programme, which is a jobseeker's programme, to try to bring people back into the workforce through the medium of sport, where that extra draw is the attraction to the sport bit.  We offer them jobseeker's training, CV preparation and that kind of thing.  We then offer them coaching programmes as well and we align that with the capital money that is being invested.</p><p>In this particular area, the funding was in the area of canoeing<b></b>coaching<b>. </b>We also developed an initiative in Croom, County Limerick, putting some capital into the development of a small climbing wall in the community centre.  Through community coaching we taught the local community leaders how to teach climbing.  Similarly, on a significant housing estate in Gorey, County Wexford, one of the largest estates in the country in a disadvantaged area, we developed a BMX track.  We have been trying to target non-traditional sports to try to reach out to people.  People know where to go to find their GAA club or soccer club and, therefore, we are trying to target different and less traditional activities.</p></speech>

I do not see it as being necessarily inevitable and insoluble.</p><p>Can Dr. McGloin give us a high-level view of how the START programme works?  It may not be possible today.  There is a &euro;900,000 budget line.  It is across the island of Ireland.  Is <i>safe</i>food trying to reach into schools or into houses?  I note the recommendations of improvements in co-ordination between community and hospital-based health professionals, the 70:30 ratio for healthy eating and physical activity and more community cooking programmes such as Cook It.  How is <i>safe</i>food translated across those initiatives?  That is what I am trying to understand.</p></speech>

I will address the Deputy's initial point about inevitability.  It is inevitable if we continue as we are.  We also mean that parents in particular feel very disempowered, in relation to both food and physical activity.  To reply to some points made in response to Mr. Treacy, we have recently done some formative research for the next phase of our campaign around physical activity and screen time.  Screen time rose to the top because parents are so concerned and so utterly disempowered with no clear guidance on how much screen time is healthy.</p></speech>

I am working on the assumption that most parents have common sense.  I am not talking about educational attainment, what socio-economic group they are in or anything like that.

We were all as surprised by it as the Deputy.  He is bang-on in this regard.  The other part is that, as adults, we all use screens enormously.  If we want to change the behaviour of the child, we need to start with ourselves.  That is difficult for the parent.  Whether we are talking about the types of food we eat or the time we spend on screen, we have to take a whole-family approach.  There is no point in saying that we will make changes for the children.  We all have to make the changes.  For a parent to face up to that is quite difficult.</p></speech>

We are not just talking about children here; we are talking about the whole family.<br/><br/>To come back to the Start programme, as we said, a partnership approach is taken between North and South.  We work with the HSE and Healthy Ireland.  <i>safe</i>food has expertise in rolling out large-scale media campaigns.  There are television ads, radio ads and outdoor advertising to help raise awareness of the issue in the first place.  We also do a huge mount of activity in the digital medium, because that way we have a deeper means to support people.  For example, we can use behaviour change techniques, such as providing reward charts parents can use with their children, or food or physical activity diaries.  We can host discussion groups where they can meet other parents and talk about the things that other parents do.  Role modelling is huge, so we try to demonstrate how other parents take on healthy measures with their children.  I think a parent-to-parent approach is really important, and we can use digital communications to show that.  The HSE obviously has a very different structure to us, and it has all the front-line staff.  Start is being rolled out throughout the HSE via its Making Every Contact Count mechanism.  The key people who will be the touch points for children, for example public health nurses meeting parents to provide vaccinations and all the early years contacts, are also being trained on the Start messages.  It is coming through different lines of communication.  </p></speech>

I am begin with Mr. Treacy.  I have an excellent relationship with the local sports partnership in Galway.   We had a positive engagement with Fit Towns a little more than two years ago.   The witnesses should tell everybody about Fit Towns and the concept behind it, because it got the whole town moving in the middle of winter.  I have to credit Mr. Mick Hurley and Mr. Jason Craughwell with all of this.  It is something that has been rolled out throughout the whole county since then.  It made us a little bit competitive.  It includes people from the very young to older persons.  One can move in the morning, noon or evening in that sphere.  It has been very welcome.  There was funding for it.</p> <p>  I want Mr. Treacy to talk about the role of county councils, because he did hit on it a little bit.  When we talk about the role of county councils, we have to talk about the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme grants that are available, as well as the town and village renewal scheme.  We also have to talk about communities.  We are talking about obesity across the entire nation.  It does not stop at the 50 km mark outside any town, village or city.  There are communities out there that are not towns, villages or urban communities.  They are very rural, but they have a definition, that is, a sense of community.  That is where the likes of those grants are important.  We need to build on the capacity of people that want to move and want a huge involvement in it.</p> <p>  It is to do with the changing culture.  I am fortunate in that I live on what is now a blueway and I hope it will become a greenway.  I have Ireland's Ancient East on one side and I am not far away from the Atlantic on the other side.  At the same time this is about how have a conversation about obesity without having to use that word.  It is about getting children moving.  Children cannot get moving unless the people in certain positions have the right tools.  When we implemented our Fit Towns scheme, with which we were successful, we used our &euro;5,000 fund to buy Sl&iacute; na Sl&aacute;inte signage.  That was fantastic.  We got the materials and Sl&iacute; na Sl&aacute;inte worked well with us.  We worked with Coillte and the Office of Public Works, OPW, but regrettably the local authority would not allow us to put down a pole.  To this day, two and a half years later, the Sl&iacute; na Sl&aacute;inte signs are still sitting in a council yard because we could not break through that  bit of red tape.  I am telling the committee my experience in my community.  That is mirrored throughout the entire country.  We could have people walking 5 km on a regular basis.  That would include parents bringing their children or grandparents bringing their children. </p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Conlon.  I am adamant that somebody with the purse strings of the DEIS programme should come before us.  What percentage of schools participate in the schools meals programme?  If we are serious about tackling childhood obesity, understanding plate size and bringing about this magnificent cultural change, we also have to change the understanding of what is the norm.</p><p>The norm will be whatever is delivered through the DEIS programme and how people understand it and then bring it home.  We have to realise that magnificent change because it is not in place at the moment.<br/><br/>Many schools could benefit from DEIS involvement in all schools and all ECCE cr&egrave;che areas as well.  What percentage of national schools, secondary schools and early childcare settings are benefitting?  We can see what the gap is if we find out.<br/><br/>I am pleased Deputy Sherlock asked about the START programme because I would have asked exactly the same question otherwise.  To me the work of <i>safe</i>food is based on research and feeds into research.  What research has <i>safe</i>food done recently that has been feed in?  Perhaps Ms Foley-Nolan will tell me that the START programme came from that research.<br/><br/>I am also interested in the <i>safe</i>food recommendations in the A Healthy Weight for Ireland document.  Reference was made to measuring height and weight for children routinely in schools.  The report states that it is well-established that parents do not recognise excessive weight in themselves or their children.  The belief is that normalising the measurement of bodily weight status will help to overcome this barrier to behavioural change.  I have this battle continuously.  Three unions were before the committee some weeks back.  They said there was no way they would agree to the proposal.  I want to hear the thought process of <i>safe</i>food representatives.  How do they envisage it operating?  Who should be doing it?  Is it in a school environment or a sports environment?  Where should this be rolled out?</p></speech>

One idea behind the local sports partnership was to have a close association with local authorities throughout the country.  That is the purpose of the local sports partnership.  The idea is to have a partnership with all the various agencies at local level.  I am pleased the Deputy is involved with the local sports partnership in Galway.  It is critical for us to have all politicians involved at local level supporting the local sports partnership.  Politicians lead by example and I commend the Deputy on being an advocate for the local sports partnership.</p> <p>  We are moving to link the local sports partnerships and invest in local councils throughout the country.  That would be a good step.  What we have now is a scenario of local plans coming up and sports being a part of those local plans.  I am talking about a shift in policy.  We now have local authorities with quality-of-life and sports policy as part of what they do.  That is a major shift in the mindset and in planning at local level.</p> <p>  There is good news around sport.  People want to be involved in sport and so on.  We have good relationships with the local authorities.  We met all the directors of services in June this year to talk about where we would be going in future.  We talked about Dormant Accounts Fund funding, how to get involved and how to ensure organisations have a competitive bidding process.  We want all the local authorities throughout the country to be excited about the local sports partnership.  We want them to be invested in it to ensure money comes back into the local councils.  That is happening throughout the country.  Local authorities give out grants.  Michael Curley is the Galway man who will ensure clubs invest at local level.  It might be small money, but a little money at club level goes a long way.  It might be &euro;500 to buy something but that goes a long way.</p> <p>  Another important aspect is to ensure local clubs are recognised.  That is important for volunteers at local level.  Again, the local sports partnerships play a key role.</p> <p>  I was in Galway for the awards for the Fit Town competition one year.  We had all the local groups vying for the title.  It was competitive.  I will leave it to Dr. May to fill in the committee on some of the details but it is about the local community coming together.  We always say that sport and physical activity are far easier when we work together.  This is why "Operation Transformation" is so important.  The towns come behind the initiative.  People meet at 8 p.m. and everyone can do it together.  People do not have to do it on their own during the winter months.  Activities bring people together and there is a sense of community.  Other people feel welcome to join with everyone else.  That is what the concept is about.  It is about ensuring that people are active.  It binds the town together.  Dr. May will comment further.</p></speech>

We are altogether grateful for the support of the local authorities.  The Sport Ireland model for local sports partnerships involves only part-funding by Sport Ireland.  The partnerships are part-funded locally as well.  Some 74% of the funding for the local sports partnerships comes from matched funding from local authorities.  We have good support in that regard.  We have hit on an important point in respect of blueways, greenways and outdoor recreation grants.  One of the keys to success in this area is to try to develop a shift in culture such that all our partners in this area are working together.  That includes all our partners in the development of outdoor recreation areas.  Tourists benefit and the local community benefits from an economic point of view.  The idea is that the facilities are available for the local community to avail of.</p> <p>  The Fit Town initiative is an innovative project that was run in Galway.  We are particularly supportive of such innovations through the sports partnerships.  We look to evaluate these initiatives each time to consider whether they might be appropriate for national roll-out.  We have evaluated the Fit town project.  There were small challenges in terms of trying to get the bigger towns to buy into it and so on.  We took the view that the community sports hub is the real core.  The idea is to get a community driven to improve its entire approach to sports and physical activity.  That was the purpose of the Fit Town initiative.  It was about identifying opportunities and growing possibilities and opportunities around all manner of difficult initiatives and programmes.  This included weigh-ins and get-fit programmes, including from couch to 5 km training and so on.  All these initiatives link in with the community sports hub model.  The model of the community sports hub is perhaps a little smaller but we have identified it as the most accessible way to achieve success.</p></speech>

Of course, modern technology will be part of the study.  The impact of technology on children's participation and what they do will be part of the 2018 study.

At the moment, there are approximately 900 DEIS schools throughout the country, of which more than 850 are in receipt of school meals.  Approximately 95% of DEIS schools are participating.  A total of 49 schools are not participating at the moment.  One of these schools approached the Department in recent weeks indicating a desire to come on board from September.  We have written to the other 48 schools within the past two weeks to encourage them to apply.  These tend to be schools in rural areas.  Urban and town schools tend to be in the programme.  DEIS schools in rural areas are less likely to be involved and they tend to form the 5%.  We are in contact with them.  I hope we can increase the 95% figure for this coming year.</p></speech>

Other schools may want to get assessments done to determine whether they can qualify for DEIS status.  Were the key drivers or key performance indicators changed recently in respect of what schools can qualify?  Was any evaluation done?  Can the departmental officials explain that?</p></speech>

That Department carried out and published a review of DEIS programme in 2017.  The Department has enhanced its analysis and how it assesses educational disadvantage.</p><p>As part of that process and in the context of the increased funding provided to the school meals scheme, we have, as has been outlined, invited some schools outside DEIS which show a certain level of disadvantage to join the scheme.  At this point, there are approximately 140 such schools in the scheme.  In light of the increased funding for this year, we have written to approximately 60 more to invite them to participate from September.</p></speech>

While a school might not necessarily qualify for DEIS, the Department looks outside the box a little bit to other schools so that more children are gathered.  They might not fit all of the DEIS criteria but they might be able to get the benefit of it.  The Department is doing this with 140 additional schools.</p></speech>

We encourage the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection to be part of this and have a similar forum.  It would be a more holistic look at food in school.  There is a model that works very well and it could be replicated in the South.</p></speech>

The messages we came up with as a result were start now, start today and start again if people fall off the wagon or give in to pester power.  This is where START came from.</p> <p>  In the context of measuring, I have not read the depositions from the three unions, but what I reckon is at the back of it is concern about stigma.  This is a real concern, but there are school medical services and we are already measuring the eyes, ears and teeth.  If things are not measured, they cannot be managed.  It is a simple as that.  It will take normalisation.  There will be a level of non-acceptance.  However, 20 years ago it was quite reasonable to smoke if one went to visit a new baby in someone's home.  It just takes time to normalise these things.</p></speech>

Many areas have already been covered.  Mr. Treacy mentioned some of the initiatives in sports that were taking place in towns and villages and he said they were getting fairly competitive.  I understand that much sport at underage levels is now non-competitive.  Is there a better take-up in sports because of this or has there been a drop off or change in psychology because it is not competitive?  When I was a child growing up, it was all about winning the game.  Trying to get on the team would drive one to do better.  Have any studies been done on whether there is more participation now with regard to involving children who were not traditionally interested in sport?</p> <p>  How to navigate lunchtime and playtime was mentioned.  I would like to go a bit further than this and speak about sport time and playtime because everything seems to be getting very structured for children.  Sport is play, but some people are just not into sports and they are into playing.</p> <p>  How do we encompass performance arts?  Have there been any discussions on this?  There is a crossover between performance arts, particularly dance, and sports that perhaps would catch people who traditionally are not into sports.  I say this as a soccer player.</p> <p>  I want to make reference to the Croom climbing wall, which is at my back doorstep.  Has it been a success case for attracting more people?  I  am really trying to target people who are not traditionally interested in sport because anybody who is interested will join the local team anyway and will be into fitness.  I want to target the people on the margins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#J01800"><p>On the competitive aspect, children are, by their nature, competitive and that is a given.  If we put two seven year olds out they will compete against each other.  We have probably led the way with many of the governing bodies in highlighting that it is about participation, certainly up to 12 or 13 years of age.  Many of the sporting organisations have come in and rolled out programmes in terms of children participating for the sake of doing so and have taken away the aspect of winning the county or the Munster championship at a very early age.  That trend has happened and it has helped.  Our study will probably prove this in terms of what is happening.  The three main field sports we fund are the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI.  They have started to tackle these issues.  They were hugely competitive for children aged under 12 and it was putting the children off.  I am 100% with the Deputy that we need to ensure children are not really competitive at too early an age.  Their experience should be fun and enjoyable.  What should be encouraged is the attitude that even if they lose by 12 goals it is still a great performance.</p> <p>  With regard to sport time and playtime, in the past many of us participated in sport in a non-formal way.  We kicked a ball out on the street.  It was playtime but we were involved in sport.  A lot of this type of informality has gone.  This is why the physical activity guidelines are not being met.  It is critical.  I support the Deputy 100% that no one should be excluded from activity.  If people cannot kick a football that is fine, as there is a sporting activity for them or an activity for them.</p><p> Without a shadow of a doubt, children have more choices than they had in the past.  If one grew up in a country parish, the option was to play Gaelic games or not to play anything but now children in those areas have much more choice.  That is to be welcomed.  Parents and schools need to ensure that if a child is not skilled in kicking a football, there is another activity in which he or she can participate.   We would strongly encourage that.</p><p> In terms of the performing arts, the PE curriculum caters for that.  That is why the PE curriculum in primary and secondary schools is very important.  The performing arts are part of the PE curriculum.  It provides an opportunity for children to become confident in an activity, learn the skills involved at an early age and carry them with them throughout their life.  That is an important element.  We would advocate having more PE in schools.  PE takes place one day a week in primary schools and two days a week in secondary schools.  We would love to see increases in the time allocation for PE during school time.  We know there is competition for elements of the curriculum in school time and the curriculum is very tight, but it is important to make sure children are involved in an activity during school time.  The running a mile initiative during school time is an important development that is being rolled in Mayo and other places during September of this year.  It is a matter of  finding activities that can be done simply in a confined space or on the local playing field.  It is about being creative.  We know there are constraints but it is a matter of being creative in order that the teacher is not limited and can arrange some activity for the children to ensure they are physically active and involved in some play or whatever it may be.  School boards, parents and teachers need to get into that space and view it as part of children's schooling.  We need to change the culture.  It is not all about running or reading, writing and mathematics.  We are investing in children's health and well-being for life.  We need to keep bombarding and brainwashing to get that message out and to get everyone involved.  I will hand over to Dr. Una May to address the question on the climbing wall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#K00200"><p>The climbing wall has only been in there for approximately 18 months.  All of our community sports hubs will go through a full evaluation of the climbing wall.  We are rolling out that facility nationally - slowly but surely.  We are considering many models, be they based in a community centre or, as Mr. Treacy mentioned, in a school, or in a particular environment, for example, an outdoor environment.  That will be evaluated fully.  We have not got to that stage yet but the local schools are now participating in climbing programmes as part of their PE programmes.  The children just have to go across the school to the climbing wall and that has opened up a big opportunity for them.  We have visited the north-east inner city of Dublin and invested quite an amount of funding there.  There is a climbing wall in one of the schools and we have been told that it is only used once or twice a year when the people from Mountaineering Ireland come in and teach the children.  We are trying to introduce training to ensure that the wall can be used all the time and that the teachers, local community leaders and youth leaders would be able to teach climbing.  That is an important development for us.</p> <p>  Regarding the non-competitive aspect, as Mr. Treacy said, there is an emphasis on developing what we refer to as physical literacy.  It is a term that is increasingly being used more.  We are developing a physical literacy consensus statement in order that people will understand what it means.  In line with mathematics, reading and other literacy skills, it is important that physical literacy is considered to be a recognised term.  It is about understanding the importance of being physically active and the fundamental movement skills of jumping, running and  throwing in order that play is something that becomes normal and that children are able to play.  We find when they go to secondary school, children do not even have the fundamental movement skills.  They are not able to catch a ball or to jump very far.  That limits their ability to take part in many activities.</p> <p> The Physical Education Association of Ireland, PEAI, and the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, have developed a module on physical literary.  It is about understanding the fundamental movement skills but also  the importance of physical activity, how to achieve it and recognising how to achieve it in different environments.  It is a holistic approach to being physically active, fit and healthy and covers the area of well-being.</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy mentioned "Operation Transformation".  We work very closely with those involved in that programme in the physical activity elements they introduce.  We have found that many schools became involved in activities at the time of the  "Operation Transformation" programme and have continued them.   The concept of 10@10 was introduced, encouraging children to do ten minutes of exercise at their classroom desk at 10 a.m.  Those types of initiatives have been continued beyond the duration of the programmes and they have been beneficial in introducing that level of activity within the confines of a classroom during the school day.</p></speech>

It is a matter of trying to encourage them to do something other than that.  Mr. Treacy hit the nail on the head when he referred to the fact that non-organised sport just does not happen any more.  I do not see it on local greens any more.  When I started out as a councillor 14 years ago, I would have been knocking on doors at weekends or in the evenings and there would have been children out playing everywhere.  Now, one does not see them.  Can that be tied to a combination of factors, including a latent fear on the part of society, screen time and other such elements whereby children are not been kicked out the door as was the case with me and, I am sure, most other present?  When we got home from school, we did our homework and if we had not had lunch, we would have something to eat.  Then we were out of the door until dinner time and when dinner was finished, we were out the door again until bedtime.  That was what happened and there was no question of a television being on.  At least that is what it was like in my household.  Is that all gone?  In Mr. Treacy's professional capacity, is there any  opportunity for even an element of that to be rekindled?</p></speech>

As the Chairman stated, we all grew up running out the door and involving ourselves in some activity with our friends.  The informality around that was fantastic.  As the Chairman indicated, he was out of the house all evening and television was not been watched.  There are a great many demands now on children's time.  Television and technology have a huge impact on this without a shadow of a doubt.  There is the question of whether parents feel safe allowing their children to go out.  That is another factor that was not prevalent 20 or 30 years ago but it is a factor now.  There are all those factors.  We would certainly strongly encourage that type of activity to take place on the greens.  It comes back to having physical activity for 60 minutes a day.  Children are going to sports and playing them a great deal but because they are not involved in those informal activities, they are not meeting the recommended guidelines.  It is a critical element.  We would like to see more informal activity.</p></speech>

There are a number of elements to it.  Play dates as distinct from informal play has very much become a feature.  The matter of making time for screen time is a huge issue.  I attended one of the focus groups and the word "television" did not come into it, it is now all about screens.  Television is now amusing and the idea that people or a family would watch it together does not exist in many homes.  We must remember that for nine months of the year - we are being fooled today with the good weather - going outside is not something with which many people are as comfortable as they might be.</p><p>We are fooled today, but we have to remember that for nine months of the year, many people are not as comfortable as they might be with going outside.  We intend to return to the Bring Back Play strategy we pursued as part of a previous campaign.  The type of play we will be advocating may or may not be more organised.  It might involve sport or whatever.  We will focus on activities like children using their scooters to get to school, while accompanied by an adult, as they develop the basic skills about which Ms May spoke.  We can do it, but many of the cultural norms that have developed are against us.</p></speech>

Activity has been planned out of our environment.  The car is king in this country now.  Kids cannot play on the streets of housing estates because cars have priority.  There are no speed limits and there is no control.  It is great that we have been able to introduce swimming and cycling programmes with the assistance of Healthy Ireland funding and dormant accounts funding, but we have found ourselves having to teach kids how to ride bikes.  In days gone by, it was normal for kids to get on their bikes to play and to go places.  Kids have lost their independence.  They are brought everywhere.  They are not able to use their bikes.  When they learn to use their bikes, the environment is not conducive to allowing kids to cycle anywhere on them.  They potentially learn the skills, but then they do not use their bikes after that.  I think we have a huge job to do on our environment.</p></speech>

It is bizarre that bikes were banned from public parks in Fingal until recently.  In one case, it was only when we exerted some pressure that we managed to get the local authority to accept that the park could be used as a cycle route by kids going to school.  I refer to a park that is used by kids going from one side of Malahide to a secondary school on the other side of the town.  Now it seems to be accepted.  The justification we have heard is that all the footpaths have been widened.  It is not the case that the footpaths were narrow in the first instance.  I can see that the built environment has changed quite dramatically.  There has also been a change in how we perceive it to be useable.  I could not possibly disagree with Dr. May's point about cars in housing estates.  I have seen people asking neighbours whom they have known for ten years to move their cars under certain circumstances, only to be met with a stonewall response.</p><p>I was going to ask about the START campaign and promotion.  The budget has been mentioned.  The issue of constant refreshing has been well covered.  Dr. Foley-Nolan spoke earlier about fast food firms targeting schools and their environs.  This issue was touched on previously when we had an interesting discussion with a gentleman from Wicklow who did a tremendous job with regard to no-fry zones.  Ironically enough, a planning application in Skerries had been considered the day before the meeting in question.  It went away, but it has come back again.  I want to highlight that Wicklow County Council has granted planning permission for a fast food outlet next to a school, even though it recently accepted an award for its no-fry zone.  The council's justification for this preposterously ridiculous decision is that the outlet in question will not open until 5 p.m., but schools close at approximately 4 p.m. and many students attend after-school activities.  It should not be there.  I think it is appalling.  In Dr. Foley-Nolan's ten years of professional experience with <i>safe</i>food, has she seen schools being targeted?  Is it actually quantifiable?</p></speech>

We cannot measure the intentions of franchises.  It is a fact that new planning in proximity to schools is certainly going on.  It seems to be another incipient move to capitalise on students in secondary schools when they are let out.  There is research in the UK and the US on proximity to schools.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Foley-Nolan.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Mr. Conlon and Ms Harrington about their professional experience of breakfast clubs.  I know there is a difference between facilitating schools and funding schools.  When we are delivering certain programmes to individuals and to entire schools to address disadvantage, we do not necessarily look at schools that might not be perceived as having disadvantage but that actually do.  Obviously, each household is different.  I appreciate that schools and school principals are responsible for identifying disadvantage.  When the relevant section of the Department is funding a programme, does it proactively ask whether there is more it can do to target funding towards a specific scheme or programme?  Does it go into individual schools, with the assistance of school management, in that way?</p></speech>

As result of the increase in funding for the school meals programme, we have been able to increase the supports for DEIS schools.  We offer breakfasts for all children and lunches for most children in those schools.  Most children in DEIS schools can avail of breakfasts and lunches at this point.</p></speech>

During recent meetings of this committee, we have been very fortunate to hear from some pretty dedicated people about what they are trying to do within their fields of expertise.  As far as I can see, the Super Troopers programme has had an impact.  The numbers certainly look quite extraordinary.  Are all the witnesses aware of that programme?  They may not be.  The Super Troopers programme is funded entirely by a private company.  Fair play to the company in question for doing so.  Is it something we should support from a national policy perspective?  Is it something we should try to replicate?  Should we try to ensure it is universal by providing for another funding stream or mechanism to ensure that it can go places with that private company where it does not go at present?  I hope the witnesses understand what I am getting at.</p></speech>

My final question is for Mr. Treacy of Sport Ireland.  We have been talking around the issue of participation in sport, primarily field sports or team sports.  I refer to the age at which one participates after which that competitive element is introduced as the norm.  As a competitive sportsman and as somebody with a huge amount of experience, what would Mr. Treacy's view be on that?  I am not picking the age - let the national sporting body govern what that is.  The GAA has it as a code and it is up to ten or 11.  I know of some soccer clubs that have it at 14 and of a rugby cub that has it up to under 14 or 15.  What is Mr. Treacy's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018062700002#M00300"><p>I will come at it perhaps a little differently.  I believe that this is really the important piece.  All the sporting clubs around the country want to keep the children involved in their clubs and part of what we are doing around good practice in children's sport is highlighting to the clubs that competitiveness will come from within and not all children want to be competitive.  That is a critical piece.  We need to be respectful of the children who do not want to participate for competitive reasons and are a bit more casual.  There is a piece around the club not pushing the children too far or too hard.  What we want is for the children to have a very positive experience in sport.  We do not want them to be put off by going into highly competitive environments.  The children, by their nature, will be competitive anyway.  There is a piece there in terms of the volunteers and coaches making sure that the opportunity is there and letting the children decide for themselves, but ensuring that the child who is not really competitive is very much welcomed in the club and that he or she is not sitting on the sideline all the time.  This makes sure they are involved in the club, are part of it and feel part of any team or activity and that they are welcomed and valued in the club.  That is a very important piece.</p></speech>

Our research has found that children who are involved in more activities will prolong their involvement in sport because where one sport might disappoint them, because they do not make the team, they will have something else in their lives as opposed to the one sport being their only focus in life and they will not drop out completely.  The research shows that if they get involved in different kinds of activities, the chances are that they will stick with at least one or two of them as they go forward.</p></speech>

I will start with <i>safe</i>food.  The opening lines of the statement were strong and were true.  We need strong and bold actions going forward.  I will touch on a few of the key recommendations, in particular the one on the sugar tax.  In a full year, revenue is expected to be in the region of &euro;40 million.  We would all agree that this would go along way to tackling obesity.  Has the <i>safe</i>food had any engagement with the Department of Finance, considering all the evidence it has on the economic effects of obesity?  </p><p>Another issue spoken about was the children's commercials code.  It has yet to be reviewed and that is long overdue.  Maybe I am wrong but I believe it could be 2020 before anything is developed and we all know that children are exposed to marketing, be it through television or other media outlets.  On the issue of the voluntary advertising code, given <i>safe</i>food's bold opening statement, does it believe it is sufficient?  When one considers that it is nearly six months since the publication of the code, it is not being monitored and there are no guidelines.  Does <i>safe</i>food believe that is good enough?  Does it believe we should be moving towards the statutory regulation of junk food marketing and advertising?</p><p>When <i>safe</i>food refers to its MediaWise programme, does it not think that we should not be placing more of an onus on these marketing companies and that we should be giving our children all the skills and the tools they need to navigate this?</p></speech>

This reformulation was obviously technically possible, but until the tax was heralded, this did not happen.  Now it has happened.  Although we will not get an income from that, it has achieved its objective.  As regards the income, all of us would like if it was ring-fenced.  There have been discussions but it is over to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the end of the day.  It would send a very strong signal and it would be bold and clear.  The money would be very welcome.</p> <p>  Dr. McGloin will talk about the marketing.  The evidence internationally is that voluntary codes are not highly successful.  This is progress, however, in a positive direction.  When I mention things like smoking, it took 20 to 30 years to get us to where we are today.  People working in bars were totally against there being any limitations.  Now one cannot smoke in a bar.  It takes time and a cultural shift.</p></speech>

We sat on the committee where the BAI introduced the food-profiling model in the last iteration of the children's code, and that is hugely welcomed.  Now we have a way to assess foods against a model.  It also introduced the one in four rule for the advertising of unhealthy foods.  It is no more than one in four in any block of advertising.  That is positive.  At the time, the public health bodies would have lobbied for the 9 p.m. but we did not get it.  In the next iteration, we will be lobbying for the same piece.  While there was huge progress in that iteration, we will be looking for further progress in the next one.<br/><br/>To echo what Dr. Foley-Nolan said regarding the voluntary model, we sat on the working group with the Department of Health.  We would have liked to see the code go further but we are happy that we have any kind of code to address the non-broadcast area.  It is a very positive step in the right direction but it does not go far enough.  We see it as a start.  There will be another iteration.  We would love to see it monitored and all those structures come in to help implement what is there.  It needs to go further, particularly in the digital environment.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned MediaWise which is not the be all and end all.  It is a resource for primary schools to help children understand their media environment.  Given that 30% of advertising is for unhealthy food, understanding the media environment is a food skill and we have to understand that.  Our resource will go some way to help children protect themselves, but obviously that does not deal with the environmental piece.  We have to change their environment and help them understand the environment at the same time.  We are coming at it from two angles.</p></speech>

Do we need a stronger health policy regarding what foods can be sold or provided to children in the school environment?</p></speech>

In this regard, the food in schools forum would be great idea because it is an interdepartmental approach, which is what is needed.  There is no point in health promotion preachers saying one thing and the environment being counter to that.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Deputy Rabbitte has touched on this issue and I apologise if I am repeating questions.  How many non-DEIS schools have received support under the scheme?  I am sure that other Deputies have received representations on the eligibility criteria for the scheme in respect of non-DEIS schools.  There are schools in all of our areas that are not designated DEIS schools but nonetheless there are children in those schools going to school hungry.</p> <p>  Mr. Conlon said that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is writing to schools.  Was he referring in that regard to schools that have previously applied for the schools meal programme but were refused?  </p></speech>

Once a school entered a scheme it was not the Department's practice to remove it.  There are some schools in the current scheme that came in under disadvantage schemes that were in place in the past.  The current identification for disadvantage is DEIS.  This is our focus in terms of bringing in new schools.  This determination is carried out by analysis undertaken within the Department of Education and Skills, as opposed to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Currently, there are approximately 900 DEIS schools, of which 853, or 95%, are in the schools meal programme.  In the past two weeks, we have written to the remaining 48.  We would have written to many of these schools in the past because we periodically write to DEIS schools to encourage those who are not participating tend to be rural as opposed to urban DEIS schools.  We have written to them again.</p> <p>  The increased funding has allowed us to improve the supports to DEIS such that we now offer breakfast and lunch to the majority of children in DEIS schools.  On the non-DEIS schools that we are bringing in, we have been working with the Department of Education and Skills to identify schools that have some level of disadvantaged but probably not to the level required under DEIS.  We wrote to approximately 170 of those schools last year, 140 of which opted into the scheme.  In regard to those that did not opt-in last year, we have written to them again this year inviting them to come into the scheme.  At this point, we have written to about 60 schools outside of DEIS, inviting them to join the scheme from this September.  These schools were identified in consultation between the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Education and Skills. </p></speech>

This is an important matter and AOTI welcomes the committee's consideration of it.</p> <p>  The new standard operating procedure, SOP, for assessment of need was developed by the HSE to ensure a consistent approach to applications for assessment of need.  It was due to be implemented from 30 April 2018 but this did not happen because of concerns raised by numerous stakeholders.  In response to concerns about the document that were raised by our members, AOTI published a statement in April 2018 on the proposed SOP.  I will outline a summary of AOTI's concerns.</p> <p>  First, I will give an overview of the assessment of need process.  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 has been enacted for all children born on or after 1 June 2002.  This enables parents, guardians or professionals to apply for an assessment of need under the Act.</p><p>According to the Act, and subsequently published regulations, the assessment of need, AON, must be commenced within three months of application and completed within a further three months.</p><p> Occupational therapists are often one of the key professionals in the AON process.  Currently, the process is significantly impacting on available therapeutic resources for children.  Occupational therapists are frequently required to prioritise AONs over other areas of practice, which detracts from time spent carrying out the non-statutory assessment of children and providing them with occupational therapy intervention.  It is important to note that, while the AON will often result in the therapeutic, health or educational needs of a child being identified, it places no obligation on services to immediately provide the named supports.  This results in children being placed on lengthy waiting lists for intervention when the AON is complete.</p><p> In a recent survey of 98 occupational therapists undertaken by the AOTI, the majority of participants reported a typical AON, including direct assessment, observation, information-gathering and report-writing can take a practitioner anywhere from two to 12 hours to complete, with the majority taking between four and eight hours.  The variation in length of assessment is because of the uniqueness of each child and the need for varying levels of assessment depending on complexity.</p><p> Therapists reported that children are then placed on the occupational therapy wait list for further occupational therapy assessment and intervention when the AON is complete.  Waiting lists vary significantly across the country.  The majority reported it can take eight months to two years for further occupational therapy assessment and intervention to be offered, while just 30% reported that it would take less than fewer months.  Some reported it can be significantly longer than two years.  Participants highlighted the AON process is significantly impacting on the level of service occupational therapy services can provide and the proposed standard operating procedure will only exacerbate this.</p><p> The HSE's standard operating procedure for AON was developed with the intention of ensuring a consistent approach to managing requests for a statutory assessment of need and processing the resulting referrals.  Contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedure document, the AOTI was not consulted during the initial drafting of the standard operating procedure.  Neither has the association been sent a copy by the HSE.  We do recognise the need for standardisation of AON processes.  We are keen to work with the HSE to achieve a process that best meets the needs of children and their families but one that is evidence-based and that is in line with ethical and best practice.  We cannot, however, support the standard operating procedure as it has been presented for the a number of reasons.</p><p> The reconfiguration of children's services has not happened in all community healthcare organisations, CHOs, which is a prerequisite for the standard operating procedure to work.  Reconfiguration allows children to access needs-led multidisciplinary services in their locality if they present with complex needs, regardless of diagnosis.  Non-configured areas continue to operate on the basis of diagnosis, leaving many children with undiagnosed complex needs without adequate services.</p><p> The absence of reconfigured teams in most areas means many therapists are working in a uni-disciplinary manner and have no, or limited, access to other professionals which would enable them to complete the preliminary team assessments proposed by the standard operating procedure.  Currently, just two of the nine CHOs in the State are fully reconfigured with children's network disability teams.</p><p> The SOP has been introduced against a background of under-resourcing of children's disability services nationally, where there are lengthy waiting lists to access services and further waiting lists for intervention.  Related to this is the lack of resources in children's disability services to ensure timely diagnosis and intervention where a disability has been identified through the AON process.  The SOP will, therefore, further restrict the provision of paediatric occupational therapy services.</p><p> To illustrate the reality of this, we wish to share an example from one non-reconfigured service in the south.  This disability service took over part of the provision of autism services in its area 12 years ago.  At the time of the establishment of this new autism service, 50 children were transferred into the service and one whole-time equivalent occupational therapist was allocated.  Some 12 years later, there are 1,000 children linked with this service with only three whole-time equivalent occupational therapists.  The HSE's own recommendation is that there should be a ratio of 1.5 whole-time equivalent occupational therapists per 100 children with a disability.  This means that where there should be 15 occupational therapists, but there are only three.</p><p> The current reality of a child referred to this service involves a preliminary screening occurring prior to the child entering the service and an indication of an autism diagnosis is highlighted.  A diagnostic assessment is then completed within 2.5 years of application, following which a diagnosis of autism, if present, is confirmed within six weeks.  If the diagnosis is confirmed, the child will then be placed on waiting lists for further interventions.  In the case of occupational therapy services, the waiting list for further assessment or intervention is more than 12 months.  A child has to wait up to 3.5 years for occupational therapy intervention.</p><p> If this service introduces the standard operating procedure within the current system, a third layer of waiting lists will be created prior to diagnostic assessment.  This will create further delays in referring children for diagnostic assessment.  Without a diagnosis, children with autism risk losing out on places in special autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, units in schools and children with autism in mainstream education will be unable to obtain access to special needs assistance.  This may prevent some children from accessing education at all, which is a breach of their constitutional rights.  As a result of the additional demands the SOP will place on the under-resourced autism service in the south, it is considering suspension of all therapeutic services in order to be able to meet these requirements.  There simply will be no capacity to provide occupational therapy intervention and children will be placed on waiting lists for occupational therapy indefinitely.</p><p> The standard operating procedure proposes only a 90-minute timeframe for assessment.  As noted previously, the majority of occupational therapists currently spend between four and eight hours per referral for an AON.  The 90-minute assessment timeframe proposed by the SOP does not afford the therapist time to assess the child across a variety of environments, such as school, home and clinic, which is considered best practice for comprehensive assessment.  Initial meetings with services can also be anxiety-inducing for families and children.  This is likely to impact on the child's presentation and, potentially, the outcome of the assessment.  In addition, the 90-minute timeframe creates a risk of over-reliance on short observations, paper screening and parent report to guide clinical decision-making.  A fixed 90-minute period for assessment does not allow an occupational therapist to gather all the information they may need to make a proper assessment of the child.</p><p> The standard operating procedure requires clinicians to identify, after a 90-minute assessment, whether the child has a permanent disability that warrants further assessment in order to confirm a diagnosis.  It also requires that therapists provide strategies to parents and carers by the end of the 90-minute assessment.  The AOTI is concerned this places significant pressure on therapists to make an important decision with what may be limited information, resulting in potentially inappropriate referrals to diagnostic services or provision of inadequate and potentially harmful intervention strategies to the parents and carers.  Occupational therapists can only provide intervention strategies when they have completed a full occupational therapy assessment.  The AON is not an occupational therapy assessment.  Accordingly, the approach outlined in the SOP is lacking an evidence base and will compromise safe and ethical practice.</p><p> The procedure places occupational therapists in breach of the code of professional conduct and ethics for occupational therapists of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU.  Among the many requirements in the code, it states that therapists must act in the best interests of service users; treat each service user as an individual in a client-centred manner; respect and, where appropriate, speak out on behalf of service users; communicate sensitively and effectively with service users, taking into account any special needs when communicating with children; carry out their duties and responsibilities in a professional and ethical way to protect the public; be responsible for any service or professional advice they give; be able to justify any decisions they make within their scope of practice and that they are always accountable for what they do, what they fail to do, and their behaviour; meet professional standards of practice and work in a lawful, safe and effective manner; and be an advocate for service users.</p><p>Each of these requirements is compromised by the proposed SOP and this places occupational therapists in direct conflict with the requirements of the CORU code of professional conduct and ethics for occupational therapists.  That is a matter of serious concern for the AOTI and our members and one that must be addressed by the HSE.</p><p> In summary, the AOTI does recognise the need for standardisation of assessment of need, AON.  However, we can only support an AON process that best meets the needs of children and their families and that does not place occupational therapists in an impossible situation where they are caught between HSE and CORU requirements.  We have requested that the HSE engages directly with the AOTI and other stakeholders to ensure a full and thorough consultation on the standard operating procedure, SOP, for the assessment of need and to resolve the concerns we have expressed here today.</p><p> To date, there has only been one meeting which took place one month ago.  The AOTI is keen to engage with the HSE on the development of this and any future policies affecting children and more broadly so that difficulties such as those can be prevented.  Ms O'Malley and I look forward to discussing this with the committee today, following the other opening statements, and we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have as best we can.</p></speech>

I am joined by my PSI colleague, Dr. Catherine Long.</p> <p>  The PSI is the learned and professional body for psychology in the Republic of Ireland.  The society is committed to maintaining professionally appropriate standards of practice in psychology and also to exploring new and innovative ways of furthering psychology as a real and applied science.</p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to detail our concerns regarding the proposed new standard operating procedure for assessment of need.  While the PSI is supportive of an SOP in principle, we have significant concerns regarding the document in its current iteration.  It is our considered opinion that the proposed changes to clinical practice described within the SOP will in many cases prove detrimental to children and their families.  The parallel operation of the new SOP and the iHIQA standards for the assessment of need, 2007, is likely to give rise to conflicting requirements for clinicians.  Of particular relevance is a published determination by the disability appeals officer, which included the following deliberation: "the contents of HSE guidance cannot be relied upon to excuse or justify any failure of (the psychologist) to comply with the HIQA standards".  Furthermore, we have concerns that compliance with the SOP could lead to psychologists being in breach of the PSI code of professional ethics of 2011, and, in due course, the CORU framework for a common code of professional conduct and ethics of 2010.</p> <p>  Our full position paper, which was also submitted to the committee, highlights our concerns in detail.  A summary of same is as follows: First, it is the opinion of the PSI that the preliminary team assessment, PTA, model described in the SOP is contrary to the spirit of the Disability Act 2005, which was developed as rights-based legislation.  The PTA is a brief screening assessment.  Its introduction will significantly reduce the level of assessment provided to a child under the statutory framework of AON.  Prior to the SOP, the child's needs determined the level and type of assessment provided.  These assessments varied substantially because children's needs vary.  However, the SOP replaces this with a uniform screening assessment, to be completed by two clinicians in a maximum of 90 minutes, regardless of the child's needs.</p> <p>  Second, the proposed SOP states that the Disability Act does not give a right to access to a diagnosis.  It is proposed that diagnostic assessments, for example, for autistic spectrum disorder, will no longer be provided as a part of the AON protocol, and will instead be identified as "health needs" in the service statement.  However, the independent disability appeals officer has found against the HSE on several occasions for failing to provide a comprehensive assessment of need, including failures to address the specific concerns of the applicant relating to diagnostic assessment, as required by the iHIQA standards.</p> <p>  Third, the Disability Act states that an assessment report shall state whether the applicant has a disability, state the nature and extent of any disability, and describe both the health and education needs occasioned by the disability and the health or education services required to meet those needs.</p> <p>  It is the view of the PSI that in the majority of cases it would not be possible for a psychologist to answer these questions and feed these back to parents within the maximum timeframe stipulated by the SOP.  Adequate time with parents or guardians is required, along with sufficient time with the child for the purposes of direct assessment.  It is also essential to give parents or guardians time at the conclusion of an assessment to process their reactions to any diagnosis or other feedback, in accordance with Informing Families of Their Child's Disability: National Best Practice Guidelines.</p> <p>  Fourth, in the view of the PSI, introduction of the SOP will give rise to the following risks: (a) A child may incorrectly be deemed not to have a disability, as the disability is not apparent from a screening assessment.  The absence of evidence in a single screening session and setting is insufficient evidence to warrant a determination of the absence of a disability.  In the event that a child receives an incorrect determination of no disability, they will consequently be denied more comprehensive assessment, and receive either no or inappropriate intervention; (b) A child's difficulties may be incorrectly formulated, again due to a comprehensive assessment not being permitted within the PTA model; (c) A child may be deemed likely to have a disability, but to require further comprehensive assessment to determine the nature and extent of the disability.</p> <p>  In many geographical areas, each of these scenarios will result in substantial delays for many children and their families in accessing a wide range of appropriate and needs-based financial supports, educational provision, and health services.  In addition, the latter two scenarios will result in children being placed on potentially inappropriate and long waiting lists for assessment or intervention.  I thank members of the committee for inviting us here this morning.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My name is Ruth Gilhool and I am joined by Margaret Lennon.  We are two of the co-founders and administrative staff of the DCA Warriors group.  We currently represent almost 20,000 parents who have children with special needs and-or serious illness.  Our main issues with the new standard operating procedure for assessment of need are the lack of consultation and the failure to inform parents of the changes in this procedure.  The full text of the SOP was not available online at the time of writing, and it has been in operation for some time already.  Parents should be fully informed of matters affecting their children's health and well-being, in particular if their needs are complex.</p> <p>  The following is a quote from Dr. Rita Honan, clinical psychologist.  "Diagnosis is the gateway to treatment and the subsequent reduction of symptoms and increased cognitive and adaptive functioning for the majority of children on the autism spectrum.  Every day this is delayed leads to missed learning opportunities."</p> <p>  In particular we have an issue with the initial screening process, which consists of an overly complicated application form, additional information sought by phone, and then a preliminary team assessment of no more than 90 minutes.  We do not consider that to be a sufficient amount of time to make a determination of disability in a child.  Correct assessment and diagnosis is vital for parents in order to be able to effectively advocate for their child.  Under the Constitution, parents are the primary educators of the child, and with complex health and educational needs, it is essential that these needs are determined under clinical best practice standards.  A lack of diagnosis hinders intervention which has an impact on health, mental health and education.</p> <p>  Without significant investment in staffing numbers, the new primary team assessment, PTA, will pull clinicians away from their positions in early intervention teams, EIT, the school age disability teams, SADT, and primary care teams, in order to carry out screening as part of PTA.  This will result a delay to intervention and lengthening waiting lists for these services, which is already over four years in some areas, exacerbated by children subsequently being referred onto these lists after the screening process.</p><p>This process moves children effectively from the waiting list for assessment of need, which has a statutory timeframe attached to it, to the waiting lists of the disability network team, early intervention team or school age team, which do not have a statutory timeframe.  These lists are already lengthy, with waiting lists of up to four years being operated in some parts of the country.</p><p> Not having timely full assessment and diagnosis, where warranted, of a child's needs, puts a child at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to having his or her health and educational needs met, with knock-on effects into the applications for school supports, specialised school placements, ASD preschool, home tuition and higher education.  We have outlined these effects in the briefing document we supplied to the committee.</p><p> Early intervention is crucial for those with milder initial presentations and those who are more severely affected.  An investment in early intervention can save a significant amount of money in the long run, not to mention the improvement in quality of life of the child and his or her family.  If appropriate supports cannot be accessed due to a child being on a lengthy waiting list, the knock-on effects, especially in the area of mental health, are in some cases catastrophic, and we see examples of this among our members on a daily basis.  The proposed approach by the HSE is shortsighted and pushes problems down the line, where they will be more severe and costly to resolve for both the families and the State.</p><p> We request the Joint Committee on Health to write to the Minister for Health with its report.  It was an oversight on our part that this was not included in our opening statement.  We thank the committee for the invitation and giving its time.  We invite any questions, which Margaret Lennon will be happy to answer. </p></speech>

If I were to do so again, I would ask that the Health Service Executive, the Minister of State and all the organisations present should be represented in order that we could all be on the same hymn sheet.  That did not matter and we can certainly relay the witnesses' concerns to the next meeting.  There is a very good mix of organisations represented today.  I especially welcome the parents who live the lives of caring for someone with a disability every day.  To know what is happening, one has to walk in someone's shoes.  They are especially welcome and I thank them all for their contributions.</p><p>Obviously the current model of assessing need is not working with more than 4,000 children awaiting assessment, three quarters of whom are waiting longer than the three-month target - often way longer.  Those in my constituency of Cork South-West and across all of Cork and Kerry seem to be waiting longer for the assessment.  They spend longer on waiting lists than people anywhere else in the country.  I know Cork is the biggest county and has the biggest population outside Dublin, but even <i>pro rata</i>we seem to be waiting longer for everything for some reason.  I will raise that at the next meeting; it is obviously not something the witnesses can answer.</p><p>As the witnesses have outlined, the new proposals will not work and obviously the old system is not working.  I think everyone's heart is in the right place, but something has gone wrong.  What can be done for the future?  The witnesses have all highlighted what is not working and what they believe will not work.  What can be done?  If the Minister of State were here this morning, what would the witnesses suggest?  This whole area is in disarray.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for disabilities, I deal with this issue every day.  The length of time to people wait to have an assessment of need done keeps coming up.  As Ms Gilhool said, diagnosis is the gateway to treatment.  She put it very well and I will use that saying in future.  Given that early intervention is so important, the assessment of need and where it directs people to go are also important.  Rather than, as we all do, knocking the present system and knocking the proposed new system, what do the witnesses suggest can be done?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Odhr&aacute;n Allen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#K00400"><p>We knew this question would be asked and it is not an easy question to answer.  We hope that part of what will come out of today is a focus on a solution.  From the perspective of the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland, this standard operating procedure, SOP, has highlighted three problems in the system.  In seeking a solution we must take account of the problems.  The SOP has highlighted the under-resourcing of services leading to long waiting lists, which is a reality in the disability services.  The SOP will only exacerbate that.  There is an inequity of service delivery nationally because only two of the nine community health organisations, CHOs, have been reconfigured under progressing disability services.  That is part of the solution that is needed in the system also.</p> <p>  There are issues with the Disability Act and the assessment of needs process, which are matters for the Oireachtas to address.  It is clear from the two professional groups represented here and it is certainly a serious concern for our members, that the professional autonomy of occupational therapists is compromised by this SOP.  Persons  carrying out an assessment of a child to determine whether he or she has a disability need to be able to stand over the report they produce or to which they contribute.  They need to be satisfied they have gathered all the correct information and have carried all the necessary assessments to be able to stand over what are very important matters.  Certainly the 90-minute cap on assessment is hugely problematic.</p> <p>  Page 79 of the SOP deals with guidance for assessors and under the section on assessment process, it states that a preliminary team assessment will be the first step in every child or young person's interaction with the disability service and that in cases where an assessment has been made for an assessment of need, AON, under the Disability Act 2005, this preliminary assessment will fulfil the team's obligation under AON.  What this is saying, not in the body of the SOP but in the guidance notes for assessors, is that the HSE's intention is that this preliminary team assessment will become the model for the first point of contact with all disability services for children.</p> <p>  This is problematic because we understood this was an attempt to address the problem with the AON - the requirement in the Act for it to be completed within three months.  However, this states that the preliminary team assessment will become the first point of contact for all children.  We do not understand why that would be the case.  Surely the first point of contact for somebody who is not seeking an assessment of need should be to be seen by a team for a full team assessment.  That needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  The following item in the guidance notes on page 79 needs to be fixed.  It states that no family should leave the clinic without some strategies to support the child or young person.  We understand why the HSE would want that to happen.  No professional would like to be seeing a family in this context and not be able to follow through.  However, the reality is that this is a preliminary team assessment under the AON.  It is not a full comprehensive professional assessment.  We should not conflate the two.  A professional cannot be asked to carry out a preliminary team assessment to establish what is required under the Act and then be expected to carry out a level of intervention, which he or she cannot do without first having carried out a full professional autonomous assessment.  That is part of the solution.  That is my initial response.  Ms O'Malley may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

It simply is not possible.  There are a number of occupational therapists and other clinicians working in a uni-disciplinary manner at the moment because of lack of reconfiguration.  Even within reconfigured services there is still under-resourcing and understaffing.</p><p>It would simply be impossible to do this type of assessment without the staffing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Long" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#L00200"><p>We all feel for families left waiting for long periods - longer than they should be - to receive a thorough assessment.  That is the position in many areas of the country.  It is absolutely right to say that is not acceptable.  Our concern is that the proposed solution is not a solution.  It removes the legal right for an assessment given under the Disability Act 2005 and potentially places people on a waiting list where they would have no legal right and would have to wait as long as required by service and resource demands.</p> <p>  There is geographical variation around the country.  Assessments are provided on a timely basis in some areas but there are also many areas where they are not provided in a timely manner.  We view that as a resourcing issue.  Resources cost money, which is limited, and resources allocation is the constant problem within any service.  Investment needs to be made in services.  The broad base of evidence consistently shows the provision of early intervention saves money and reduces costs in the long run.  One Australian study on providing early intervention services to a child with autism estimated lifetime savings of between 750,000 and 1.3 million Australian dollars per child.  The benefits came from reduced support in adulthood, reduced services, increased employment rates and reduced mental health difficulties.  While there is a short-term cost to increasing resources, the evidence shows an economic saving in the long run, as well as a human saving, from supporting children and families and giving them the best chance.</p> <p>  I reiterate Mr. Allen's point about the constraints the SOP document places on clinicians regarding autonomy and decision-making.  We do not do assessments if we believe they are not necessary.  Psychological assessment can be complex and there can be differential diagnoses.  We need the freedom to do the assessment we consider necessary to give an appropriate diagnosis as otherwise there is a risk of giving an inappropriate diagnosis.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Lennon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#L00400"><p>The SOP document states that parents should be fully informed at all times.  I would go further.  We should be consulted much more because we are doing the work that is needed in our homes.  We get professional guidance, usually privately.  As the professional bodies have outlined, the waiting lists are, unfortunately, horrendous.  I echo the Psychological Society of Ireland.  The cost of not providing early and appropriate diagnosis and intervention will be catastrophic given the rising prevalence of autism globally.  Early identification is paramount.  Figures for Ireland compiled by the NCSE identify that one in 65 children in the education system has a diagnosis.  No data are being collected by the HSE to determine the real figures.  How can a service or an education be planned if the data are not available?</p> <p>  The position in Ireland is so urgent that childhood developmental checks should be changed to incorporate the modified checklist for autism in toddlers.  This would allow the HSE to be informed of the numbers coming into the service, even prior to an assessment of need.  The service could then plan for these numbers and the staff hiring requirement.  We have almost 20,000 members in our group, the majority of whom have children with autism.  They are coming in droves and keep coming.  On average, we are adding approximately 400 members a month and nearly every person who applies for membership has a child with autism.  </p> <p>  We would also like to mention dyspraxia.  These disabilities are often not easily identifiable unless a professional diagnostic assessment is carried out.  The knock-on effects for children of not being able to access supports at school or via home tuition could be disastrous for many of them.  There are even parents who will claim for domiciliary care allowance, DCA, if the desktop assessment states their child does not have a disability.  While DCA and carer's allowance do not require a diagnosis, professional reports are needed.  From what the professional bodies have outlined here today, it is clear that a 90-minute assessment will not provide that.  </p></speech>

I am interested in Mr. Allen's thoughts on what changes could be made to the Disability Act 2005.  Perhaps we could discuss that a future meeting if we would like to have a think about the issue.  We are helpless in many ways, but that is something that we can try to change.  I am interested in meeting Mr. Allen to discuss that.</p></speech>

I will group the next two members together.  I call Deputy Durkan and Deputy Donnelly and I ask the witnesses to bank their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#L00700"><p> I thank our witnesses for attending this morning and for the information they have been able to give us.  This harks back to a discussion we had about waiting lists in private session earlier.  My query is still why we have waiting lists.  The needs of the patient, that is, the person directly on the front line requiring attention, whatever that may be, must be the first consideration.  I cannot for the life of me understand why we have these conversations from time to time.  There seems to be a difficulty gaining access to services for people with a particular special needs requirement.  </p> <p>  How has it come about that access to the service required is more difficult to secure in some parts of the country than in others?  It is recognised that early diagnosis is of great importance and we preach that message all the time to our constituents and the parents of children who come to speak about the complicated application form.  Arising from that, which guru designed the application form in such a complicated way?  Remember that when these forms have been filled in, they have to be assessed by somebody again.  It is a long drawn out assessment requiring serious study.  We know it is a serious subject.  This is not the first time that assessments have been done.  </p> <p>  The HSE is trying to address this issue, although it may be going about it in the wrong way.  The purpose of the exercise, however, is to try to ensure that children in all parts of the country get timely access to whatever diagnostics or treatments they require.  Following on from that, what comparisons have been made with other jurisdictions, such as Northern Ireland and the UK which are our nearest neighbours, to compare like with like?</p><p>Can we do something that we are not doing to improve the system and bring it forward some little bit?  This is something we as public representatives, and the Chairman in his professional capacity and a public representative, have had to do.  We have had to meet the parents of children and explain that there is a delay.  Why does there always have to be a delay?  Surely we can introduce some system that does not have delays associated with it?  To have a child waiting for two, three or four years, or six months for that matter, is an appalling situation because the parent does not know what the outcome will be.  They are deeply concerned and deeply stressed, and nothing changes.  We now discuss everything openly in this country with regard to health, but we must have come to a conclusion somewhere along the line that the first priority has to be the potential patient, namely, the person who has a disability or perceived disability but the parents of the children need to know where they are going.  They need to have some information as to what the future holds for them.  To tell them the child will be put on a waiting list, and that everything will be all right if they wait long enough and that something is sure to happen, is no way to treat patients.</p><p> My point is it is as easy to do things quickly as it is to do them slowly.  As a matter of fact, to do things slowly has more complications and creates greater expense and costs all around than doing it the other way.  Everybody says we need more resources.  There has to be some reason that in some parts of the country the resources are more seriously deficient than in others.  It is supposed to be a universal service.  It is supposed to be delivered all over the country at the same time, in the same way, in the same fashion and to the same extent.  Access to it is supposed to be universally applied also.</p><p> It appears to me that what the HSE is trying to do is standardise the service.  Yes, we need to standardise it but we need to improve its availability and access to the service from the point of view of the children and the parents of those children, who have a deep concern and know that early diagnosis, early action and early treatment are key to the whole outcome.  These are some of my thoughts.</p></speech>

For me, one of the most difficult experiences of being a Deputy is meeting the parents of children who have special needs and who are waiting for assessment or access to special education supports, wheelchairs, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and counselling.  I cannot begin to imagine how frustrating it must be for all of the witnesses as parents and practitioners.  I thank them for everything they are doing on a daily basis for our children.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions, which can be answered by any of the witnesses.  There are parents watching this, as are other legislators.  Will the witnesses walk us through the steps?  At some point, the parent or parents of a child may begin to think that child might have special educational needs and they would like to get the child assessed.  Will the witnesses walk us through the process from the moment that parents think they want someone to take look at their child to the child actually getting the intervention?  Do they go to the community nurse or the GP?  How do they end up on the list for an assessment?  Who does the assessment?  Once the assessment is obtained who else is involved?  I know special education needs organisers are involved, as are psychologists and occupational therapists, and I know it is different for every child, depending on his or her need, but for those watching will the witnesses walk us through the process and, if they would, the typical delays, because we know there is a delay to assessment and we know equally there is a delay from assessment to treatment?  Will the witnesses walk us through this?</p> <p>  Where does it work?  We know some parts of the country are better than others.  I hope the witnesses will be able to tell us where, if anywhere, we are doing well and, even if it never works perfectly, where does it work the best in Ireland?  Are there areas that have begun to get their heads around this and are making good improvements?</p> <p>  I read the opening statements previously and I have listened this morning.  It is clear nobody is happy with the 90 minutes, from a parental perspective and from a clinical and professional perspective.  Let us assume the HSE also cares about the nation's children, and I believe it does.  Why do the witnesses think the HSE recommends the 90 minutes?  Were they consulted, as practitioners and parents' representatives, in the formulation of the standard operating procedures?</p> <p>  What are the opinions of the witnesses on the quality of support when children get it?  This morning, obviously, we are speaking about the process for assessment and access.  We are all very aware of the delays in assessment and delays to access.  I would like a quick view as to whether, once the child actually gets the intervention he or she has been assessed as needing, sufficient resources are available.  It is a bit like the way people in Ireland state frequently that it can be very difficult to get into the HSE but once one gets in, the quality of treatment is usually pretty good.  In the opinion of the witnesses, is the quality of treatment good?  I do not mean whether the individual practitioners are any good.  I mean whether, once people finally get access, support for the child is comprehensive and sufficient.</p></speech>

He is a lovely GP but he did not know.  My son was referred to have grommets because the GP assumed it was a hearing problem.  It was not.  We then set about trying to find out where we would go to find out what was wrong.  This was some years ago and we did not have access to social media at the time.  I remember looking at my son one day and I realised that I thought he had autism.  The word terrified me because the only thing I knew about it was with regard to a campaigner who had been in the media a few years previously, Kathy Sinnott.  I remembered her very public and horrific battle, and I thought this cannot be happening.  To make a long story short, our GP did not know and we assumed our paediatrician would know.  We did not realise it has to be a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist who diagnoses autism.  We went around and around and eventually sourced a private psychiatrist.  We were so sure at this stage that he had autism that I had decided if the psychiatrist said it was not autism we were getting the next plane out of Ireland because something was really wrong.  He confirmed the diagnosis that it was regressive autism and that it was mild to moderate.</p> <p>  At that time there was very little available, so we went outside of Ireland to source clinicians and educational professionals to give us an assessment to allow us to know what our son needed as opposed to what was here at the time.  We set about providing this for him and, thankfully, because he had early, appropriate and good quality intervention, he made exceptionally good gains.</p> <p>  What I have seen in the intervening years is a wave of parents coming with young children who do not know where to go or what to do.  GPs are inundated.  Previously one could self-refer for assessment of need.  Now, the new standard operational procedure puts another layer on this, whereby there is a desktop assessment first to see whether the child can actually progress to be assessed.</p><p>This is completely unsatisfactory.  I would go so far as to say it is putting children at risk and is putting parents in an extremely difficult position.  International best practice tells us for every day one delays in providing an early and appropriate diagnosis and early and appropriate intervention, one's child will regress more.  Where are we going to go in another ten years?  How is our country going to support a generation of children who will end up extremely disabled when, if they were given a modicum of what they need, a good number of them would be able to live relatively independent lives?</p><p> On the standard operating procedure, SOP, as to whether we were consulted, the answer from DCA Warriors is "No."  We were not even aware that this process was going on.  We became aware last year that the HSE had announced an autism review and submissions were invited, on 16 August, to be in by 12 September.  We did not think this had anything to do with the current SOP but, in correspondence that I got recently from the team that generated the SOP, it would appear that the submissions for the autism spectrum review last August were used in generating the new SOP.  We sent in a submission to the autism spectrum review last year.  We had no idea at all, even from the terms of reference, that this would include in any way the standard operating procedures in this regard.</p><p> As to the quality of therapy and treatment, we believe there are a significant number of extremely committed therapists and clinicians within the HSE.  We also believe that they are being put under horrendous pressure.  I would go so far as to say that they are being prevented from carrying out their job to the best of their ability.  Most of our parents report to us that when they finally access services, such as occupational therapy, OT, or speech and language therapy, it will be for a block of maybe five or six sessions, and they might not be seen again for years.  That would be our take on the questions.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question, "why do we have waiting lists?", is an important one.  There are two issues that need to be looked at.  The first is what structure of services is the right structure.  The HSE has identified a good structure called the progressing disability services programme.  There is buy-in from all stakeholders that this is the right structure.  It is the right structure because it provides a consistent structure of services throughout the country, it is a needs-based service rather than a diagnostic-based service, there is equity of access to services and there is one clear pathway for all children according to their needs, and effectively, children would be identified as either having complex or non-complex needs.  If they are non-complex needs, they are dealt with by primary care services.  If they are complex, they will be dealt with by children's disability network teams.</p> <p>  However, as good as that structure is, it cannot work without adequate resources.  The Deputy is correct that the issue of resources always comes up.  We understand the constraints.  There is not a bottomless pot of money.  However, the reality is in the past 20 years there is a greater awareness and openness to the needs of children with disabilities.  More and more children are presenting with difficulties and needs that need to be met and there is an increased demand on services.  There are more children with needs coming forward but the progressing disability services cannot be implemented without the adequate resources.</p> <p>  As for the waiting lists, there are variations.  Ms O'Malley will say a little bit more about that.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Durkan's question about the assessment form, who designed it and why it is so unwieldy, we had no involvement.  As I stated, while it states in the SOP that professional representative bodies were consulted, for the record, we were not.  No doubt there were occupational therapists and other professionals who work in the HSE who may have been involved, but as the professional body for occupational therapists, we were not consulted.  As I stated, we have never been sent the SOP and were not involved in its development.</p> <p>  In terms of comparison with other jurisdictions, what works elsewhere or what might work here, the Deputy raises an important question, which is the issue of evidence-based service delivery.  We would question what the evidence base is for this SOP.  Some of the evidence can be service audit.  It can be the experience of professionals on the ground and feedback from users of services and families, but also what clinical evidence is there for good practice.  We would all agree that having a safe evidence-based and ethical approach is the right one.</p> <p>  I agree that delays in diagnosis are difficult for families.  As Deputy Durkan stated, families need to know where they are going.  We would feel that this SOP does not improve services towards meeting that end of helping families know what is going on for their child.</p> <p>  Ms O'Malley will try her best to respond to Deputy Donnelly's questions.</p></speech>

A parent might have concerns and maybe go to a primary care clinician, such as a GP or public health nurse, or go directly to the assessment officer in the HSE and highlight the child's needs.  They might complete an assessment, essentially, a screening assessment, and there may be an indication of, say, autism.  They will refer then into the autism service.  Even referring through the assessment of need, AON, process, there is a two and a half year waiting list for the assessment of need to be completed.  They will then be provided with the diagnosis, if that is the case, and the child will be put on a further waiting list for further assessment or intervention.  The longer that waiting list is, the more in-depth and comprehensive that assessment will have to be, essentially, one is completing a reassessment of the child because things have changed over the period that one has been waiting.  Then intervention can be provided.</p> <p>  If the SOP is to be introduced within this particular service and the parents highlight a need with the GP or the primary care clinician initially, he or she will say there is an possible indication here of ASD and will refer through the AON.  Then there will be an assessment completed within six months.  A further round of clinicians will say an ASD assessment might be indicated here and the child will have to go on the waiting list for diagnostic assessment, and then one has a further two and a half year waiting list.</p> <p>  One should note that the assessment of need process does not give a child any right to intervention whatsoever.  It highlights the needs.  One of the primary issues with the Disability Act in general is that it gives the right to assessment and identification of needs.  It does not give the right to intervention and supports to be put in place.</p></speech>

Currently, when the primary care clinician refers into the service, the child is placed on a waiting list for two and a half years for diagnostic assessment.  As part of that diagnostic assessment, the assessment of need under the Disability Act is completely currently and then there will be a further referral to an internal waiting list for intervention.  The statutory assessment needs to be completed, obviously, because it is a statutory assessment.</p></speech>

Without a diagnosis, children do not have access to special education, special autism units or special needs assistants in schools.  All of those opportunities are missed without a diagnosis.  What is missed from an intervention point of view varies greatly, depending on the child.  What my colleagues in the Psychological Society of Ireland and Dedicated Children's Advocacy Warriors have mentioned is the significant impact on the mental health of the child and his or her family.  Going without a service, interventions, support and a diagnosis has an impact on the mental health and stress levels of the family, which is immeasurable.</p></speech>

As we have seen throughout the health service, there seems to be no lack of funding, but there does seem to be a lack of personnel to fill positions.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

The provision of money to put progressive disability services in place and employ and recruit the necessary professionals to run the service is part of the issue.  Some &euro;14 million was allocated for 275 additional posts to progress disability services between 2014 and 2016.  When staff in children's disability services were mapped in 2016, there were only 175 more whole-time professional equivalents than in 2013.  We can only assume that where the extra posts were filled, even though there are difficulties in recruiting staff, others were becoming vacant and staff were not replaced owing to the moratorium on recruitment.  There are several factors - it can be difficult to recruit staff and it can also be that staff are leaving and not being replaced.  It is also the nature of many professions that different audits identify that at any one time there may be up to 10% of posts vacant due to staff being on maternity leave and there being no backfilling.  On the question of resources, there is the question of buildings, information technology and administration.  Staff on maternity leave is also a significant issue.</p></speech>

Donnelly is identifying a more fundamental issue, that there is a golden window of opportunity in the children&rsquo;s lives that is being missed and it is undeniable.  We have to bear this in mind.  It comes back to what Deputy Bernard J. Durkan said, that we have to put the child and the user of the service at the heart of what we are trying to do in addressing the issue.  </p> <p>  Someone asked about the figure of 90 minutes.  We do not know, but it raises the question of the evidence available that led to that decision.  We were not party to the decision-making and can only ask the question.  What was the evidence that led to the HSE deciding on a figure of 90 minutes?  In our research occupational therapists point out that it can take two to 12 hours and have explained that the range in time is due to varying levels of complexity.  A figure of 90 minutes seems to be arbitrary.</p></speech>

It is extremely important, but that happens in only two of the nine CHIO.  In my own clinical experience it is working better in those areas where multi-disciplinary teams are co-located and working together.  That is not to say, however, that it is ideal because they are still under-resourced, but they do have access to their colleagues.  When reconfiguration occurs, the assumption is that the resources will be put in place for the co-ordinated teams and co-ordinated access to services.</p></speech>

Why is it not universally available?  </p> <p>  On the question of best practice and best procedures, there must be some access to what is happening in other jurisdictions.  Somebody somewhere must be able to find out if we are doing it right.  I cannot understand why, when new appointments are made, that there is not direct referral to those areas where there are no deficiencies in staffing levels.  Otherwise, we will end up with no staff in some areas and extra staff in the areas that seem to be the most attractive places in which to be.</p></speech>

We went to the local health nurse when our son was about two and half years old.  It is the same for many parents who will go to the local health nurse who will say the child has grommets, this or that.  Some will refer on, while others will not.  In our case we went to the general practitioner who said he would refer us to the primary list team.  I went back to him after seven months and fell apart in his office because my son was over the age of three years and not acknowledging us.  We did not know whether he had hearing problems or there was a problem with food.  We were not getting any sleep as he was up the whole time.  He had many behavioural problems and sensory needs.  It was actually on a parents' autism group page that I found out about the assessment of needs.  I was not told by the public health nurse, the GP or the early intervention team where our son was on the list.</p></speech>

I did not realise I could seek speech and language therapy privately.  I finally found out that I could to have him assessed, only to discover that the person whom we had paid privately was a member of the early intervention team.  It took me four months to fill in the assessment of needs form.  I called the liaison officer who gave me the sheet of paper and the early intervention team to beg them to help, saying I did not know how to fill it in.  For me as a parent, it was heartbreaking to write everything that was negative about my son.  Parents feel like they are betraying their children.  They do not realise they have to say everything that is happening in the home.  Our assessment of needs was completed within nine months.  What got to me in the way of guilt as a parent was that I did not know what was meant by the words assessment of need and by then I felt I had delayed my son's diagnosis.  We now find out that, when on the waiting list, parents are sent to parenting courses and told that if they do not attend, they will be signed out of the service.</p><p>Parents are attending parenting courses when they do not even have an idea of the diagnoses relating to their children.  Some are sitting there unsure.  If a course has a bit about autism, does that mean their child has autism?  A lot of the time on pages like the Dedicated Children's Advocacy Warrior groups and other parent groups emotional support is given to parents who are falling apart in their own home.  At this stage, the relatives do not know what is wrong with the child, whether it is behaviour or whether it is bad parenting.  They are not getting any sleep and the whole family unit is falling apart.</p></speech>

I wish to address the issue of access and variability, which I think is a very important point.  In the context of Northern Ireland and the UK, I refer to a 2011 publication by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is UK-based.  It indicated that an assessment for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, takes approximately 47 hours on average.  The Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, would certainly welcome a review of services throughout the country in order to find out what works and what does not and look at how services can be reconfigured in areas where they are not working.  I also think it would be useful to have the information around staffing levels, population levels and demographics in different areas.  Can that information explain why some areas have longer waiting lists than others?  They are two possible issues to be looked at in addressing why services are much more accessible in some areas than in others.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being here for all of it.  Unfortunately, I had to be in the Seanad for an item.</p> <p>  I want to revisit the staffing issue.  This is a challenge across the board in the health service, in areas such as maternity, orthopaedics, etc.  We face a challenge in recruitment.  At present, 40% of medical practitioners who register with the Medical Council in Ireland are from overseas.  If we decided to recruit new occupational therapists and staff who operate in the area of psychology, would they be available?  That is my first question.  Second, if we were to increase the level of services and earlier assessment, is there a plan outlining the other supports that would be needed in order to provide fast and efficient services?  I am wondering if anyone has actually looked at that.  I know it is the responsibility of the HSE because it is the main body involved.  Has that been done?</p> <p>  The other issue that has arisen regarding autism and disabilities generally is that we have had a huge reliance on agencies outside of the HSE over the past 50 years.  Approximately &euro;3.5 billion is paid to more than 2,500 different organisations via the HSE's annual budget.  Is there insufficient co-ordination between the bodies that are helping in this area and the HSE?  Is there a buck-passing exercise going on as well where parents are concerned?  Do organisations say that a certain problem is really not their responsibility and claim that parents should be dealing with someone else?  I have come across families to whom this has happened, namely, families who are going from one organisation to another.  It is a hugely frustrating system.</p> <p>  I also wish to consider the area of education.  We have been lucky enough where the education system is concerned that we have employed a huge number of special needs assistants, SNAs.  I think we now have the highest number ever, with about 15,000 SNAs in our school system.  I am not saying that it is ideal or that everything is perfect but it is a huge improvement on the situation 15 years ago.  Why have we not been able to do the same thing at the very initial stages?  I was dealing with a family at the weekend in respect of a mental health issue.  I was so frustrated - and I am still frustrated - by the challenge of trying to get access to mental health services for a young person.  The initial stages are the most important and I just do not understand why we do not seem to be able to get them right.  If someone gets into the system they are fine.  The initial stages seem to be the problem.  Has anyone ever sat down and evaluated what we need to do, how we can prioritise and how we can fast-track this process?</p></speech>

Perhaps the witnesses can outline for us what notice, if any, they received.  I can tell from the look on their faces that they did not get any.  It might be helpful to explore what notice was given and what groups were consulted.  If the witnesses were not consulted, do they have a view on why they might have been left out?  Do they have a view on who the HSE selected?  I refer, in particular, to the parents who I would have thought should have been central to any process, most especially those who bear the scars of having been through the system already.  They may be best placed to comment on that and to have a very meaningful input.  Perhaps the witnesses might offer a view as to why we seem to be hearing from people who were excluded entirely from the process.  I am curious about that.</p> <p>  This question is addressed to the parents and the experts.  Would the witnesses say there are particular problems or issues for first-time parents, parents who are living deprived in areas or parents are themselves experiencing deprivation?  Is there a barrier?  Reference was made to the golden window of opportunity and to the need to purchase services from the private sector.  That is just not possible for some people.  It is literally not possible.  For those people and those children that golden window is presumably missed, and missed further by virtue of their socio-economic circumstances.</p> <p>  We are clearly 45.5 hours short of what would be considered average in terms of international best practice.  Resources are always going to be an issue, but is there any international best practice the witnesses could cite that would back up this change in the standard operating procedures, SOPs?  I am curious, because the more experts we talk to and the more we engage with parents who have been through this, the more we come back to the fact that there is no real understanding of how it operates or where it came from.  Reference has been made to the issue of reconfiguration.  There is a need to reconfigure the services, and I understand that the failure to do so is part of the reason why this SOP has not been introduced.</p><p>Two out of nine CHOs have multidisciplinary teams and everything works together.  Is the new procedure being used in those areas?  If so, is it working?  Will it work in some areas but not in others?</p><p> My final question relates to the potential for a national screening assessment.  There seems to be a postcode lottery in terms of access to services and outcomes etc.  Would a national screening programme have any benefit?  Are we anywhere close to getting the resources necessary for it and how would we need to change what we are doing in order to be able to deliver it?</p><p> We are getting mixed messages about the updated SOP.  Is it being used in any areas at present?  I understand the HSE believes it is not but I have heard it is being used in some areas.</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear how the HSE can square the circle.  Do the witnesses agree that the time spent waiting for assessment, diagnosis and subsequent treatment is time that people will never get back?  The child is developing and it is a golden window of opportunity.  In economic terms, there is a cost to trying to claw back the time.  If a child enters the system aged five or six, perhaps after a grandparent notices something, is it not costly in comparison to dealing with the child when they are aged two?  Do we have any figures for the children who are lost in the period between when parents apply for a child to be assessed and when they get an appointment?  If 100 children wait three years, do we know what is the figure for wastage?  What are the subsequent effects on their families if they fall out of the system, never to return?</p><p>Is the filling of posts because of maternity leave still an issue?  Is the moratorium a historical, rather than a current, issue?  Did Ms Gilhool indicate that, before a child is assessed, their parents could be sent on a parenting course?  Can she elaborate on how this made her feel?  It is very difficult for a parent to be put in that position.  We know these conditions exist and that early intervention has better outcomes for children and families but there seems to be an <i>ad hoc</i>approach to it.  If one of my children was doing something which I felt was not right, I would not know where to go.  It must be very stressful and when a parent finally accepts the need for intervention they need to know whom to call.  We appear to be losing a lot of valuable time that we can never get back.</p></speech>

There seems to be an extraordinary lack of consultation between the witnesses, parents' groups and advocacy groups.  The assessment of needs process is failing our children and it is unforgivable that a child has to wait over two years for an assessment and then cannot get the necessary speech and language therapists.</p> <p>  The new standard operating procedure is designed to circumvent the provisions relating to the assessment of needs and the Disability Act in order to cut waiting lists.  It seems to be a process designed to make things look better than they are and is obviously a political decision made by the health services.  As professionals, the witnesses know that early assessment and intervention are absolutely key for a child who has certain needs.  If those needs are not met, the child will lose out.  The Government is breaking the law in the Disability Act and five or six individuals have taken the Government to the High Court in this context.  The State is not delivering on legislation to help the children of this country.</p> <p>  Individuals often have to go into the private sector to see occupational therapists but this is very expensive and probably out of the reach of most people, yet they are forced to do it.  I know of some families which have gone to excellent professionals in the private sector but cannot afford to keep going.  The public service is supposed to be for children but it cannot deliver the service.  Something is dramatically wrong.  There is dysfunction in the service across the country when it does not meet children's needs.  Do the witnesses believe the standard operating procedure is a way of cutting waiting lists relating to children in this country?</p></speech>

I ask each group to comment for three or four minutes, following which we will wrap up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Odhr&aacute;n Allen" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#R00100"><p>I will go back to Senator Burke's questions.  On staffing, occupational therapists are available.  There are delays in recruitment because we have a panel system which is operated centrally by the HSE.  That creates issues.  That is part of the recruitment issue but there are occupational therapists who would be more than happy to take jobs in these services.  What numbers are needed?  I draw the attention of the committee to the document, "A National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services in Ireland".  The HSE's own paediatric clinical programme has a range of resources, one of which is this document.  Chapter 9 of this excellent resource is a guide to workforce planning.  It outlines the numbers required within progressing disabilities services and across paediatric services.  It has established the levels of staffing that are needed.  This is an excellent piece of work.</p> <p>  The people leading on progressing disabilities services within the HSE are clear that the structure of progressing disabilities services is the right one but, in terms of resourcing, the physical infrastructure is required, that is, the building to house these teams.  Administration staff, IT systems and professionals are also needed.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Kate O'Connell's questions.  We agree that the HSE needs to answer the question about the 90 minutes discrepancy.  On the missed timeframe and the question of whether children will ever get it back, the only answer I can give is that a lost opportunity is a lost opportunity.  I agree with the Deputy that it creates a false economy in which we are trying to make up for the lost opportunity.  The moratorium is gone, though there are historical issues related to it because there has not been any significant investment in services to roll out progressing disabilities services since 2016.  Even though the moratorium is over, there has not been the investment to roll out progressing disabilities services in other areas.  I will let Ms O'Malley take the other questions.</p></speech>

On consultation, we were not consulted on the SOP document.  Senator Burke also made the comment that the SNA scheme is working relatively well at the moment.  We were consulted on the scheme.  We were able to feed into it and the evidence is there.</p></speech>

Parents also come in who are extremely stressed and anxious.  Perhaps they have not slept in a long time because they have a child with such needs.  I reiterate that there are huge issues for parents.  Parents sometimes have their own learning needs, which must be accommodated.  The 90-minute assessment will just not meet those needs at all.</p> <p>  The evidence base we use for the diagnosis of autism, for example, is the assessment of a multidisciplinary team.  That does not mean two professionals, but a full multidisciplinary team.  The preliminary screening could be considered a national screening programme, as was mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly.  That is what the SOP is perhaps trying to do, but it is not enough.  Is it happening on the ground?  The AOTI position's is that it is a breach of our code of ethics and that of CORU.  I am not entirely sure whether it is happening nationally but it is a breach of our code of ethics.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Stoker" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#R00500"><p>I echo the majority of what my occupational therapist colleagues have just said.  My understanding is that psychologists are available.  We are also aware that there are some difficulties in the way in which psychologists are recruited to the HSE nationally.  The PSI is currently seeking feedback from its members regarding their experiences of that.  We hope to provide some information about that in due course.</p> <p>  As regards the consultation process, the PSI was not approached by the HSE in respect of the SOP.  Our members brought the SOP to our attention.  We produced a position paper expressing our concerns.  The HSE wrote back to us in response to that position paper and subsequently invited us to meet, unfortunately at rather short notice, and we were unable to attend.  We have not met the HSE with regard to this issue yet.  </p> <p>  It is certainly the case that many children are unable to afford private intervention.  They find that the provision of public services is delayed and, when they access them, the services can also be significantly less than might be hoped.  That is definitely a factor in many areas, though not all.  Our sense is that, partly due to the lack of consultation and partly due to referring to the evidence base regarding what constitutes a comprehensive assessment with a view to understanding the nature of a child's needs and their extent, the 90 minutes does not appear to be coming from an evidence base or from consulting the professionals.</p></speech>

The HSE's stated position is that it is attempting to improve service and access to interventions through this change in policy.  However, the effect of it is that the legal right of children to an AON will be fulfilled in a 90-minute assessment according to the SOP.  The effect is that the legal right will be met by this assessment, which is not adequate.  Children will then be placed on waiting lists for further assessment.  The SOP states that a need for assessment can be an outcome of an assessment of need.  The problem is that in areas that are currently under-resourced, this will leave children on long waiting lists to access that full diagnostic assessment.</p></speech>

Deputy Kenny asked whether the new SOP has been generated to circumvent the AON under the Disability Act, or to water down that legal responsibility.  Looking at the timeline, the High Court gave permission to proceed in July 2017 for a challenge on the failure to carry out an assessment of need or to finish it on time.  The HSE announced via press release on 16 August 2017 that it was doing a review on ASDs.  In correspondence with me, the team tasked with generating the new SOP mentioned that it used the autism review submissions to generate the SOP.<br/><br/>Deputy Kenny asked whether the new SOP is being used.  We have been informed that it has been deferred.  I have looked at all of these documents quickly.  There were 30 comments as of last night.  I will just read one or two into the record.  These are all current.  They were made in the past couple of weeks since it was deferred.</p><blockquote>Hi, I just want to let you know that the assessment officer sent me a letter to state that she was withdrawing my son from the AON facility.  I wrote to her via email explaining why this was unacceptable and she said that, because of a legal case, they are now doing away with the assessment of need.  I wrote to her repeatedly.  I did the form with her over the phone [apparently she was asked to complete a new form] thinking I was finally getting somewhere and got speech and language, who recommended a psychological assessment.  I brought my daughter previously to [she mentions the service] and it still upsets me the way we were treated.  My Dad had just died but they told me before any assessment like the ADOS [Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule] took place that my daughter was not autistic.  I have had her assessed privately and she is classically autistic.  </blockquote> <p>That is what she was told.  Without carrying out an AON, HSE determined that this child did not have ASD but no explanation was given for her behaviours other than poor parenting.</p><p>It continues:</p><blockquote>So there is no way I am letting this happen to my second child.  I would love to have OT intervention, physiotherapy and so forth if it exists.  I wonder how many families have they done this to, how many people just accept it and why doesn't our Government actually care about its little people.  I know that I am lucky.  We are working and I have made many sacrifices so we can go privately when we have to.  I do not understand why everything is such a battle.</blockquote><p>I will read one more comment:</p><blockquote>I was one of the parents that was contacted by telephone by an assessment of need officer and told that I needed to go through the new form over the telephone.  I feel so cheated now.  What do I do?  I applied for an assessment of need before Christmas 2017 and it was officially to start on 10 February.</blockquote><p>I am conscious there are time constraints but we have hundreds of the same comments.</p></speech>

After a couple of years of waiting, where nothing is progressing in the child's behaviour and development, they feel they have no other choice.  They will sell belongings on DoneDeal to get them done.</p> <p>  With regard to the comment that schools have the highest number of SNAs ever, what is written on paper is not necessarily what happens on the ground.  One of our cases involves a child who is six years old and has extreme anxiety.  The child has gone to school for a week since the beginning of April and has been signed out of school for anxiety reasons.  The SENO visited the school while the child was out and carried out a review of the three hours of SNA time per day that the child had.  Without any consultation with the parent or seeing the child in the school, the SENO took the hours away from the six year old.  We have so many cases where we are finding that since the allocations were changed for SNAs and for the resource hours, the children being signed out of school are getting younger and younger.  If one asks the Department of Education and Skills, one will not get the right numbers for the children being signed out of school because to be granted home tuition for those who are lucky enough, the children have to be still registered in the school so the school still gets the capitation money for that child.  There is money floating around there somewhere and it needs to be investigated.</p> <p>  On the parenting classes, some are ASD-related and some are not.  We only attended one.</p> <p>  The DCA Warriors were not consulted on the SNA resource hours allocation scheme.  We are known to speak out on behalf of our members; perhaps the invitation got lost in the post.</p> <p>  I would like to have an investigation to find out the amount spent by the HSE on administration of interventions and assessments of special needs versus the amount spent on the assessment and the interventions given to the children because it appears that all that has changed is an increase in paperwork.</p></speech>

I meet parents of children and young adults with autism all the time so I am familiar with all that has been presented by the witnesses.</p><p>I welcome the SOP but I have concerns.  The fact that parents and the witnesses were not consulted is indicative of what is happening.  That shows where the problem is.  People are not being consulted while others are in little huddles making these decisions.  There must be a paring back of that.  Time and again I have seen parents and families described as problem families, &quot;Everything is okay but they are problems&quot;.  I was alarmed the other night to hear one of the national autism services staff say that it is unfair on people and parents who speak out because it means that the others who do not speak out do not get the services.  My God, where are we going with all of this?  We must work together.</p><p>The CSO figures have to be inclusive of children and young adults with autism.  We cannot ever hope to address this issue if we are unable to quantify it.  All of us must work together to try to get that done.  All sorts of nonsense is included in the CSO figures.  This issue is not going away and we need to confront and tackle it together.  I want to know where the experts in autism trained.  I find that many of the services have no expertise in autism and they operate on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  I can only speak for the west, where I am from.  It was suggested to me once that if one does not have expertise in the area, trying to make a child with autism eat cabbage is like asking me or somebody else to eat glass.  There has to be an understanding of what the condition brings with it and unless we have the trained experts who can then deliver further training down through the system to ensure everybody is trained, we will not tackle it.</p><p>There is a long journey ahead on this.  We will continue to work.  We are meeting with all the national groups on trying to tackle this issue in an inclusive, progressive and timely way.  Time is running out for many of these children.  Time is also running out economically.  As was said earlier, the cost of not having early diagnosis and early intervention will be phenomenal in the future.  Leaving aside the humanity of it, the economic nonsense around all of this must be tackled.</p><p>I am sorry that the witnesses will not have time to reply but we will get an opportunity to talk again.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleague, Ms Angela O&rsquo;Neill.  She is a national disability specialist and works with me as part of the national operations team.  I understand that the committee wishes to gain greater understanding of issues surrounding the SOP, which the HSE regards as a necessary operational support to implementing the Act and which is currently the subject of an important consultation process with F&oacute;rsa trade union.<br/><br/>Since the commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 in June 2007, the HSE has endeavoured to meet its legislative requirements as set out in the Act.  Under the Act, any child born on or after 1 June 2002 is eligible to apply for an assessment of need.  Children who qualify for an AON under the Act have a right to an assessment of their health needs arising from their disability; an assessment report; a statement of the services they will receive; and to make a complaint if they are not happy with any part of the process.  The Disability Act outlines the statutory timelines under which an assessment of need must be completed.  In effect, the assessment must be completed within six months of the application date with a further month to issue the report and service statement.<br/><br/>The numbers of applications for AON under the Act have increased steadily since its implementation in June 2007.  In 2008, 2,535 applications for an assessment were received with 1,392 assessments completed.  By 2017, the number of applications received had grown to 5,814 with 3,660 assessments completed.  When originally implemented, it was envisaged that the assessment of need would apply to children aged less than five years and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act, EPSEN, 2004 would address the needs of older children.  The committee may be aware that the EPSEN Act has not been fully implemented and, following a High Court ruling in 2009, eligibility for AON was expanded to include all children born on or after 1 June 2002.<br/><br/>A 2016 review of the practice of implementation of this Part of the Act confirmed anecdotal evidence that the approach to AON is not consistent across the country.  There is evidence that practice varies widely across the nine community health organisation areas.  While a large number of guidance notes regarding AON processes have been issued since 2007, there has been no nationally standardised or agreed definition of &quot;assessment of need&quot;.  As a consequence, it is a considered view on the part of the HSE that the Act includes a number of definitions that are open to interpretation operationally, therefore, leading to an inconsistent approach as well as inequity in time afforded to &quot;assessment&quot; versus &quot;support or treatment&quot; interventions with children and their families.<br/><br/>While the Disability Act does not attempt to define an assessment of need, it does state that the assessment officer must prepare a report of the results of the assessment.  This report must set out the findings of the assessment together with determinations on:</p><blockquote>(a) whether the applicant has a disability;<br /><br />(b) where the applicant has a disabilityi. a statement of the nature and extent of the disability<br /><br />ii. a statement of the health needs (if any) occasioned to the person by the disability<br /><br />iii. a statement of the services considered appropriate to meet the needs of the applicant and the period of time ideally required for the provision of those services and the order of such provision<br /><br />iv. a statement of the period within which a review of the assessment should be carried out</blockquote> <p>In practice, because of a perceived legislative requirement to undertake a detailed and comprehensive assessment, assessment officers and clinicians have erred on the side of requesting and administering a wide range of assessments in as short a timeframe as possible.  In some cases, children may undergo numerous assessments in a short timeframe where a period of diagnostic intervention might be more appropriate.<br/><br/>In an effort to standardise procedures and to facilitate timely assessments, the HSE identified a requirement to develop a SOP for assessment of need under the Disability Act.  This SOP is intended to replace the suite of approximately 50 guidance notes issued since 2007 and will define the assessment.  It is intended that an AON will comprise a PTA that will determine a child&rsquo;s needs and will identify initial interventions that will be required to meet these needs.  In developing this SOP, a consultation workshop was held in September 2017.  Attendance included representatives from the following disciplines: assessment officers; liaison officers; community health doctors and paediatricians; occupational therapists; physiotherapists; psychologists; and speech and language therapists.  Following this workshop, a range of email submissions were received and considered.  Parent feedback provided through a parallel review of ASD services was also included in our considerations.<br/><br/>It is intended that the National Policy on Access to Services for Children and Young People with Disability and Developmental Delay 2016 will form the basis of the revised structure for the AON.  The implementation of this policy has been identified as a priority in the national HSE operational plan for 2018.  The decision-making process outlined in the access policy should be utilised to determine whether the child presents with the level of difficulty and complexity that would require referral to a children's disability service.  Children who do not require a disability service would generally be deemed not to meet the criteria for eligibility for an AON.</p><p>It is important to note the implementation of the revised AON procedure and the national access policy are linked to the wider reconfiguration of children's disability services.  This reconfiguration project is advanced and represents a change from an historical model whereby children access services based on criteria such as age and diagnosis.  The new model is designed to facilitate equitable, timely access to services based on need.</p><p> The SOP is intended to ensure a standardised approach across the State in respect of the operational application of the Disability Act.  Additionally, it offers an important opportunity to balance or ensure equity in terms of assessment and support interventions for vulnerable children and young people with disability.  Regarding the current status of the SOP, it is important to reiterate that the HSE is engaged with a consultation process through F&oacute;rsa and hopes to successfully conclude this engagement in the coming weeks, prior to roll-out.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleague, I will endeavour to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

We went to school at the same time.  I extend a special welcome to her and Dr. Morgan.  I apologise as I must leave shortly as there is a group from west Cork that needs to be shown around etc.  I will read the answers to colleagues' questions as well.</p> <p>  The current system of assessment of needs is not working.  Everybody's heart is in the right place but there is clearly something wrong when more than 4,000 children are waiting for assessment, with three quarters of them waiting longer than three months.  People from Cork and Kerry seem to wait longer for the AON and then for therapies indicated by the assessment.  The population is high in Cork but even taking that into account, there seems to be a big problem there.</p> <p>  Why was there no consultation with the professional bodies who will be involved with the SOP before any plan was made?  Why did the service not consult parents?  The witnesses did not have an opportunity to listen to our previous session.  Maybe it is a lesson for us but in hindsight we could have had all the groups in together to facilitate interaction between us all.  It is too late for today but it could be an idea for the future.</p> <p>  This seems to be an administrative solution to a waiting list problem.  I cannot see how this will in any way help the AON problem.  Dr. Morgan indicates this is proposed to be a standardised system.  If that is the case, surely the reconfiguration should be done throughout all the CHOs rather than two from nine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#U00400"><p>Dr. Morgan referred to consultation and we have heard from others who refer to a complete lack of consultation.  We had three groups before us earlier but we also had correspondence from a group representing speech and language therapists.  It advised that the group was made aware that there would be some class of consultation process but it was at such short notice, its participation was impossible.  Psychologists reported the same and the group representing occupational therapists appears to have been sidelined altogether.  The groups told us that, in other areas, what the HSE proposes to do in 90 minutes takes 47 hours.  The SOP indicates no family should leave the clinic without strategies to support the child or young person but the provision of these strategies in any meaningful way takes time.  Time is precisely what the HSE appears to be taking away.</p><p>We may not be talking to the people directly responsible for policy, which is fair enough, but parents have described the process as a &quot;battle&quot; or &quot;struggle&quot;.  It is like they are going to war for services for their children.  Like all Deputies, there are parents in my constituency who sell items to get the money to purchase services from the private sector.  These people are going to loan sharks or going without.  One parent who was appeared before the committee outlined how they sell their belongings on <i>www.donedeal.ie</i>to be able to purchase services from the private sector.  That is a flashing blue light indicating a problem, and the SOP will not deal with that.  If anything, it may exacerbate the problem.</p><p>I am worried that one of the professional representative bodies advised us that the SOP is in breach of its ethics, standards and guidelines and CORU's ethics and guidelines.  I appreciate that the HSE is having a dialogue with F&oacute;rsa, which is fine for directly employed people, and that should continue.  Is the procedure is in line with these guidelines?  I am worried that a group is saying that it is not, as we could be putting much effort and energy into something that is not fit for purpose.  We could debate all day as to whether it will work but it will certainly not if from the start it is in breach of the code of ethics or at variance with CORU's guidelines.</p><p>Reference was made to a &quot;golden window&quot;, a time at which intervention can bring a meaningful difference to the life of a child.  This is affected by a longer assessment process.  Some parents are waiting up to four years to access services.  The golden window is being looked at in the rearview mirror after a couple of months and every day that goes by, the child is further away from being able to realise his or her full potential.  In what way will the SOP contribute positively to attaining that golden window?  I do not believe it will but perhaps the witnesses can tell us how it will and we would love to hear it.</p><p>Some groups said the new SOP has been deferred and it is not in place.  Dr. Morgan said the HSE is in consultation with F&oacute;rsa, suggesting that it definitely is not in place.  As a former trade union official, I know the union would not allow that and SOP would be locked down before it could be started.  It would be counter-productive to be in negotiations while also using the procedure.  Why are parents getting phone calls to go through this process?  It seems it is being used in some CHOs but not others.  Where are those areas, why is it being used and how does this not conflict with the ongoing negotiations with F&oacute;rsa?</p></speech>

Will they lay out the proposed new process and address the issue of the time it is taking?  I have no doubt that they are trying to do the best for children with special needs but, during the previous session, we heard from the professional bodies and parents that they were not consulted and that the standard operating procedure of the 90-minute assessment is not just a little inadequate, it is woefully inadequate.  Some assessments occur over a 40-hour period.  Will the witnesses explain what is the proposed new process?  Is the 90-minute assessment an additional triage that leads to a more detailed assessment?  How does the new process differ from the current process?  Will the children receive more than 90-minute assessments?  It seems to be the view of the professional bodies that a much more extensive and multidisciplinary assessment is required.</p> <p>  My second question is on the timing.  Dr. Morgan laid out the requirement under the Disability Act 2005 that a child must have an assessment within six months of an application being made.  We heard this morning that typically the time from a GP working with a parent to refer for assessment to the assessment taking place can be two and a half years.  My understanding of what Dr. Morgan stated is that there is a statutory requirement for it to be no more than six months.  Will Dr. Morgan indicate whether it is also his understanding that the period, which should be six months, is in many cases taking two and a half years or are we talking about two different periods?  Why is it taking so long?  What we heard this morning is that it can take two and a half years for a child to move from application to assessment and then a further year to move from assessment to intervention.  Therefore, in a situation where parents bring their two and a half year old to a GP and say they think there might be an issue and they would like to have their child looked at, that two and a half year old will be six years of age before he or she gets an intervention.  We universally agree that early intervention is critical.  Does Dr. Morgan agree that is the current situation?  Is it the case that a two and a half year old could be six years of age before he or she gets intervention?  If it is Dr. Morgan's understanding, will he outline why that is?  Is it that there is not sufficient funding for disability services?  Is it that there is sufficient funding but it has not been possible to hire sufficient numbers of professional staff?  Is it that the current process is incredibly inefficient and whilst there may be sufficient funding and staff, the process is so inefficient it means that the resources are not being deployed properly?  Is it a combination of all three?  Is it other things as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#V00300"><p>I thank Dr. Morgan for his opening statement.  I want to address the inconsistencies across the country.  Being from the western region, I am interested in what is, or is not, happening there, particularly in terms of front-line staff.  I welcome the standard operating procedure.  It is very necessary.  It is alarming to hear that parents were not involved in it.  It is indicative of how the process works in terms of parents not being allowed to be involved.  I commend all the parents who, despite everything they have to deal with, have come forward and are very strong advocates for the services.  Other parents benefit from that.  Parents must be listened to but that is not happening.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the figures relating to the assessments.  In 2017, there were 5,814 applications for assessment and 3,660 were completed.  This means that over 2,000 assessments were not completed?  What happened or is happening in respect of those children?  Why are the models of best practice not replicated throughout the country?  Is it purely a question of resources?  What is the interaction between the autism services and the mental health services?  Many children and young adults, because they have not received early interventions, reach a crisis point where they may have psychotic episodes.  My experience is their being told by the HSE to go home, hide the knives and sharp objects and make sure the doors are locked at night and that it will let the Garda know if officers should respond to a call to attend at the person's house.  Surely to God, the HSE has more of a responsibility than to leave these parents and families in such a vulnerable state.  It is wrong for a young child, as a result of a condition that dictates his or her behaviour, to end up in a Garda cell and over-medicated.  It is intentionally criminalising young people with the condition of autism.  This is wrong and it has to be stopped.  I am not assured that the things being put in place now will address it.  There are young people and children falling between the disability services and the mental health services and nobody is taking responsibility.  It should not end up with garda&iacute; who do not have the necessary expertise.</p> <p>  How many people with expertise in dealing with autism are employed by the HSE?  Speech and language therapists who do not have expertise in autism are trying to cope with impossible caseloads in order to deal with the condition of autism when they are not equipped to do that.  Those are some of the issues I would like the witnesses to address.</p></speech>

That is absolutely the case.  If I thought it would , that would be great but it is not the case.</p> <p>  There are four key points in order to contextualise.  It is the case that, as a result of population growth, we will see a lot more children coming, necessarily, forward for services.  The factors that affect disability have changed quite dramatically.  Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned autism.  It is a very substantial factor that needs to be considered in the context of the delays we have in making assessments and offering diagnoses and interventions.  One will see that pattern very clearly when one looks at it by CHO area.  Very high numbers of people are waiting primarily because certain assessments and interventions need to take place.  That is one factor.   The second factor that is critically important to emphasise is the issue of access.  What I mean by access is it is absolutely the case there are not sufficient therapy grades in the system.  There is no doubt about it.  A recent National Disability Authority report indicates that we will need at least another 400 therapy grades in the next three years or so in order to be able to respond adequately to presenting need.  It is important to make that point at the outset.  We could add in all these therapy grades, which we need, but if we do not deal with structural and practice issues, we could still end up with inequity in the system.  From a structural point of view, what we have been trying to implement in each of the nine CHO areas, as a partnership between the HSE services and our colleagues in section 38 and section 39 organisations, which are the very familiar disability organisations that most people know about, are what are called progressing disability services.</p><p>Many of our therapy resources are delivered through the section 38 and section 39 organisations.  What we are trying to do structurally is to have in place  a network team that is made up of people from the various disciplines that are required to deal with very complex disability cases.  The team would be overseen by a manager.  Currently, services in each CHO area tend to operate in silos.  We are trying to move away from that, which the sector has accepted, and to have much more of a network team approach whereby a lead clinician or manager would pool the resources to ensure that there is good assessment, good follow-up and intervention happening.  In other words, that the resources would be used much more efficiently.  This is because, at present, there is huge inequity in the system.</p><p> In addition, we have been trying to implement a national access policy.  Some children, because of their complex set of circumstances, will require the involvement of a number of different disciples simultaneously.  Some people may need to access only one intervention.  For example, a person may need to see a speech and language therapist or a psychologist.  The national access policy is a guide to steering people toward the right service, for example, advising a person that it is best for him or her to go to his or her primary care service.  When there is a complexity of need, the person should be with a network team and then he or she would become part of the caseload of that multidisciplinary team.</p><p> The fourth element is that we believe there is a need to examine the way in which professionals work within the system, in other words, practice concerns.  That leads me to the point we have been making regarding the standard operating procedure.  We are not trying to dumb down or limit clinicians in terms of their autonomous working, rather we are trying to put a framework in place within which we can meet our statutory needs but also strike a balance between diagnostics and assessment versus intervention.  I will ask Ms O'Neill to go into this in some depth to address Deputy Donnelly's question when he asked that we talk him through what the new standard operating procedure involves and the steps to be taken.  Nowhere in the standard operating procedure are we saying that a full assessment should not be done.  There is an opportunity to do a preliminary team assessment at an early stage.  When children and families come forward, they are likely to engage mostly with an assessment officer who is not necessarily a clinician.  An assessment officer has to rely on a multitude of disciplines to advise him or her on the best approach to take in an assessment of need under the Act versus full assessments that need to be taken on board in regard to doing intervention work.  We are trying to see if we can get a balance between assessment and intervention.  That is what we are trying to do with this standing operating procedure.  I will ask Ms Angela O'Neill to describe the current system and what we are trying to move towards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Angela O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#W00200"><p>To address Deputy Donnelly's query, the current position is that stage 1 of the assessment of need process allows for three months to do a desktop assessment of the referral.  The application is submitted by the family and the assessment officer gathers additional information through a standard additional information form, under the new standard operational procedure, which is tailored to tie up with the national access policy and tailored according to the child's age.  The pre-existing one is general for all age groups.  The family complete that form, any available reports are submitted and the assessment officer determines whether the child needs further assessment.  In most parts of the country, that stage 1 desktop assessment is being done within the three-month timeframe.  In some of the Dublin areas and in one area in the south east, that desktop assessment is delayed.  Once it is done, stage 2 of the process kicks in.  There is a further three-month period allowed for stage 2, which is the clinical assessment.  The date on which the assessment officer refers a child to an assessment service - be it an ASD service, a speech and language therapist, a hearing test or some another service - stage 2 of the process starts.  There is a further three months allowed to complete that stage, which includes completing a clinical assessment and an assessment of need report.  Shortly before the end of three-month period, the clinician will send a report back to assessment officer and he or she will complete an assessment of need summary report, the final report.  That is then sent to a liaison officer.  Therefore, the report is completed and it goes to a liaison officer who has a further month to engage with the services to prepare the child's service statement.</p> <p>  In developing a child's assessment of need report, I, as a clinician, would state that the child presents with X and he needs Y.  When I declare the services he needs in the assessment report, that should have no regard to resources.  I would list any of the services he needs regardless of whether we can provide them.  In the service statement, I would have to say that he needs X and he will get it by such and such a date and that he also needs Y but, unfortunately, we cannot deliver that.  The service statement sets out what we will provide and when we will provide it.  There is a month allowed for completing that process.  When that service statement is completed both the service statement and the assessment of need report are sent simultaneously to the parents.</p></speech>

In Wicklow, which comes under another CHO area, the time involved is not seven months or anything close to it.  I have had to intervene on numerous occasions to find psychologists for young children with suicidal ideation.  Even to a non-clinical person, these children were clearly in need of help.  If Ms O'Neill agrees that the period involved in the southern area is not seven month but three and a half years, will she indicate what is the time involved is the nine CHOs throughout the country?

When one drills into that figure, the high numbers are specific to North Lee and South Lee in Cork.  Kerry is more or less doing well.  The figure is geographically specific.  It is the major urban centres.  The factors relate to the concerns I spoke about earlier.  They need more therapy staff, but they also need to have a more structured way of working the progression disability services to get the teams in place.  We can compare it to the mid-west and Limerick where this is working efficiently.  Those areas have reconfigured and their numbers are quite different.  There will be variances between the two systems and they will not be like for like, but CHO 4 stands out by a mile in comparison to the rest of the State.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about this.  Separate to that is the need for a restructuring of how services are delivered so that there is more co-ordination between the various services that deliver therapy services.  Some funded services do not play a role in the assessment process and they stand outside of that.  Therapy services specific to the organisation that deliver those types of services.  This is why we want to progress disability services into new network teams that are managed by a single person who has complete responsibility.</p></speech>

We recently got agreement to put the management posts in place.  We have entered into a mediation process with the various lead agencies such as the large not-for-profit organisations that deliver many of these services.  These organisations will have to take a lead agency approach and will have to become totally responsible for their therapy services in that area in Cork.  We will achieve this now we have gotten through the mediation process.  It is important that there will be a streamlined process around the operational procedure so there is some guidance for clinicians as to how they will interact with the assessment officer and the various therapists who are working on the ground.  I am confident we can get through this, but it will take time.</p></speech>

Midway through last year our emphasis was on the reasons the service was not meeting its timelines.  The detail I have given heretofore explains this.  We put all of our energies into consultations with clinicians and staff on the ground through a consultation workshop.  I am happy to accept that the professional bodies have remaining concerns, and if we were not sufficiently robust in our consultation process I am happy to take responsibility for that.  The net point, however, will result in the standardised approach across the nine CHOs, which will require co-operation among clinicians on the ground working with assessment officers.  This in itself will not be enough and I accept that there is a need for more therapy grades to be recruited.  At the outset I made the point that even if we were given sanction for 400 new therapy posts covering speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists and physiotherapists, it would take a number of years to recruit them.  In the meantime, if those therapists walk into a system that has no structure to it, we will still end up with system with inequities in it, and there will be too much variance in practice.  I must stress that this is not an attempt by us to constrain clinicians.  The Chairman and I both come from a clinical background and we know it is a challenging process, including for the HSE.  The F&oacute;rsa process is good.  I accept that we probably should have gone into it much earlier but we made it known that we needed to move down this road.  The current process we are in with F&oacute;rsa includes the main therapy grades and we are doing a line-by-line review.  The specific issue of the 90-minute timeframe compared to a longer timeframe is open for discussion.</p></speech>

These times usually refer to an diagnostic ASD assessment, which can take that long.  As a disability team we have had concerns about current times.  When a child goes onto a waiting list for a diagnostic ASD assessment under the assessment of need, in areas such as Cork the children can wait for three years for this assessment.  While on the waiting list a two and half year old child, such as the child Deputy Donnelly mentioned, is getting no services.  I have reviewed files and when they have the 40-hour assessment, some of the children are deemed to not have ASD.  The child, however, is 5 or 6 years old by this time and does not have ASD.  He or she could have been accessing community speech and language therapy or community occupational therapy in the meantime but he was on the wrong waiting list for that time.</p> <p>  With the new SOP we are trying to ensure that when children are applying for an AON under the Disability Act we have the right children coming through the Disability Act gate.  We would look at the access policy and the eligibility in that way and within the statutory timeframe.  If we are to offer a PTA, it is only a viable option if we are to do so within a reasonable timeframe.  It is not reasonable to offer a PTA after one, two or three years.  If such an assessment can be offered within that timeframe and if it is determined that the child has needs, then mum and dad can be offered strategies to help the child in the meantime.  The child may need a diagnostic ASD or a cognitive assessment, or speech and language therapy intervention, and is then placed on the waiting list for that assessment.  At that point we at least know the child is on the right waiting list and that we have given the family some strategies to work with in the meantime.  We do not say the child does not take the diagnostic ASD, which may take the 40 hours - even though we also need to do some separate work in fine-tuning the ASD assessment to make it more streamlined.  We do not say that the child cannot have that full assessment, but somebody needs to be seeing the child much faster and putting him or her on the right path.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman to address my question on whether this measure is in use in some areas, and if it is under negotiation.

I would hate this preassessment to become the statutory obligation because the Disability Act envisages the full assessment happening within six months.  Can Ms O'Neill confirm the preassessment will not count as an assessment under the Act?</p> <p>  Will the HSE give an undertaking to meet the professional bodies on the 90-minute issue?  Perhaps they agree with a preassessment and a duration of 90 minutes or three hours.  It would be useful to meet them to determine what the time should be.  A small number of therapy groups are involved - physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and psychologists.  They are deeply uneasy, from a clinical perspective, about what can be achieved in 90 minutes.  It is not reasonable to expect someone to wait on the wrong list for two years and not get the treatment they need.</p> <p>  Ms O'Neill was going to give us the statistics for the nine CHOs.  Can we have them?</p></speech>

I have met them, apart from the members of the Psychological Society of Ireland who were not free on the day.  One of the commitments I gave was to ensure we had ongoing dialogue regarding professional capacity building for therapy grades in the system, and to continually engage on that basis.  I am happy to reconstitute the group again.  Under the auspices of F&oacute;rsa, we have strong clinicians sitting around the table who link back to their professional bodies.  I am sure we can address the issue of the time range so that clinicians do not feel they are compromised.  We have also engaged with CORU and continue to do so, as we have to satisfy that body.  We committed to getting back to its members following the consultation process to ask them if it was in contravention of the code of ethics or of particular regulations.  We will not implement a SOP that would put a clinician in jeopardy.  The HSE, as employer, has to take responsibility for this from the point of view of professional indemnity.</p></speech>

The Disability Act is an administrative process and is not at all child and family friendly.  Our preference is for children and families to access timely and comprehensive assessments without going through the process, if at all possible.  It is huge for a family to be asked to apply for an assessment under the Disability Act when they are just getting to grips with the fact that their two and a half year old is not communicating well.  Our preference is for children and families to access timely and comprehensive assessments through the children's disability network teams.  If they never had to use the Disability Act, that would be brilliant.  We feel we can meet the statutory obligations to determine whether a child has a disability, what its nature and extent are and what the health needs are arising from the disability based on a preliminary team assessment.<br/><br/>We should not focus on the 90-minute issue because, following engagement with F&oacute;rsa and professional bodies, there will be a much wider time range.  The Disability Act <i>per se</i>does not require us to provide the diagnostic assessments.  The three-month timeframe for an assessment can be clinically inappropriate in the context of autism and it might be better for a child to attend a disability network service and have a diagnostic intervention which arrives at an ASD diagnosis over a much longer period.  The Act can tie us up in knots that are not child and family friendly.</p></speech>

I asked the groups that presented earlier about the availability of people with the required qualifications and they stated adequate numbers were available to fill any vacancies or shortfall.  My understanding from the HSE presentation is that the officials feel that is not the case.  Can they clarify the position regarding the availability of the professionals we need on the front line?</p></speech>

If we extrapolate the early intervention posts, which are the clinical grades working in children's disability services, we get a figure of just under 1,200.  The National Disability Authority has done a lot of good work to estimate need for services and we will need an additional 400 therapy posts in the next three years or so.  These will be across the range of disciplines such as psychology and occupational therapists, etc.  Given the emphasis that has been placed on ASD, there is no doubt that we need to look much more clearly at behavioural support management.  Parents talk to our clinicians every day of the week and tell us that, while assessment and diagnosis are important, they want help and support.  The literature confirms that behavioural management supports are critical in the context of ASD.  As Ms O'Neill said, while assessment is important, we need to intervene much earlier.</p> <p>  As to whether sufficient grades are coming through, we have panels but many people could be sitting on panels who are working for other services on temporary contracts and there could be a displacement effect.  We need to carefully examine the degree to which those panels could result in a net throughput.  We also have to link into training colleges to determine how many are coming through to meet our demand.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly asked us to go through the statistics and I can follow up on this in writing.  We have broken the figures down by county.  CHO 1 is the area covering Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</p><p>There were 203 overdue assessments at the end of April.</p></speech>

A parent may approach a psychologist, a psychiatrist or other professional for a private ASD assessment and receive a uni-disciplinary report stating the child presents with ASD.  Many of the services that deliver ASD diagnostic and intervention services require a multidisciplinary assessment and will not accept a uni-disciplinary report.  There is no denying that such multidisciplinary assessment is of significant benefit.  What creates a difficulty is that a uni-disciplinary assessment has in the past allowed families to access educational services such as an SNA or an ASD class or similar.  However, HSE or HSE-funded ASD services require a multidisciplinary report and need to start that assessment.  That is not the blanket situation across the country.  In some parts of the country, uni-disciplinary reports are accepted and the child will be put on an intervention waiting list, although that may change.</p></speech>

In areas where services have not yet reconfigured, it is almost impossible to navigate the system and it is difficult for families, GPs and teachers to know what to do because one service caters for people over six with intellectual disability, another for preschoolers with intellectual disability and another provides services for physical disability but if the child has both, nobody knows where he or she should go.

We heard testimony from a parent on behalf of the patient this morning.  There is a huge gap, two to three years, between the assessment and the service being delivered.  That is where the system is breaking down.  In general practice, I would have no idea whatsoever how to navigate the system.  I receive reports from therapists but, apart from that, I have no influence on how a child accesses a service.  None of my colleagues in the mid-west would know how to do it.  There is no pathway.  We would not be aware of any pathway and we do not have the possibility of referring people to the appropriate pathway.</p></speech>

There is a 90-minute assessment versus the 47-hour recommended under the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines.  I understand that could be classed as a pre-assessment.  A witness who appeared before us earlier - I refer to Ms Gilhool, a parent - spoke of attending a parenting course before her child was assessed.  These seem to be delaying tactics to fill in time while the child is being assessed.  The issue for me and for many members is that if this critical window in a child's development is missed, it can never be got back.  Have the witnesses made any financial or economic assessments of the implication of not intervening until a child is five, instead of when they are two years of age, the cost of filling that gap?  Are there any figures on the economic and emotional cost of that to a family?</p> <p>  For the Chairman to say that the pathway in parts of the country is unclear is very challenging for people.  Like him, I have worked in primary care and I too would not have any idea how to refer or help somebody.  It must be absolutely heartbreaking for a parent to see their child regress after eventually getting through this pre-assessment, been on the waiting list and the parents going on the course, when they know there is something wrong with the child which requires an intervention that costs money and are not able to have it for two to three years.  Do the witnesses think it acceptable for children in this country to be victimised or treated in such a way?  I do not think we would leave an adult two or three years after being assessed.  We would get away with that.  Will the witnesses comment on the financial and other costs of delays for families, whether the 90-minute pre-assessment is being done anywhere else or is it an Irish solution to kick the can down the road, and the same for  the parenting courses?  Sending a parent on a course when there is no diagnosis or assessment of a child is just another way of filling in time.</p></speech>

We made very clear that there has been very little to no investment in children's services over recent years.  The National Disability Authority has told us there is evidence to suggest we will need upwards of 400 therapy grade posts in the children's disability services.  There is no doubt that investment is absolutely required.  Investment with structures and pathways identified for everyone, most particularly for parents, needs to happen.  This can be done by the reconfiguration of our existing disability services under what is called progressing disability services so that each community health organisation has a range of approximately 96 networks made up of individual teams with all those disciplines working on those teams, dealing with and providing services to children who have complex disability needs.  We feel we have come a fair distance, have had some positive results recently and have agreement with our colleagues in the section 38 and 39 services because many of the therapy services are delivered through that channel.  In order to manage that we have agreement on putting a management post in place to make sure there is better and more effective utilisation of those posts.  At present, therapists work for the organisations that employ them in that capacity.  That is not to say they want to do that.  Everyone has agreed that we need better co-ordination between services.  In other words, better management of services.</p> <p>  Resources for access are required in children's disability services.  Everyone says the same thing.  When that is done, the pathway will be very clear to parents, clinicians and practitioners and we will be confident in saying that.  There are concerns about the time range for doing an assessment.  This is formally part of a consultation with F&oacute;rsa.  I agreed with Deputy Donnelly that I will meet the representative bodies again to have a session with them on their concerns about this.  That commitment has been made.</p> <p>  Sometimes to do a full diagnosis of certain disorders, for example, ASD, requires quite a long time.  It needs to be done carefully because the last thing one wants is to apply a tag or diagnosis that does not fit because that person becomes tagged with that for ever.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.317" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Angela O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018062700002#AA00600"><p>The 90-minute engagement is subject to the F&oacute;rsa engagement and my instinct is that the outcome of that will be that we will have a wide range of times.  We will not be taking the 47 hours referred to because we will not be able to meet our statutory obligations if all our assessments take that length of time.  It is key that even if an ASD assessment takes 47 hours those hours are often more appropriately spread over a much longer period than the three-month period for which the Disability Act 2005 allows.  For some children, a period of diagnostic intervention before finalising a diagnosis of ASD would be more appropriate but the Disability Act 2005 requires us to provide an assessment of a child within a particular timeframe.  In order to meet the requirements of the Disability Act 2005, therefore, we need to separate that from the needs of a child and family to have a diagnosis and appropriate intervention services.  The Deputy is absolutely correct it is not acceptable that children should wait two or three years.  In some areas resources are being used almost exclusively for assessment and children get their diagnosis and no intervention.</p><p>We are trying to balance the need to do a comprehensive assessment with the need to provide intervention for children.  We need to fine-tune our assessments a little better so that not all of the resources are spent doing the assessments.  When a family is told that a certain diagnosis has been agreed on, it should not be told to go off because nothing can be provided for it.</p></speech>

This would help us to understand how the process works and what the target would be if we were in an ideal situation.  Today's meeting has raised a huge number of issues, many of which are unresolved.  We may have to return to this huge topic again.  We are facing time constraints today, unfortunately.

It is great to be here.  It is great to get out of Beaumont Hospital and be back in business.  I welcome this opportunity to update members of the committee on the important work being undertaken in the Department of Justice and Equality to support the recent ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Specifically, I will update the committee on progress regarding the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity)Act 2015 and the implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.</p> <p>  The week before last, I was delighted to attend the UN conference of the states parties to the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and to speak of Ireland&rsquo;s progress in ratifying and implementing the convention.  The ratification of the convention has been a deeply held commitment of mine since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues a little more than two years ago.  Indeed, as an Independent Alliance Minister of State I insisted on it being highlighted among the highest priorities when negotiating the programme for Government.  In other words, I was directly involved in inserting it in the programme for Government.  It was a key issue for me in supporting the Government.</p> <p>  The convention came into force for Ireland on 19 April 2018.  This marked a key moment not only for people living with a disability but also for their families, friends and support networks and for Irish society generally.  Ireland&rsquo;s ratification means that all European Union member states have now ratified the CRPD, making the EU the first region to ratify the convention.  Ratification was the first action listed in Ireland&rsquo;s national disability inclusion strategy.  The strategy takes a whole-of-Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities and contains 114 measurable and time-specific actions under eight themes that relate to the areas of education, employment, provision of public services, health, transport, personal safety and autonomy.  The strategy and the robust monitoring framework supported by the National Disability Authority, NDA, leaves us well placed to respond to the requirements of the convention.  I commend and thank the NDA on its magnificent and supportive work on the disability issue.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in placing a strong focus on ability rather than disability.  Key actions in our national strategy include the implementation of a comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, including an increase of the public service employment target from 3% to 6%, the arrangement of special public service recruitment competitions and the opening up of alternative recruitment channels.  Ireland has strong equality legislation which prevents discrimination on the basis of disability.  However, people with disabilities are still only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  I take that very seriously.  This is why the comprehensive employment strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring people who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  The strategy includes commitments such as special public service competitions and the opening up of alternative recruitment channels as well as the provision of a NDA-assisted employer helpline to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers.  There is a great deal of work taking place under the radar in the broader society with regard to employment, with small companies and businesses taking on people with disabilities.  In addition, some Departments are doing a magnificent job.  I accept that we still have a long way to go but a quiet revolution is taking place regarding the employment of people with disabilities.  These are concrete examples of how Ireland will fulfil its obligations under the CRPD. </p> <p>  In line with the convention&rsquo;s guiding principles of respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy - including the freedom to make one&rsquo;s own choices, and independence of persons, the disability inclusion strategy contained a commitment to establish a task force on personalised budgets to make recommendations on potential models of personalised budgets to give people with disabilities more control in accessing health funded personal social services.  When establishing the task force in September 2016, I was eager for it to proceed along the lines of my thinking and beliefs regarding people with a disability - that we must allow them to say how they wish to lead their own lives.</p><p>I am pleased this vision was demonstrated in the recommendations of the report of the task force, which I hope to publish very soon.  I brought a memorandum to the Cabinet on Tuesday morning.  I thank Mr. Christy Lynch and the task force for their magnificent work on the report.  It will be a core element in responding to some of the fundamental principles of the convention.  I refer to our respecting dignity, autonomy, independence and the freedom to make one's own choices.</p><p> The convention rebalances the right of people with disabilities to make decisions for themselves, rather than having decisions made for them.  With ratification now in place for Ireland, I can now focus on using the convention to better equip and resource people with disabilities to improve their quality of life.  The ratification of the UN convention is an important support for me as a Minister of State.</p><p> Ratifying the convention signals a commitment to ongoing improvement in the provision of disability services.  In keeping with this principle, I recognise totally that there is always more to be done, including ratification of the optional protocol.  I will respond to this in more detail later.</p><p> There has been some commentary on ratification of the optional protocol, which is not being ratified at this time but will be ratified as soon as possible following the completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle.  This will provide an opportunity to identify areas for improvement and any actions needed for a high level of compliance.  While I accept there was a commitment given, in the 2015 roadmap, to ratify the optional protocol at the same time as the convention, my current focus has been on ratifying the convention in the first instance.  That was the first step.  </p><p> As I have outlined, the convention and the optional protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which require substantive cultural change.  Indeed, an analysis of the some 14 complaints brought under the optional protocol since 2010, indicates a range of areas on which we are actively working hard to address, such as deprivation of liberty and the right of deaf persons to participate in jury duty.  </p><p> Work is continuing on the final reforms needed for Ireland's compliance with the convention's requirements.  Just because one does not see this in the newspapers every single day does not mean the work is not being done.  A phased approach is seen as the most practical and realistic way of moving ahead.  Furthermore, while we have already made significant progress in terms of legislative change, including to the law on decision-making capacity, there still remains some legislation to be enacted.</p><p> The disability Bill was published in 2016 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This is something Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has raised with me regularly.  The Government has given approval for the Bill to receive priority within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and work is under way to progress the Bill for enactment by the end of the year.  I hope it will be sooner.  When I say that, I mean it.</p><p> The Bill addresses a range of issues to facilitate the highest possible level of compliance with the convention such as an amendment of the Juries Act 1976 and the Electoral Act 1992 to facilitate greater participation of persons with disabilities in jury service and political life; improving the standard of reasonable accommodation to be provided by commercial bodies whose activities are regulated for quality of service; bringing civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back within the terms of Part 5 of the Disability Act to promote and support the recruitment and employment of persons with disabilities.  This will allow the public sector employment quota to apply to civilian staff, which is an important part of any employment strategy.  </p><p> There is a range of mostly technical amendments that are to be brought forward on Committee Stage.  It was originally intended to introduce deprivation of liberty provisions as amendments at this stage.  However, due to the complexity and far-reaching implications of the proposals and in response to feedback from many in the disability sector, the Government decided it was better to deal with the issues separately.  The deprivation-of-liberty provisions will now feature in a standalone Bill to be sponsored by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and me.  </p><p> The central problem to be addressed by the new provisions is that existing legislation does not provide a procedure for admitting persons without capacity to relevant facilities in which they will be under continuous supervision and control and will not be free to leave.  </p><p> Existing legislation does not provide procedural safeguards to ensure individuals are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The draft legislative proposals that I published for public consultation last December are designed to address this gap by providing safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and some categories of people with mental illness to ensure they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in certain residential facilities.  The consultation was an important part of the debate.  We wanted to ensure everyone was consulted, including those with disabilities, senior citizens and those in the mental health sector.</p><p> The development of these deprivation-of-liberty legislative provisions is a highly complex undertaking.  In addition to satisfying the requirements of the CRPD, the provisions must also align with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and existing legislation, such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the Mental Health Act.  I am continuing to progress this legislation as a matter of priority.  The target date for finalisation of the heads is the autumn.  </p><p> The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act needs to be fully commenced.  Three million euro in funding has been allocated in 2018 for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.  </p><p> A question that people often ask me about the convention is on resources, and rightly so.  I fully agree that to support people effectively in accessing their rights, the proper allocation of resources is a key consideration.  That is an important part of my strategy on providing services for people with disabilities.</p><p> We, as politicians, need to be mindful of any changes in policy and resourcing that can significantly impact on everyday circumstances.  I am very much aware of this, and many members of this committee are very supportive in this regard.  When the matter arises in the D&aacute;il, as it does regularly, the committee members are very supportive of the concept of implementation.  It is all very well to be talking about rights but they have to be backed up by resources.  In fairness to the committee, every member has an amazing track record on disability services.</p><p> I have always placed strong emphasis on securing adequate funding, with &euro;1.76 billion allocated by the Department of Health for disability services in 2018, representing an increase of 4.4% on 2017.  Furthermore, in December of 2017, I announced the securing of an additional &euro;10 million funding for respite care.  This was based on listening to families on the ground and colleagues such as the members present regarding the crisis in respite care.  That funding is now being pumped into 12 additional respite houses all around the country to support the families.</p><p> It is not just about funding, however.  That is the important thing I have learned in the past two years.  We need to challenge attitudes and mindsets and recognise the valuable contribution that persons with disabilities have made and will continue to make to our economy and society when supported to do so.  We have to change the mindset in broader society and right across all sectors of society because we still have a long way to go.  We need to focus on ability rather than disability and we need our society to encourage and empower people with a disability to define themselves, and in turn to be defined, not on the basis of what they cannot do but on the many things they can do.  Last Friday week, along with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, we announcement &euro;16 million for the Ability programme, which is totally ignored by all sectors of society, including our national media.  Some 2,600 young people between 16 and 29 years saw their organisations and groups, which focus on education, training and employment, receive substantial funding for their programmes based on an independent assessment of the work they do.  Many of the organisations and groups, such as the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, have been crying out for funding.  It was given.  It has a positive effect on young people, many of them with ability.  One should note the programme is called the Ability programme.</p><p>We need society to encourage and empower people with disability to define themselves.  This country has embarked on an era of unprecedented change in services for people with disabilities in recent years, which means we are now ready to meet our obligations.</p></speech>

The convention covers a broad range of commitments which require substantive cultural change.  Fundamental to that are the concepts of freedom, autonomy, independence and recognising the right of people with disabilities to make decisions for themselves.  In this regard, I have received a report on personalised budgets, on which I brought a memo to Cabinet last Tuesday.</p> <p>  The Government's approach to meeting the terms of the convention will be one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for the optimal level of compliance with the convention's requirements.  In the early implementation phase it is essential that the resources are focused on the improvement and enhancement of services and not diverted into additional areas such as servicing the optional protocol before we are fully ready.  For this reason, the Government and I see a phased approach as the more practical and realistic way of moving forward.  The optional protocol is not being ratified at this time but it will be ratified as soon as possible, and at the latest following the completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle which will be within two to three years' time.  This will provide us with the opportunity to identify any remaining actions needed for the highest level of compliance with the convention.</p></speech>

This is particularly important in respect of employment and improving access to employment for people with disabilities, which one may also call "abilities".  What can Government do to encourage people in the private sector to recognise the abilities of people with disabilities, and the usefulness they could have as employees?</p></speech>

I have been working under the radar with small businesses up and down the country in this area.  There are fantastic examples of good practice in small business and in the private sector.  I visited a project in Galway a year and a half ago where 101 people with some form of disability were employed by nine or ten small businesses.  It was supported by the wage subsidy scheme, WSS.  Some of the people were highly technically qualified with a physical disability but fantastic on IT matters.</p> <p>  The public sector also has to be involved and we need to get the 3% figure up to 6%, though I am aiming for 10%.  We are doing a lot and there are 5,000 people on the WSS scheme who are working in different areas with some degree of disability.  In the CRC, in my own constituency, I have met young people aged between 18 and 20 who are highly intelligent and articulate but have some form of physical disability and who are crying out for work.  We are focusing on the ability programme to address their needs.</p> <p>  We have to follow examples of good practice, much of which comes from creative small businesses where they have open minds and are inclusive.  One young man aged 28, a supportive and inclusive manager of a shop, spotted an autistic family going into a shopping centre in Drogheda.  He noticed that the mother was under severe pressure and had nowhere to leave her child.  He opened up a sensory room because he recognised that 15% of his market had some form of disability and wanted to provide a place for kids to be left while the parents were shopping.  He did it out of good will but turned it to his advantage and now he is making a fortune, with every special school in the Louth and north Meath area visiting him to use his services.  I have been in the sensory room and it is a fantastic facility.</p> <p>  I mentioned the 5,000 people with disabilities who are working on the WSS scheme but we have a long way to go.  Unemployment among people with disabilities is unacceptably high and we need to encourage people to be more supportive.  We need to change attitudes and broaden the minds of people, particularly employers.</p></speech>

The equality division is working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, to progress the remaining Committee Stage amendments, which will likely result in fewer than ten heads.  The amendments are mostly technical and there is some work to be done to streamline the contents so that only what is absolutely necessary for compliance with the CRPD features in the Bill.  A drafter has been engaged from the OPCand work is ongoing to draft committee Stage amendments.  It is envisaged that the Bill will reach Committee Stage as soon as possible.  I would suggest that this will be following the summer recess.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for all the work he has done in the context of Ireland ratifying the CRPD.  I know it was one of his main targets in the past couple of years and, despite the delay, he went and did it.  He is to be commended on that.  It is now in the implementation phase.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the A Vision for Change document and intellectual disability.  Can the Minister of State outline where Ireland stands in the context of matching the targets relating to intellectual disability that were set in A Vision for Change?  Intellectual disability services do not match the median norms relating to the fields of adult psychiatric or the psychiatry of old age field or those that apply to child and adolescent mental health services.  This is despite the fact that those services are completely under-resourced relative to the demand.  My understanding is that services for people with intellectual disabilities are the worst of in comparison with the targets in A Vision for Change.  I would like an update on that.</p></speech>

I am on the same page as him and many other colleagues regarding the UN Convention.  It is the implementation that matters.  As I have said before, I use the UNCRPD to strengthen my hand when talking to my colleagues in government, and right across every Department, about resources and implementation.  I agree with the Deputy.  As I strongly emphasised, there is no point in talking about it.  We can sign all the conventions in the world, but we have to ensure that our people have access to services and that their rights are being actively implemented.  As far as I am concerned, ratification is stage 1.  Stage 2 is implementation.</p> <p>  We have many problems in matching the targets in A Vision for Change.  I totally accept that argument.  We have to ensure that all people with intellectual disabilities are brought up to their targets.  Regarding my own position on supporting people with disabilities, I saw this when we came into the sector two years ago.  We had a huge problem with 18 year olds with intellectual disabilities coming out of second-level institutions with no places guaranteed for them.  Approximately 1,500 were coming into the system every year with no guarantee of places.  Dealing with that particular issue was the first thing I did, because I saw there that there was a cohort of young people with disabilities being left out of the picture.  We had to go and get an extra &euro;31 million to provide the places.  It is now June 2018 and in recent weeks every young person coming out of a second-level institution at 18 has been informed of his or her place in an adult service in September.  That is a start.  We have achieved that target.</p> <p>  Another issue which I found very important was the restoration of the old respite care grant, which is now called a carer's support grant.  Some 101,000 families had that grant cut.  They were left behind and the restoration of that &euro;1,700 for them was very important.  Another issue we addressed related to young people with disabilities.  We now have 1,000 new special needs assistants in the education system, along with 100 new special education teachers.  We have tried to bridge the gap and attack the targets in A Vision for Change to which Deputy Jack Chambers referred.  We have started but, as far as I am concerned, we have a long way to go.  I will do my best to reach those targets in the next six months.</p></speech>

I meet people from the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Disability Authority, NDA, on a regular basis because I think it is essential to do so.  When I meet these people, I identify priorities for the disability sector.  I usually have four or five issues to raise every time I meet them.  The important thing is that if there is somebody I should meet, I am prepared to meet anybody in that sector.  If there is anybody I omitted, I would be delighted to meet him or her.</p></speech>

No area has matched the outcomes called for in the A Vision for Change strategy but my understanding is that, despite all mental health services being under-resourced, services for people with intellectual disabilities lag far behind the norm or the median target range of all the other areas.  If there is a clinical lead on intellectual disability, which I understand there is, I think it is important that the Minister of State and the Department meet that person.  At the very least, intellectual disability services should match general adult services or old age services.  The teams catering to intellectual disability services in all of the allied health professions lag far behind.  Comparing the data on them versus data on the other teams, I am of the view that there is not enough focus on this area.  We can talk generally about budgets or increased allocations.  However, unless this committee and the Joint Committee on Health hear about what targets the Minister of State is meeting within the strategic focus of the A Vision for Change document, we cannot measure anything that his Department is doing in the area of mental health.  I think it is the health professionals that need to receive the focus and resources.  If services for people with intellectual disabilities are lagging behind, which they are , then they need to be a focus.  I ask that the Department bring greater light to the data relating to intellectual disability services and the health professions therein.  I have not heard much from the Department, today or ever, about how it is matching the focus of A Vision for Change.</p></speech>

Like the Minister of State, on a daily basis I meet people who are battling to access any type of service.</p> <p>  Again, there is a crisis in recruiting enough staff to work in the field of allied health professionals. Will he update the committee on CAMHS and what he is doing to improve the level of intervention that people receive as children and adolescents?  The State has failed people born with mild disabilities because it has not provided them with appropriate interventions thus allowing them to develop moderate to severe long-term outcomes.  I urge the State to provide the appropriate interventions to these people.  What is the Department doing to match greater levels of service for those who have waited a crazy length of time for a basic assessment and for basic intervention, which would make a difference to their lives?  Enhancing someone's ability is about giving him or her the appropriate intervention when differences in a child's development or inability to reach certain milestones or whatever else are noticed.  There is a complete lack of wraparound services in the disability area at primary and secondary school level and that is the pain that parents must face on a daily basis.  </p> <p>  Regarding the disability section and A Vision for Change, what is the Department doing to match the waiting times?

Many of our young graduates in psychology, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy emigrated to the UK and around the world over the past seven to nine years, especially those qualified but some of them are beginning to return, which is positive.  We have an issue with staff shortages, which are leading to waiting lists.</p> <p>  I am pushing the issue of tackling the shortages at Cabinet level.  The Estimates will be discussed over the next couple of weeks and I have support for early intervention services, the recruitment of more staff and supporting those services as one of my top five priorities but I have other priorities.</p> <p>  I have been asked by the Deputy's colleagues to make the issue of a lack of residential places for older people with intellectual disabilities who have elderly parents my number one priority when we discuss the Estimates.  At least 400 residential places are needed in 2019 to deal with the issue.</p> <p>  I have listed the Deputy's concerns about access to assessments and tackling waiting lists as one of my priorities.  I agree with him that we must respond to the matter.</p> <p>  During the debate on the Estimates, I ask the Deputy to request his party to support me when I negotiate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018062700002#F01000"><p>The Minister of State will seek an increase in funding and he is not responsible for cuts that were made to public pay eight or nine years ago.  However, the State has failed so many children.</p> <p>  Last night, I attended a meeting of a school board.  Teachers have told me that the HSE has resisted the assessment of need process because it does not want to triage people and provide services.  Some children who have been assessed have had their cognitive assessments rejected after waiting two years for an intervention and they must now rely on the school system for assistance.  Perhaps the Minister of State cannot update me now but I would like him to provide an answer to the committee on the cognitive assessment area.  I also want him to clarify the HSE policy on these assessments.  One arm of the HSE provided a particular cognitive assessment for a child with some type of intellectual disability but another arm of the HSE rejected the assessment because it did not match another assessment field.  Clearly, silos are operating within the HSE and the only people who lose out are the children because they do not receive the interventions that they require.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has said that he wants to enhance ability.  If so, then there must be early and swift intervention as soon as children are diagnosed thus avoiding people having to go down long culs-de-sac and ending up in a black hole without a service or intervention.  We must shine a light on mental health services whether they relate to intellectual disability, CAMHS areas and education.  Many children will lose out and will not be given the opportunities that the Minister of State has mentioned if we continue like this.  It would make no difference if the Minister of State threw another &euro;100 million at this area and hired 100 psychologists, 100 occupational therapists and 100 speech and language therapists because the clearly dysfunctional system must first be fixed.  There are mismatched cognitive assessments and different services operating in complete silos.  Therefore, the Government will continue to fail children with disabilities.  Parents and schools are at odds and exist in the unknown in terms of this area.  The system works well in some areas of the country yet it is impossible for children to get appropriate interventions in others.  The solution is not just a case of Estimates and throwing money at the problem.  We need to analyse how the system operates because we clearly have a problem.  I have only given one example of cognitive assessments where, for example, one person that the Minister of State employs does something for a five-year old child yet when he or she is seven years of age, having waited two years, another psychologist declares that his or her unit does not use that cognitive assessment.  The child must then return to his or her school, time moves on and the parents and children are worse off as a result.  There have been two appointments yet the child gets no intervention.  That is the reality of the current system.  The solution is more than Estimates.  That is why we need greater focus on this.</p></speech>

I assure him that a debate is taking place.  The latest reports that I have had from the HSE and the Department of Health is that internal discussions are taking place and there should be a cohesive response in the next few weeks.  Some parents and professionals have made me aware of the issues raised by the Deputy.  I will check if anything has happened in the past day or two that I have not been told about and I will forward a more detailed response to the Deputy.  I assure him that we are trying to resolve the issue.  I accept that one cannot have confusion about cognitive assessments or similar issues while children suffer.</p> <p>  On the education issue, the Deputy can criticise us and accuse us of not doing enough.  I take his point on resources but I know how important resources are and that they have a major impact.  Let us compare what happens now with what happened in primary school education 20 years ago.  Recently, 1,000 new special needs assistants, SNAs, were appointed, which helps children with disabilities who attend school.  In addition, 100 new resource teachers have been recruited, which helps children with disabilities to attend primary school.  All of that proves that the situation has improved.  Twenty years ago children with a disability were not provided with supports in primary school except for a little remedial teaching.</p><p>Now we have resource hours and SNAs.  We have come a long way.</p><p> I will come back to the Deputy with a more detailed response on the cognitive assessment issue.</p></speech>

When will this be progressed?  Health professionals are discussing it but there has been a delay in the Department in processing it.

The whole strategy was that ratification of the UN convention was an important step.  The Department of Health organised a consultation process on this issue.

When I started to try to ratify the UN convention two years ago, it was a slow debate.  In the end, we had to keep on pushing the issue forward.  I accept the Deputy's point on frustration.  However, the fact we ratified the UN convention on 19 April will, hopefully, speed up the process.  If it were not ratified, we would be in a weak position.</p> <p>  There are issues in wider society about the rights of senior citizens, those in nursing homes and residential centres and people with disabilities in nursing homes who should not be there in the first place.  The solutions are complex and, at times, it can be slow to agree on them.</p> <p>  There is only way to do it which is to keep the head down and keep pushing.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State, his officials and the NDA for being here to assist us in that regard.</p><p>It is hard to know where start as so many interesting points made been made.  I have a copy of a brief submission made by Inclusion Ireland on issues such as assisted decision-making -I did not like what I heard about that - personal budgets, the working group and a number of other issues, some of which have been dealt with.  I ask the committee to provide the Minister of State with a copy of the submission for consideration.</p><p> I welcome the representatives of Inclusion Ireland who are in the Public Gallery and who also yesterday attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health as part of the Oireachtas disabilities group.  I thank the Chairman for the leadership he provided to that group as its vice-chairman.  This group comprises four organisations: the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, Inclusion Ireland, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies and Not for Profit Association.  It has called for a five-year multi-annual investment in the disabilities sector.  As mentioned by Deputy Jack Chambers, rights should drive what happens in every Department.  This sector cuts across a range of Departments.  The group has called for north of &euro;200 million per annum for the disabilities sector, not to solve all the problems but to ensure a decent kick-start following ratification of the convention earlier this year on 19 April, which the Minister of State said earlier "will help, hopefully".  I do not take a lot of comfort from "will help, hopefully".  I understand that Ireland via the Houses of the Oireachtas has given its solemn commitment to implementation of the convention throughout our system, in education, housing, transport, communications, health, social protection and so on.  </p><p> In fairness to the Minister of State he was strong in his opening remarks about the chronic unemployment rate among people with disabilities, which is damning.  We experienced similar unemployment levels in this sector ten years ago when Ireland was sucking people in from other parts of the world to fill employment gaps.  What new initiatives are planned to ensure the comprehensive employment strategy works?  This strategy is almost three years in existence.  On 2 October this year, three of its ten years will have elapsed.  What initiatives are in place to drive it?  The Minister of State will rightly point to the increase from 3% to 6% in the number of people with disabilities in the public sector.  It we can leverage activation and employment it will be a game changer.  </p><p> I welcome the recent initiative proposed at the joint meeting of the Joint Committees on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health and Education and Skills to look in the round at the interlocking issues between Departments.  We heard testimony during that hearing for approximately one and a half hours from six people with disabilities, all of whom said they were "lucky" to get a start.  Strategies and governance are not about luck; they are about making something happen.  For every person with a disability who was lucky, there are thousands who were not.</p><p> There is an ongoing crisis in respite care.  To put it mildly, doing something about respite provision would be modest and it does not speak to the spirit of the UN convention.  Yesterday, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Senator Conway and I listened to the story of a woman who has been up to her neck caring for a child for the past 35 years and who said: "I want my life back."  We focus on the rights of people with disabilities but there are other people whose rights and basic dignity are being infringed by being locked into caring roles.  There is a great deal at stake in the implementation of the convention.  The Minister of State is well aware of the issues.  I have perhaps worn him out talking about personal assistant supports to enable people to get out and about.  What will be provided for in the budget on respite care will be sold to us as substantive.  However, the circumstances are chronic for the people who are stuck but there has not been a substantive response post-19 April.     </p><p> I welcome the Ability programme.  The CRC has two schools in Dublin and there are many other special schools in the country.  However, there is no career guidance in these schools because they are regarded as primary schools.  These schools should be provided with funding to enable them to provide career guidance and thus marshal people and get them thinking about progression.  This issue could be taken up by the Department of Education and Skills.  Under the Ability programme, these schools are currently addressing issues such as human rights awareness and understanding.  It is an excellent initiative.</p><p> The Minister of State referenced the additional funding being invested in disability services every year.  What annoys me and others is that we are never shown the balance sheet.  We hear constantly that more money is being invested, which nobody denies, but we are never told how the need for funding is changing.  We are never told if need is increasing or decreasing.  We all know it is increasing.  Thankfully, babies are being born that would not have survived ten years ago.  Thirty years ago a child with Down's syndrome lived to only 30 or 35 years of age.  That was the expectation of their parents from day one.  Nowadays, these people are living into their 50s and 60s, although some have other issues.  We are pumping out the flooded house but water is still coming in.  If is important that across government people are as honest as they can be and admit that while additional funding is being provided they are hard pressed to keep up with the accelerating need.</p><p> I thank the Minister of State for mentioning the 1,200 young people who are in nursing homes.  There are also 2,500 people in congregated settings, with up to 170 people still trying to exit these settings every year.  This process was supposed to be concluded this year.  At the same time, there are people who are younger than most people in this room going into nursing homes for 30, 40 and 50 years.  Honesty is vital.</p><p> The Minister of State spoke about awareness in the community and among employers.  My sense is that there is not enough leadership at the top.  He is working night and day, might and mane to ensure there is focus on getting critical Bills enacted and securing additional funding for disability services.</p><p>I am left with a question.  The Government as an entity does not get it.  I refer to cultural change.  The Minister of State spoke of the man in Drogheda who saw something, responded to it and his instinct was right.  We see that around the place.  I do not, however, see that instinct in our Government.  More money must be into the disability sector.</p><p> Between 40 and 50 polling stations were not accessible to people with disabilities during the recent referendum.  That is just one example, which requires an amendment to the Electoral Acts.  I would be happy if we were implementing some of the Acts in place.  It was like pulling teeth to introduce the change to allow blind people to vote.  This was a basic measure but it is only guaranteed for referenda.  It was resisted tooth and nail by a Department for many years before Mr. Robbie Sinnott pulled it out of their heads.  He did it doggedly and was threatened that the State would go after him.  </p><p> The attitude that we cannot do this, because it would cost money remains.  This is not a criticism of the Minister of State but he sits at the Cabinet table.  We will not, in fairness, be dependent only on him to do this work; we will work on it as well.  This will be the third budget of this Administration and it has to demonstrate improvement in a range of areas in people's lives such as transport housing, education, employment, communications, and income supports.  It cannot just be about specialist disability services, although God knows there are problems there.  We will walk past the window of this budget the day after and people with disabilities will have to see that an effort was made in and there was thoughtfulness across a range of Departments.  That is moving away from the tight text of the presentation of the Minister of State but it is connected.  Was 19 April a game changer for the Government and the Oireachtas?  There is challenge for all of us to see that reflected in the budget in early October.  I refer also to assisted decision-making, deprivation of liberty, the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, and so on, being done and dusted by the end of this year.  There is an issue with timelines.  </p><p> Turning to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 published in mid-July 2017, states, "Progress the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill so as to enactment to address outstanding obstacles to ratification". The Department of Justice and Equality timeline was 2017.  In the middle of July, with five and half months to go to the end of 2017, there was a commitment that it would be done by then.  It bothers me that commitments are made close to when they are due.  Time passes and they are still swinging in the wind.  There are issues there.  I thank the Minister of State for the work he does but the Government needs to reinvigorate he significance of 19 April. </p></speech>

I thank the Senator for all his work.  The Oireachtas disability group is a valuable tool and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is the vice-chairman.  It is important we have multiple voices.  On the Senator's initial points I have not seen the Inclusion Ireland document yet but I meet the organisation regularly and work closely with it.  I am on the issue and I will have a look at that to see if there is something in it later, when I get an opportunity.</p> <p>  Turning to the budget issue, I spoke last Monday morning at the DFI conference where I met many of its members.  I will also meet the DFI and the Senator in the next couple of weeks on the issue of the budget and the multi-annual funding.  I support it but the Senator is correct that funding has to be provided by every Department.  We have to ensure everybody in different Departments gets the issue of disability and that it is not just the Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities talking about the &euro;1.7 billion in funding for the social care policy plan in 2018.  It has to involve transport, young people in nursing homes and decongregation etc.  I get that and it is my job to make sure my Cabinet colleagues get it as well.</p> <p>  There has been progress on the mindset and cultural change.  I notice that regularly when I speak at Cabinet level on disability issues.  I try to bring in everybody involved, whether it is the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Health, Education and Skills or Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I accept the criticism regarding balance that we have a hell of a long way to go to change the broader mindset both in government and in society but that is part of my agenda.  The important aspect is to understand that the broader D&aacute;il and society, and committees like this, have played a leading role.  When I was in opposition and when it came to civil rights, human rights and equality issues, I always found the Oireachtas committees pushed out the boat and set the broader agenda.  That is important to me in as Minister of State with special responsibility for disabilities.  I would love &euro;200 million in the budget this year and-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018062700002#J00500"><p>-----I will appreciate any help.  Last year, I went in looking for an extra &euro;100 million and I ended up with &euro;92 million.  Some people would say that is not bad going in negotiations.  That was in respect of the social care plan.  Senator Dolan is correct, however, and Deputy Jack Chambers mentioned this as well.  We can talk about resources but we have to make sure that the resources are delivered to the person with the disability.  That is an issue and I will put up my hands and accept that.</p> <p>  The Senator also talked about employment issues.  The NDA works closely with the HSE to strategically forecast funding needs.  The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, for the first three years - the foundation stage - features collaboration with different employers and the implementation of make work pay actions and Departments are working together to set up a national programme to support employment.  There is a broader view on the issue of work.  </p> <p>   The Senator also touched on personal assistants, and that is something I have learned about from a recent meeting with the DFI.  We can put &euro;10 million into respite care, which is an issue that has to be solved, and we can put &euro;31 million into school leavers but a substantial section of the disability community feels we need to increase personal assistant hours to enable people to live independent lives in line with the UN convention.  I accept that argument and it is on my shopping list for the Estimates debate.</p> <p>  Another issue the Senator touched on was that of value for money.  That is something we have to see from the viewpoint of a person with a disability.  Parents regularly come to me saying they have heard that the funding for their daughter in an adult service is between &euro;80,000 and &euro;150,000 a year and they do not feel they are getting value for money.  That has to be listened to, that is my job and that is one of the reasons we looked at a personalised budget.  It will be given as an option and I do not say will work for everybody - but it is an option.  I know from my own experience and from talking to people with disabilities that usually between 8% and 12% of the population are interested in that.  They have to have value for money.  </p> <p>  I will address the issue of people with a disability living longer.  There is a huge increase in the population.  People with health issues are living longer due to new medicines and so on.  I remember being told 25 years ago that when a person has a daughter with a disability, God knows how long she will live.  It might be into her 30s.  Going around the country now I meet adults with intellectual disabilities in their 50s and 60s, which is great.</p><p>As the Chairman knows, I have been to his county.  When we are talking about congregated settings, the examples in Monaghan are fantastic.  They are smaller houses in which four or five people live with support staff funded by the State.  It is very progressive.  We have learned from that.  Do we have more a lot more to do?  Absolutely.  There are more than 2,500 people in congregated settings.  My job is to try to get them out.  We are trying to provide funding to get another 170 out this year.  We need to ensure that is progressed.  As a Minister of State, one has competing needs.  Different issues come at one.  If I thought for a second that I could deal with all those issues in 2019 with the &euro;200 million, I would absolutely do so.  The Chairman can take it that I will be pushing for the maximum resources for my colleagues both in the Department of Health and in the Department of Justice and Equality in the negotiations.</p><p> The other question Senator Nolan posed is very important.  The budget absolutely has to be cross-departmental in nature.  If one is talking about equality, that has to be ensured.  I agree with that principle but we have to ensure that every single Department understands it.  We have made progress.  We have managed to change the mindset.  One of the reasons we included a Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities in the programme for Government was to start the change of mindset of Government, of the Cabinet and across society more broadly.  I agree that we have to have cross-budgetary action in respect of budget 2019.  We have to ensure that people with disabilities are not left behind in the broader debate.  I know there are competing interests.  From talking to him, I know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is under pressure in the context of hospital issues, staff issues, accident and emergency departments, beds, etc.  We also have the issue of housing.  There are competing needs in the budget.  My job is to try to push for the maximum supports for all people with disabilities.  I give a commitment to the committee that I will do my best on these issues.</p></speech>

First, I will give the Minister of State a break.  I will probably not be at his meeting with the DFI.  The Minister of State is saying that progress is being made and that there is cultural change at the level of the Cabinet and the Government.  The question is whether progress is happening faster than the demographic change that is working against us.  That is the real nub of this issue.  Of course, progress is being made when one looks at it micro issue by micro issue.  On that &euro;200 million or more which will be the minimum going in, if that amount or something like it is not allocated, we will not make the progress required.  That is the issue.  Government has crises in health and housing.  It is very concerned about what is or is not happening in Northern Ireland and in the context of Brexit.  If one looks back five years, the Government had other priorities.  Disability is always spoken about as a critical issue but it never breaks into the first division of priorities.  That is the problem.  It is always on the edge.  Can it not break into the first division now?  I have named four issues for Government.  I will add a fifth.  I do not hear Ministers - and I am not talking about the Minister of State - name-dropping disability, mental health or the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Has the latter been ratified?  Do the Ministers understand what it means?  That is the nub of the cultural change.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned a figure of 170 people, which is all very well.  I am not going to rub it in.  He and I know that is modest in terms of what needs to be done.  Some of that problem will be solved by people dying in the residences and institutions in which they are living.  Sadly, that is a fact.  Can we please stop adding to it by putting people into nursing homes?  There will be people put into nursing homes this year.  There are issues like that.  The Minister of State has to start draining the thing.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  I thank the Minister of State.  I have a suggestion for the Cathaoirleach.  I do not know the way to do this but there needs to be some way for this committee or the Cathaoirleach, with some of the other committees, to bring this discussion beyond justice in some way.  It has to be embedded across other committees and other Departments.  That is a conundrum don Chathaoirleach f&eacute;in.</p></speech>

People have talked about how this issue relates to justice but I see it as one for this committee and the Department because it relates to equality.  The Department, including but not limited to the Minister of State, has responsibility for ensuring equality on this particular issue and right across the board.  It is the Department that should be responsible for working across all Departments to ensure that all policies are equality-proofed, whether they relate to matters of disability, social inclusion or race.  The Department has a responsibility to ensure that all Departments take on the brief of equality.  Many of the issues have been covered quite well.  I will try not to go over some of them.  I may comment briefly on some issues that have been covered but I will mostly try to move to new territory.</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State elaborate on how the comprehensive employment strategy is working at a practical level?  Specifically, would he consider increasing the wage subsidy scheme?  I will ask a few questions and then the Minister of State can come back in.  I may then ask a few more questions if that is all right.</p> <p>  In the area of reform of the wards of court system, there has been some discussion regarding the Decision Support Service and the delay in implementing the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The points have been well made.  It has been far too long.  Even the timescales we are now looking at in respect of the service are absolutely unacceptable.  That point has been addressed but are there other actions the Department intends to take to ensure the reform of the wards of court system?</p> <p>  On the optional protocol, could the Minister of State indicate the timeline again?  With regard to a different optional protocol, the Minister of State has made some comments on the deprivation of liberty.  Could he give us a sense of how he defines that?  There is also an issue in respect of the Government's failure to ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, not that anybody is suggesting anything with respect to torture.  That optional protocol relates to inspections of places where there is deprivation of liberty.  That is quite salient.  It is not only about people who are incarcerated, but those in any situations in which there is, broadly speaking, a deprivation of liberty.  The optional protocol requires reporting on that.  Will the Minister of State offer a view on his definition of the deprivation of liberty?  Does he believe that the Government should ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018062700002#K00600"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for his comments.  I take his point with regard to Senator Dolan's comment about which committee is responsible.  As far as I am concerned, disability and inclusion are contemplated as part of the broader issue of equality.  That is a very relevant aspect.</p> <p>  On the comprehensive employment strategy, the Department of Justice and Equality is leading on its implementation.  The strategy is basically intended to address the under-representation of people with disabilities in the labour force.  The purpose of the strategy is to facilitate a concerted cross-Government effort to address the barriers and challenges and their impact on people with disabilities.  As stated earlier, we have changed that figure from 3% to 6% within the public service.  On the impact of the implementation issues which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised, the implementation of the strategy is under way and is being co-ordinated and monitored by the Department of Justice and Equality.  An implementation group consisting of relevant Departments and stakeholders meets regularly and is engaged in discussions with larger public sector employers such as the Public Appointments Service and the HSE to progress commitments outlined in the strategy.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire touched on the monitoring of the strategy, which is very important.</p><p>The overarching monitoring method used by the group is the traffic-light approach or the so-called red-amber-green approach.  This is something we also do in the broader national disability inclusion strategy.</p><p> Importantly, we made progress on the employment of people with disabilities.  Some Departments have very good records and have moved above 4%.  As I mentioned earlier, there are approximately 5,000 people with some form of disability employed in small businesses in the private sector.  I know from visiting third-level colleges throughout the country that there are in the region of 12,000 people with some form of disability in those colleges.  This was unheard of 20 years ago.  Therefore, we have moved forward and are doing certain things.  As I touched on earlier, we were monitoring and assessing, every few months, every development in regard to the employment of people with disabilities.</p><p> We have to change the mindset of broader society, including in both the public and private sectors, to focus on the ability of a person with a disability.  We should focus on abilities in working with people to find them employment.  There are 16 Intreo officers in the 60 social protection offices throughout the country.  Their full-time job is to liaise with any family or a person with a disability with a view to advising them on some form of employment.  I have updated members on what we do.  As I stated before, we have a long way to go and a mindset to change.  It is important that we acknowledge that.</p><p> The optional protocol to the CRPD establishes two procedures to strengthen the implementation and monitoring of the convention.  First, it allows individuals to bring petitions to the committee on the rights of persons with disabilities claiming breaches of their rights.  The second is an inquiry procedure giving the committee authority to undertake inquiries into grave systematic violations of the convention.  The convention and protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which require substantive cultural changes.  Included are changes concerning decongregation, personalised budgets and the deprivation of liberty.  As the optional protocol comes into effect 30 days after the deposit of its instruments, the State will become accountable to the committee for any breaches of the convention from that date forward.  We might disagree on this but it is essential that the necessary legislation, the disability Bill we are discussing today, and the Decision Support Service be in place prior to an optional protocol.  For this reason, I have opted for a phased approach as the most practical and realistic way of moving forward.</p><p> Accordingly, the optional protocol is not being ratified at this time.  It will be ratified as soon as possible following completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle, which will identify any actions needed regarding compliance with the convention.  The direct answer to the question is that I will ratify as soon as possible.  We will ratify as soon as possible.  I want to ratify.  We will opt in eventually.  I want to make sure everything is in place first.</p><p> I omitted to mention the reform of the wards of court system.  This is also an issue.</p></speech>

With regard to social protection, I mentioned the Intreo offices.  There are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people in the scheme now.  That figure might not have changed recently but the answer is "Yes".  We have to ensure positive discrimination in regard to the employment issue.  There are a couple of thousand people on the scheme and we need to develop it.  We need to ensure more employers become directly involved.  I will absolutely be pushing for this with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  That comes under her remit but I work very closely with her.  As I said earlier, and as Senator Dolan will tell the Deputy, there are many more qualified people now in the disability community.

The existing legislation does not provide procedural safeguards to ensure individuals are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The draft legislative proposals that I published for public consultation last December are designed to address this gap by providing safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and some categories of people with a mental illness to ensure they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in certain residential facilities.  The development of these deprivation-of-liberty legislative provisions is a highly complex undertaking.  I mentioned this earlier.  In addition to satisfying the requirements of the CRPD, the provisions must also align &ndash; this is probably related to the Deputy's question &ndash; with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and existing legislation, such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the Mental Health Act.  I am continuing to progress this legislation as a matter of priority.  The direct answer to the Deputy's question is that the target date for finalisation of the heads is the autumn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018062700002#L00900"><p>I have another series of questions.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  There are those who would like a narrow understanding of it, specifically focusing on incarceration in prisons and so on.  A broad view needs to be taken of it.  The convention should have application anywhere people are deprived of their liberty.  The Minister of State would have an interest in that.  I hope he will have discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality, and that we can ratify the optional protocol as soon as possible.  It is in everyone's interest.</p> <p>  I support Senator Dolan on the point he made about polling stations.  Deputy Adams brought forward a Bill on this.  No polling station should be used that is not fully accessible.  We should put that on a legislative basis.</p> <p>  A number of points were made on respite.  The Minister of State committed to expanding respite care.  The matter is raised regularly in my constituency office by people seeking respite.  I had a conversation recently on an issue that is broader than respite, namely, that of settings, on which there has been a fair bit of discussion.  A parent to whom I spoke who has been regularly seeking more respite said the service is reasonable until the person cared for reaches the age of 18, after which there is a bit of a cliff edge.  The person's son is profoundly autistic.  The family have quite a challenging life.  It is positive but challenging and it is very difficult for them to get respite.  They recently asked a health service provider where their son would go if anything happened to them in the morning.  They were shocked to discover there was no place in particular.  The son would probably end up in hospital for a period until another setting was found.  The family were quite shocked, upset and worried as a consequence.  They are right because it indicates the lack of a long-term plan to offer support to individuals.  There might be a bit of a plan up to the age of 18 but, beyond that, there is not.  The family was rightly very concerned about this.  It has made them concerned now and they are trying to figure out how best to put a plan in place.  There might not be a great amount that they can do, which is quite worrying.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I have more points to make and perhaps the Minister of State will take a note of them in order.  I recently visited Cork Deaf Club.  Much of the discussion was on the back of the recognition of Irish sign language.  A number of significant issues still need to be addressed, however.  One is that the driver theory test is quite challenging for those who are deaf or who have limited hearing.  It is more difficult than it should be.  This may not be so much the case with the practical test.  There is a serious lack of teachers who can sign to an adequate standard.  This needs to be addressed.  I note that there is a course available.</p><p>This is more likely to be the case at primary level than at post-primary level, but it seems to be an issue.  There also seems to be an issue with the quality of interpreters.  There are many interpreters whose work is of a high standard, but there are also those whose work is not of an adequately high standard.  Questions have been asked about the much-discussed voucher system.  When will something like that be put in place to allow people to obtain interpreters for cultural and social events outside of those to which there is an entitlement because public services are being provided?  Obviously, there needs to be an improvement with regard to public services as well.  I ask the Minister of State and the witnesses to comment on the voucher system.</p><p> I wish to ask about the option of sending a text message to alert the emergency services.  I think it may be available in Dublin in respect of ambulance services, but I am not sure.  In other parts of the country, it is not the case that one can send a text message to alert the Garda and the other emergency services when people are in distress.  I do not think it is possible to make an appointment with SouthDoc, which is the after-hours service in the HSE's southern area, by sending a text message.  That is quite challenging.</p><p> I would like to mention an issue that was raised with me on another occasion.  It has been suggested to me that it would be helpful if members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knew five or six basic signs.  When communications difficulties arise in situations of distress, perhaps because somebody is not able to verbalise what he or she wants to say, it would be helpful if garda&iacute; knew five or six basic signs.  Perhaps that could be integrated into their training.</p><p> I was part of a delegation of Deputies from Cork that met the Minister of State approximately two years ago to discuss the lack of multidisciplinary supports for a special school in Cork.  I regret to say that very little headway has been made in that regard since then.  I wrote to the Minister of State recently to raise this matter again.  If it has not yet been brought to his attention, that is reasonable.  I would like the Minister of State to meet the delegation of Deputies from Cork again, ideally before the recess.  Two years have passed and very little progress has been made in this regard.</p></speech>

I know that, like the Chair, he is a strong advocate for people with disabilities.  I agree that we need to have a broader view, as the Deputy said earlier when he spoke about the optional protocol.  Of course, I will have discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of this issue.</p> <p>  It is unacceptable that there are polling stations which are not accessible.  If we are talking about having an inclusive democracy, we need to do something about this.  I will push this issue as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy touched on the important broader issue of respite, about which I spoke earlier.  An extra &euro;10 million was provided for respite a few months ago to try to ensure services are provided.  As he said, older parents in their 70s, 80s and 90s who are caring for their children, who are now adults with intellectual disabilities, are wondering where they will go when they pass away.  I have heard about such cases in Cork and from my colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  We have to address that system.  I am banging on the door as part of that.  I am looking for 400 emergency residential places to deal with these situations.  Last year, I managed to get emergency funding for 135 places.  Having listened to what the Deputy has said today, and having listened to colleagues right across the D&aacute;il, I have decided that 400 places are needed.  That is something I have to push for.</p> <p>  I have a long-term objective for services for people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  Every state and every society should have a plan for children and adults with disabilities from the cradle to the grave.  This links in with the debate we had earlier about the multi-annual approach.  A plan is needed for people with disabilities.  There was a row when I was looking for funding for places for 18 year olds.  There is never a similar row about people in the non-disabled community.  They automatically go to primary school, to secondary school and to college if they have enough points.  There is no debate about it, but I need to have a discussion and a row about getting money to ensure  that 18 year olds with disabilities can get adult services.  That is part of this debate.  We need to plan the service from the cradle to the grave.</p> <p>  I was in Cuba a couple of years ago.  Many of the members of the committee will not agree with this, although Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire probably will.</p></speech>

There are disabilities in Cuba, which is a country that has been hammered by an embargo.  It has been hammered by its next-door neighbour - America - for 60 years.  When I met the Cuban Minister who deals with disabilities, she brought me around.  It is interesting that there were no people on trolleys in this supposedly poor country.  They had a plan of the kind spoken about by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  There is a plan for every child with a disability in Cuba from the day he or she is born to the day he or she dies.  I saw the services that are bring provided in a country that has a low budget.  Cuba prioritises health, disability and education when it is debating these matters.  It is a lesson for us all.  We can learn from it.  If a poor country can do it, we can do it.  My objective, if I get enough time in the job, is to develop a cradle-to-grave approach to this whole issue.</p> <p>  I will work with the various Departments on the important issue of driving tests and theory tests for deaf people.  I intervened to assist the Irish Deaf Society when it was in financial difficulty recently.  Like the members of this committee, those involved in the society were very supportive when the Irish Sign Language Bill 2016 was going through these Houses.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has indicated, now that the legislation has been passed we need to ensure services of an appropriate quality and standard are available.  There should be no issues with lack of standards in services.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a very good point about being able to send text messages to alert the emergency services.  It will have to be addressed.  The inclusion of emergency communications in the proposed EU accessibility directive is being examined as part of the negotiations on the proposed directive.  When that directive has been agreed and transposed, it will be put on a legislative footing in Ireland.  It is important for the ongoing work on this issue to continue.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire also mentioned the use of Irish sign language by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He suggested that all garda&iacute; should have basic training in the use of Irish Sign Language and I agree that this would be very important.  I suggest that this should be done in Templemore, but I would take it a step further.  Every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should receive Irish Sign Language training at the Garda College, but this should apply to other public servants as well.  They should get some level of training in the use of Irish Sign Language.  I expect that people involved in the Irish Deaf Society would be glad to facilitate the training and upskilling of people in this area.</p> <p>  I am disappointed to hear that no progress has been made in respect of the special school in Cork.  I will meet Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and the other members of the delegation to discuss the issues in relation to the school in question.</p></speech>

I support the request made by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, for the Minister of State to meet a deputation of Deputies from Cork to discuss the availability of essential services.  I ask the Minister of State to agree to such a meeting.</p> <p>  The failure to provide for polling stations that can be accessed by people with disabilities has been mentioned.  I would be careful in saying that polling stations should be shut down.  I come from a rural area where polling booths were placed in private houses until quite recently.  We have moved on since then.  There is a limited choice of public buildings in certain parts of the country.  If we are talking about upgrading access or reviewing buildings, funding needs to be provided to facilitate that.  If this does not happen, people in some parts of the country will end up with no polling booths within miles and miles of them.  We need to be fair to all people, for example by giving them transport or whatever.</p> <p>  I came to this meeting to raise a different issue.  Senator Dolan referred in his concluding remarks to the need to avoid putting people in nursing homes.  Yesterday, the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly, launched a report on the home care package, which is an alternative to the fair deal scheme for nursing homes.</p><p>Will the Department have a look at the report and see where it could feed into it and how younger adults could avail of this option?  As Senator Dolan stated, the last thing we want to do is put people into nursing homes or community care houses.  We want to keep them at home.  There may be some parts of this report that the Department could feed into, particularly with regard to the home care package scheme for younger people.</p></speech>

We will see if we can be supportive of parents and children in that school.  We must see what is the problem or the delay.  I agree with that.</p> <p>  The Deputy is 100% right about polling stations and accessibility is important.  Even in smaller locations with polling stations, it is easy to adapt and provide resources and services.  I did not realise there were still some stations in private homes.</p></speech>

There should be access and services should be provided in that respect.  We will examine the home care package question.  We have tried out for the past 12 months the idea of home support service hours.  For example, last year there were 2.75 million home support hours.  Instead of people going into respite care in those cases, the services came to the person's house.  I mentioned to Senator Dolan and DFI recently the provision of personal assistant services.  Last year that came to 1.5 million or 1.6 million hours.  If we can increase those hours, we could provide support, particularly for young people with a disability.  I do not wish to discriminate but it is particularly sad to see a young person in their 20s or 30s in a nursing home environment.  The members do not have to convince me about such people as I know them, have met them and I spoke to some recently.  Whatever about a senior citizen or elderly person being in a nursing home, such people are at least with their peer group.  Part of the solution will be more personal assistant and home support hours.  The issues of services for people of all ages will be considered in developing the new home care scheme.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about funding and the mindset in Irish society.  My job is to push for funding and to change the mindsets both within and outside government to ensure every person with a disability is treated with respect and dignity.  I set out with three clear objectives when I took over as Minister of State.  The first was to reform services, and we have started doing that.  The second was to invest in services, and we have started that as well.  Third and most important, is the facet fitting into the comments from Deputy O'Keeffe and Senator Dolan, which is putting the person with the disability at the centre of our services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018062700002#N00500"><p>I will make a number of points and pose some questions before we bring this session to a close.  As Senator Dolan noted, the Oireachtas disability group yesterday launched its pre-budget submission for 2019.  It is the first time that an all-party or non-party group of Members of both Houses has prepared and published pre-budget proposals in the area of disabilities.  The only precedent I can reference relates to mental health.  A different group, which I am thankful is still functioning here, has in previous years presented such a proposition.  We will forward those proposals to the Minister of State.  I join the Senator in strongly urging the Minister of State's careful consideration of the points made.  They were made in conjunction with four of the key organisations, including Inclusion Ireland, which is represented at the meeting, and the DFI.  I thank them for their collaboration in this effort.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan mentioned a figure of &euro;200 million but we are not asking the Minister of State to secure that on his own.  It is across what has often been referenced as the "silos" of government.  What we are hoping for and urging is that in budget 2019, not only with the portfolios under the Minister of State's aegis, but all Departments would reflect on this to ensure that the needs and rights of people with disabilities can be front and centre in all the departmental elements of the budget.  As I said in closing yesterday's event, it would be an historic statement on the part of the Government if the approximately 640,000 people who have registered with a disability in the 2016 census were recognised, with their needs and rights affirmed across all Departments.  I take the opportunity to strongly urge the Minister of State's careful consideration and that he could be that the champion at the Cabinet table.  It is important that we see this referencing and provision across all Departments.</p> <p>  We are a justice and equality committee and the equality element is important, and not just in terms of justice rights.  The equality element relating to people with disabilities is important.  I know other members who, unfortunately, could not be with us today and who would have a very strong contribution to make in that regard.  I regret that they have not been able to attend.</p> <p>  We can go over a number of the points made by the Minister of State, specifically relating to the optional protocol to the CRPD.  In December 2016 the Minister of State sat in this room with us, indicating it was his intent and purpose to ensure the simultaneous ratification of the convention and the optional protocol.  There is major disappointment that the optional protocol has been kicked down the road; there is no other way to describe it.  The optional protocol will give effect to the two implementation mechanisms mentioned by the Minister of State.  It is only through the adoption of the optional protocol that the mechanisms are open to exercise.  I noted the Minister of State's first response to Deputy Chambers on this, which is speculation that it will happen in two or three years.  Even the notion of having to wait for the first report in the cycle is not good enough.  It does not allow for enforceability but it offers a means to hold to account not only Departments and agencies and it gives people hope and a path to ensuring the promise of the UN convention.  That is much more than how the Minister of State described it himself.</p> <p>  In his opening comments, the Minister of State indicated that ratifying the convention signalled a commitment to ongoing improvement in the provision of disability services.</p><p>It has to be so much more than that.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment to ongoing improvements in the provision of disability services, but the ratification of the CRPD is not just people with disabilities and those who care for them and who share with them.  It has to be so much more.<br/><br/>He referenced recognition of Irish sign language.  I remember the euphoria of the deaf community in the Visitors Gallery on the confirmation of recognition of their language.  Similarly the recognition of ethnicity for the Traveller community was a great day for Travellers.  To see such joy in people was wonderful.<br/><br/>The CRPD is an unfulfilled joy for people with disabilities.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of revisiting the Minister of State's decision to do this on an incremental basis.  I ask him to give the programme for the ratification of the optional protocol serious consideration in the period ahead and perhaps we could talk again in the autumn on this matter.  I do not want the him to dismiss my appeal out of hand and I do not expect that he will be in a position to answer my request and say: &quot;Okay&quot;.  I ask him to take a little time to consider it, to listen to the representative organisations, to reflect on the submission of the Oireachtas disability group and to give serious reconsideration to the scheduling of that.  <br/><br/>When the committee dealt with the general scheme of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, it was then called the equality and disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  The equality element in the Title was dropped.  We have done that.  I note in his opening remarks that the Minister of State stated: &quot;The disability Bill was published in 2016 and is currently awaiting Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  We are the committee who will perform that task and we are awaiting it.  It is hugely frustrating because it also has a direct impact on the implementation of the UN convention.<br/><br/>There are delays with various Bills coming to the committee and there is a delay even in the decision on support service under the capacity legislation.Only a fortnight ago, the senior Minister from the Department of Justice and Equality, was before us and we cited to him the backlog in legislation.  There has never been such a serious delay with progressing legislation as some of us are witnessing now, particularly those who have been here for many years.  Will the Minister of State endeavour to prioritise the promised legislation and to prioritise again the assisted decision-making support service?  One of his officials told us honestly during a previous engagement with officials from the Department that she did not see it happening in this calendar year.  I acknowledge that is the reply the Minister of State gave, but if it is at all possible, whatever can be done before the end of the year should be done.  I note that he has said 2019, as the lady official also indicated previously, make it as early as possible in the new year, if that can at all be done.  The decision-making support service and the capacity legislation is a vital support for people with an intellectual incapacity.  <br/><br/>I have a number of specific questions.  The Oireachtas disability group is making a case to the Minister of State for the cost of living with a disability to be factored in.  There should not be a relationship between the disability allowance, the social protection supports and people in other situations, such as unemployment assistance or whatever the case might be.  People living with disabilities are living unique lives and it should be down to the real cost.  As an interim measure we are urging a particular increase in budget 2019 of &euro;20 per week to be followed in each of the subsequent years over the five-year lifespan of the submission we have made.  Is an analysis of the real cost of living with a disability being undertaken?  Is such an exercise under way under the aegis of the Departments of which the Minister of State has an overview?.<br/><br/>Are measures being taken to introduce secure medical cards for people with a disability?  It is frustrating for people with a lifelong incapacity finding themselves because of whatever change without a medical card which is such a crucial comfort and support.  That is simply not acceptable.  If we are to believe the Minister for Health, we are moving towards an NHS-type of public health care provision, we should take medical cards away from anybody.  We should move forward to include more and more cohorts.  People with disabilities should not lose a medical card at any time.  <br/><br/>What plans are there to increase the number of health professionals in the disability sector such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists?  The Minister of State mentioned recruitment of up to 400 in the coming year.  What proactive measures are under way to signal to displaced Irish trained therapists across the range of different areas that Ireland is hoping to recruit therapists?  Are we advertising in the Irish overseas media and all the local newspapers that are sold in the United States and Britain?  That is where our expats will go for information.  Does the Department advertise, for example, in the <i>Irish Voice</i>, and <i>The Irish Echo</i>to notify readers that there are job opportunities in the healthcare system in Ireland in all of these specific areas?<br/><br/>The <i>in loco parentis</i>issue has not been raised.  I am not going to go over what has been said but I have raised this issue repeatedly and in tandem with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, I have met Department of Health officials.</p><p>I know of several settings where the <i>in loco parentis</i>clause almost creates an inability on the part of a parent to take even a brief break from a home environment where they are looking after a special child on a 24-7 basis.  On a strict application of the <i>in loco parentis</i>provision, when a fully qualified, properly vetted nurse practitioner is dealing with a child's specific needs for a period of time in the day, a parent can only leave to visit next door for a coffee or to fulfil a need such as shopping, etc.  Unless they can put another adult<i>in situ</i>they are not allowed to leave the house, though the highly qualified nurse practitioner is probably the most respected person to have <i>in situ</i>.  If there is no willingness to look at the <i>in loco parentis</i>provision in its entirety, there is a huge need for a significant relaxation to allow the parent a brief respite for a half an hour or an hour to enable him or her to cope. There are real situations involving real people.  I have many questions.  I showed them to the clerk to the committee yesterday but they do not all come under employment, education, and transport.We believe the needs and rights of people with disabilities cut across all Departments, which is something the Minister said earlier in response to a question.  I commend the Minister of State on that and I ask him to ensure that his colleagues in Cabinet also appreciate this.<br/><br/>I have witnessed the Eagle passenger lifter device assisting people with significant physical disabilities to get from a wheelchair into an airline seat.  It has an Australian manufacturer and the process was, I understand, recently demonstrated for the Minister of State.  It is not, however, available at any airport in the State.  In my view, it is a requirement and the airport authorities should have it.  It is long past time for people who cannot move from a wheelchair to an airline seat to have such a device, rather than being hauled by two, three or four people into a seat, which is hugely undignified.  Any measure that helps affirm the dignity of every human being should be pursued.  I understand that we all make a small contribution to a fund every time we book an airline flight, which is supposed to be set aside to introduce such measures so the money is there, sitting in the coffers of airline authorities, and we need somebody to drive it forward to ensure the equipment is rolled out across the airports here.  It would mean a total of 11 units in Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Galway, Knock and Donegal.  There would be no additional cost to the public purse.  The money is there so why can we not have the service for those who need it and are entitled to it?</p></speech>

I have met some of the groups that are pushing this agenda.  I am glad the Chairman recognises that the &euro;200 million is not just for me and it is a broader Cabinet issue.  I have made it a priority, however.</p> <p>  All Departments have to reflect the needs and rights of all people with disabilities.  The Chairman said the UN convention was a historic statement for the 640,000 people with disabilities and he also mentioned the justice and equality dimension.  I understand his concerns relating to the optional protocol and we have to ensure there is a pathway so that people can have hope.  I had a choice; I could have been hanging around for another two years to get the legislation done but I decided to ratify the convention and use that to strengthen my own hand in the area.  People may not have agreed with this but I felt the process was too slow.</p> <p>  I totally agree that the ratification of the UN convention has got to be more than just ratification.  The Chairman referred to the unrestrained joy on the night the Irish Sign Language Bill 2017 was passed and we have all learned from that positive experience.  We have to ensure the UN convention is a meaningful convention and is backed up by implementation and by resources.</p> <p>  I have worked very closely with the Chairman on other Oireachtas committees on the area of disability, as I have with Senator John Dolan.  I give serious consideration to everything the justice committee tells me.  Behind the scenes, I am raising the points they have made on the timeframe for ratification.  I also feel strongly about the delays in the legislation.  Members mentioned the issues of costs for persons with disabilities.  Every time I talk about improving things for a person with a disability I refer to the high cost of services for people with disabilities.  I would love to give them &euro;20 per week more in the disability allowance and we will push for this.  Over the past two years, the disability allowance has gone up by &euro;10 a week, though I was looking for &euro;20 more.</p> <p>  The security of medical cards for people with disabilities is also important.  We have to build a strong, national, public health service and that is my vision.  I am working with the Minister for Health on it and the domiciliary care allowance for 11,000 children was one of the first issues we worked on.  We need to ensure our senior citizens, our sick and our elderly, who are among the most vulnerable people in society, have a medical card.  There should be no dithering about it and nothing should change while a person has a recognised disability.  I have been in talks with the spinal injuries people and I am a strong advocate in Government for medical cards for them.  Many of them are working and they have many additional costs because of their disability.</p> <p>  I am told there are plans to get some of our speech and language and occupational therapists back from England and Scotland.</p><p>I take the point about local district Irish newspapers being sold in Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh which people whose parents are living in Ireland buy.  I had not thought of that important means of making contact with our highly educated people whom we lost to emigration during the downturn and most of them are dying to come home.  We need to push strongly for this to happen.<br/><br/>On the issue of <i>in loco parentis,</i>I have talked to the HSE, the Department of Health and have made my views known internally.  I have similar views to the Chairman, because we know how difficult it is for some families with high dependency children and-or adult offspring with disabilities who cannot get a break because there are issues with using highly trained staff or nurses.  We have to examine the issue in its entirety and we have to be flexible.  The latest up-to-date situation is that the Department of Health is looking at the issue.<br/><br/>The Chairman referred to the Eagle Passenger Lifter, and I am on the same page about the undignified way people with disabilities are often treated at airports.  I met personnel from the company that supplies Eagle Passenger lifters.  The Chairman had a very positive constructive proposal about covering the cost because normally when one looks for a service, the first thing that is said is that it will cost us money.  He pointed out that there is a budget for this service.  The use of an Eagle Passenger Lifter leads to supporting the personal dignity of a person with a disability and that is in line with the UNCRPD</p></speech>

I am here in response to an invitation from the joint committee to assist in its consideration of the general scheme of the railway safety (amendment) Bill as submitted recently to and approved by the Government for publication and drafting by the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>  A key role for the Minister is to develop robust legislation to underpin railway safety in Ireland.  First, I will give an overview of the various agencies that operate under that legislative framework.  Each has an important role in railway safety.  The prime duty to ensure safety in the day-to-day safe operation of railways rests with the railway operators, in accordance with the Railway Safety Act 2005 and a wide range of EU laws.  They include Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Transdev, the company that operates Luas.  All railway organisations are obliged to implement statutory compliant safety management systems.  </p> <p>  As an independent specialist regulator, the Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR, is the national safety authority for the rail sector.  It is charged under the 2005 Act with oversight of the safety of the heavy and light rail organisations which provided over 80 million passenger journeys in 2017.  It approves and audits the safety management systems of the railway operators and takes enforcement proceedings, where necessary.  </p> <p>  The Railway Accident and Investigation Unit, RAIU, is an independent investigation unit that conducts investigations into accidents and incidents on railways in Ireland.  Investigations are carried out in accordance with the Railway Safety Act 2005 and EU law.  The purpose of RAIU investigations is to make safety recommendations in order to prevent future accidents and improve railway safety.  </p> <p>  This comprehensive framework is in place because railway safety is critical for passengers, railway workers and all who come in contact with the rail network.  One aspect of railway safety involves safeguarding against impairment of safety critical workers as a result of intoxicant use.  The main provisions in the general scheme as circulated propose important amendments to the drug and alcohol provisions of the 2005 Act.  The general scheme also has some miscellaneous amendments to the 2005 Act, in addition to one amendment to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  </p> <p>  I will focus first on Part 9 of the 2005 Act which provides for the implementation in the workplace of a statutory code of conduct for drugs and alcohol for railway safety critical workers.  Not all employees are safety critical workers.  Under the Act, a safety critical worker is one who performs safety critical tasks, including tasks to control the movement of trains, encompassing train drivers and signal operators, as well as tasks to control the movement of persons, for example, at railway crossings on platforms, in addition to maintenance tasks.  The code sets out the workplace policy for testing these workers for intoxicants.  Disciplinary sanctions apply for non-compliance, up to and including dismissal.  Under these provisions, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Transdev, the current Luas operator, have both agreed codes of conduct for drugs and alcohol.  Random testing is undertaken, in addition to testing for cause &ndash; for example, after an incident.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has 2,421 safety critical workers employed.  In the three years to the end of 2017, 710 employee tests were undertaken, with eight positive results.  None of the positive results was after an incident and all were dealt with under disciplinary procedures.  Transdev has 246 safety critical workers employed.  Since the commencement of Luas operations in 2004, four Luas safety critical workers have had positive results.  None has continued in employment or returned to work for Transdev.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that the introduction of the drugs and alcohol policy and the associated testing has been extremely effective in developing its safety culture.  It seems that workplace testing and the culture of awareness of intoxicants can be considered as factors in the continued positive record of railway safety in recent years.</p> <p>  While the provisions of Part 9 are working well, the general scheme addresses some issues of concern.  The alcohol limits set in the 2005 Act mirrored the provisions that applied under road traffic Acts at the time.  However, the alcohol limits under road traffic Acts have evolved since 2005.  The Railway Safety Act has not kept pace.  Road traffic legislation has been amended to reduce the statutory alcohol limits for all drivers and introduced a "specified person" category which includes professional road drivers such as drivers of buses or taxis.  This means that train drivers and other railway safety critical workers are currently permitted to have four times more alcohol in their blood than the equivalent professional road driver.  Following a CRR recommendation, the general scheme proposes that statutory alcohol limits consistent with those specified under Road Traffic Acts for "specified persons" apply to all railway safety critical workers under Part 9.  Other changes are proposed to clarify procedures.  For example, the amended Part 9 will make it clear that a doctor is not required to be present when a urine sample is given.  It is also proposed to expand the provisions to introduce a role for a nurse in sampling.  </p> <p>  Part 10 of the Act provides for criminal sanctions.  It is proposed to amend the provisions in order that the procedures under Part 10 will be used only following an accident causing harmful consequences such as one involving fatalities.  Just as for Part 9, the proposal is to ensure statutory alcohol limits consistent with those under the road traffic Acts for "specified persons" will apply to all safety critical workers on the railways.  Under Part 10, the sanction will involve criminal offences with potential penalties, on conviction in court, involving a fine or imprisonment, or both.  As they are currently exempt, the general scheme also proposes to extend criminal sanction provisions to heritage train operators where they are operating on the rail infrastructure of another rail organisation &ndash; for example, when a steam train runs day trips on the Irish Rail mainline.  </p> <p>  Road traffic legislation was expanded in 2016 to provide for analysis of blood samples to establish the concentration level of certain drugs such as cocaine.  A Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2010 sets out the relevant drugs.  In regard to drugs, it is proposed that the approach under Parts 9 and 10 differ.  Workplace testing will continue to provide for a simple Yes/No test for the presence of drugs.  The more sophisticated approach involving sampling by the Garda and analysis for concentration of specified drugs by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will be used only in the criminal context.  If in the future either the statutory alcohol limits or the list of specified drugs set out in Road Traffic legislation are amended, the Bill provides that all such changes will automatically carry through for application for railway safety also. </p> <p>  Since the general scheme was circulated to the committee, we have been liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It has begun considering the many associated issues and complexities.  In opening discussions the Parliamentary Counsel highlighted the intricate interplay between Part 9 which is broadly based on employment law and Part 10 which constitutes criminal law, as it did in the original 2005 Act.  Initial views suggest that, in order to safeguard the ability to prosecute successfully under the criminal provisions, there may be a need to deal with those provisions separately or to apply a different legislative approach.  The Parliamentary Counsel has also noted that the general scheme was developed to closely mirror the drugs and alcohol provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, while adjusting them to fit the context of railway infrastructure, rather than public road, and to consider railway safety critical tasks being performed, rather than a car or road vehicle being driven.  </p> <p>  While the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has not yet finalised its analysis, it seems possible that the outcome of deliberations may be to recommend an approach that will be simpler than the full mirroring of the road traffic provisions, which is evident in the heads circulated.  While we cannot be definitive in that regard just yet, I highlight for the members of the committee that these considerations are ongoing and that the approach currently applied in the heads may evolve.</p><p>In respect of the commission, the Bill includes provisions that recognise the expanding remit of the CRR, and some streamlining of administrative procedures.  Due to changes in EU law, there is a need to ensure the RAIU continues to have adequate powers.  Post-transposition of the EU Fourth Railway Package, the RAIU would be unable to conduct investigations on light rail or metro, if this change in the Bill was not made.  There is also an amendment which provides for possible future international rail agreements.</p><p> The amendment to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 brings commercial school bus services which operate outside the scope of the school transport scheme under the Department of Education and Skills, and back within the scope of NTA&rsquo;s licensing regime.  These services were inadvertently excluded due to the definition of public bus passenger service which was amended in the 2009 Act.  The new provision corrects this.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting me to make this presentation and look forward to hearing their views.</p></speech>

This is the first time I have dealt with legislation and the heads of a Bill.  Members may have some very important questions on the Bill or on particular heads of the Bill.  I will be happy to take either-or.  The Department has assured me that if there are any questions that members ask to which it does not have the answers, it will come back with them.</p> <p>  This is very important legislation.  The record of Irish Rail drivers was exemplified by the driver of the train on the Malahide estuary some years ago when the lives of hundreds of passengers would have been lost but for his skill and capacity.  As the line collapsed, he was able to go at the correct speed to get everybody safely over the bridge.  I know many people who were on that train and how thankful they were for the professionalism of the driver concerned.  There is an excellent safety record but there are issues that have to be addressed and this legislation is updating the legislation for drivers of vehicles, drivers of trains and critical staff.</p></speech>

If it was a little quicker, it would be better but it was pleasant nonetheless.  I have a few questions regarding the general scheme of the railway safety (amendment) Bill.  The witness said that with the amendment to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the school transport scheme was inadvertently excluded due to the definition of a public bus passenger service.  Why did that happen?  It sounds like something simple.  Was it just left out?</p> <p>  In the three years to the end of 2017, 710 employee tests were undertaken with eight positive results.  None of the positive results was post-incident and all were dealt with under disciplinary procedures.  I notice in Transdev, which is a newer company, that 246 safety-critical workers and four Luas safety-critical workers had positive results and none of these has continued in employment or returned to work for Transdev.  Is there a different interpretation or how were the people in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann dealt with compared to Transdev?  Did they lose their jobs or was there a different procedure?</p> <p>  I find it hard to believe that until now train drivers were permitted to have four times more alcohol in their blood than the equivalent professional road driver.  I know what this Bill is about but maybe we were not keeping our eye on the ball.  I welcome this Bill.</p></speech>

The exclusion which existed before 2009 was that, in respect of the State bus operators, there was an essential approach that they had a different regulatory oversight regime and that in that case they were excluded from the bus licensing regime of the NTA.  The intention was to continue that exemption solely in regard to the bus services that were either provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann or provided under contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Department of Education and Skills school transport scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann and has a significant number of services provided directly or under contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The way it has been approached is that the oversight regime conducted by our State operator is adequate and the intention was to exclude them from the bus licensing regime.</p> <p>  Given the way the definition was crafted, what happened was that at the same time, inadvertently or unintentionally, other school bus services which were simply provided by commercial bus operators and were not under the Department of Education and Skills or Bus &Eacute;ireann's oversight were excluded.  It is, however, a very small minority of school bus services.  In the past year, 130 licensed.  In the scheme of all the bus services provided in Ireland that would be less than 5%, which is a small number.  They were inadvertently excluded.  What will happen with this amendment is that it will allow the NTA to conduct oversight and to check - for argument's sake - that Garda vetting is being conducted.  We are not saying that Garda vetting is not being conducted but at the moment, there is not an arm of the State that can make those additional checks.</p> <p>  Disciplinary procedures are brought by both companies in regard to the workplace tests and any failures.  I am not in a position to go into the detail of any of the particular cases, but disciplinary code involves up to, and including, dismissal.  As I understand it, in certain cases, people have been dismissed in Irish Rail.  I do not have the full detail here but, in some cases, they may have had other actions under the disciplinary code which may not have led to dismissal.</p></speech>

It is probably a factor of a certain siloed approach in respect of the development of legislation.  There are people who do road traffic legislation and people who consider railway legislation.  Somewhere, obviously, something fell between the gaps.  We intend to address this in the way in which we have approached this Bill.  The intention is not only to update the limits, but also to ensure there is a connection back to the limits in the Road Traffic Acts in order that if there is an amendment on the road traffic side, relating to either statutory alcohol limits or concentrations of drugs, this will automatically carry through straight away.  As soon as my colleagues and I realised there was a disparity, draft regulations were developed to address the disparity and to amend the limits because, under the current 2005 Act, there is a power to amend the limits with a statutory instrument.  However, when we developed that statutory instrument and sent it to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, it asked the advisory side of the Office of the Attorney General to look at it and to consider whether we had adequate powers, given statutory alcohol limits are set in primary legislation and we were attempting to amend these limits in primary legislation using only secondary legislation or a statutory instrument.  When that question was asked within the AG's office, it turned out that there was a Supreme Court case pending at the time which addressed the exact question whether these powers could be used.  The AG awaited the outcome of that case and then advised that it was inappropriate for the Department or the Minister to attempt to change the limits using a statutory instrument.  When the outcome of the Supreme Court case was clear, the advice was that primary legislation should be developed to amend the statutory limits.  This process took its time, and part of the delay was due to that engagement.</p></speech>

As part of the contract, a worker can arrive at work and be expected to take a test.  It would be unreasonable if the worker was in the middle of doing the task, but the legislation is written in such a way that if one either presents to do the task, that is, arrives at work and clocks in or is driving the train, one is not allowed to be unfit or intoxicated between walking from the flexi-clock to the train.  The legislation provides that if an authorised person notices that, he or she can take action.  The random test can be conducted before a person starts performing a safety-critical task because the legislation provides that one should not be unfit.  It is, therefore, not that one is stopping someone doing a task, but it is clear that the offence exists regardless of whether one has started.</p></speech>

The reason I seek clarity on this is I would not trust the Government or the Minister when it comes to privatisation by stealth.  When the Department refers to future international agreements, what precisely is meant by that?  If the Department is talking about the Enterprise service, we are an island.  I do not see how we would need international agreements in that regard.  Because the wording is so vague, I am just trying to understand what precisely is meant by it.

It seems as if it was just slung in there with a specific purpose and I just want to find out what it is about.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-06-27a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maev Nic Lochlainn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018062700002#D01400"><p>This is under head 4.  The reason for this is simply that since 2005 there have been many amendments to EU rail legislation which has involved additional functions being given essentially to the CRR.  The purpose of the amendment is to broaden adequately the scope of any potential order that could be made for conferral of additional functions on the commission.  It flows from the amendment proposed for section 10 in view of the European Commission now having a remit broader than railway safety.  For argument's sake, it now also does economic regulation because of legislation that was brought through by the EU, which was transposed in Ireland.  Similarly, it reflects the fact that it used to be called the Railway Safety Commission.  Given the commission now has that broader remit, it is now called the CRR.  The amendment is, therefore, simply a reflection of this new reality, which was also recognised by the Oireachtas in 2016.  It is just a further extension of that.</p> <p>  Head 6, the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, allows for an interval period of between three and five years for the mandatory publication of a statement of strategy.  Section 29 currently imposes a requirement on the commission to publish a statement of strategy at least every three years, and the proposed amendment is to extend the interval to at least five years.  The commission is a regulatory body.  Much of the work that it does, while important, will in a sense be the same.  There are safety management systems which it will have to oversee and regulate.  There are pieces of infrastructure coming into service which it must authorise before they are allowed into service, and there is a risk-based audit and inspection regime.  These tasks will not radically change.  In that context, and also given the code of practice for the governance of State bodies allows it, it is understood that in the context of this organisation, five years will be adequate.</p></speech>

Given the urgency of changing the limits, some parts of the Bill were put together quickly to get the limits changed.  This is one of the provisions we thought was important to add in but may not have taken as much consideration as others.  We will have to consider that fully with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></speech>

It relates how critical workers in the airline safety business are tested while on the ground or in the air, or what legislation, if any, covers them.  If Ms Nic Lochlainn has not got the answer, she might forward it to the committee.  It would be interesting to look at what the regulations are, particularly as in some cases people come into the State from outside the jurisdiction.  Is there common testing among airlines throughout the world?</p></speech>

On the aviation side, I understand random testing is conducted.  Many such tasks in the transport sector are safety-critical.  As I understand it, in aviation, the codes were developed under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Acts where one is obliged to have safe employees and safe practices to protect one's own safety and the safety of passengers.  Health and safety legislation is used, as far as I understand it.</p></speech>
