    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100003#J00300"><p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and thank him for the briefing given to the select committee.  The purpose of the meeting is to consider Vote 30, Revised Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Before I ask the Minister to make an opening statement, I will briefly deal with the proposed timetable, copies of which have been circulated to members.  Following the Minister's opening statement of approximately ten minutes, we will spend 20 minutes discussing administration, including a question and answer session.  We will then deal in turn with each of the four programmes.  While discussion of some programmes may take longer than 20 minutes, it is proposed to complete our discussion in two hours, although further time will be provided, if necessary.  As the Minister noted, a consultation paper on the rural development programme has been circulated to us.  While he may wish to expand on the paper, the secretariat has been in discussions with officials from the Department with a view to arranging a briefing for the joint committee.  That is being done to be fair to non-D&aacute;il members who do not sit on the select committee.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100003#J00400"><p>The outlook for the agrifood sector remains very bright and the sector will continue to contribute strongly to national economic recovery.  There is a new awareness of its vital economic importance and a strong recognition that it has the fundamental building blocks in place to reach the demanding targets it set for itself in Food Harvest 2020.  This blueprint will contribute significantly to growth in food and drink exports and national prosperity.  I am confident that the measures introduced in budget 2014 in a highly challenging fiscal environment will help us to continue on this path towards national recovery.</p><p>  The agrifood and fishing industry is enjoying a period of strong success.  I was pleased to note recently that the most recent statistics from Bord Bia confirmed that this trend was continuing, with all signs pointing to ongoing growth in the sector.  The value of Ireland's food and drink exports grew by more than 9% in 2013 to slightly less than &euro;10 billion in the year.  Since 2009, the value of food and drink exports has increased by more than 40%.  </p><p>  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.22 billion in 2014.  This figure comprises &euro;1.019 billion in current expenditure and approximately &euro;200 million in capital expenditure.  While on the current expenditure level, the allocation amounts to a modest fall in overall terms in 2014, reflecting the reality of macro-level budgetary constraints, but it is also worth noting that some agricultural schemes are coming to the end of their natural life.  Separately, the Department continues to reduce the administrative cost of delivering its programme for farmers and the agrifood sector as part of its reform package.</p><p>  When drafting the Estimates for 2014, I was conscious of a number of key areas, including the need to provide support for vulnerable sectors and maintain family farm income; the need to provide a support for the very important suckler beef sector; and, consequent on the new Common Agricultural Policy, the need to ensure schemes and programmes under the rural development programme were well funded.  On this latter point, last week I was pleased to be in a position to announce that under the new rural development programme, &euro;1.9 billion in national funding would be added to the &euro;2.2 billion European Union funding already secured for expenditure on the seven year programme.  Combined with the &euro;8.5 billion in EU funding that will be paid in direct payments to farmers in the period to 2020, this brings total funding for the sector over the period from 2014 to 2020 to more than &euro;12.5 billion.  This constitutes an ongoing and significant strategic financial investment in the agrifood sector.  </p><p>  I have demonstrated the Government's ongoing commitment to support farmers in vulnerable sectors, particularly those farming in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>Furthermore, I have maintained the level of payments under the disadvantaged areas payments at 2013 levels, with an allocation of &euro;195 million for 2014.</p><p> I am pleased that we were in a position to fund support measures for suckler farmers which will result in investment of &euro;40 million in the beef sector next year.  The suckler herd is the seedbed for a quality beef industry, involving more than 100,000 farm families and employing almost 8,000 people in processing and sales and marketing.  It drives exports valued at approximately &euro;1.8 billion per annum.  Harnessing technology in a way that improves efficiency and, ultimately, profitability at farm level is key and I am convinced that the combination of measures announced can make a major contribution to the expansion of beef output and greater market penetration.</p><p> The key elements comprise &euro;23 million for the new beef genomics scheme; payments of &euro;5 million for the continuation of the beef technology adoption programme; &euro;10 million from unspent single farm payment funds for the beef data programme; and &euro;2 million under the suckler cow welfare scheme.  This will bring total payments direct to suckler farmers to &euro;40 million in 2014.  The continuation of the beef technology adoption programme with a funding allocation of &euro;5 million will build on the outstanding success of the previous two years of the programme to allow its continuation for a third year.  Almost 6,000 farmers received an annual payment of &euro;825 each under the 2013 programme.  Some &euro;10 million will also be paid for the beef data programme in 2014.  In 2013 approximately 34,000 farmers applied for the programme, which assists farmers in improving the genetic quality of their livestock while maintaining a flow of crucial data to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation that will generate further advances in cattle breeding at national level.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, I have been able to obtain some &euro;23 million in Exchequer funding for the beef genomics scheme.  This will provide suckler farmers with a payment of &euro;40 per calf in return for which the farmer will be required to take samples from stock bulls and a selection of suckler cows for genotyping.  This will help to accelerate the type of genetic improvement that will drive efficiency and increase profitability at farm level.  With the beef data programme, this will provide for payments of up to &euro;60 per calf in the suckler herd.  The initiative will help to place Ireland firmly to the forefront globally in beef genetics.  It will enhance our reputation as a world leader in sustainable food production.  It will increase the carbon efficiency of the sector and, from a marketing perspective, it will help to reinforce the uniqueness of our offering on EU and world markets.  The collection of this vital genetic information can also provide a building block for further development of a genetic traceability system, which would be a global first.  This would place Ireland firmly in first place globally when it comes to consumer assurance and traceability.  The transfer of knowledge and best practice to beef farmers through the beef technology adoption programme and the collection, through the beef data programme, of animal events data that will link to the genetic data gathered through the beef genomics scheme are key examples of the smart green growth initiatives proposed under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  We are building on the progress to date with what we announced last week in respect of the rural development programme to bring payments to farmers from &euro;60 per calf to &euro;80 per calf and by adding to the beef genomics scheme, which we can discuss later.</p><p> I am strongly committed to supporting a capital programme throughout the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors in 2014.  In the marine sector I have provided an increased capital allocation of &euro;12 million to maintain the infrastructure at the Department's fisheries harbours and local authority fisheries harbours, which make a valuable contribution to Ireland's marine sector.  The capital allocation to the Marine Institute is being increased to &euro;10 million to cover the cost of its ongoing research programme as well as upgrading its research vessels.  Capital funding to Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be increased to &euro;6.5 million to assist in the implementation of the revised Common Fisheries Policy.  In other words, we have deliberately increased funding to the marine and fisheries sectors to ensure we can bring about the necessary changes required under the Common Fisheries Policy, which are all positive sustainable changes to fishing but which will require some capital investment from fishermen.  We will need to help them in the transition and we will certainly do that through BIM in particular.</p><p> I have also continued to provide capital funds in support of on-farm modernisation.  Specifically, in 2014 I have provided for the investment requirement needs to support the dairy sector through its expansion plans ahead of the removal of milk quotas in 2015.  The ending of milk quotas provides the best opportunity for dairy farmers to increase output volumes rapidly and enhance the earning potential of the sector.  As the final year ahead of the quota abolition progresses, I expect to see an increasing level of investment in farm infrastructure in line with the investments already commenced at processing level, which are significant, amounting to &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million.</p><p> I am committed to the continuation of an active programme of reducing the cost of running my Department.  Costs have fallen by some &euro;88 million since 2008 from &euro;304 million to &euro;216 million, a reduction of 29%.  Considerable reform efforts have taken place in recent years.  The Department's staffing level has fallen by some 1,600 since 2005, in other words, from 4,800 staff to 3,200, a reduction of one third.  Since 2010 there has been a 22% reduction in the staff of the non-commercial State bodies, down to 1,463 from 1,865 at the beginning of 2010.  The total Department spend on these agencies has fallen from &euro;247 million in 2008 to an estimated &euro;189 million this year, a reduction of 24%.  The cost of running my Department and the State agencies will be some &euro;8.5 million less in 2014.  I intend to continue to drive a change management programme throughout the Department and its agencies while ensuring the proper resourcing of front-line services, particularly those directly responsible for food safety, animal welfare and programme delivery.</p><p> All in all, I believe the funding provided to the Department for 2014 demonstrates the Government's commitment to the agriculture and marine sectors.  It recognises the potential of future growth and employment in the sectors and their important role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  I am determined to build on the progress achieved in recent years in developing the agrifood sector and, in particular, to contribute further to the future growth and prosperity the sector can achieve for Ireland, primarily expanding its revenue base through growth in export earnings.</p><p> Following the rural development programme, RDP, funding announced last night, I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  He was very much a part of the conversation and the decision.  We had a good negotiating process and, as a Minister, he understands well the importance of the sector.  His support for the funding announced last week for the RDP for the next seven years is significant and I thank him for that.</p></speech>

Let us consider programme A.  The Minister remarked that the costs of running his Department would be down by &euro;8.5 million overall.  I propose that we go through administration, programme A covering all sectors.  This will be a general examination.  Members may wish to make a comments now and I will call them in the normal way.  Deputy Pringle is first.  You may wish to make a general point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100004#K00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and introduction to today's meeting.  I am somewhat disappointed that we do not have any outturn figures for 2013.  They would be most useful in terms of examining the Estimate for 2014.  We are simply comparing the 2013 Estimate with the 2014 Estimate.  We are not examining the actual outturns that took place during the year and that is somewhat disappointing.</p></speech>

Obviously, it would have been helpful if the committee members had them before the meeting but I am giving them out now.  There has been a change in the procedure for the Estimates.</p> <p>Out-turn figures are useful for comparisons.  Those are the figures.  We have nothing to hide.  We will try to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100005#L00200"><p>I thank the Minister for circulating the figures at this stage.  For future reference it would be useful to have them when we get the initial documentation because that makes comparing and interpreting the figures much easier.</p><p>  There is an increase of over &euro;3.7 million in the budget for office equipment and external IT service in the estimate for 2014.  That represents an increase of over &euro;6 million since 2012.  Why are there such significant increases year on year and will this be a trend?  There is an increase of &euro;554,000 for 2014 in the supplementary measures to protect the financial interests of the EU.  What do those costs entail?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100005#L00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive review and congratulate him and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on securing the funding that is very important for the sustainability of rural areas.  It is important now to know how the various schemes will be focused to achieve their objectives and to minimise administration costs.  Administration includes inspections.  The charter of rights of farmers is several years old.  Will it be reviewed and renewed?  I note that the Minister has to deal with a clearance account for the EU budgets and to ensure that a certain number of inspections are carried out but landing in on people and expecting them to be ready causes significant angst.  It is important to take cognisance of the fact that people have to work on farms.  Appropriate procedures in respect of the charter should be implemented and reviewed.</p><p>  The Minister spoke very cogently and clearly about saving money.  It is important to save every cent that we can on administration and give it to the areas where it is needed at ground level.  That is why I am disappointed by the threatened industrial action at Portlaoise.  It would be remiss of me not to avail of this opportunity to raise this issue.  The action started yesterday with technical staff reporting in the traditional way and refusing to co-operate with proposed transfers of staff within the grade.  Initially it will be mild and will cause administrative inconvenience to management without impacting on farmers and the agricultural and food industries.  It has, however, been indicated that if there is no resolution to this dispute it will escalate to include action that will delay grant payments to farmers and disrupt the processing and export of cattle and other agricultural products.  This could happen in late February or early March.</p><p>  I would like to see every effort made to use the normal industrial relations channels to put a stop to this threatened industrial action.  There are 600 agricultural staff where a few years ago there were 1,200.  Nowhere has there been greater co-operation.  There has been a rationalisation from 58 officers to 16, and redeployment of 400 staff.  The Minister said that staff members had fallen at the Department.  One of the biggest cuts was the 18.6% among the technical staff who cooperated fully with the rationalisation which resulted in tens of millions of euros saved.  Along with other public servants they have been subject to two pay cuts since 2009, as well as other changes in their working terms and conditions, applicable under the Haddington Road agreement, which we all saluted as being extremely important.  Why did the Department not intervene?</p><p>  The root cause of this dispute is well known.  The management in the Department appears to be refusing to implement official policy, which denies these agricultural officers an opportunity to compete for posts at a time when their traditional role is being diminished.  Management persists in allocating inspections to more costly staff.  That costs everybody money.  We are taxpayers, like the farming community and everybody else.  I am confused.  There was a policy on cross-stream promotion and redeployment which was always agreed.  Why under the Haddington Road agreement have those people not been allowed to participate in competing for those opportunities?  Every other Department has implemented the new approach.  Why is this policy being blatantly ignored and excluding agricultural officers from competition for assistant principal posts?  If there are savings involved in the administration we are entitled to ensure that takes place.  Why is that happening?  Why was it allowed to reach this impasse?  When will it be resolved?  Are there not significant savings to be achieved by following Government policy?  This is not a new policy.  I would appreciate a reply to those questions.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister and his officials on securing a vital investment for rural Ireland in last week's rural development programme announcement and the overall package of measures which puts agriculture on a firm footing and gives everybody involved a great opportunity to drive on into the future, to meet the targets for Food Harvest 2020 and continue to grow our food and drink exports.</p><p>  On programme A ----&ndash;</p></speech>

I presume it is to do with the new CAP schemes.  It is quite a high figure each year.  While there are reductions, what is the balancing figure of pensions on total salaries, wages and allowances?</p> <p>While it might look good that the Department is more efficient as a result of the large number of staff retirements, would it be better to be pay people a bit more and have their services rather than have them sitting at home?</p><p> I refer to the expenditure on office premises expenses which seems to have remained stable even though quite a few local offices have been closed down.  One would expect that the closure of offices would be reflected in this figure.</p></speech>

It is a very important development for rural Ireland which has been struggling in recent years.  This expenditure will be an important stimulus which it is hoped will be beneficial for both rural and urban Ireland.</p><p>  Deputy Heydon referred to the figure for consultancy costs.  A once-off figure of &euro;1.3 million is set aside for expenses related to the EU Presidency last year.  Were consultancy services required to assist with the Irish Presidency role?</p></speech>

One of the great features of Irish public administration is that we tend to do both simultaneously in that people retire with a lump sum and they are brought back and paid again.  I refer to the case of Irish Water as a great example and also the teaching profession, although the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Quinn, has been trying to combat that practice.  How many consultants were previously departmental staff?  The Minister may not have that information to hand.  Are many such people employed in various capacities by the Department, such as the consultants to whom the Minister referred?  This seems to be a feature of Irish public administration which is not confined to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100006#M01800"><p>I will begin with Deputy McNamara's question.  The Department has a policy of tendering for consultancy services.  For example, consultancy services for the horse racing industry was won by Indecon.  There is no arrangement for retired staff to be hired as consultants.  One exception was made for good reason because the Department needed that individual's expertise.  For example, retired departmental veterinary staff are not hired as consultants.</p><p>  On the question about IT costs, the increased Estimate for expenditure on IT is related to the implementation of the new CAP and CFP, Common Fisheries Policy.  The Department will need to redesign its IT systems to fit the new policy direction.  A new scheme will be needed for the new GLAS environmental programme.  The new IT system will need to be in place this year to allow for the introduction of the new CAP policy in 2015.  The Department manages its own IT services as opposed to hiring outside services.  For example, Revenue uses an external consultancy to run its online service.  My Department has an internal IT section which requires staff who can write code and design new systems.  This work will need to be done this year and this is the reason IT costs will be higher than last year.  The expenditure will be used to implement a system to manage the implementation of a new CAP and CFP.</p><p>  In reply to Deputy Penrose, negotiations on the charter for farmers' rights will commence this month.  We gave that commitment to farming representative bodies.  It is appropriate to discuss a new charter for farmers' rights at a time when a new CAP is being finalised.  We know the policy direction and how much money we need to spend.  We will discuss matters such as inspections and the implementation of regulations.</p><p>  The Department of which I am the political leader has shown a willingness to adopt to change and reform to an extent that is more impressive than any other Department, bar none.  We have an outstanding team of people who have accepted and embraced that significant change, such as a reduction in staff numbers, redeployment and office closures.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the attitude to reform shown by staff in my Department.  There is a difference of opinion on a particular issue between IMPACT - which represents technical staff - and management with regard to a competition for promotion for assistant principal officer positions.  We have invited the workers involved to discussions tomorrow and this invitation has been accepted.  I am hopeful that any differences can be resolved tomorrow and so avoid any escalation of industrial action that would potentially affect services.  The management has an open mind with a view to resolving an issue.  I know the workers will also approach the discussion on that basis.  Nobody in the Department wants to be involved in industrial action.  The Department has provided a lot of good news stories with regard to public sector reform and delivery for our clients.  I am hopeful tomorrow's meeting will be an opportunity to end that industrial action before it becomes more serious.</p><p>  We have clarified the figures for consultancy services raised by Deputy Heydon.</p> <p>There is a reduction there from &euro;150,000 down to &euro;40,000.  Depending on the issues on which I need to obtain advice or in respect of which the Department needs an outside opinion, that consultancy figure can go up or down.  We are not budgeting for a significant sum this year.</p><p> Deputy Barry raised the issue of the pay bill coming down but the pensions bill possibly increasing.  It is general Government policy to seek to reduce the numbers in the public sector.  Those numbers rose steadily over a period time until we ended up with a public sector that was larger than it needed to be.  That growth was fuelled by overspending at a time when we could afford it.  Under this Government and towards the end of the last Government's term, there was a realisation that Ireland as a country could no longer afford a pay bill of that magnitude.  We have been successful in reducing numbers across the public sector, including in my Department.  In fact, my Department is ahead of its targets in this regard.  It was a whole-of-government decision to reduce numbers.  Clearly, there is a consequence of that in terms of pensions, but the net cost to the State is significantly down.  That is clear from the figures coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of the overall cost of salaries and pensions across the public sector.</p></speech>

My officials inform me that approximately 50% of this expenditure is for outside IT consultancy services and 50% for in-house work.  We recruit people on temporary contracts to, for example, write code.  They do not come cheaply but it is essential to take them on so that we can put in place systems that work.  We also need to bring in consultants from time to time to help us redesign systems in order to accommodate new policy frameworks.  Breaking down the figure for expenditure on IT services, it is approximately 50:50 in terms of in-house versus external consultancy.</p></speech>

We are responsible for distributing &euro;1.2 billion in direct payments and an additional &euro;405 million this year under the rural development programme.

We are putting a system in place that will ensure the correct distribution of approximately &euro;12.5 billion over the next seven years.  In that context, an investment of &euro;10 million in ensuring we have effective systems is reasonable.  If our system is not dependable, we will be subject to fines from the EU and all types of problems will arise in terms of the farmers' charter.</p></speech>

Ireland is receiving fewer disallowances than any other country within the EU because we have IT systems that work.  Other countries have IT systems that have let them down.  We are spending when we need to spend to make sure we maintain an IT structure that functions as it should for the distribution of huge sums of money to 130,000 farmers.  We are trying to keep costs down as best we can, but we will invest when we need to, such as in the case of the new mapping system and a new IT system for the new CAP and CFP.  If that is not done, we would have to outsource the job, which would be more expensive and would mean having far less control if something goes wrong.  Looking at the countries that have outsourced their IT systems, there are significant difficulties, in many cases, when things go wrong, because they are essentially stuck with the one provider.  We have made a policy decision to have an in-house capacity in terms of IT management and delivery, but we have to bring in outsiders to upskill that team and help to rewrite code and redesign systems when such is needed.  That is what is covered under this particular expenditure.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100008#O00200"><p>I will focus on the macro rather than the micro.  How can the Minister justify reductions of 17% in respect of disadvantaged areas, 30% in respect of animal health, 53% in respect of the REPS - a reduction over three years - and only 9% and 7%, respectively, in respect of the administrative budget and non-commercial State bodies?  It seems that farmers are being hit, while the bureaucracy is being saved.  What is being done in this regard is completely unacceptable.  We know that the use of technology means that much of what needs to be done manually from an administrative point of view can be reduced.</p><p>  The second issue to which I wish to refer relates to those who were responsible for writing the code for the maps issued by the Department and its claim to the effect that certain people over-claimed in respect of their lands.  One would need a microscope to see the X01, X02 and X03 designations on the maps to which I refer.  Many farmers are elderly and either cannot understand what is involved or cannot see the X designations on maps.  I have looked at many such maps in recent months and trying to find an X on one is similar to playing a child's game.  It is also difficult to establish whether a designation is X01 or X03.  If the Department had done what I am about to suggest, it would have saved itself a great deal of trouble.  When it wrote farmers, why was it not in a position to indicate the estimated over-claims made - according to its computer files - and the penalties that would arise in 2013 as a consequence?  Many farmers receive letters which only indicate the plots of land that the Department is disputing.  They do not understand they are obliged to revisit their figures, carry out a new calculation in respect of the eligible area and discover whether it is over or under 3% or over or under 20%.  If it is greater than 3%, one multiplies the figure for the lost land by three.  If it is greater than 20%, one is out the gate and cannot claim.</p><p>  In the light of all of the computer technology used and all of the money spent, it is amazing that the information the Department has in its possession cannot be provided for farmers in an accessible and understandable form.  If a farmer knows he or she is going to lose &euro;100 in a year, he or she might not bother to pursue the issue.  The Department might state 60% of an area of his or her property is scrubland, whereas he or she might state it is 40%.  In addition, it might be stated it is 30% or 80% rock.</p></speech>

If there is a small penalty involved, most farmers in the interests of avoiding hassle might leave well enough alone.  However, they do not know what the penalty will be, unless they ask someone to carry out the calculation for them.  Is the Minister in a position to assure us that there will be no retrospection in what he refers to as mapping errors, particularly in view of the fact that the digitised maps currently being used are based on previous versions produced by his Department?  Will he confirm that penalties will not be imposed for the years prior to 2013, unless people were purposely trying to cheat the system?</p></speech>

I have given credit where it is due in the context of correct decisions made by the previous Administration.</p><p>  There was a requirement to reduce the cost of administration across government.  That requirement was forced on both the previous Administration and the current one.  I would like to believe the reductions relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were achieved in a way which did not undermine services to farmers.  To be clear, the idea that one can simplify all of this and try to make a political point by stating we are cutting REPS payments by more than we are cutting administration costs is a non-runner.  We can only do what we are allowed to do under agreements - the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements - that were signed up to by the previous and current Government.  One cannot just lay people off or reduce their salaries without agreement being reached on such actions.  We have reduced staffing levels dramatically - by one third, to be precise - since 2009.  Like all other public servants throughout the country, those in my Department have been obliged to accept reductions in their salaries.  The idea that we could somehow start to slash both salaries and numbers in one Department and ignore the rules of engagement negotiated is nonsense, as I think the Deputy knows.</p><p>  The issues relating to mapping have nothing to do with the writing of code or anything of that nature.  The actual accuracy of maps has changed.  Last summer we were required to introduce a new mapping system by the European Commission.  We now rely on satellite imagery rather than images taken by high flying aircraft.  Mapping systems are much more accurate than they have ever been and it is now much easier to identify land that is eligible and that which is not.  Whether we like it, we must deal with the reality whereby land which attracted funding in the past, even as recently as last year, should not have attracted it.  We addressed this matter last year in the context of more accurate mapping.  We have put an appeals committee in place which involves staff from within the Department and external to it and which is chaired by Mr. Padraig Gibbons who was a popular choice among farmers.  We will ensure farmers receive fair treatment.  We are aware that 93% have no issue above the figure of 3%.  In other words, a relatively minor over-claim took place and the figure for retrospection to 2009 will also be relatively minor because less than 3% of farmers' land is involved.  The figure for the other 7% of farmers is slightly higher than this.</p><p>  Approximately 400 farmers throughout the country have a difficulty in respect of over-claims in excess of 20%.  We are going to try to deal with them on a case by case basis.  If it is possible to do so, we will reduce the figure below 20%.  We will work with farmers and net off parcels of land in respect of which they might have slight over-claims or under-claims.  We will do everything possible to try to minimise the financial impact for farmers who, for whatever reason, over-claimed on land that was not eligible.</p> <p> The alternative to doing that - which is the approach some other countries have taken - is that the Commission will estimate the level overclaim, then multiply that figure significantly and apply a disallowance or a fine to the tune of approximately &euro;160 million.  That is the figure I have.  Either we can try to solve this problem by accurately assessing what land was not eligible and in respect of which there was therefore an overclaim which must be repaid and we keep the repayments to a minimum by using such accuracy, which is what we are trying to do, or the Commission will do the job for us and it will be a much more significant figure that every farmer will have to pay because that disallowance will have to come out of the agricultural budget.  That is the position and I believe the Deputy knows that.  We have had this discussion in the D&aacute;il.  We must, whether we like it or not, deal with retrospective overclaims for the past four years, and we will do that.  For most farmers, this is a relatively small sum of money.  For farmers who have less than 3% of an issue, the average retrospection repayment is approximately &euro;400 out of a figure of approximately &euro;11,000 in terms of an annual payment.</p></speech>

It is a relatively small figure.  The average overclaim in that category is only about 1% and it is a repayment.  For some farmers, we took that retrospective payment last year to try to ensure that they would not have a problem.  Anybody who thinks that to be popular we can simply tell the Commission we are not paying any retrospective payments, I can advise them that what will happen to Ireland will be what has happened to other countries-----</p></speech>

That is crazy when we have the technical capacity to be able to do this much more accurately.

We are working with the farming organisations to try to do that as accurately as we can.  I appeal to people not to hype up this issue unnecessarily because we have to deal with it and we are dealing with it in as accurate a way as we can.

Many of them claimed they are losing between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000 as a consequence of this.  That might be the accumulated figure or the yearly figure, I am not sure but I will work on the basis of the accumulated figure.  Most of these people are low income farmers and are totally dependent on this income.  Many of those to whom I spoke after the meeting stated categorically that the claims they submitted were claims that were agreed with the Department.  They did nothing wrong in their eyes.  They were claims the Department approved in terms of what they were claiming for and they now find they are being penalised for overclaiming and retrospective payments are being taken from them. The consequences of this affects not only the applicant-recipient but the wider community.  I have attended many meetings over the years and the farmers at this meeting were very angry.  They were angry with the Minister, the Department, local representatives and the leadership of the farming organisations.  The problem with this is the retrospective aspect of it.  The farmers firmly believe that they did nothing wrong, the Department was well aware of the position from their previous maps and so forth.  These digital maps were approved by the Department and now they find themselves in this position.  Is there any flexibility the Minister can exercise to alleviate this problem?  I do not see how they can be penalised if they were compliant.  I understand that the non-compliance comes as a result satellite readings but  pre-satellite readings they were complaint.</p></speech>

It is the legal responsibility of farmers to ensure that they are making their applications on the basis of eligible land.  We have a more accurate set of photographs now in terms assessing land and we are required, as every is every other member state of the European Union, to make an estimate as to whether there were overclaims and, if so, to return that money.  This is public money which is being given to farmers for producing food sustainably and all the other things that are covered by the Common Agricultural Policy.  If public money is being given to a farmer on the basis of drawing down money on eligible land, and if some of that land is not eligible, then that public money has to be given back.</p></speech>

The farmer determines what is eligible.  He or she has a responsibility to do that and the Department then checks the eligibility by inspection.  If there has been a physical inspection on a farm and the claim has been approved on the basis of the inspection by the Department there will not be any retrospective claims on the land.  If there is a dispute as to eligibility there are two appeals processes in place.  That is why, where appropriate, we will go out and walk the land as well as talk about the imagery that exists, to try to get as accurate an assessment as possible.  We cannot have a situation whereby farmers say they got a payment on the land in the past because nobody said it was ineligible and therefore they should not have to give back the money.</p></speech>

This is a very difficult issue.  I accept many farmers feel very angry and hard-done by in terms of the issue but in the position I am in I only have two alternatives.  Either we deal with this as a country through my Department and an appeals process working with farmers on a case-by-case basis to try to get an accurate assessment of what is eligible and what is not, and repay the money that was drawn down on land that was not eligible.  Failing that the Commission, which is coming in February to assess the process, will determine a figure of over-claim and it will multiply the figure substantially and apply a fine to this country, just like it has done in France, Italy and the United Kingdom, for very substantial amounts of money.  Every farmer will suffer as a result of that.  We are trying to address a difficult situation.  Simply putting our head in the sand and ignoring it is not an option, nor is it an option to say we will not make retrospective payments because we do not want to do that.  We must deal with the retrospection issue and we will try to deal with it as fairly as we can with farmers.  Nobody will pay back a cent more than they have to in terms of claiming a payment on land that is not eligible.  We will work with farmers on that but, unfortunately, I cannot simply ignore what I am required to do by the European Commission.  If I do, the alternative is a much bigger financial loss for farming, collectively.</p></speech>

There is an estimate for legal costs under subhead A10(7) of &euro;3.3 million.  The figure in the 2013 Estimate was &euro;3.35 million but the outturn was &euro;685,000.  When we questioned this in July we were told it was prudent to include &euro;3.3 million for 2013 but we see the outturn is &euro;685,000.  We are back again this year with another &euro;3.3 million.  I believe that is an over-estimate and it might be overly prudent.  In 2013 we were dealing with a &euro;5 million reduction in the disadvantaged area payment but when we consider the outturn for 2013, and I did a rough calculation on the figures the Minister gave us, there was an underspend of approximately &euro;19 million under the different programme headings, which would have offset the &euro;5 million reduction in the disadvantaged area payment last year if we were not being so prudent in terms of the figures.  Has an overly cautious approach been taken in regard to some of the figures before us?  It may not be significant this year because no scheme has seen a reduction but it is something I would like to tease out with the Minister.</p><p>  Regarding subhead A10(11), which is the commercialisation of State agencies, there is an Estimate of &euro;150,000.  I accept that is a small amount but there is a new line in that regard and I wonder what is the intention into the future in terms of the meaning of the commercialisation of State agencies.</p></speech>

What is the difference between research and training and A5, which is Teagasc grant-in-aid?  Does research and training come under Teagasc also or is it separate?  In terms of the slight reduction for Teagasc, is the Minister happy that Teagasc will be able to continue to provide the vital services it provides?</p><p>  I welcome the beef genomics scheme.  I missed Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's outline of the detail of it in his opening statement but it is to be welcomed that we would look to protect our beef sector at a time of massive dairy growth.</p><p>  I acknowledge that this Government has continually sought to maintain the Horse and Greyhound Fund, with a very small reduction.  I accept that every area has to take a small cut but we tried to maintain the Horse and Greyhound Fund as best we could in light of the fact that previously it was cut to the bone.  It must be recorded that the horse and greyhound industry cannot continue in the long term with this level of funding.  I spoke on the Betting (Amendment) Bill last week.  We need to move to more sustained, self-sufficient funding but for now, in the position we are in with annual budgets, it is the best we can hope for the industry.</p></speech>

The Minister has outlined that this will be the Vote in 2014.</p><p>  I, too, welcome the beef genomics scheme.  I come from a traditional beef fattening county.  Suckler cow herds are the genesis of our beef industry and that sector has suffered.  The Minister indicated yesterday that there will be &euro;80 per calf.  A total of &euro;23 million is provided.  How will he make that up to ensure we secure the &euro;80 per calf?  It is a great step forward to allow us penetrate the lucrative markets still available.  There is a lot to be done regarding our level of penetration across the eurozone in terms of the big, high quality beef markets but this measure will give us the impetus to achieve the full-scale penetration we deserve for a quality beef product and our traceability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014012100011#R00600"><p>On the beef genomics scheme, I outlined earlier how that will work but essentially, any farmer with suckler cows who is also participating in the beef data programme, which is currently approximately 34,000 farmers, will be eligible to join the beef genomics scheme.  The beef data programme will be opened to new participants as well in 2014.  The farmer will receive &euro;40 per calf under the beef genomics scheme.  When added to the &euro;20 per calf provided for on the beef data programme, that will mean &euro;60 per calf for the farmer involved in the two amalgamated schemes.  The farmer will be required to genotype about 15% of his or her cows by submitting samples to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  Farmers who own a stock bull will also have to have it genotyped.  The farmer will pay ICBF for the collection kit required for the animal selected for genotyping and for the cost of genotyping, estimated at &euro;30 per animal genotype.  Obviously, we will try to get down that cost down as much as we can.</p><p>  Farmers with BVD permanently infected calves will have to commit to disposing of those calves.  Essentially, that is how it will work.  Only 15% of the animals will be required to be genotyped but the farmer will be paid the &euro;60 per calf on all of their animals.  In the new rural development programme, RDP, we are looking to increase that figure to &euro;80.  It will be the new beef genomic and data scheme in the new RDP, which essentially is what makes up the &euro;40 and &euro;20, the current &euro;60 per calf.  That will be increased to &euro;80 per calf to make sure we incentivise as many farmers as we can, and we are planning to make that payment on about 650,000 calves in the suckler herd.  We have budgeted for approximately &euro;53 million.</p><p>  To ensure people understand this, the idea behind this scheme is to try to help the suckler herd become more commercially viable and more profitable by building a national database that matches an animal's DNA with its likely performance.  In other words, if a farmer is sending in performance data on his or her animals around ease of calving, confirmation and so on, and they have also data on that animal in terms of its genotype, its DNA, we will then be able to make much more accurate predictions as to how calves are likely to perform based on their DNA.  We will also be able to give farmers much more accurate information in terms of breeding programmes and the kind of bull they should be using depending on the genotype of the animals they are breeding.  This is about applying technology to improve our breeding programmes and to have a national database that can inform farmers to make decisions that will help them become more profitable in the marketplace.  </p><p>  While we need to give some income support in terms of the suckler farmer in Ireland, we are doing that while incentivising a change in behaviour that will help this sector in its entirety become more efficient and more profitable.  That is the idea.  When we add that to sexed semen technology and genomics technology, and no other country in the world is attempting to do this, we are in a position to get a much better understating and to provide more information that can allow farmers make more informed decisions in terms of their breeding programmes and the performance of their herds.</p><p>  We always have to be cautious in regard to legal costs.  People take us to court all the time.  As the Deputy knows from the fishing industry, people challenge decisions we make all the time, therefore, we have to have enough money in the kitty in case we get a major legal challenge that we have to deal with in the year.  We do not spend the money if we do not have to, which is the reason the outturn in terms of legal costs is much less than was anticipated, but we move budget lines from one line to another line if we can see that we will be underspent in the year.  We can give the Deputy some detail on the overall underspend later if he wishes so that people can understand where the underspend was but there will always be some level of underspend in a Department.</p> <p>Otherwise, one is flirting with over-expenditure, which the Department of Finance certainly does not tolerate easily.  On the commercialisation of State bodies, the note I have to hand indicates it is to help State bodies to develop a more commercial approach and is matched by funding from Enterprise Ireland.  I may need to send a more detailed note to the Deputy in this regard.  The Department has a number of ways of doing this such as, for example, carrying out lean reviews, to examine the management performance within certain agencies linked to the Department to ascertain whether it is possible to drive greater efficiencies, get better value for money and so on.  However, there is a separate funding line for the lean review process.  My understanding is this is a fund to help the Department's non-commercial State bodies to develop a more commercial approach, which also involves Enterprise Ireland.  However, I must send on further information on it to the Deputy because that is as much as I know.</p><p> In response to Deputy Hayden, not all research and training takes place under the auspices of Teagasc.  The Department supports Teagasc with a significant budget each year and as the Deputy is aware, it has multiple roles, namely, education, research and development and consultancy for farming.  Teagasc has these three areas of responsibility, all of which must be funded.  In recent years, the major drive has been in respect of research and development, as well as trying to provide for an increasing educational need in agricultural colleges.  For example, the Department sanctioned increased staff numbers to try to staff the agricultural colleges as numbers and demand for those courses have increased dramatically in recent years.  Entirely separate to this, however, the Department has a competition for research and development funding in respect of food and forestry and it is a significant funding stream that supports research and development programmes across multiple universities in Ireland, as well as some research in Northern Ireland.  They are two different funding financing mechanisms in respect of research and development with regard to agrifood and the food industry in general.  I welcome the Deputy's comments on the horse and greyhound fund.  I also seek a more sustainable model in that regard and the Department is working towards this through new legislation, which will be published shortly.</p><p> Deputy Penrose has left the meeting but in respect of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, the Department has deliberately increased that board's resources this year.  We are at the beginning of an implementation process for the Common Fisheries Policy review, which will involve a lot of gear change for fishermen.  We also are in the middle of a safety initiative for fishermen to try to make it a less tragic industry and, consequently, I considered that BIM needed increased resources to do both those things.  I believe that to be the right decision and obviously, it only will spend money when it can get good value for money from it.  I believe that covers everything.</p></speech>

To return to Teagasc and the area of education in particular, I refer to the incentives that were introduced last week in the context of the recent CAP allocation.  Obviously there will be greater incentives for young farmers to return to the farming cycle, which, while not popular a number of years ago, is now popular.  Farmers who had off-farm jobs will find it difficult to return to education to qualify for these schemes.  Is the provision of additional schemes under consideration to enable such farmers to qualify for future funding in respect of the top-ups and the 60% grant aid support that has been mentioned?  To an extent, restrictions are in place on some schemes right across the education system at present and with the available funding, will such restrictions be maintained?  Alternatively, is there a possibility of putting in place other educational courses for young farmers returning to the system?</p></speech>

It went to the Congo and was sanctioned in December.  I assure the Chairman it is money that is being well spent.  However, that contribution, which is part of the overall calculation in respect of the Government's commitment to the development aid budget, is not money that would have been spent elsewhere.  Nevertheless, I consider it to have been worthwhile expenditure.</p><p>  As for some of the other questions, on education and the new young farmers schemes that will be rolled out in the new rural development programme, RDP, farmers will be obliged to show they have an appropriate qualification.  One cannot have a situation in which families decide to hand over the farm to a son or daughter simply to get a 25% top-up on their single farm payment if that son or daughter is not actually farming.  In other words, there is a no-change scenario with the running of that farm but people simply try to reapply in a son or daughter's name to get the top-up payments.  This is not acceptable and, consequently, a young farmer would be obliged to show he or she has come into farming within the past three years.  Obviously, such farmers must be under the age of 40 and will get a young farmers top-up payment for five years, while under the age of 40, as part of Pillar 1.  Likewise, under Pillar 2 preferential treatment essentially will be given in respect of grant aid.  If they are investing in their farms, they will receive a 60% grant support for the total cost of a project, rather than the 40% grant aid support that applies to everyone else.  However, for those positive supports for young farmers, there will be a requirement and an obligation on that young farmer to show he or she has a suitable qualification, such as, for example a green certificate.  They will be obliged to get this either on a temporary course through evening classes or whatever or will be obliged to attend an agricultural college to get it.  I consider this to be appropriate.</p><p>  The agricultural colleges unquestionably are under some pressure.  It is amazing that a decade ago, people were talking about the need to close agricultural colleges and we now are struggling to provide enough places and to have enough staff.  However, the Department will continue to support Teagasc in respect of the resources it needs to provide that education.  I can provide the Deputy with a note, if he wishes, with regard to Teagasc training programmes but the figures are available for him to seek.</p><p>  On the beef genomics, essentially this is a policy approach.  I do not think it possible to patent DNA testing, which is essentially what this does.  However, if a genuinely unique management system is developed that can be patented, perhaps that should be considered.  Essentially, this programme is about gathering data on to a central database and comparing accurately DNA samples with the performance of animals in order to be able to make accurate predictions into the future.  This type of centralised database approach will provide farmers with really useful information for their future breeding programmes.  It will be managed by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which currently manages the national database for the beef herd anyway.  It will involve building a couple of new layers onto its central database system.</p> <p>If there is anything to be patented that we could export for a financial return in the future, we will certainly look at that.</p></speech>

That revenue goes into the Department of Finance and does not get allocated automatically to my Department.  We still must make decisions on the Horse and Greyhound Fund which are consistent with our overall expenditure ceiling and budget.  If there is a good income stream coming into the Exchequer general from betting revenue which is dominated by the horse and greyhound sectors, it helps me make a case for the Horse and Greyhound Fund.</p><p>  I can send the exact figures to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

We need to get that system up and running.  Many countries have looked at how to do this and have not been very successful.</p><p>  Once we have a system up and running at 1%, then we need to have a debate on increasing the rate.  My views on this would be well known.  I certainly would have no difficulty in increasing the rate in an effort to get an increased revenue stream but, more importantly, we need to get a system up and running that does not allow any online bet taking to escape the levy.</p></speech>

The use of technology makes much sense.  Must the data be provided for all of the calves even though 1.5 in ten will be sampled?</p><p>  The Minister stated he hoped to reach 600,000 calves; presumably, he meant 15% of them.  There are many more calves than that in the country.  There was a suckler  cow welfare scheme.  It did not involve this genotyping, but it was improving the quality of animals quite considerably by better husbandry and better practices, without bothering about the DNA element.  Will there be any incentive for the other half of the country, which comprise the smaller farmers, to continue to improve husbandry?  It was well accepted that the suckler cow welfare scheme, while not the deluxe scheme that those involved in genomics will be doing, without changing the DNA, was improving the quality of calf produced in the market and was informing farmers.  I wonder will there be an equal measure for the non-genomic farmers, who in the main are the smaller operators who produce half of the calves of the country, to encourage them to improve the way they farm and to support a vulnerable sector, that is, the suckler cow sector, which is in decline.</p></speech>

There are two matters being confused here.  There is the 2014 payment for the beef suckler herd, part of which requires a farmer to take a DNA sample from 15% of the herd and to provide information on his or her herd.  That is a separate scheme to the one on which we are building for the rural development programme, RDP.  We have not yet decided in terms of the beef genomics and data scheme within the RDP whether a farmer will be required to take samples from 15% or all of his or her herd.  That is a decision that we will finalise during the consultation process on improving that scheme and it is something on which I would encourage the committee to make suggestions and recommendations.  We are increasing the payment for farmers and the requirements of farmers can also be increased in terms of the beef genomics scheme.  We want to get as much data as we can and as many DNA samples as we can from the herd.  It is important not to confuse the beef genomics and data scheme which will be in the new RDP starting in 2015 with our current commitment to the genomics scheme for 2014.  One builds on the other but they are two different requirements and it is important to clarify that.</p></speech>

That was announced in Union Hall.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, held a joint launch to announce a grant-aid scheme for personal location devices, emergency position indicating radiobeacons, EPERB, from boats which, when they hit the water, float and send off a distress signal, and a number of other matters.  One will see the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport introducing requirements on safety in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>  We also introduced new training programmes for fishermen.  In order to qualify for the grant aid for the equipment, they will have to do a certain amount of safety training.  They will have to upskill within a certain period of time.  It is not an overly onerous time commitment that they must make but they must do it.  We also have a committee representing stakeholders in the sector which will report to me and has finalised work on new recommendations on marine safety for the fishing sector.</p><p>  There are too many fishermen dying tragically in Irish waters and we are trying to find a way of reducing those numbers.  Part of that will involve grant aid, part will involve training and part of it may involve new regulations, if such are needed.</p> <p>Just as the safety culture must be improved in agriculture, we have work to do in the fishing industry.  However, in terms of EPIRBs and personal location devices, the technology is now available for fishermen and it is grant-aided.</p></speech>

Quite a number of farmers chose not to be involved in the scheme.  We are catering for the number who decided to apply for the scheme and a few more, but there will be farmers who will choose not to be part of the new beef genomic scheme.  I do not know why, but that is their choice.  They may not want the hassle, for example.  Some of them may be part-time.  However, this is not about big and small farmers.  There is no reason farmers with small suckler herds cannot be part of the scheme if they want to be.  It is not a case either of west versus east or north versus south.  Nobody is excluded if he or sh e wants to be part of the scheme.  The idea that we have to provide something else for those who do not qualify or those who are not part of the beef genomic scheme does not arise.  Any suckler farmer who does not want to be part of it is choosing not to be, just like the farmers who chose not to be part of the suckler cow welfare scheme.  We cannot pay those farmers if they are not doing anything to draw down a payment.  If we did, we would be introducing some kind of coupled payment and we are not doing so.</p></speech>

No scheme ever rolled out has attracted 100% participation, not even the old headage payments scheme which was quite simple.

What was the explanation for this?  Given that the control of horses will comprise an ongoing problem, should the Minister not have included a higher figure for 2014?</p><p>  With regard to sbuhead B.3.20 &ndash; Other &ndash; the outturn for 2013 was &euro;2.3 million, whereas the Estimate figure was &euro;300,000.

With regard to compensation and related costs, there is a very welcome and significant reduction in line with the reduced incidence of positive cases.  What is the Minister's outlook on BSE testing?

This is an ongoing issue.  A substantial problem relating to horses arose in my part of the country during the Christmas period.  Has the Minister plans to move the issue forward?  There is a stalemate currently.  There was a reduction in the number of horses slaughtered last year.  Fortunately, it has been a good winter up to now but if the weather deteriorates, this will become a serious issue  Has provision been made for that scenario if it arises?</p><p>  Subheads B3.12 relates to the fallen animal scheme.  A farmer who has an animal to dispose of must pay a substantial amount to the knackery?  Does he pay the entire cost or does the Department pay a proportion of the cost of the disposal?</p><p>  Must animals that are injured on farms, for example, those that suffer a leg break be disposed of in certain places or can be disposed of anywhere without going to the knackery?</p></speech>

I raised this in the D&aacute;il when they were implemented in December.</p><p>  With regard to the control of horses, I do not question the Minister's Estimate but one of the problems is a great deal of work is being devolved to local authorities but they are not being given adequate resources.  If he scrounges money from other subheads, could he please increase the funding for the control of horses that is given to local authorities?  They are experiencing straitened financial capacity to deal with the problem, which was rightly alluded to by Deputy Deering.</p></speech>

The outturn last year doubled in comparison to the original provision and everybody is anxious about this.</p></speech>

There has been more done on horse welfare over the past 12 months than over the past 12 years.  The process had commenced prior to the horse meat crisis to improve the regulations and data relating to horses such as who owns them, their location, the premises they are on and the process by which some enter the human food chain, which needs to be checked and examined and so on.  We now have a centralised database and passport issuing organisations, of which they are seven, must agree to supply information to the database before they can issue a passport for a horse.  We, therefore, have a handle for the first time on the number of horses in Ireland, where they are, who owns them and so on.  It is illegal to own a horse that does not have a microchip and a passport.  This is not a option.  One cannot have one's horse slaughtered for human consumption unless in its first six months or before the end of its first calendar year it has been microchipped and issued with a passport because we cannot trace the veterinary drugs and so on that it has consumed.  Phenylbutazone is one example but there are others.  Under EU regulations, no horse can enter the human food chain unless it has a passport and has been microchipped in its first six months of life.</p><p>  Many farmers have asked why I do not introduce a system to test horses before they go into factories to check if there are traces of bute and so on in their blood.  That is not acceptable.  EU regulations are clear on this and they are in place to protect the integrity of the human food chain.  Last year, approximately 10,500 horses were slaughtered in Ireland for human consumption compared to 24,000 in 2012.  People think there has been a dramatic reduction on previous years but while there was a dramatic reduction on the previous year, 10,500 is the third highest number of horses slaughtered ever in the State.  There was a glut of horses that were not wanted in our system.  One of the problems associated with a recession is people cannot afford to keep horses and many of them sought to dispose of them.  If they can be sold for human consumption, the owners will be paid between &euro;400 and &euro;600, otherwise they have to pay to have them humanely disposed of, rendered and so on.  That is why they want to sell horses to factories.</p><p>  Last year, we tightened up dramatically on this issue.  There was evidence to suggest that some horses may have been going to factories to be slaughtered on the back of false passports.  That is no longer possible.  My Department supervise every slaughtering facility.  Up until this time last year, some of them were supervised by local authorities but that is no longer the case.  Now that we have a centralised database, the information regarding passports is much more accurate.  If a person owns a horse in this State, he or she must have a passport and a microchip for the animal and he or she must register his or her equine premises otherwise he or she is keeping an animal in breach of the regulations.  If the horse is at risk of welfare abuse, we will confiscate it.  Last year, with the co-operation of the Garda and local authorities, we confiscated approximately 4,500 animals because we felt their welfare may have been compromised.  We will not give the animals back to their owners unless they can demonstrate they have appropriate identification for them and they have an equine registered premises.</p><p>  We are changing attitudes regarding how horse owners need to behave.  We will enforce the law and we will take prosecutions against those who abuse horses.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act to which many of the members contributed addresses this.   We have made dramatic strides in horse welfare.  Some people would like me to introduce a mass cull of horses that are valueless and for which there is no market as a welfare initiative.  We have a plan that could work to facilitate such an approach but it is not the right approach because many of the welfare compromised horses would not be handed over in that scenario.  People who have horses out the back that they no longer want or do not want to feed and do not have a market for expect the Minister to take the horses off their hands.  I am sorry but I will not do that.  I will spend public money to protect the welfare of animals; I will not spend it to help the income of people who have horses and who want grant aid to get rid of them because they cannot sell them.  We take seriously the responsibility that goes with horse ownership and people need to understand that.  I will happily give members who want a detailed outline of what the Department has done on horse welfare and protecting the integrity of the food chain in the context of horse slaughtering because we have spent a great deal of time on it and we will continue to focus on the issue.</p><p>  We are getting value for money from local authorities, which is why I have not allocated as much money as last year for the confiscation of horses but if I need to increase that figure this year, I will.</p> <p>We will continue to take a proactive approach to horse welfare.  We will make examples of people if they are knowingly abusing their animals.  If anyone has a horse they cannot afford to keep, they can use the freefone number for my Department and we will intervene to ensure the animal&rsquo;s welfare is looked after.  We will spend public moneys to do that.  We increased the figure last year by &euro;1.5 million on top of the Estimate.  We are working with local authorities and the Garda, which has been helpful in some cases.</p><p> We are trying to consolidate and tidy up the dairy science Vote.  It is our view that the dairy science allocation is more appropriate to subhead B13.21 rather than being covered in the administrative budget.</p><p> There has been a steady and substantial decline in TB while brucellosis has virtually been wiped out, both good news stories for Ireland.  TB is down from 29,900 instances in 2008 to 15,000 in 2013.  That is a dramatic reduction across our herd.  There is a saving that goes with that in the compensation we need to give to farmers for TB reactor numbers.  We have been so successful that the UK is now discussing the Irish approach towards TB reduction as the model to follow.  That is a signal that we have the right approach to TB, brucellosis and disease control generally.</p><p> The &euro;2 million figure relates to the spend on the fodder transport scheme.  It must be remembered that we had to supplement the cost of importing fodder into Ireland early in the year.</p><p> The supports for a fallen animal from the Department amount to &euro;30 for the animal collector and &euro;58 for the renderer.  The current subsidy rates, excluding VAT at 13.5%, per over 48-month bovines are &euro;30 for collection, paid to knackery/animal collectors and &euro;58 for rendering, paid to category 1 rendering plants.  The cost of collection to the farmer for such animals is capped at &euro;54.03, including VAT.</p></speech>

There is an endemic problem in urban areas.  I believe prevention would be much better than a cure.  What discussions has the Minister had with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, on the development of further horse projects in urban areas to divert people from keeping horses in inappropriate settings instead of spending millions of euro disposing of these horses?</p><p>  With extra moneys coming in from the betting tax, would the Minister, along with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government persuade the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set aside some of the yield to deal with the problem of abandoned horses in urban areas?</p></speech>

For example, on the north side of Cork city at the end of November, 83 horses on public lands were seized.  Quite a number of these horses had to be put down because of welfare concerns.  We rehomed 42 of those horses through a voluntary organisation.  Most of them were rehomed in the UK.  Some of the horses went back to the owners when they could show they had the horses microchipped, passported and an equine-registered premises willing to take them.</p><p>  The Garda, departmental vets and Cork City Council were involved in this case.  That type of approach has been replicated across the country where local authorities have been proactive and helpful in most cases.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we cannot simply confiscate all horses from Traveller communities, for example, or other urban-based communities that cannot afford to keep animals.  If the animal&rsquo;s welfare is compromised, we will intervene and seize the animal.  We also have an obligation from the social point of view to examine expanding programmes for young people connected with horses but who live in an urban environment and who may benefit from learning horsemanship.  In the meantime, until we have those programmes in place, we will intervene on welfare grounds and be pretty uncompromising in doing so, as we have an obligation in this regard.  Some of the welfare stories about horses on urban lands are just horrific and we will simply not tolerate it.  On the social issue outlined by the Deputy, I am very supportive of the development of urban-horse programmes.  In the past few days I have spoken to a local councillor based on the outskirts of Dublin on this very issue.</p> <p>We will try to follow up on that but we have limited financial resources in our Department to be able to do anything extensive in that area.</p></speech>

Before I move to programme C, it would be remiss of me not to welcome the reduction in the overall TB numbers.  There is an odd hot spot around the country and I happen to live in the middle of one.  I notice that there is a slight increase in the provision that would be targeted at areas that seem to have consistently higher - far higher in some cases - average outbreaks of TB per thousand animals compared to the national average.  It is three times the national average in my constituency.  If I did not make that point, I would be accused of not standing up for my own area.

With regard to piers, it is set down that there is a separate allocation for fisheries, harbours and aquaculture development.  The subcommittee on fisheries released a report last week.  One of the recommendations was that county councils be funded to carry out an assessment of existing infrastructure and any surveys required to enable them to apply for funding from the Department.  The current situation is that the Department does provide funding for necessary works but only provides funding for the actual physical works.  County councils must get to the stage of planning so that involves various environmental impact statements and other costly works that are required to get them to the stage where they can apply for funding.  Has there been any change to that policy and is the Department now in a position to fund the surveys and desktop work to get them to the stage of being able to do the bricks and mortar work?</p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to the Irish Seed Savers Association, which is an organisation of national importance and gets quite an amount of national coverage regarding the financial difficulties it is in.  Obviously, there has been a reduction in funding from the Exchequer to the Irish Seed Savers Association.  I am very grateful to the Minister for his interest in the association and for the fact that, subject to EU approval, he has agreed to increase the budget for the association in 2014.  A large part of the difficulty the association is encountering is not just because of a reduction in Exchequer funding.  It is also because there is a reduction in the volume of sales on which it relies for a large part of its funding and a reduction in membership as people across the country seek to reduce expenditure.  The association performs a fairly vital national function in maintaining biodiversity in this State, which Department officials have acknowledged.  Will the Minister look at a multi-annual funding approach?  Again, I do not wish to appear ungrateful for the additional funding the Minister has agreed to provide.  It has been communicated to the Irish Seed Savers Association and we are all grateful for it but the Minister might look at a multi-annual approach which might enable it to look at how it is funded into the future. </p><p>  I am not entirely sure whether the final issue to falls to the Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or other Departments.  I suppose the fact that the OPW falls between many Departments is part of the problem.  A considerable amount of farmland in south west Clare around Kildysart and Ballynacally was flooded due to storm damage when the embankments along the Shannon estuary were breached.  There was a time when those embankments and culverts up across the west of Clare in Carrigaholt and right up to Quilty would have been maintained by the OPW.  They are not now maintained by the OPW and there is a bit of a bunfight between Clare County Council and the OPW as to whose responsibility they are.  The same is true of the embankments along the estuary.  That is of little consolation to the farmers involved.  All of these areas are designated as special protection areas, SPA, and special areas of conservation, SAC.  There is a very detailed protocol and detailed analysis in Great Britain regarding how state agencies must respond when flood protection mechanisms are damaged. </p> <p>There is an obligation on the part of the State because these SAC and SPA designations have caused considerable difficulties for farmers.  Perhaps this is a silver lining in the cloud in light of the duty to restore SAC and SPA areas to ensure there is sufficient habitat for the various species for which they have been designated.  Are protocols in place and how are decisions made on whether State agencies will repair damaged embankments?  It is a cause of concern to farmers in the area.  It might not be the Minister's responsibility but he sits at the Cabinet and a bun fight between State agencies would be unseemly given the damage that has been done. </p></speech>

This year's allocation is &euro;17.3 million.  It is clear that issues have arisen in regard to how money can be drawn down from this scheme.  Will other incentives be introduced this year to encourage engagement given that it is a particularly good scheme?  Is further flexibility required to allow money to be drawn down?  We will, for example, need additional funding for dairying.  The allocation for the dairy hygiene scheme increased from &euro;10,000 to &euro;26,000.  Is there a correlation between the two sets of figures?  Can there be more flexibility in the draw down of TAMS money in view of the fact that only 50% of the budget allocation was drawn down last year?</p></speech>

The budget allocation was &euro;1 million but, for obvious reasons, the outturn was only &euro;178,000.  Only a limited area was planted with bioenergy crops because of issues relating to the ultimate use of these crops.  Subhead C.6.3 on forestry development is a related area.  A large number of farmers are harvesting willow crops and putting them into aerated storage but problems arise due to the breakdown and heating of the material.  In England, sugar cane harvesters are being modified to cut billets, which are bits of timber only a few inches in length.  These billets do not degrade as quickly because air can circulate through them and they can be used to produce wood briquettes or other forms of wood heating fuel.  We need to expand beyond our current practices because nothing is happening.  Will the Minister consider copying what is being done in the UK, where a renewable heat incentive scheme pays 1 p per kW/h of fossil fuels substituted with biomass.  Departments would need to work together to create a final destination for these products because currently people are spraying off miscanthus fields.  We have made a good step forward on the medium-term objectives but we are starting to lose ground.</p></speech>

That figure will drop dramatically into next year but it still requires a substantial amount of money to meet the estimated &euro;184 million in payments.

In regard to Deputy Penrose's question on whether we will introduce a new installation aid scheme, we investigated how we can spend money to the maximum effect.  When installation aid was introduced, there was no requirement on young farmers to spend it in any particular way.  The money was given to young farmers, supposedly to get them started.  That was a good principle but they could spend it on anything.  There was no requirement for them to spend it on agriculture.</p><p>  We will continue to positively discriminate in favour of young farmers by giving them a top-up of 25% on their single farm payments which means &euro;16,000 over five years to someone who claims the maximum available under the scheme.  Obviously that figure varies according to how much land is being claimed.  They also have access to preferential capital supports under Pillar 2.  Under the rural development programme, a young farmer who wants to invest in capital infrastructure on his or her farm can get 60% grant aid, whereas his or her parents would get 40% grant aid.  These capital grants amount to a significant amount of money.  They can also get support for establishing partnerships or producing artisan food.  There is a strong package for young farmers.</p><p>  I made what I think was the right judgment call, as I explained to Macra na Feirme at its annual meeting.  We cannot be in the business of giving out money without understanding how it will achieve value for money.  There are strong incentives for young farmers and for generational change within the new RDP.</p> <p>We will not give them a huge lump-sum, no questions asked, and let them spend it however they want.  Those days are over.  We can no longer afford that luxury.  That does not mean we have not allocated very significant sums of money for young farmers.  We have.</p><p> Licensing for aquaculture has been one of my great frustrations since taking this job.  We are getting through it and are trying to fast-track it as best we can while staying within the agreed EC regulations.  Last year I approved approximately 140 aquaculture licences, maybe more.  I can get the exact figures.  It is a slight increase on the previous year.  We are assessing bays as quickly as we can.  If a bay or harbour is a special area of conservation, SAC, we have to go through a process of environmental assessment before we can even accept an application for an aquaculture licence.  That means our Department, working with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Marine Institute, getting the science done on those bays before we can assess the aquaculture applications.</p><p> This is a very important area for me but we must do it in a way that is sustainable and environmentally acceptable.  We have an obligation to do that and the Commission will require it, and that is right.  That does not mean we cannot get on with the job as quickly as possible.  People who seek aquaculture licences or licence extensions in some bays are waiting for their bay to be assessed, and that is very frustrating for them.  We have to try to get around to assessing those bays as quickly as we can.  We are prioritising the bays that have the most applications or potential applications to try and get as many of them dealt with as possible.</p></speech>

We will do that and will try to increase the resources to do it.

Seafood processing has been a good news story.  In the last two years we have spent a lot of money helping seafood processing by giving companies grant-aid assistance to upgrade their equipment and so on.  That is part of the reason the value of seafood exports has dramatically increased, even though the volume has remained more or less the same.</p></speech>

We have only so much money to spend.  We are looking to increase horticulture grant aid.  We are importing a lot of horticulture in Ireland.  We provide for only approximately 60% of our domestic needs here.  We can increase that.  That is why we are examining grant aiding the development of more horticultural facilities such as polytunnels and glass houses.</p><p>  A number of people asked about the harbours funds.  We have two ways of supporting the physical development of harbours.  My Department is responsible for, and owns on behalf of the State, seven fisheries harbours.  We need to invest in the infrastructure of those harbours.  Killybegs is the biggest, then Castletownbere and we have many others such as Rossaveal, Greencastle, Howth and Dunmore East.  There is an ongoing maintenance requirement there and some capital projects that we are trying to spend money on.  We have a second programme where we work with local authorities who apply for marine access projects, mainly around fishing, but not solely.  We provide 75% co-funding for local authorities for projects up to a certain value.  Last year and the year before, local authorities applied for that financial support and we have given it as much as we can support.</p><p>  Following the storm damage of the last number of weeks I have made the case in Cabinet and outside it that this model might be a good model for repairing some of the storm damage to the coastal harbours that have been affected.  We have done quite some work with local authorities in 92 piers and harbours to get an assessment of physical damage we might be able to support.  The Government will make a collective response in terms of resources that will be available for that work, along with the Ministers, Deputies Brian Hayes and Hogan.</p><p>  We will not provide money for survey work and consultants for fisheries harbours.  If local authorities want to develop their harbours they can do the ground work first in terms of surveys or consultancy.  I insist on spending our money on physical work.  It is a stimulus.  It is about creating jobs in coastal communities around the country.  We have a relatively small amount of money to spend and I want it to be spent on physical construction jobs around harbours, piers, access points, slipways, walkways and rock armour.  They are the kind of projects we have been supporting.  If we had more money we would also look at supporting some of the survey work required, but we do not.  A local authority can make a special case to us, for example if there is a special reason around marine safety, such as the need for a harbour to be dredged.  Generally we support physical construction activity and that is the best way to spend our limited resources.  It is small money in the bigger scheme of things.</p><p>  We have revised the Estimate for Irish Seed Savers upwards by 15%.  One would not think that looking at the Seed Savers campaign on social media and the questions asked of me.  It is the right thing to do.  It is an important organisation but it also needs to find ways it can help to fund itself.  We cannot pay for everything.  There are very few examples where I have decided to increase anybody's budget by 15%.  We made that decision virtually overnight because we had overlooked it during the budget debates.  The Deputy raised it with me and so we responded to it.</p><p>  Flooded farm land exists not only in County Clare.  There has been much physical damage to agricultural land right along the western seaboard.  OPW has primary responsibility for managing floods and ensuring we take action to reduce the effects of floods in the future.  Essentially a climate-change adaptation strategy is required.  It is very expensive and OPW has limited resources and must prioritise how it spends them.  If the Deputy is asking me whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can provide capital resources for reinstating farmland that has been washed away, that is a difficult ask.  There will be a collective response from Government on the overall flood damage.  That will come in approximately a fortnight's time.</p> <p> Deputy Pat Deering referred to TAMS.  There have been issues and there was an underspend last year.  I would like the full amount of &euro;20 million to be drawn down, but that did not happen because farmers decided, for whatever reason, that they did not want to spend.  In the first half of the year we had terrible weather and they experienced fodder problems and a horsemeat crisis and confidence in the sector to borrow and invest in farms was knocked because many farmers had debts linked with the fodder issue and so on.  The second half of the year was much more positive and dairy farmers were more willing to invest in building projects.  I am hopeful this year that optimism will result in a full draw-down, particularly in the dairy sector which is preparing for quota abolition in April 2015.  This is the time to invest in dairy farms and plan for expansion and increased herds and milk volume.  That is why we are providing a strong TAMS programme again this year.  I am hopeful more money will be drawn down this year than last year.  However, it is a demand-led scheme and we cannot force farmers to participate, although there are sufficient incentives in place to draw down the money.  We do not need to improve the scheme because it is a good one as it is.</p><p> There were other reasons farmers did not draw down the money last year.  There was a pig welfare issue which posed a problem.  Pig farmers must have loose sow housing.  This is a welfare requirement laid down by the Commission and we are grant-aiding prig farmers to upgrade their facilities to comply with it.  Many of them secured planning permission, but they could not physically get the works done in time with the contractors and we extended the deadline for compliance until the end of February.  Much of the TAMS money earmarked for the sow welfare loose housing scheme has been deferred to this year and it will be drawn down.  Extending the deadline led to an easing off of sow welfare expenditure, but this was done for all the right reasons.  It would have been rushed if we had not done this.  I am reasonably confident that all of the money allocated under TAMS will be drawn down this year.  I cannot say this for sure, but the figure will be higher than last year.</p><p> Deputy Willie Penrose referred to the new RDP.  I answered the question on installation aid.</p><p> Deputy Tom Barry asked about bioenergy   My Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have been in constant discussions about a bioenergy strategy and how to link with the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and so on.  There are more problems around miscanthus than willow, but we need to examine what is working elsewhere because the energy crops initiative, particularly miscanthus, has not been successful in Ireland.  It does not pay a person to transport the bulk material to Bord na M&oacute;na for co-firing and so on unless he or she is harvesting near Edenderry.  Some farmers have sprayed the crop and are ploughing in.  We have amended the rules to permit them to do this without paying a clawback penalty to the Department for the grants they received, but it is still not a satisfactory scenario.  Energy crops probably need more consideration and to be the subject of another debate.</p></speech>

We are responsible for spending the money and have sanction to spend up to &euro;40 million.  If we do not deal with the environmental issue - it is essentially a toxic landfill site in the middle of Cork Harbour without a licence - we will be fined by the Commission.  We are, therefore, required to deal with it and are doing so.  I have sanction to spend up to &euro;40 million to make the site safe.  I hope it will cost less than this.  We have made an application to the EPA for a licence and a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do the work necessary to make safe the site which is located at East Tip on Haulbowline Island.  While it is part of the Estimate, I assure the Deputy that we are not taking the money from schemes for farmers.  This is money Ministers collectively have agreed to provide and I am the Minister in charge of delivery of the project.  We could spend more than that this year, if the EPA licence and planning permission are granted, but that is the estimate for now.</p></speech>

An inventory was created by local authorities in some counties, particularly Cork and Galway.  When I was Minister, the Department funded some of this work in order that we would have an accurate record of what was in place.  It did not involve detailed surveys, rather it involved visual surveys of piers.  A two-page description of every pier and landing place was supplied.  Some of them are in charge of councils, while others are not and few of them do not have a value.  They are either used for marine leisure activities or fishing.  The database makes is easier for local authorities and the Department to make informed decisions on investing money and for people to be creative in developing harbours through Leader companies and the rural social scheme if the Minister funds them.  It would be cost effective, therefore, to use some of the allocation for harbours and piers to expand this inventory to cover all of the counties in which surveys have not been carried out.  Rather than having a hotchpotch view, it was a useful tool in developing a comprehensive plan to use all of these facilities.</p></speech>

Local authorities have a great deal of information on the harbours for which they are responsible.  We have an estimate of the damage caused to that infrastructure in the past six weeks and are continuing to work on it.  The Deputy and I share an interest in marine, coastal and island communities and the infrastructure they need.  We are preparing a detailed assessment of the damage that needs to be repaired which I will bring to the Government.  An inventory of infrastructure should be developed, although I am not sure of the extent of what is available.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, my Department and local authorities, collectively, should have access to such an inventory.  I will follow it up and ascertain what is available.</p></speech>

What percentage have less than ten or 20 ha?</p> <p>The problem is that for a farmer with 100 ha, 3% is 3 ha which is a hell of a mistake to make.  However, for a farmer with 10 ha, it is 0.3 ha and for a farmer with 5 ha, it is 0.15 ha.  If the Minister examines the map, which I need back after a while, he will find it very instructive.  Based on the Land Registry map that the land holder had - that person did not have the Department's mapping techniques - one can see how this thing can be totally disproportionate to the people at the bottom of the pile.  It is involving a huge bureaucratic engine and at the end of the day there is not much money involved with these very small farmers.  A farmer is getting &euro;100 a hectare.  For someone who is 0.4 ha out and if that represents more than 3%, the farmer gets cut by 1.2 ha multiplied by the five years from 2009 to 2013.  That suddenly becomes 7 ha which means that it is virtually one year's payment gone.</p></speech>

Some 7% of farmers are affected above the 3% figure.  We then need to work out with the farmers why that is.  If there is reason to do so we need to go out and carry out a physical inspection of the land.  This year, we are proposing to go through it in as much detail as we can and work out with farmers what was eligible and what was not, and why it was not eligible so that we can ensure that money that should not have been drawn down is paid back.</p><p>  We need to take an approach to the spending of public money that is transparent and beyond question.  If we do not do that, the Commission will take an aggressive approach to this, make its own estimate and apply a disallowance, for which every farmer will have to pay.  I encourage farmers to use the appeal system that is in place.  We want to be as helpful as we can in getting farmers under the 20% threshold and getting farmers under the 3% threshold when we can.  Everything we do here is being monitored and audited by the Commission.  It is not open to me to make some kind of arbitrary policy decision that because somebody has a small farm and a small payment, we should just ignore a payment on land that was not eligible.  That option is not open to me, as the Commission has made very clear.  We are adopting those options that are open to me.  We will work with farmers on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>  The Deputy is right in saying that most of the farmers who have problems in terms of the 20% have small holdings.  There are a few big ones - only 400 of those - but most of them are relatively small farmers.  There are issues we need to go through with those landowners and farmers explaining why the land is not eligible.  Where there is an overclaim of more than 20%, we plan on dealing with those individually with the farmer.</p></speech>

There is a process to request a physical inspection of the land by a Department inspector.  It is good to highlight the cases and the various different situations that can arise but we need to be reassured that the process is fair and adequately resourced so that these cases can be assessed individually.  The most important thing is for the Department to take a proactive approach to getting people under the thresholds of 20% and 3%.  For the purposes of this meeting, which is an Estimates meeting, we need to ensure there are adequate resources for the process to be conducted.  I could cite several cases of people who would argue that these maps had been signed off in 2010 and that they would not be retrospectively challenged again.</p></speech>

Now they have received another digitised map.  I understand the Ombudsman is examining the retrospective action the Department took in 2011 on disadvantaged area payments.  I have no doubt the Ombudsman will state the process being followed here is unfair and we will test it all the way to the Ombudsman.  It seems to be tying up many of the Department's resources.</p><p> Recently somebody who had overdeclared came to me with one of these maps.  The person had not realised a garra&iacute; had been left out which far exceeds the overdeclaration on what was included.  We must find out from the Department before a case is made whether the person will be penalised on the double for not declaring all the land.  People are human.</p><p> Suppose for argument sake the Department examined cases where it is clear and obvious the person is defrauding the Department and penalised them.  Suppose then the Department considered other cases involving 0.1 ha or 0.3 ha on land which is very difficult to measure, such as that which contains rocks and scrub, and calculated the overpayment by Europe was &euro;10 million and paid it back to Europe.  Would the Department still be fined?  Rather than taking money from the farmer the Department would take it from the Exchequer but would avoid a fine by paying back the overpayment.  It would mean effectively the Department disallowed European payments because it was paid out of Exchequer resources.</p></speech>

The objective is to get to a position at the start of 2015 for a new CAP round with accurate maps and money being drawn down on eligible land.  As part of this process, which we are required to introduce by the Commission, we must assess, in terms of making our maps more accurate, whether there has been an overclaim on land which was ineligible for the past four years and, if so, we must give back the money.  Some countries have stated they cannot deal with the detail and it is too big a job.  In such cases the Commission has made an assessment of the overpayment, multiplied it by a considerable figure and there have been significant disallowances.  In Ireland we are attempting to accurately address the overpayment so the only farmers asked to make repayments are those who have overclaimed, whether they knew they were doing it or not.</p><p>  Every year farmers have a responsibility to check their maps and ensure they are accurate, and this is clear in the application.  I do not like having to ask people for money back but the alternative is a significant fine.  If we decide to ask the Exchequer to pay it we will have a problem because everybody will pay for the fact certain farmers drew down payments on land which was ineligible and we will know the percentage of land which was not eligible because we must correct the mapping accurately in advance of 2015.</p></speech>

It is not like we have a reassessment every year.  The mapping technology has changed and allows us to be much more accurate.  It happened last July.  As a result of this accuracy we now know some land which was not eligible for payment drew down payments.  The Commission also knows this and we must take the course of action we are taking.</p></speech>

She was inadvertently overpaid by the rural social scheme.  She did not mean to cheat the scheme by &euro;2,300.  In fairness to the Department it did not hit the poor widow woman.  I would say the ordinary plain people of Ireland would rather spend the fraction of the euro themselves.  We did not reclaim it.  We told her she owed us the money but we did not claim it.  The maps I gave the Minister are typical of a large number of maps in the west of Ireland.  They involve 0.01 ha.   Until recently the people or the officials had no way to measure this accurately.  Suddenly people are being penalised 15 times for errors involving 0.01 ha.  Some cases come to a judgment call as to whether scrub is a forage area and whether it can be grazed in the summer or winter.  It is bizarre.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and his officials for assisting the committee with its consideration of the revised Estimate for 2014.  As the select committee has completed its consideration of the revised Estimate for public services, in accordance with Standing Order 87, the clerk to the committee will convey a message to this effect to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.

When the select committee has considered the Estimate that will be reported to the D&aacute;il.  The select committee does not formally approve the Estimates and, therefore, it cannot divide on the issue or cast a vote.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry.  I welcome also the officials.  I am sure we will hear from them at some stage.  </p><p>  As members will have seen that the 2014 Revised Estimate was presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme based format.  This means that the Estimate, as presented, contains the following information for each programme - how the money allocated to that programme is proposed to be spent and the previous year's outturn in each case; the numbers of staff assigned to work connected with the programme and how this compares with the previous year; performance related information such as the departmental outputs, again with corresponding information for previous year; and what are termed performance and impact indicators with previous years information also.  Administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than previously.  </p><p>  The Revised Estimate gives us an opportunity to review whether targets set out and the distribution of moneys across the Vote are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate best use of resources.  It also gives us an opportunity to explore issues facing the Minister in terms of the 2014 allocation for his Department.  </p><p>  A timetable for today's meeting has been circulated in advance and agreed.  It allows for a brief opening statement by the Minister and a discussion on the 2014 Revised Estimate with questions on each programme listed in the Estimate.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, to make a brief opening statement.</p></speech>

I think it is the second of the programmes.</p><p>  I thank the Vice Chairman and the committee for holding this hearing.  Overall our budget for the coming year is &euro;732 million, a reduction of 4% on the 2013 provision.  The capital provision is &euro;440 million, the current provision is &euro;291.5 million.  Adding in the capital carryover of &euro;23 million, which we have secured, will allow us to maintain capital spending at the same level as the outcome of last year.  </p><p>  On the jobs, enterprise and exports area, we can look back on a very good year in terms of employment performance.  Not only does the CSO data show growth of almost 62,000 in private sector employment but IDA and Enterprise Ireland had record job performances.  Enterprise Ireland has reached record levels on its exports and sector strategies are making good progress.  We are encouraged that the Action Plan for Jobs process which achieves cross-Government support for the enterprise and jobs agenda is adding value.  That is not to say that everything we are doing is perfect.  There will obviously be comments on the success of our new access to finance measures.  They have definitely added value but our ambition would be to see them grow further. </p><p>   In the small business area for which the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has responsibility we will shortly publish an entrepreneurship forum which was a piece of independent work conducted by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan with a group of practical entrepreneurs.  We will follow that up with our own enterprise strategy.  In the course of the year we will seek to make entrepreneurship and small business a very central focus of what we are about.  We are rolling out the local enterprise offices this year and we want to see them help provide a first-stop shop for business in order that anyone who is seeking access to any of the State programmes can have an easy and understandable location from which to get that support.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has been instrumental in driving this need for a good front-of-house point of sale, POS, to use the professional term.  That is clearly a very important element.</p><p> My ministerial colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock will deal later with innovation, but I will make a brief comment.  We have adopted the new approach to research funding.  We have in place a central technology transfer office.  We have delivered the new IP protocol and Deputy Sherlock has been instrumental in delivering Horizon 2020.  I think we are set fair to sweat the asset of our investment in research and science more effectively in the years to come.  That has been the central ambition that he has held in this brief. </p><p> Regulation is the third part of our responsibilities.  We are making very strong progress.  The committee very generously accommodated the passage of the Committee Stage of the Companies Bill 2012.  The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 allows businesses to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership.  We will shortly introduce legislative reforms in the area of work permits.  We are progressing the reforms in the workplace relations commission, which is simplifying the whole issue of workers' rights, and issues of dispute.  We have pushed ahead and successfully negotiated the opening of negotiations with the US for a trade agreement over time.  We see many of our agencies rolling out better compliance methods for businesses to keep high standards and be compliant in a way that does not represent a high cost.  The big uptake of BeSMART under the Health and Safety Authority is a good example.  Members will also see in the Companies Registration Office the adaptation to online reporting, e-filing and so on.  Our agencies, despite the declining resources available to them, are delivering strong service to the clients.  That is the key challenge.</p><p> I will deal specifically with some of the areas before taking questions.  The integration of Forf&aacute;s in the Department has made a substantial change in the presentation of our Estimates.  Members will see a very substantial increase in consultancy budgets.  The actual consultancy budgets are not up, but this reflects the integration of the type of work that Forf&aacute;s does, which is largely policy evaluation and value for money exercises, some of which it does not have the in-house capability to deliver and which it traditionally outsourced.  While it may appear there are significant increases in the administrative and consultancy budgets, the situation reflects the integration of Forf&aacute;s which was one of the rationalisation measures.  Let me explain at the outset the thinking behind the integration of Forf&aacute;s.  I have been a strong advocate for the integration of Forf&aacute;s even when I was on the benches opposite, since the time Culliton reported on the need to strengthen our industrial strategy.  Culliton was of the view that we needed a strong policy capability in the Department.  In the event, the policy capability was outsourced from the Department to Forf&aacute;s.  I think bringing the policy capability within the Department, which is reflected in these numbers, gives the Department greater capability to shape policy and to oversee the performance of our agencies in a more effective way.  That integration of Forf&aacute;s will help over the longer term.</p><p> Chairman, rather than have a long statement we will deal with the issues as they arise.</p></speech>

As suggested when we get to programme B, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock can make a brief statement.</p><p>  We will consider the Estimate and the performance and expenditure proposals for 2014 programme by programme, commencing with programme A which is jobs and enterprise development.  I remind members to identify the subheading of the programme to which they are referring when asking a question.</p><p>  We will discuss the general position in relation to savings measures that were to be introduced from 2013 and then move on to consider performance and expenditure proposals for 2014, programme by programme.

I notice a certain ministerial nervousness around consultancy fees, which is welcome, but Forf&aacute;s spent &euro;11.3 million on research in 2012.

We have also strengthened the National Competitiveness Council with the addition of six industrial partners.  The Forf&aacute;s resource services the National Competitiveness Council which is entirely independent in the publication of its work.  Forf&aacute;s will have independence in publishing its research independently of me as Minister, but in addition, it will have through the National Competitiveness Council a forum of outside interest which it serves to ensure an independent critique of how we are faring in terms of competitiveness across the spectrum.</p></speech>

In 2013, it was 30% and the IDA states in its end of year report that it is a challenge to reach that 50% figure.  In 2013, 64% of the visits by incoming client companies were to Dublin and to Cork.  Will we reach the 50% target figure in 2014 or is it just a notional figure?</p><p>  In 2012, the last year for which we have figures, &euro;89.9 million was paid out to client companies.</p> <p>Is the Minister satisfied with the audit procedures associated with that level of expenditure?  Are there difficulties with how that money is spent by any of the client companies to which it is paid?  When I studied the documentation, I could not find out how much was paid to client companies of the county enterprise boards in 2012.  That figure might be in the documentation somewhere.  I have seen the Enterprise Ireland figure, but I want to get a figure for the county enterprise boards.</p><p> I have two final questions on subhead A5.  How much did IDA Ireland pay in consultancy fees in 2012 and 2013?  What is IRA Ireland's active presence or footprint, in terms of staffing, in the BRIC countries?  I refer particularly to China and India, where a considerable level of industrial expansion is under way at present.  Is the Minister satisfied with that presence?  He mentioned that he has identified 155 investment projects for 2014.  How many of them will come from the BRIC countries, as opposed to the traditional inward investment markets?  Has a target been set in that regard?</p></speech>

Does this take account of the proposal to increase the number of start-up properties that IDA Ireland has around the country?  I understand that three such developments have been announced.  Does the Minister envisage that IDA Ireland will develop its own industrial parks to improve the employment prospects of counties other than the three that were named earlier?</p></speech>

As a representative of Galway, I am aware of the importance of regional balance, which has been much commented on.  Obviously, there is a critical mass in Dublin and Cork as the largest cities.  Are there other issues that attract companies primarily to those locations?  Can more be done to attract inward investment into Galway?  While Galway has done quite well, in fairness, one would never refuse new business.  I am always pushing these areas.  The Minister might comment on that.</p><p>  When I visited the consulate general in Boston during the summer, I noted that the Enterprise Ireland offices were located in the same complex and I was informed that efforts were being made to bring IDA Ireland in there as well.  It seems like a good idea for consular diplomats to be accommodated alongside the staff of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Is that being replicated in other parts of the world?  Are there plans to do so?  I am aware that the opening of new embassies and consulates has been announced today.  Will the Minister consider this approach in that context?  For example, would consideration be given to operating in this way in Austin, Texas, where a new consulate is to be opened?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2014012100005#D00500"><p>Indeed.  I will take them in order.  I can inform Deputy Calleary that the targets are based on an original five-year strategy.  We do not tend to change them suddenly on the basis of something like a record year.  We will not take last year's figures as the new baseline.  IDA Ireland is a long-term operation.  Its remit is to build strength in certain sectors.  It operates in a long-term planning environment.  I do not think it should suddenly change.  Last year was certainly an exceptionally strong year.  Even though 13,300 new jobs were delivered last year, it will still be a stretch to achieve this year's target of 13,000.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the 50% target.  It is true that over a number of years, IDA Ireland has consistently found it difficult to achieve this target.  Last year's figure actually represents a significant improvement on the previous year's figure, which was less than 25%.  Last year, 35% of new jobs were created outside Dublin and Cork.  This was a substantial step forward.  There is no doubt that this target presents difficulties.  The sort of mobile investment we are now seeing is different from the sort of investment we saw a number of years ago.  As a result, this activity has become more focused on cities.  As part of our efforts to counteract that, we have developed new initiatives like ConnectIreland, which has a better spread and offers regions the capacity to use their own resources to try to assist the foreign investment effort.  As part of the review of foreign direct investment that is being undertaken, IDA Ireland is looking at the challenges that lie ahead and how we can best capitalise on them.  That review will definitely look at the regional challenge.  As the Deputy said, it has not been possible to deliver on the targets that have been set in that regard.</p><p>  I am anxious to develop a more broad-based discussion on how a region can achieve competitive advantage for itself.  In many regions, foreign direct investment has not been the backbone of the local economy - it accounts for a small percentage of that economy.  There are areas in which there can be a legitimate expectation of building foreign investment.  There has to be a strategy around that in the region.  I think that needs to involve more stakeholders.  It should not simply be a question of asking why IDA Ireland is not bringing more visits to the area.  In the case of each region, a strategy needs to be developed that assesses the competitive advantage of that region and focuses on the elements of foreign direct investment which can build into that.  Similarly, there is a need to look across the region.  Enterprise Ireland, which is strong in many regions, has a much better regional spread.</p><p>  In this context, there is a need to look more strongly at the existing base of companies.  IDA Ireland has been doing this in the last 12 months, in particular.  Perhaps that is reflected in its numbers.  Approximately 70% of new jobs come from the existing base of companies.  We need to work on the base of companies that we have at regional level.  We should look at how we can build services in each region to meet the needs of companies that are already in the region.  I accept that there is a need for a broader regional enterprise strategy.  The sole focus should not be on IDA Ireland visits or IDA Ireland jobs, as if that represents the entire sum of what a regional strategy is about.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is to assure him that a review has been commissioned.  In addition, we must start to look at how we can shape a better regional strategy across all of our agencies and embrace stakeholders that are outside of our agencies.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether there are difficulties with the way IDA Ireland spends its money.  I have no reason to believe there are difficulties in that regard.  IDA Ireland has a strong system of evaluating the added value that companies bring.  I have seen that in the past as well as in more recent times.  IDA Ireland builds into its grants a requirement to surrender funds if targets are not delivered.</p></speech>

Consultancy spending by IDA Ireland came to &euro;740,000, out of a total of &euro;17 million in its non-pay budget.  I can assure the committee that IDA Ireland oversees offices in the BRIC countries.  It has 17 staff between the Asia-Pacific region and its growth markets overall.  It has a target of getting 20% of its greenfield investments from those growth markets.  Those staff go beyond the BRIC countries.  They work across a range of countries, including Singapore, Korea, Japan and Australia.  They are moving closer to the long-term target of 20%.</p> <p> The IDA announced a number of property solutions for Waterford, Athlone and Letterkenny.  Waterford and Athlone are important regions for the pharmaceuticals sector.  During the period when the property sector was strong, there was significant willingness to build without IDA involvement.  The agency views the property issue from the perspective of need and intervenes where it considers a region's offering needs to be fortified to continue to win investment.  It will act if there is tightness in the property market and an opportunity arises on which the market is unlikely to deliver.  I expect it will continue to pursue this type of strategy, rather than one based on the old concept of "build and let them come", in other words, advance factory building.  This approach will no longer work because companies must consider a much wider range of factors than was the case previously when the type of employment involved was largely lower skilled, assembly type operations.  At that time, advance factories were obviously a critical success factor but property is no longer as much of a success factor as companies must consider a wider range of issues before locating here.  Although it no longer has quite the same allure, property is still important in certain sectors.  </p><p> There is a particular tightness in the office market at present, especially in Dublin.  The IDA is working with the National Asset Management Agency and Dublin City Council which is developing a special development zone in the docklands.  There are areas where a requirement for property needs to be met.  The IDA will also weigh need against the potential of the market to deliver  in cities such as Cork and Galway.  The agency's property manager will assess what is likely to emerge in each of the various cities relative to the pipeline of investment and try to ensure it remains one step ahead.  That is the basic approach.</p><p> Deputy Kyne also asked about the Ireland House concept.  This approach has proved effective and is used wherever it can be developed.  It is under constant review to identify where we can obtain greater added value.  Enterprise Ireland has successfully co-located with Irish embassies in 16 of its overseas locations.  In six of its remaining 13 overseas locations, it is co-located with one or other of the remaining State agencies.  We seek to achieve co-location and moving towards a form of Ireland House arrangement.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the ambassador in each country chairs a cross-agency group to ensure an integrated approach is taken by the Irish presence in the relevant market.  This means Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and so forth operate as an integrated team under the ambassador.  This approach has proved to be a successful instrument, even in cases where there is no physical co-location.</p></speech>

Company A's stated intention was to sell off the company after phase 2 two clinical trials, company B's application did not make any forecast of jobs to be achieved and the said forecast did not meet the scheme requirements.  It found that the valuation documentation was inadequate.  This was a pilot scheme launched in the south east.  The object was to assist new start-up companies and individual entrepreneurs.  Some 14 companies were approved for funding under the scheme, five fully completed the study while a further five are in the process of completion.  In both cases the evaluation team deemed the application to be of sufficiently high quality to be awarded the funding, particularly as regards their development and employment potential.  While the applications in question did not fully meet all the relevant criteria they did meet all legal-based eligibility criteria with regard to the awarding of funding by Enterprise Ireland.  To date one of the companies has drawn funding of &euro;10,000.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the pilot scheme.  These have been addressed in a subsequent roll-out of the programme, specifically via clearly defined terms of reference which details eligibility criteria, evaluation criteria and the involvement of external evaluators.  Enterprise Ireland has subsequently rolled out the competitive feasibility funds to the north west, north east and midlands.  The lessons learned from the pilot scheme and the audit report have fully informed the more robust procedures and strengthened criteria that are now in place for these schemes.</p><p>  The internal audit did its job in terms of the way it worked.   The value of Enterprise Ireland payments and the capital was &euro;36 million outturn.  The allocation for 2014 is &euro;49 million.  There are issues, obviously, around timing of grant or draw-downs and there is a &euro;3 million carryover.  </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's presence in the BRIC countries includes 33 personnel in the Asia-Pacific region.  While south Paulo is included I will have to find out the staff numbers there.  Some 33 are spread across Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and New Delhi.</p></speech>

We do not have a number but I will get it.  Deputy Anthony Lawlor makes a good point.  We have tried to have a compendium of what is available across our agencies but the point is well made that Enterprise Ireland could have a simpler source document for the uninitiated as to what is available.  Many of these schemes have developed names which are great if one knows them and they mean something if one knows them.  If one does not know them and sees the name they do not mean anything.  One of the things we are doing this year, not just across my Department but across the wider Government, is to have a communications strategy to make it easier for people to access.  The creation of the local enterprise offices will be a part of that.  I will invite the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, in on that issue.</p><p>  The local enterprise office is innovative in trying to start a first-stop-shop for everyone and local government will bring in its business service units.  Therefore, there will be integration of the business service units of the local authority with the local enterprise offices.  We are protecting the resource of the enterprise offices and adding the resources of the local authority.  We hope it will be a bigger resource as well as doing new things.  LEOs funding, which I supplied already, comes directly from the Department's Vote.  </p><p>  In 2012, venture capital provided &euro;80 million in funding across 140 companies.  That has been a significant improvement on previous years and it is performing better.  I would hope that the 2013 figures, when they become available, will show a continuation of that trend.  They will not be available until later in the year.</p></speech>

We put up so much money and we get matching finance.  It paid 100 million, effectively, to a number of venture funds.  What happens is that they have to raise the matching finance.  They put up the right funding from that fund over a period of years.  Therefore, a fund is available, for which I will be able to give the amount, which, generally speaking, is about four times the amount we put in.  It is a fairly significant fund but its draw-down is only reported annually at present.  I think we should increase the frequency of reporting of that in order that we get a better handle on it.  Once the fund is available it then depends on the project flow.  It is privately managed.  It is managed at arm's length from Enterprise Ireland and that is true of the other funds.  Of course, Enterprise Ireland manages its own investment as well.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, will deal with the LEOs involvement in the regions because he has been intimately involved with that initiative.</p></speech>

On the issue of what the local authority would bring to the table I take Mayo as an example.  The development and implementation of the local enterprise plan will be formulated by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, through the local government input into the county development plan and the development of a partnership with the relevant agencies North and South.  I met the chairman of InterTradeIreland and it is anxious to work closely with the local authorities.  The promotion and marketing of local areas as a location for investment, as the Minister has said, is done in conjunction with the appropriate national body, IDA,   We have a very effective service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland.  With the concept of a regional plan, a county plan can feed into the IDA plan and identify and develop projects and programmes, leveraging resources to implement these programmes and funded from non-core resources.</p> <p>There will be other non-core funding as well, such as the management of the local authority enterprise infrastructure, enterprise parks.  I had the occasion this week of launching a report entitled The Impacts of Community Owned Enterprise Centres.  There are over 120 of these centres, spread through every county.  They set up in locations where the IDA will not set up.  I have distributed a copy of the report to every Member of the Oireachtas.  It indicates that there are 3,500 jobs in community-owned enterprise parks.  They will have a critical role in this as well.</p><p> While they will be based in the first-stop-shop for business they will incorporate the county.  This is a county development plan.  From next June there will be significant autonomy at local level and local authorities will have an input into assisting in the development of the county economic strategies, as proposed in the local government reform programme.  Local authorities will engage directly with businesses in difficulty to develop payment plans, for example for commercial rates.  They will have the possibility of giving a derogation for vacant properties.  I am very impressed by the meetings that I have had around the country with county managers and the county enterprise board directors.</p><p> I know that mentoring is close to Deputy Collins&rsquo; heart.  There were 1,473 training courses; 4,824 clients were mentored and there were 89 management development and growth programmes.  As the Minister said, we have got an increase on the capital allowance which the Department will ring-fence.  Local government will bring in staffing and expertise.</p><p> I had a very good day in Mayo where I met all the agencies.  As Deputy Calleary is aware, they are up to the game.  We are at a very advanced stage.  The Minister will announce the kick-off date for this work but we are pushing at every possible level to get these enterprise offices open.  The first first-stop-shop will open very shortly.</p><p> I am very optimistic because I believe in the role of local government in business, and integration of this Department, with start-up companies, community enterprise parks and formulating a plan for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I will send a copy of the service level agreement to every Member when it comes into the Chamber.  It covers general business advice, information on rates, planning and licensing.  The Taoiseach has been pushing very effectively for the integration of licensing on business.  We have carried out a review of all licences operating in business.  In the retail trade alone there are 15 different authorities and 28 licences.  From the third quarter of this year there will be a single portal where one can get all one&rsquo;s licences.  Much of that has been worked out.  People will deal with SOLAS, the Companies Registration Office, the Credit Review Office and other services, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Western Development Commission and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and get advice and information for local business on assessing public procurement, which is a big issue &ndash; I hear it all the time &ndash; advice on energy efficiency, sustainable development and alternative renewable energy.  The service level agreement agreed by the Minister with Enterprise Ireland is a very good document and Julie Sinnamon is determined to ensure that it will be a working document.  Eugene Forde of the enterprise development unit in the Department is here with us.  We look forward to the opportunities that the roll-out of this service will bring in 2014.</p></speech>

We expect the grants in 2014 to be &euro;18.5 million.  We spent &euro;18.18 million in 2013.  It is totally ring-fenced within this budget and the service level agreement.  We hope to complement enterprise promotional activities by local government.  There are many other schemes that will complement it.  We hope that the activation of the micro-finance fund, about which the Minister will speak, will be far greater through the local enterprise offices.  One will not need a refusal from the bank to apply.  I have spoken to several county enterprise boards and they welcome this additional source of funding, joint funding by the State to start a business.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, negotiated a higher SME proportion in Horizon 2020.  The recent flow of companies within Enterprise Ireland taking up research and development is somewhat short of where it might be but that resulted in a delay in the capital management process in 2010, which has been reflected in a slower draw-down.  The opportunities are there and Deputy Sherlock will deal with that when he makes his presentation on the innovation side.</p></speech>

As the county enterprise boards come to the end of their existence I acknowledge the great work they have done.  I am still not convinced and am concerned about moving Enterprise Ireland into that space because, while it is an excellent organisation, its interest is firmly in companies that want to export.  I know the Minister of State is working hard on this but I am concerned that we have a home for companies that want to get on with being in business.  They are not sexy.  They are not high-potential start-ups, HPSUs.  They just want to open their doors, employ people, provide a service in a community and get whatever support they can.  As we come to launch the LEOs that should be to the fore of people&rsquo;s thinking, companies that have no export potential should have a home and support within the State organisations.</p></speech>

The centre of excellence will lead, develop and manage.  We know only too well that 98% of the economy is driven by 200,000 small companies.  They are the backbone of the economy.  While we all welcome foreign direct investment, the enhancement of the support service generates innovative small and micro-enterprises.  That is why Enterprise Ireland is very committed to promoting innovation in its approach to supporting start-ups, entrepreneurship, developing the capability of the LEO network to set best-in-class standards and a lead role within Enterprise Ireland for the development and review of the service level agreement.  This will not be just a change of name.  The emphasis will be on the economy and small start-up companies.  I have seen them.  When I was in Enniscorthy last weekend I saw extraordinary companies employing two and three people which have immense opportunity with the development and oversight of metrics, the quality of local business development and the development of a common approach to mentoring and mentor management.</p> <p>Enterprise Ireland has taken Deputy Collins's document on board and I have spoken to Julie Sinnamon.  Considerable consideration has been given to the service-level agreement.  The first-stop shops will promote interaction with local government.  I refer to companies with the potential to be start-up companies as manufacturing or service companies.  We are encouraging start-up companies and we are working with third level institutions such as GMIT, Castlebar, for example.  Mayo will be one of the first out of the traps and we hope to have more counties in the following weeks.  I am very optimistic.  I have seen the service-level agreement and I know the commitment of local authorities and the staff in the enterprise centres.  The purpose of this Government is business in local communities, villages and towns.  A sense of enterprise is needed in smaller towns in every county.  I assure the Deputy that Enterprise Ireland will make this a priority and action will be taken.</p></speech>

The focus will be on delivery on-site.  New instruments are being developed such as microfinance which is available for both the export and non-export sectors.  Mentoring will be provided.

The temporary guarantee scheme has provided &euro;10.3 million in 15 months which is way lower than was presumed.  The Minister undertook a review of the credit guarantee scheme.  Is the target still &euro;150 million?  What is the target for 2014?  The microfinance targets are way below expectations.  Microfinance Ireland came before the committee a few weeks ago and its representatives were very impressive and focused on improving the target result.  The Minister for Finance announced on budget day that an information campaign would be in place in 2014 to publicise the supports available for business yet the Department's promotional budget has been cut by 17%.  This scheme needs to be publicised more effectively because people are either unsure of it or they do not know enough about it.  Is the target of &euro;150 million still a possibility?</p></speech>

However, there seems to be an issue in getting people to draw down funding from Microfinance Ireland, although I acknowledge it takes time to become familiar with such initiatives.  This is the case with the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  The message does seem to be getting across to potential enterprises that it is all right to try and to fail and to try again.  I refer to the Cork Foundation which has raised funds and it is not as bureaucratic as some Government initiatives. People who want to start up a business tell us they find it difficult to access help.  It seems we are all so involved that we do not see that the information is not getting out to those who need it.  On a recent visit to Brussels we were complimented about the great work of this Department and its civil servants.  It is important to acknowledge the good work which is being done.  Ireland draws down more EU funding than any other EU member state.</p></speech>

It takes more work when one is starting from scratch.  We are trying new methods.  We have had a series of meetings with the banks to seek to ensure that microfinance and our loan guarantee are considered immediately by an applicant who has been refused a bank loan.  We have removed the requirement for a paper refusal.  We have worked with the banks to see if a better response rate could be achieved if the banks were to highlight the alternatives to customers.  In tandem with Microfinance Ireland we are working to achieve a better take-up.  The local enterprise office system will be part of this scheme as will better protocols with the banks.  While Microfinance Ireland has changed its view of what will be the size of the potential market, it is still very ambitious for it.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary makes a valid point about the importance of promotion.  The Department is considering ways to promote the scheme more effectively.  The target for the loan guarantee was not changed but we hope to make changes this year in the terms of the scheme.  This will require primary legislation and the Oireachtas has the right to oversee any guarantee we offer.  We will be returning to the Oireachtas looking to make changes in light of experience so that it can be more effective.  </p><p>  I continue to meet regularly with the Credit Review Office in order to understand its experience.  There is no doubt that this type of scheme can play a role in finding solutions to viable companies which the banks for one reason or another will not fund.  My Department and the Department for Finance and the other stakeholders in the finance group are looking at a set of initiatives to be in place for 2014.</p><p>  In light of Deputy Collins's observations, the Credit Review Office is still hopelessly underutilised.  It has a current limit of &euro;3 million and only 3% of cases of refusal are being appealed in any shape or form.  Only a subset of those cases come to the Credit Review Office yet it is turning over nearly 60% of the cases that come its way.  There is a case for the Credit Review Office being more utilised by people who believe they are being treated unfairly.</p><p>  On the positive side, the latest survey by RED C in replacement for Mazars, shows that the rate of refusal by banks is falling, which means there is an improvement in the rate of approvals.  Approval is much more difficult in the non-pillar banks and this continues to be a problem.  My staff in the Department and everyone else, including myself as Minister, are working hard to sweat this area, so to speak.  We are hoping to get the most from the schemes and to improve them.  It is a work in progress.</p></speech>

However, by the time people are refused by the bank they baulk at the thought of going to the Credit Review Office.  They seem to give up.  I ask if the system can be activated at an earlier stage.  We had a conversation in Brussels about this problem.</p> <p>On the one hand, we are telling the banks to lend money and, on the other, telling them they must submit to tighter regulation and be more risk averse.  Is there scope for new, more innovative methods of financing?</p></speech>

This would allow us to examine at least a subset of the applications that are being refused without the appeals process being triggered, to see whether a significant number of good applications are being rejected.  That would give us a better insight into the potential that is there.  We are willing to consider any way in which we can achieve better insight and tools that will allow us to respond more effectively to the demand that exists.</p></speech>

That is the fundamental philosophy underscoring our efforts in this area.  The 2014 science and technology programme budgets have been maintained at the 2013 levels, which will support this goal.  Within the constraints of our economic circumstances, we are maximising the funding available for research, development and innovation and, critically, seeking to maximise the impact of this investment on jobs and the economy.  Evidence form both the EU and internationally shows that the Government's strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our science, technology and innovation investment is paying off.</p><p>  We are first in Europe for jobs created in research and development and tenth out of 142 countries under the global innovation index for 2013.  Ireland is in 13th position for university-industry collaboration on research and development.  We are in the top 20 in global international scientific rankings, first in molecular genetics, second in probiotics, third in immunology, sixth in nanotechnology, eighth in material science and tenth in computer science.  We are ranked third in the EU on the new indicator of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, thereby making Europe more competitive and helping to create jobs.</p><p>  The provisional figures indicate that the target to support 100 high-potential start-up businesses in 2013 has been exceeded.  These businesses have committed to creating a total of 2,100 new jobs and will generate annual sales of &euro;300 million by 2015.  The seven new Science Foundation Ireland research centres established in 2013 will directly support 800 jobs and are a key attractant for foreign direct investment.  In 2013, Science Foundation Ireland had links to 65% of the 3,085 jobs announced by IDA Ireland in the fields covered by SFI's legal remit.  We will continue the implementation of research prioritisation as well as a range of other initiatives to deliver on our strategy, ensure a more targeted investment of science, technology and innovation, and further enhance the effectiveness and impact of our research investment, with the aim of sustaining and creating jobs across the sectors to which I referred.</p><p>  This year, Science Foundation Ireland will establish two to three new large-scale research centres, which will support between 200 and 300 jobs in sectors of national strategic importance, such as medical devices, software, diagnostics, telecommunications, smart grids, and sustainable food production and processing.  SFI will also fund 3,000 researchers and more than 20 world-class research centres in 2014.  These are a key magnet for foreign direct investment and will help to ensure Ireland becomes one of the most attractive locations in Europe and globally in this regard.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland will support 95 high-potential start-up businesses in 2014 which, as I said, will yield 2,100 jobs across a range of sectors.  We are also working hard on driving greater industrial and academic collaboration.  Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to promote and drive effective collaboration between the two.  The main driving force for this is the translational impact from research into economic activity.</p><p>  Does the Vice Chairman wish me to address the individual subheads?</p></speech>

There is significant potential under Horizon 2020.  The negotiations on the &euro;80 billion package were concluded during the Irish Presidency, an effort to which the team that is behind me today was integral.  Through Enterprise Ireland we have set up a national support network which will includes most of the State funders of research, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Health Research Board, Irish Research Council, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  What we have here is a set of national contact points which will liaise with the institutes of technology and with individual entities within the universities.  These are the go-to contacts for industry and academics.</p><p>  We are targeting an increase in regard to the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are engaged with programmes like Horizon 2020.  We have raised the bar up to 20% engagement in terms of a drawdown of funding.  The funding target is some &euro;1.25 billion, which should present significant opportunities for the SME sector.</p></speech>

As I understand it, only research moneys can be put through the third level institutions.  There are issues arising in regard to intellectual property rights and so on.  In the United States, it is much more a case of get the research done, turn it over to the market and create the jobs.  In this country, there are different concerns on the part of different colleges.</p></speech>

The national intellectual property protocol deals with how industry engages with academia in terms of collaborations and how it mines that intellectual property.  There should not, therefore, be any ambiguity for anybody who wants to talk to an institute of technology or university in regard to mining those types of opportunities.</p> <p>There are clear protocols in that regard.</p><p> The major challenge, which Deputy Lawlor touched on, relates to how we encourage those in the SME sector, particularly those who own small and, quite possibly, intergenerational businesses, to engage with the institutes of technology in the context of innovation partnerships or innovation vouchers.  There may be a job of work to be done in the context of improving the profile of innovation vouchers among small businesses, particularly in the context of their value.  The LEOs may be the means by which that could be done.  I do not wish to be parochial but I am aware of the intimate workings of the system in Cork and I know there is quite an advanced, if informal, network in place which allows businesses to interact with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.  However, I am not sure whether this is replicated throughout the country and there may be a need for work to also be done in this regard.</p><p> The net point is that larger corporations will have relationships through the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres and the technology gateway centres.  The relationship in this regard is quite formalised and deep.  We want to encourage the participation of more businesses which would not have interacted on this level.  Such businesses could, for example, be operating in the light engineering sector and could be intergenerational in nature.  Those involved with firms of this nature may be extremely intelligent people who may not have gone through the formal system of third level education, but they are still running great businesses and they possess major skill sets.  These individuals may not be thinking about growing their operations in a particular way or about moving in a direction which will facilitate new innovations.  There is an opportunity for Ireland to improve its position in the context of this sector.</p><p> We must ensure there is a greater knowledge among people with regard to the potential of innovation vouchers.  There are those who may argue about whether the level of take-up in respect of the innovation partnerships has been sufficiently high.  The position with regard to take-up may relate to people aiming for the top end, maximum amount of &euro;250,000 rather than for the minimum amount of &euro;50,000.  The latter amount could, of course, have as much of an impact as the former in the context of the industry or SME academic partnerships which are driven by Enterprise Ireland.</p></speech>

NUI Maynooth is linking with technical colleges in Athlone, Waterford and Carlow to create a hub.  The aim of those involved is to source funding through Horizon 2020.  The greatest difficulty they are encountering relates to the matter to which the Minister of State refers, namely, SMEs and universities becoming involved in research together.  Perhaps it might be possible to examine that matter.</p></speech>

I have with me the Technology Centre Expo 2013 booklet, which acts as a very good guide to the technology centres that exist within the institutes of technology, for example.  Those centres are natural gateways for industries involved in a range of sectors, from the production of food right through to medical devices, to come on board.  The key point is that the system relating to more well-established or technology-driven companies is quite advanced.  What we are concerned with here is trying to get those who operate small or medium-sized businesses to start considering how they might obtain access to the information that is available.  As stated, it costs nothing to get involved in a conversation.  It could be argued that the walls are impenetrable.  However, I am of the view that those walls are being broken down quite quickly.  The Deputy would be surprised by the number of people who attended the launch of Horizon 2020.  I met a man from my region who is a painter and decorator by trade and who was present at that launch to examine a business opportunity.  There is a new confidence among people but we need to do more to drive business forward.</p></speech>

He is aware that I live in an area which is similar to that in which he resides.  In that context, he will also be aware that the value of innovation vouchers for universities, in terms of processing them and so on, is quite limited, particularly when the level of research involved is taken into account.  Perhaps that matter might be examined in terms of making the position with regard to vouchers more flexible.  For example, would it be possible for the colleges to receive the money directly?  I am not familiar with the entire process but it seems to be somewhat cumbersome, especially for those with small businesses.  I accept that &euro;5,000 is a great deal of money and that there is a need to manage the system properly.  However, perhaps a more flexible approach might be taken.</p></speech>

If a voucher is not working in a way that suits a particular company that is trying to drive innovation and if it is agreed, in principle, that there is scope for new innovation, then one would argue that Enterprise Ireland's suite of supports should be bought to bear in respect of that company in any event.  I accept the point and it is important that Enterprise Ireland should analyse the output relating to innovation vouchers.  That is certainly something which can be done.</p></speech>

A number have been set up, one of which can be located in northern Italy.  These hubs are focusing on various topics within the field of research.

The funding for it would come from the Commission rather than from the Irish taxpayer.  As stated, it is proposed to put 35 such hubs in place throughout Europe.  The strong hint we got at our meeting is that there is huge potential in the context of research into marine renewable energy.  It would not just be Ireland that would be involved either.  The hub would be operated on an intergovernmental basis.  We reached the conclusion that a hub of this nature could be a source of job creation, particularly in view of the fact that it would attract researchers from across Europe.</p></speech>

This strategy relates to evaluating the Atlantic's potential in the context of renewable energy and would involve countries collaborating with each other.</p> <p>I take the point that has been made.  There are knowledge and innovation communities and various themes that have been negotiated through Horizon 2020, in particular one in which we had a specific interest that related to food and that will be rolled out soon.  Countries will have to collaborate with each other along those themes anyway.  In respect of Horizon 2020, those research centres will be rolled out with the idea of leveraging greater funding from the EU because of their size.  By creating those economies of scale and forcing more academic institutions to collaborate with each other along thematic lines, large entities are being created that will be able to leverage opportunities from Horizon 2020 from an &euro;80 billion fund along those themes to which the Deputy referred.  In view of the two jurisdictions, we are working very closely with Northern Ireland and InterTrade Ireland to enable those concerned pitch for that kind of funding as well.  There are opportunities there.  I would like to know to whom the Deputy spoke.</p></speech>

My understanding is that it is not possible and that we are one of the only countries in Europe that has that scheme.  In other countries, companies can collaborate and set up a research institute.</p></speech>

There are other models like the Fraunhofer model in Germany which act as stand-alone entities.  We have the Tyndall National Institute but it is aligned to an academic institution.  I am not sure how to answer the Deputy's question other than to say that if a company is innovative and arguably has a relationship with a State agency, the chances are that if it is going to look for funding, it will already have a relationship with one of the State agencies and will find its way to one of the Enterprise Ireland or national contact points to seek those opportunities to draw down funding as per the SME targets about which I spoke earlier.  The company will already be alive to those opportunities so we do not think there is any need to change the model in that sense.</p></speech>

We are the only country in Europe that has this model.

They are existing but the problem is that they must be aligned to universities to draw down the money.</p></speech>

The reason why it works here is because we have cross-collaboration between different academic institutions.  There can be more than one academic institution mapped on to a theme, which is normally the case.  If one looks at Teagasc in Moorpark or Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre in University College Cork, one can see that a number of State entities and a number of different and competing industrial partners are involved in that.  There is a mechanism to allow them to share knowledge, which is arguably a better model because it results in greater economic activity for Ireland at the end of the day.  Most companies will already have research arms with their parent companies.  The model we have in Ireland is one of Government collaborating with industry and it works.</p></speech>

When a lump sum of this nature occurs, it comes from the Department.  That is where the lump sum arises from.  It is a small provision of &euro;55,000 but when an amount of this nature comes to be paid, it appears this way.  I can get a note on it for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd.  To assist members, we have prepared briefing material on the Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2014, which sets out details on the overall Vote, as well as key financial and performance information about each strategic programme.</p><p>  The key objective for Government in framing budget 2014 has been to do what is required to support our exit from the EU-IMF programme; this has now been achieved.  Getting to this position has, of course, presented major challenges, including the need to maintain tight controls on public spending generally.  Despite these constraints, considerable resources are being made available to my Department for 2014 and these will be used to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery and help the less well-off in our society.  In these and other ways, we will work to the greatest extent possible to improve public well-being and support delivery of better services for our citizens.  The budget of &euro;817 million being provided to the Department for 2014 is firm evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  The provision is made up of &euro;456 million in current spending and &euro;361 million in capital investment.  It includes an additional &euro;50 million made available to the Department on budget day for investment in infrastructure stimulus measures in the housing and related areas.   There will also be a further &euro;72 million of carryover capital funding for use on the LEADER, rural development and housing programmes in 2014.  In addition, there will be &euro;240 million in Exchequer equity investment in the newly-established Irish Water to fund the water and waste water capital programme this year.  Departmental programmes will also benefit in 2014 from resources available from both the local government and environment funds.</p><p>  I will turn now to specific areas.  As the committee is aware, 2014 will see major reform in the local government sector.  The action programme for effective local government sets out a wide-ranging reform agenda across local government to address weaknesses, enhance effectiveness and accountability and improve performance across the entire system.  Key features of the programme to come into effect following this summer&rsquo;s local elections include the restructuring of local government at regional, county and sub-county levels and the strengthening and widening of the scope and role of local government.  This represents the most far-reaching changes since the present system of local government began in the 1890s.  As members will be aware, local authority financing will change radically in 2014.  Irish Water assumed responsibility for the delivery and funding of water services from 1 January, the local property tax will operate on a full year basis, with an amount equivalent to the money collected in 2014 transferring into the local government fund, and 2013 will be the final year of operation of the non-principal private residence charge.</p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.  Irish Water will fund local authorities to deliver water services through service level agreements.  In this regard, Irish Water will cover some &euro;730 million in operational costs of providing water services in 2014, which formerly were funded by local authorities.  Last month I announced general purpose grants to local authorities of &euro;281 million for 2014.  When taken with the water costs of some &euro;730 million that are transferring from the local government sector to Irish Water in 2014, this represents a funding boost of some &euro;100 million or 11% to the sector when compared to the corresponding funding and costs for 2013.  This reaffirms the strong central government support for a reformed local government sector and the essential services which local authorities deliver to our people.  I acknowledge again the efforts being made by local government to reduce demands on the commercial sector.  It is vital that progress in this area is maintained, and indeed built upon, given the importance of local enterprises to employment and to the economy generally.</p> <p> Of course, there is no room for complacency; efficiencies are needed now more than ever.  The sector continues to make significant and welcome progress in implementing the efficiency changes recommended in the original Local Government Efficiency Review Group report.  For example, the sector has reported total efficiency savings of nearly &euro;230 million in 2010-12, primarily in staffing reductions and procurement.  However, it is vital that the rate of implementation of the efficiency agenda is accelerated by the sector to ensure that the overall targeted efficiency savings of &euro;346 million, as set out in the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group, are achieved in a timely manner.</p><p> The transfer of water services responsibilities from local authorities to Irish Water took place on 1 January and was a landmark event in the delivery of water services in Ireland.  This major reform programme will drive improvements in water services and provide security of water supply for the public and economy in the coming years ahead.  Security of supply will only exist if we increase investment in infrastructure and create a sustainable funding model for water services.  These will happen as part of the reform process.  In turn, security of supply will position Ireland's economy well to attract water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agri-food in the years ahead.  With these reforms, we are also directly creating jobs, through the domestic metering programme and the establishment of Irish Water's customer contact call centre.</p><p> Some &euro;240 million in equity-based funding will be invested in Irish Water this year.  This will fund progress on projects set out in the Irish Water capital investment plan, including over 100 projects in progress under the Water Services Investment Programme at the end of 2013.  The capital funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014 ensures that it is in a position to take on responsibility for delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  In addition, some &euro;486 million from the Local Government Fund will subvent the service level agreements between Irish Water and local authorities in respect of operation and maintenance of water and wastewater services.  A particular focus will be placed during 2014 on all aspects of water conservation to ensure that we manage our water resources in a sustainable manner and customers are informed on ways in which they will be able to manage their water usage when meters are in place.</p><p> This year will also see continuation of the Department's Rural Water Programme.  Funding of almost &euro;28 million is being provided under this programme and will include funding for the group water sector and septic tank grant assistance.</p><p> The environment and waste management programme provides for expenditure of &euro;35 million, largely to meet the cost of the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII; work is now well-advanced towards the merging of these agencies in the course of this year.  The Environment Fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, will provide a further estimated &euro;48 million to be directed to key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention and recycling.</p><p> On the community and rural development side, I have been particularly conscious of the need to support funding levels for the Local and Community Development Programme.  Given the current economic crisis and the high level of unemployment, the programme is now more relevant than ever as it supports employment and gives those most distant from the labour market the skills to access training and jobs.  The programme provides employment, training, personal capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.</p><p> Almost &euro;48 million will be invested in 2014 to increase access to formal and informal educational activities and resources, and to increase people's work readiness and employment prospects.  Some 14,000 people who are distanced from the labour market will receive direct one-to-one labour market training and supports through this programme in 2014.  While the current programme was due to finish at the end of 2013, it is now extending into 2014 on a transitional basis, with the successor programme being launched in January 2015 under the new local community development committees, which will enhance the role of local government in local and community development matters.</p><p> The Leader elements of the Rural Development Programme will receive substantial funding of some &euro;50 million this year and, as in 2013, will support nearly 2000 enterprises to improve quality of life and promote growth and diversification of the rural economy.  Leader is addressing many of the challenges facing rural communities, including through increasing economic activity and generating employment.  It is a key multi-annual programme which will continue to be supported to deliver on its commitments to enhance the social and economic fabric of rural communities.</p><p> I have kept my remarks as brief as possible so that we can have a full discussion on the activities of the Department and how our programmes, and the significant resources we will deploy in support of them in 2014, will benefit communities and citizen throughout the country.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts and contributions.  The Minister of State, Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, will complement what I have said in regard to her areas of responsibility and we can then deal with matters of detail that members wish to raise.</p></speech>

In 2014, almost 70% of the budget for the Department will go directly to supporting housing - this will result in an investment of over &euro;0.5 billion across a range of programmes.</p><p>  A &euro;50 million stimulus package was announced for the housing sector on budget day.  Some &euro;30 million of this funding is being made available for investment in local authority housing.  This will allow for a new social housing construction programme to be developed over the period to end 2015 and for a retrofitting programme to return vacant houses to productive use as soon as possible.  I expect that this investment will deliver up to 500 new homes for households.  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of these measures are being compiled by my Department and I expect to be in a position to announce details shortly.</p><p>  Considerable work has been undertaken in tackling the issues around unfinished estates.  The next step now involves resolving the residual cohort of estates which remain in a problematic condition.  Therefore, in 2014, &euro;10 million is being provided for a site resolution fund to resolve public infrastructure issues on the most problematic unfinished estates which cannot be resolved by other means.  My Department has recently invited local authorities to submit proposals for funding under the site resolution fund which will enable collaborative solutions to be found for unresolved developments.</p><p>  In continuing to support the objective of the Government's Housing Policy Statement of meeting the needs of people who are unable to provide for accommodation from their own resources, I expect that approximately 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014.  These units will be delivered through a range of mechanisms, including through continued investment in leasing and RAS, the completion of existing capital programmes and mortgage-to-rent arrangements, and the continued transfer of NAMA units.</p><p>  Reflecting the ongoing importance of leasing as a primary delivery mechanism for social housing, increased funding of &euro;40 million is being made available and some 1,200 new leasing units will be delivered in 2014.  This provision also provides for increased output under the mortgage-to-rent scheme which is a crucial element in tackling the mortgage arrears crisis and 350 new transactions will be delivered in 2014.</p><p>  To support the most vulnerable in society, funding is being provided for the development of 175 new housing units for those with special housing needs.  Furthermore, up to 150 persons with disabilities will be provided with new homes in the community under the Government's de-institutionalisation programme.</p><p>  To support Government strategies on the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities, some 7,800 adaptation grants will be available to assist people to remain at home for longer and prevent premature entry to residential care.  As the committee will be aware, adjustments to the administrative structures for the grant schemes for new applicants became effective from the start of this month following a review of the schemes.  The aim of the review was to give priority to finding ways to spread the benefits as widely as possible, to target those most in need, and to ensure that the grants supported the maximum numbers of households.  With the level of funding now available and the revised administrative arrangements, the most vulnerable will be better placed to benefit from the grant schemes.</p><p>  This year will also see a continuing focus on a programme of regeneration and remedial works projects, with a provision of &euro;79 million being made available.  These projects target the country's most disadvantaged communities through a programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  Priorities for 2014 include a new focus on construction and refurbishment in Limerick regeneration, the final phase of construction and refurbishment in Tralee and Ballymun, and refurbishment, demolition and construction works in Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens.</p><p>  In order to ensure continued progress towards the achievement of the 2016 target of ending long-term homelessness, the homeless budget is being maintained at &euro;45 million in 2014.  As the committee will be aware, the first report of the Homelessness Oversight Group was published last December.  That group was established to examine the approaches being pursued in the Homelessness Policy Statement and to review progress, identify obstacles and propose solutions.  I am currently considering the group's report and its recommendations and will consult with colleagues in Government on the implementation of these recommendations, as appropriate.</p><p>  Additional innovative measures in 2014 will see &euro;25 million being made available for the energy efficiency stimulus measure which will improve the energy efficiency of some 12,500 local authority houses, resulting in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families.  This initiative will also create approximately 1,000 jobs in the construction sector over the period 2013&ndash;2015.</p><p>  The social housing reform programme will also continue during 2014 with the commencing of the testing phase of the new housing assistance payment.</p> <p>This will begin in Limerick, the lead local authority for the project, and quickly extend to the six other local authority areas forming the first wave and thereafter to all areas.  I also hope to see the necessary supporting legislation, which is now being drafted, enacted before the summer.  I hope to bring the heads of that Bill to the committee as soon as possible.</p><p> The most recent data on the number of households qualifying for housing support underpin the need for flexible and diverse approaches to be taken to increase the level of social housing supply.  There is no single solution to this and my priority is to use all avenues available to me to respond to this housing need.  In 2014, I am determined that the social housing programme will continue to optimise the delivery of good-quality social housing and the return for the resources invested.  I  would welcome the views of the members of the committee on the issues and challenges outlined.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue.  It is no secret that we need to ask many questions about the transfer of duties from the local authorities to Irish Water.  If it were not for events of the past few weeks, much information may well have been absent here today.  However, there are a few items that need to be clarified before we proceed even to this year's programme.  I am conscious of a comment made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, last week that this committee would have discussed the costs associated with the setting up of Irish Water in November 2012, further to his having received approval from the Cabinet of &euro;180 million for set-up costs. As the &euro;180 million to which he referred was raised as a commercial loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, can he confirm that there is no way it was discussed at this committee in 2012 with regard to the spend in 2013?  Furthermore, can he confirm what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, said in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday when he stated this point and, more to the point, said that any parliamentary questions from Members of the D&aacute;il on behalf of taxpayers relating to that spend and how it is being carried out would not be answered because that information was judged to commercially sensitive?  That was in contradiction to what the Taoiseach has said earlier about how Irish Water is a public utility in public ownership and that all questions asked in the form of parliamentary questions would be answered.  If that is the case, is it the position that I or anybody else is not entitled to ask questions about information relating to costs associated with consultants such as IBM, Accenture or Ernst &amp;amp; Young, to name a few, and that in receiving answers to those questions we are at the mercy of Irish Water, which is not yet subject to freedom of information legislation or the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and is only obliged by virtue of the legislation that was guillotined before Christmas to come before this committee once a year, when we are at its behest as to when it specifically wishes to answer questions?  I inform the committee that the Secretary General of the Department thankfully contacted me last night to apologise on her Department's behalf for not answering questions from me and others in the past pertaining to this matter.  I accept that apology and her commitment to discuss with Irish Water a mechanism by which information may flow - I emphasise the words "may flow" - in the future.  I await the Minister's comments in that regard.</p><p>  As I mentioned in the debate on a motion we had before House last week, I asked the Minister on 13 November 2012 about the specific costs associated with the setting up of Irish Water.  I asked how much he had committed towards Irish Water for next year - that would have been for 2013.  While the Minister has argued that it was in the context of water metering, which is fine, he came back and said a provision of &euro;10 million had been provided for the establishment of the structure of Irish Water in 2013.  He said that legislation to set up Irish Water on an interim basis would be introduced pending full implementation in 2013.  We have since had that legislation.  He said the cost of metering would be paid out of a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund - we were always aware of that, so there was nothing new there - and that it would not be included in the Department's Estimates, as metering would be rolled out over a number of years, but he never mentioned the specific set-up costs.  In his response to my statement last week he said that he provided a breakdown of the &euro;10 million, part of which was &euro;2.7 million towards administration and set-up costs.  A good deal of explanation is required to clear up what the Minister has said.  I left Dublin last Tuesday night wondering what the situation was, having been told it was my responsibility for not having raised this issue in the normal fashion, the Minister having gained approval from the Cabinet prior to that, but we now know that he did not gain approval from the Cabinet in the normal fashion.  It was the economic council that designed the funding in such a way that it would be a loan, and that only copperfastens the accusations that have been made in regard to the overall secrecy that has surrounded this whole debacle since then.  That is my point regarding what has happened so far following the chief executive officer's admission on the national airwaves about the costs associated with Irish Water, the consultancy fees of &euro;50 million that had been spent up to then, and the &euro;85 million being provided in the overall scheme of things. </p><p>  To return to the Minister's presentation today, he said that &euro;240 million would be provided from the Exchequer towards Irish Water.  Is that in respect of new capital projects or ones carrying over from last year?  How much in total was spent last year by local authorities on capital projects relating to water programmes?  How much is proposed to be spent this year either in respect of projects carrying over from last year for which approval has been given by the Exchequer, or in respect of commitments that may have been given to the Minister on foot of representations from local authorities for this year coming?</p><p>  The Minister said that Irish Water would cover &euro;730 million of the operational costs next year.  What is the source of the &euro;730 million?  I expect part of it is derived from the collection of commercial water rates, to the tune of &euro;200 million, but from where does the balance come?  Perhaps it is quite obvious, but it is not very obvious to me when I read what is before us today.  The Minister said that &euro;486 million from the Local Government Fund was also being given to Irish water.  The amount of &euro;730 million is in addition to the &euro;486 million that the Minister, according to his statement here, is providing towards operational costs.  That indicates that there is an operational cost of &euro;1.216 billion in total next year.  I think the amount was substantially less last year because the &euro;1.2 billion that we have all been quoting with respect to the operational costs in a given year is inclusive of capital spending in that area also.  </p><p>  Where is the &euro;400 million that was taken from local property tax revenues that had initially been committed to local authorities that have found they are not able to strike budgets, that find it very difficult to provide the services and facilities they had intended to provide and that had considered this funding a windfall?  The Minister took that from them at the back end of last year.  Where is it to be spent now?

Can the Deputy repeat that question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014012100004#C00500"><p>It is in relation to the emphasis the Minister mentioned his Department would place on water conservation and, specifically, how would that manifest itself.  Would it be by local authorities or by Irish Water?  The Minister specifically said how much would be spent when he said there would be an emphasis on it.  Can he assure us that the associated funds will be spent on what it says on the tin?</p><p>  Can the Minister confirm that if a household, for example, conserves water such that it uses less than the flat rate set by the regulator, there will not be any additional charge associated with its efforts at conservation?  </p><p>  In regard to the &euro;28 million that the Minister said was provided for group water schemes and septic tanks - I presume that is for a rectification scheme - can he give a specific breakdown of the amount?  Is he providing any money for local government training towards the testing that is required on the data collected from the registration of septic tanks in the past few years?  I do not believe one grant was made by any local authority to any individual in this State who had registered his or her septic tank knowing that it needed rectification works.  The reason for this is that local authorities have not been carrying out the testing.</p> <p>If I know my septic tank needs rectification because it contravenes the existing law, I cannot apply for the grant despite the great fanfare of the Minister in announcing the grants.  The tank must fail a test carried out by the local authority before I can apply for the grant, but they are not carrying out any tests.  No grants are being offered.  Is the &euro;28 million going to address the issue that was to be addressed some time ago?  Is the Minister running the risk that the EU may enforce the fines the Minister was so fond of talking about in the past?</p><p> With regard to Irish Water, it is now January 2014; what has been spent specifically by the State since last January?  What has been raised, even if it is from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and not directly from Exchequer funds?  On 13 November 2012, the Minister said &euro;10 million had been spent on operational costs and administration charges associated with the setting up of Irish Water.  Has that money been spent?</p><p> We knew nothing about the &euro;180 million in November 2012 but we know about it now following a radio interview last Thursday week.  The money was committed.  Some &euro;1.2 billion was spent last year in operational costs of local authorities throughout the country.  Some &euro;500 million was provided in a loan to Irish Water from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for water metering.  Has that been spent?  Have the targets been met?  Before Christmas, I was led to believe that only 20% of metering targets had been achieved.  Have issues arisen over the course of the metering that present bigger challenges and problems relating to its financing into the future?  Can the Minister confirm that the figure he provided in the form of a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will not be breached?  Will there be any savings compared to the Estimate and the loan in the first instance?</p><p> Some &euro;486 million has been taken from the local property tax revenues and given to Irish Water.  Today, the Minister tells us &euro;240 million has been given by the Exchequer towards the capital cost of Irish Water and that operational costs of &euro;730 million have been provided by the Exchequer.  That amounts to &euro;3.3 billion in a year.  If I am being outlandish or adding things twice, the Minister can correct me.  God knows, enough information has been hidden from us since the process began.  If this meeting takes a few hours more, I want to walk out knowing, on behalf of those I represent and taxpayers, what has been committed and what has been spent, and then we can begin to make a judgment on the value of what has been committed and spent.</p><p> This takes place against a background in which there has been no audit of the national network.  We do not know.  The figures being bandied about and used loosely need to be confirmed quickly.  We need a roadmap with the cost associated with rectification and reinstatement.  This applies to the national network and to the dreadful problems we have in Dublin, with a view to committing the funds required and working under the critical infrastructure legislation to allow Irish Water, or whoever is charged with responsibility, to fast-track the solution.  In the absence of that information to allow people to judge it and understand what is involved, they cannot see that we will have a water system fit for purpose five years down the line.  If they can see that, they may be committed to paying accordingly.</p><p> My party is not against the concept of water charges, although we disagree totally with the method and the avenue the Minister went down in setting up Irish Water.  Fianna F&aacute;il would have retained the expertise on the river basin management regionalised structure that exists in local authorities.  We can talk all day long about what we would have done and would not have done but the Minister is now accountable, having sought a mandate to govern and having acted accordingly.  Perhaps he did not act in the best interests of the public but he must regain the trust of the public in order to allow this project to proceed properly.  I would appreciate it if the Minister had answers to my many questions.</p></speech>

We have 18,000 people on public water supplies that have a boil water notice or other restrictions.  The EPA has determined that remedial action is required on supplies that are at risk, which include large supplies in Dublin and Cork, affecting a million people.  We have significant supply constraints in Dublin.  Where we normally have a cushion of 15% on supply, we now have 3% or 4%.  There is water unaccounted for, meaning there are leaking water pipes costing a lot of money.  Some &euro;1.2 billion comes from the taxpayer and 40.8% of the water is leaking.  Thirty-six percent of our wastewater treatment plants did not meet our effluent standards in 2011 and European Commission has launched a pilot infringement in respect of 80 of those plants.  That is the legacy I inherited.  I was faced with the challenge of deciding which programmes we would cut further in the context of a troika programme in order to deal with these serious issues.  We had to provide good-quality water to meet water quality directives in 2016 and 2021, and this required a capital investment of &euro;600 million per annum, which is almost triple what we spent this year and last year.  We have &euro;500 million of investment projects on hold because we did not have the money.  We have no hope of meeting those objectives without having some new initiative to deal with it.</p><p>  We set up a study that did not cost a whole lot of money.  We studied the situation internationally to see what we could do.  The best way to roll out additional capital investment was to set up a semi-state commercial body and link it not to a greenfield site but to an existing State body to save money.  Bord G&aacute;is and Bord na M&oacute;na were the existing State companies that bid for it.  We made savings because we used existing systems and expertise up to now.  And I would ask Deputy Barry Cowen-----</p></speech>

Instead of 34 local authority offices handling water services separately, we will have just one office.  It was a useful initiative.  We have retained the expertise of local authorities alongside the expertise of Bord G&aacute;is in building systems and customer capability.  Committee members received details of the essential software and hardware last week.  The people involved are not consultants.  Rather, they are external service providers and 90% of the money spent will be an asset on the company's balance sheet.  How could the ESB, EirGrid or Bord G&aacute;is have been set up without actually spending money on putting systems in place?  It will not be a ramshackle company, but the most modern water company possible.  We are borrowing money to do this.  Depending on the term of the loan, that money will be on the balance sheet for ten, 15 or 20 years.</p><p>  I will provide the full details of last year's expenditure on the establishment.  Some &euro;15.76 million was spent, with &euro;760,000 towards the regulator to cover its new work, &euro;570,000 on phase two of the pilot metering project, &euro;5.7 million on the water services transition office and &euro;179,000 to PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, for the original independent report on the structure of the water utility that was to be established.</p></speech>

The project management office cost &euro;628,000.  This related to project management costs incurred by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  Some &euro;55,726 was spent on the ESRI's research on affordability issues and the impact of water charges.  The water metering programme cost &euro;7 million.  This covered the costs incurred by local authorities in terms of road opening protocols, CORE systems, ESRI software systems and mapping.  The Department needed &euro;328,000 worth of engineering support with the water services investment programme.  The Department also required additional staff last year, amounting to a cost of &euro;321,000.  Advertising for water metering subcontractors, including in Public Sector Times, cost &euro;31,000.  Mazars did &euro;27,000 worth of work for the recoupment of costs incurred by ICTU under service level agreements.  Overall, the Department's spend has been &euro;15.76 million.</p></speech>

Give me a chance to handle the Estimates.  This year, we will spend &euro;240 million on major capital works.  There is a carry-over from last year relating to unfinished projects.  That money must be spent, but Irish Water will deal with those projects.  It will publish its public capital programme for water and sewerage schemes at the end of next month.  We will see the colour of its money and what it can afford to do then.  However, it faces significant issues.  Irish Water has all of the assets now, but not all of them are in good shape.  It is trying to find temporary and permanent solutions in that regard.  Equally, Irish Water has all of the liabilities that used to lie with local authorities.  This is a major undertaking, for which reason it needs asset management systems.  They cannot be set up using fresh air.</p><p>  The rural water programme will remain with local authorities.  As with previous years, directors of services will issue a call for submissions, which will be evaluated.  The Minister of the day will announce the allocations to be devolved to local authorities.  Nothing has changed.  This amounts to &euro;28 million.</p></speech>

Arising from a European Court of Justice case about which Deputy Cowen did nothing, we went to the European Commission.  In spite of the legislation that I introduced quickly after I became Minister, we paid &euro;2.7 million in fines because of the Deputy's inactivity.

Deputy Cowen said he received an apology.  I have not received mine yet.  I asked a number of questions throughout last year on costs, including the cost of outside expertise and consultants.  Those questions were not answered.  Any answers I did get were nonsense.  The Ministers completely sidestepped the questions in the Chamber and this is on record.  Rather than asking the Minister for an apology, I ask him to send me one page with the relevant figures for last year.  I have heard all the figures being talked up, down, backwards and forwards.  Either deliberately or as a result of confusion, the figures have been presented in such a hodgepodge way over recent months that they have clouded over and distorted what is happening.  Money comes in and out and revenue has been raised from various sources for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p><p>  Anybody who has ever sat on the board of a small business or run a household would know how to proceed.  It is very simple: on one side of a page one puts down what came in during 2013 and on the other side one puts down what went out, in addition to the sources.  The Minister and two Ministers of State are present today with their most senior officials.  I ask them to produce the figures for me.  The way we were treated over the past year was a disgrace.  We were deliberately misled over the past 12 months when we probed this.  We had no answers for the public on how the agency would be established, the sources of funding, how the moneys would be spent and what was taking place.  I feel aggrieved and annoyed by it.  People elect me, in addition to the other 165 Members, to come here to represent them, and we should be able to get answers.  Opposition spokespersons on these matters were deliberately misled, and information was deliberately withheld from us.  I take no pleasure in stating that.

If I remember correctly, advertising on the local property tax stated revenue would be used for parks, libraries, lights and paths.  I heard the Minister and Minister of State Deputy O'Dowd say this many times.  It now turns out that the &euro;550 million landed into the Local Government Fund and that the Government pulled &euro;490 million from that for the Irish Water subvention.  The Minister can talk about this in whatever way he likes but the fact is that he put the money into a drum and pulled it back out again.  He should not try to distort that in any way.</p><p>  Of the money that is being spent, how much will be spent this year on rehabilitation in respect of leaks in the public network?  This is a straight question and I demand a straight answer.  The Minister answered the question on grants for septic tanks.</p><p>  On the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, the Minister and his officials have given figures.  The Taoiseach gave figures also.  I heard the Minister say the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann would save &euro;2 billion over seven years.  The cost of water services is to become more expensive.  On this matter, I will make a bet of &euro;50 or &euro;100 with the Minister that my projections are correct.  The Chairman can hold the bet and I will collect the winnings in a few years.</p></speech>

The Minister said it would be &euro;2 billion, which points to a difference of &euro;900 million.  It is costing roughly &euro;1.2 billion at present.  Over seven years, this will amount to &euro;8.4 billion.  The Minister is saying he will save &euro;2 billion.  I asked him before how he would do that because he has created a macro-structure on top of what exists already, with 500 extra employees, call centres and God knows what else.  How will it be cheaper given all the investment?  Why is the Taoiseach on a different page from the Minister?  Why are officials on a different page?  I know the page I am on because when I calculate the current investment and analyse the structure of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, I realise it cannot be less expensive.  The iron laws of economics show it will be more expensive.</p><p>  What I am asking about regarding the expenditure on Uisce &Eacute;ireann is simple.  We know the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General on accessing information.  As the Minister said many times, this will be a stand-alone utility, a stand-alone commercial entity.  Both he and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, said it many times in the Chamber.  It was obvious at the time where they were going with this.  When will the utility be subject to FOI mechanisms?</p><p>  Can the table of expenditure be set out in a clear form for 2013?  No more than a page or two is required.  It would demonstrate to me and the public exactly what has happened.  How much was spent last year on leaks?  This is related to a question I have already asked.  How much will be spent fixing leaks this year?  Some 40% of the water is lost through leaks.  I understand some good work has been done in Dublin on fixing leaks over recent years.  I understand we cannot reduce leakage to zero.  The Germans have probably gone as far towards zero as possible and their leakage percentage is still in double figures.  However, if we could halve the number of leaks over the coming years, we would save a substantial amount of money, or several hundred million euro, in terms of water provision.</p><p>  There is talk of new sources but there is no point pumping water from a new source into a leaking system.  I have heard no talk to date about leaks being fixed.  I have heard all about where the &euro;180 million was spent, and we know about the call centres and other facilities that must be set up.  If we could fix half the leaks, we would be going somewhere.</p> <p> My last question relates to the building regulations and is directed at both the Minister and the Minister of State at his Department with responsibility for water.  I accept that we cannot empty material from hardware shops and ask suppliers to get rid of stock, particularly in the current economic climate.  However, I am asking the Minister to put in place new building regulations related to water harvesting and conservation.  All new builds should have water harvesting and water conservation facilities.  The home-improvement tax incentive scheme introduced in the last budget is to be welcomed and could be linked into the retrofitting of older houses with water harvesting and water conservation equipment.  Then, once older stock has been used up in hardware shops, dual-flush toilets can become the norm, along with other measures that will save water.  I making a serious proposal here.  There are lots of simple measures that can be used to save water and we should not long finger this issue.  We should start to examine this now, in a serious way.  The Department, this committee, the D&aacute;il, local authorities and those who police the building regulations should focus on this now.  New regulations should be put in place so that when the stock that is there is used up, we will introduce dual-flush toilets and water harvesting equipment, particularly in larger commercial buildings and new public buildings.  No new public building should be built without water harvesting facilities.  Thousands of gallons of water are running off roofs and we need to catch that water and use it.</p></speech>

I have already told the Deputy that I will do it in 2014 and I am doing everything I can to amend the building regulations to ensure that new buildings and new planning applications will have to include a rainwater harvesting plan.  I totally agree with the Deputy on that point.</p><p>  I will provide the committee with the one or two pages of information on the financial issues that the Deputy raised.  I have no difficulty with that.  It is interesting to note that the figure for leakage in the network is 40%, which is exactly the same as the figure in 2006.  We have spent &euro;30 million per year every year since then and have made no impact because as we solve a problem in one area, another arises somewhere else.  We have not been able to catch up with the low level of investment that we have on the leakage side.  We will take three initiatives on the leaks.  First, we need additional capital investment and that is where, off balance sheet, Irish Water will be able to borrow money in order to provide the additional capital investment for that purpose.  Second, we are going to introduce a first-fix leak system to the metering programme so that when the meters are turned on, we will provide financial assistance in order to ensure that the customer is not held responsible for a legacy leak outside his or her boundary.  However, there is customer side leakage as well and customers will have to find a way to resolve those themselves.</p><p>  We estimate that with the metering programme, there will be a 15% reduction in consumption, which will save a considerable amount of water.  This is based on an analysis of group water schemes, which are already metered.  A lot of people in this country have had water meters for a long time.  Those in the commercial sector and those in group water schemes have had meters for some time.  When water meters were installed in the group water sector, the drop in consumption was between 20% and 30% because leaks had to be detected and repaired.  There is a lot of good work going on in the group water sector that we are trying to learn from and which the contractors are learning from.  The customer will also have to learn.  The water conservation plan, to be outlined by Irish water, will take the best practice, knowledge and expertise that is out there and impart it to people.  </p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be making Irish Water subject to the Freedom of Information Act as quickly as possible.  Indeed, he repeated that to me yesterday.  We have no difficulty in doing that.  We are not waiting for the legislation to go through the House before doing that.  We will bring it in under the existing regulations.  The Minister feels that he will be able to do that.</p></speech>

I particularly wish to address Deputy Stanley's assertion that he was deliberately misled during debates in the D&aacute;il.  I utterly refute that assertion.  The commitment to make Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann subject to the Freedom of Information Act was given by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform last November.  That commitment was repeated by me during the debate in the Seanad in December.  At all stages during the debate in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, we spoke about the annual report being available for debate in the Oireachtas by the relevant committees.  I also gave a commitment that when the investment plan of Irish Water was prepared, it would be laid before the both Houses of the Oireachtas and fully debated.</p> <p>There is no attempt to deliberately mislead people in that regard.</p><p> I met with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, during the debate and raised issues with it regarding its intentions and how it would explain its role, which is fundamental to the Bill.  The CER assured me that its staff are prepared to come before any Oireachtas committee to debate issues before any decisions are made and say what it wants to do, how it would proceed, and to provide total transparency.  When a proposed decision is due it would then come before the D&aacute;il for discussion.  Subsequently, when the decision was made it would be debated again.  At no stage was there any attempt not to have total transparency in terms of accountability to the Oireachtas on all fronts.  I refute what was said.</p><p> A key issue that has been raised in particular by Sinn F&eacute;in, with which many of us agree, is that there would not be privatisation of Irish Water.  That was expressly written into the Bill.  There was no question of avoiding the issue or setting up a quango that would not be accountable.  Deputy Cowen referred to parliamentary questions.  I have the speech prepared for me and I do not see a reference to the comments he made but I would be happy to stand over them.  The reality is that speaking in the D&aacute;il on the issue the Minister said a third Bill is due on Irish Water.  That is a matter of record.  He said that anything that was not working would be examined.  As I understand it, the Secretary General and the Minister have written to Irish Water to set up direct accountability to Oireachtas Members on queries they might have.  Therefore, at all stages of the debate we have been transparent, accountable and open.</p></speech>

I am sorry to cut across Deputy Murphy but this might be helpful in terms of a question she asked about meters.  I know they are busy installing meters around Leixlip.</p><p>  The approved budget for the metering programme is &euro;539 million, excluding VAT, which includes the supply of the materials and the installation work by contractors operating in eight regions.  The total spend on the programme at the end of 2013 amounted to approximately &euro;35 million.  It is estimated that 1.05 million meters will be installed under the programme, with 400,000 by the end of this year, 800,000 by the end of 2015 and the balance in 2016.  The current rate of installation is approximately 27,000 meters a month and approximately 94,000 meters have been installed to date.  We can give a breakdown region by region.  In the midlands region, 22,064 meters have been installed.  In the west, 6,520 meters have been installed &ndash; they are a bit slow in the west; in the north west 7,012 meters have been installed; a total of 8,550 meters have been installed in the south east; in County Dublin it is 15,646 meters and in the city of Dublin it is 13,613 meters.</p></speech>

The focus of attention has been on water services but there are additional substantial issues at stake.  If one wants confusion in terms of income stream versus expenditure stream &ndash; pardon the pun - then one must look to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Let us look at page 16 of the briefing document, for example.  I have asked parliamentary questions and assembled information.  The general purposes grant is slightly more than &euro;275 million.  There is a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;600 million.  That was provided for in the local government Bill.  One could ask where the &euro;600 million came from.  We can see where the &euro;490 million for water services comes from.  People feel they have been conned on that because they have seen it is coming out of the property tax.  I refer to the fact that it was advertised and people expected 80% would go to their individual local authorities.  They are now asking what they are getting for it.</p></speech>

In terms of the income of local government, some years ago the motor taxation income was ring-fenced for the purposes of having a Local Government Fund.  That has largely proven to be the case.  I have figures from 2006 to 2014.  It is a sizeable amount of money &ndash; close to &euro;1.1 billion.  Basically, what appears to have happened is that in 2012, &euro;46.5 million was taken out of that and given to the Exchequer.  Last year &euro;100 million was given to the Exchequer and this year &euro;600 million is going from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer.  What has happened is that a decision was taken to change the regime in terms of ring-fencing the motor taxation fund.  That fund is now going to the Exchequer.  The money is primarily going to pay the national debt &ndash; the &euro;8.2 billion it is costing this year to service the debt.  We must focus on that.  It is an enormous amount of money.</p><p>  The money is in addition to the &euro;490 million that is going from the local government system to Irish Water.  That is changing the dynamic hugely in terms of local government.  I wish to highlight the language that is being used on savings.  The language that is used refers to savings to the Exchequer in regard to the &euro;2 billion for water services.  The reason it is a saving to the Exchequer is because there is a new income stream, namely, domestic water charges.  The Minister might outline the extent of the domestic component he includes in that.  Some significant changes are taking place.  We got a presentation from both Ministers about what would be done but we did not hear about what will not be done.  I hear expectations all the time about what people are getting for the property tax, why they have to pay water charges and whether it is a conservation measure.  They are the two big issues people raise in terms of the impact of such taxes on their personal finances.</p><p>  The Minister&rsquo;s script referred to amalgamations at local government level such as of the Leader fund.  There has been a dramatic reduction in the Local Government Fund which will affect all of the functions carried out by local authorities such as libraries, arts, parks maintenance, playgrounds &ndash; where they exist - and street lighting.  The fund has been reducing year-on-year.  The allocation for the Local Government Fund is not evenly spread due to variations around the country in terms of the resources and the income from commercial rates.</p> <p>From a breakdown I got from the Department, the likes of Fingal County Council will be getting &euro;165 per head from the local government fund while Leitrim County Council will get &euro;260 per head, understandable due to its small population base.  The areas paying most in property tax will be getting the least amount of money from the local government fund, however.  People in those areas in question are entitled to ask why they are getting so little for their high property tax.</p><p> This week I had to refer ten families, not individuals, to the homeless officer in Kildare County Council.  This happens every week now because of the high level of rents, low rent caps and limited availability of rental properties in the county.  While increased employment with Intel and others in County Kildare is a good news story, it has a negative impact on the availability of rented accommodation.  Up to 50% of those on the national housing waiting list, 45,000 people, are located in six local authority areas, namely, Dublin city, Cork city, Cork county, South Dublin, Fingal and Kildare.  In the case of the bottom six local authorities with the least demand, they account for less than 4% of those on the national housing waiting list.</p><p> There is an absolute crisis in some parts of the country.  It is a misrepresentation when the Minister talks about ending long-term homelessness when we are seeing an escalation in the problem.  Is there anything worse than not having a roof over one&rsquo;s head?  I had a family attend my clinic before Christmas who spent the Christmas in bed and breakfast accommodation.  In all my years as a local authority member, I never saw such a situation.  There is an urgent need for a targeted response to this problem.</p><p> The joint committee recently was told by Dr. Michelle Norris that &euro;480 million from European funds was available for the approved housing body sector.  It could be used to fund housing associations like those in Germany and Holland where there is alternative housing provision.  However, the tier 3 housing associations are not sufficiently capable of drawing down these funds.  We are so fixated on doing headcounts on how few people are working in the Department.  Would it not be better, given that we are spending over &euro;400 million in rent assistance, to increase the number working in the Department to have the expertise to draw down these European funds and make some savings for the Exchequer, as well as boosting conduction sector employment?  I do not get the logic of this.  Will the Minister of State address this question?</p><p> People are confused with figures being bandied around such as &euro;600 million, &euro;490 million and &euro;780 million.  In addition to the moneys going to Irish Water, &euro;600 million is going out of the local government fund.  That is pretty much going from motor tax receipts.  This notion that, with a large fund available to local government, there will be increased local authority services is actually a complete con job.  Essentially, the funds from the property tax are going to service the national debt.  Will the Minister confirm what is happening with the motor tax fund?</p></speech>

Under subhead D3, income and expenditure of the local government fund, income from local property tax comes to &euro;550 million, gross motor tax receipts, &euro;1.16 billion, and interest from local government moneys invested in the NTMA, National Treasury Management Agency, &euro;150,000.  This totals &euro;1.71 billion.  Outgoings are &euro;280 million in general purpose grants, &euro;363 million in public transport infrastructure payments and &euro;600 million to the Exchequer, as the Deputy rightly pointed out.  The fact is the country is broke and we have had conditionality through the troika for the past three years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014012100011#K01100"><p>I wish to respond to the housing issues raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I absolutely share her concern about the number of people waiting on housing waiting lists.  This is the reason that for the first time, the Government has introduced a mainstream construction programme through local authorities.  The Government was unable to do it heretofore.  It was not because it did not wish to do it but in recent years, it simply did not have the money because of the cut-back in the general amount of money available to the Government under the troika, following on from the debacle of what happened to the economy.  However, the Government now has a housing construction programme, of which &euro;65 million will go directly through the local authorities and &euro;35 million through the voluntary sector.  The programmes will be announced as soon as possible this year.</p><p>  I listened to Deputy Murphy specifically on the fact that a small number of local authorities have the largest number of people waiting.   I have specifically instructed in respect of this funding that there be a focus on those local authorities that have demonstrated the greatest need and the longest waiting lists.  I do not wish to spend the money where there are no problems but wish to spend it where the predominant problem exists in respect of housing supply.  This will be part of the policy pertaining to the expenditure of this money.  I am highly conscious that a number of local authorities have particularly long waiting lists.  As for the European money, Ireland has applied under the social investment programme of the European Union.  This European Investment Fund is under the European Investment Bank and we have applied for funding under the scheme.  If the Government gets this money, it expects it will provide approximately 1,500 units.  While a response has not yet been received, it was brought to the Government's attention that there were very few applications under that fund from Ireland over a number of years since the fund was set up.  In fact, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance now is a member of the governing board of the European Investment Bank.  The Government has been made aware that there were fewer applications from Ireland than should have been the case and an application now has been made that is specifically related to the housing sector.  I hope we will be successful in getting funding.</p><p>  The issue of homelessness is a top priority for me and I have stated that clearly.  I set up an oversight group, which has reported and I will bring a memorandum to the Cabinet shortly regarding its recommendations for addressing long-term homelessness in particular, as well as having a housing-led approach to it.  In respect of the involvement of the not-for-profit sector, there certainly is scope for it to become involved in this area and I am working with that sector in this regard.  The Government has now introduced voluntary regulation of the sector, which believes that if it is regulated, it will be better able to attract funding.  This now is under way and eventually will lead to statutory regulation but for the present, voluntary regulation applies and the sector is very supportive of this.</p><p>  Overall, the Government is addressing the housing supply issue in a number of areas, the main one being the return to mainstream construction, which obviously also is important for job creation, as well as applying for European funding.  There is another programme called the social impact investment programme, which is starting this year and which is geared specifically at families.  Again, it involves working with the voluntary sector and is geared towards addressing families in the Dublin area who have presented as being homeless.  The Department also wishes to expand this programme.  The Government is involved in a number of other areas and obviously, it continues to lease and to seek units from NAMA.  In addition, approximately 50% of those who are on housing waiting lists are in receipt of rent supplement through the Department of Social Protection and thereby are in receipt of some housing support.  There will be a gradual movement onto the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which I acknowledge the sub-committee does not have time to go into today.  I accept it is a question of addressing the growing waiting lists and that there are real problems with such waiting lists.  However, the Government is addressing this in a variety of ways and the construction of housing is the new element this year.  There had been construction for people with special needs, for older people and those who are homeless but the construction programme will now revert to being a mainstream local authority programme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1099" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014012100011#K01300"><p>I thank the Minister, the Ministers of State and their officials for their attendance this afternoon.  On the local government section, will each new municipal district will have the opportunity to strike its own rate at its own level?  In the past, they would have struck the rate but some councillors have suggested that flexibility be provided for start-up businesses in particular, perhaps in the retail sector. One might start off with 10% of the rate in the first year, perhaps rising to 30% of the rate in the second year and so on, until reaching 100% by year four or year five.  Will such flexibility be included?  If so, it will be welcomed by many of the new municipal districts, which will be welcoming the additional powers under the legislation.</p><p>  In respect of water services and wastewater, I welcome the establishment of Irish Water and have listened with interest to some of the comments.  It is greatly welcome that it now will be amenable to freedom of information requests.  It also is welcome that since the presentation last week and the presentations by the Ministers and Department, there is clarity on the source of the funding and on what it is being spent.  Irish Water has been clear in that regard.  I also note the negative commentary in respect of consultants and contractors.  When one considers the companies that have been asked to provide the processes and systems, the list includes IT specialists and architects.  I make the observation that one is talking about young people working in those companies and it does them no favours to be disparaging about the work they are doing.  In addition, political footballs have been kicked around at this meeting for the past hour or so and it is only right that I pick it up and kick it back.  It is welcome to hear Fianna F&aacute;il members talk about their concerns regarding spending.  However, I remind them of the messes they left behind.  I think of one in particular that pertains to the environment, namely, electronic voting machines, and I note that at least one company in County Offaly benefitted from dismantling them.  That project certainly gave no value for the taxpayer.  However, I feel strongly about the companies involved and some of the young people working therein.  It is not right to be so disparaging about the work they are doing on behalf of Irish Water.  While it is absolutely clear that it is very important to get value for the taxpayers' money, the testimony the witnesses gave last week from Bord G&aacute;is makes clear the amount of savings it has been possible to put in place for the taxpayer, based on existing services, such as software contracts and so on, which I greatly welcome.  Every effort should be made to ensure a smooth transition from the local authorities because they contain great expertise in this regard.</p><p>  On the community and rural development aspect of the Estimate, I greatly welcome the funding that has been provided.  On the transitional arrangements to be put in place under the new local community development committees, what does the Minister hope to do for this year in order to have it up and running by January 2015?  Coming from the midlands and a rural area, I note these Leader and community development schemes have been really critical to capacity building in these areas.  It will be of critical importance to continue with such capacity-building activities, particularly now when opportunities are to be put in place for retraining and to continue with such schemes.  I greatly welcome this development and seek information on the transitional arrangements.</p><p>  I will turn to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the unfinished estates.  I have been following this issue with great interest even though County Offaly does not have a huge number of such estates, although there are some.  I must note the work that has been done in this regard has been really exceptional.</p> <p>It is a very good news story.  That site resolution fund is being put to great use across the country and I am very glad it will continue to be put in place.  People in the local authority are identifying the areas that need to be prioritised and that is working very well.  I very much welcome that and hope it will be ongoing until all these are resolved because it is a major problem.</p><p> I am very concerned about homelessness.  It is not as big an issue in the midlands as in other counties and I take Deputy Catherine Murphy's points on board.  However the Simon communities in Ireland do outstanding work in this area and they are experts in their field.  I would be most concerned if I thought there would be any reduction in their funding.  They run it all on a shoestring and they have a huge voluntary capacity.  I would like some clarity on their funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12014012100012#L00200"><p>I was involved in the Irish Water controversy.  Back in November I asked parliamentary questions which were not answered.  To assist the Minister in road testing the system I have resubmitted all those parliamentary questions.  Depending on the fullness of the answers we can see whether the new system operates.  Those questions are on their way to the Minister.</p><p>  In the six target urban areas Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, my experience is that the vast majority of landlords are leaving the rental accommodation scheme because they can get a lot of money in the private sector.  In urban areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway there has been a major exodus.  Can we examine ring-fencing that funding to target social housing?  If it cannot be spent in the rental accommodation scheme we need the flexibility to shift the money into other areas to provide accommodation.  Has much of the &euro;15 million carry over of capital funding already been pre-committed?</p><p>  According to page 39, more and more voluntary housing systems are being developed as the model to provide social housing, yet we are still using the RAPID programme to specify disadvantaged areas for applying for funding.  The flaw in the RAPID system is that it excludes people in the rental accommodation system or in voluntary housing.  Many communities are under pressure because they have people in voluntary housing.  In my constituency one of the very clear examples is the Iveagh Trust.  People housed by the trust are not accounted for in the RAPID system because it is not deemed to be social housing.  The Iveagh Trust provides a huge number of social units in an area of deprivation in the city and has been left out of many funding projects.  That whole area has been left out of targeted funding projects for deprived areas.  Should we still be using a model that was designed ten or 12 years ago?  Does it need to be updated?</p><p>  The Minister was going to establish an expert advisory group on climate change on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis until we can get a statutory situation.  The funding is so small it does not come into the Minister's Estimates but I would like some reassurance that it will be set up.</p></speech>

In a project he was involved in there needed to be evidence of much more comprehensive oversight in monitoring and controlling expenditure.  Can the Minister comment on that because people are not necessarily experts on IT systems or on whether one can get &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 a day as a consultant.  All they can go on is whether they are confident in the person who is running it.  The Minister must be aware of Mr. Tierney's past record.  Why is he still in the job?</p><p>  Have some of the people on whom the Minister is spending this money already received money from the local authorities through retirement packages?  If so, how much have they received?  An important question that was not asked of Irish Water is whether we will be able to drink the water and what systems are being implemented so that local authorities do not continue to investigate themselves.</p><p>  The Minister has informed us that if someone is aware that there is a possible problem with his or her septic tank and does not do something about it, he or she is committing a criminal act.  If people do not have money to do something about it, can they apply for a grant or do they need to come out of the tombola, have their tank tested and fail it, following which they are then entitled to a grant?</p><p>  On the issue of solutions to our water pollution problems, what beginning-of-pipe solutions is the Minister considering?  There is a problem with testing the septic tanks.  Has the Minister examined the idea of locally run, community based anaerobic digesters for animal waste as a solution to the problem that the only way the Government can secure drinkable water is if it doses the water with chlorine and numerous other chemicals?  It passes the test but, bar swimming in it, it does not seem to be much use to us.  The Minister will come up with some system that will solve all this.  If we cannot drink the water, will we have to pay for it again?  We are already paying for it through general taxation.</p><p>  I will be very pleased if freedom of information legislation is to apply in this area but it is a little inconsistent with another semi-State entity, Coillte.  If would be easier to get information out of the Kremlin.  The Minister is running the country and does not seem to be too bothered about the fact that there is no freedom of information.</p></speech>

Local authorities apparently have no money to refurbish their houses.  The Government could also buy houses, but there is a problem with that, and the Minister knows it.  If the Government were to provide these people with houses in the morning and they were to move out of the houses they are in, the people who own those houses in the buy-to-let sector would lose out.</p> <p>They would be in serious financial problems and we would take the hit through the banking system.  The problem is that the blanket is not big enough to go around, rather than a solution cannot be found.</p><p> It is great to hear there is significant money available to deal with ghost estates, because going by what the local authority in my county, there is not much money to do anything about them.  Last week, I visited a house on one of these estates and the people living in it now have to pay the property tax.  The situation is a living hell for them and the local authority can do nothing for them because there is no money available.  If I thought I would get away with it, I would go into the estate with a bulldozer and floor the 70 houses that are no longer of use there.  There seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel for these people.  Their house is like an oasis in the middle of the estate, beautifully painted and landscaped.  It is immaculate, but the message being sent out to them and people like them is: "Don't bloody well try in this country, because if you do, you will get kicked in the head."  That is what I see when I go there.  We need more money to deal with this situation, because people who are trying are being punished.  That should never happen, whether one is a socialist, a capitalist or an environmentalist.</p></speech>

The commercial rate will be struck by the county or city authority, not by the municipal district.  However, the municipal district members will be members of the plenary session when that happens, whatever municipal district they are from.  If they want to have certain enterprise initiatives at local authority level, offhand I am not sure what discretion they will have in terms of commercial rates, there is nothing stopping these municipal districts or local authorities generally proposing these initiatives, as they do.  For example, the bid scheme in Cork County Council is working exceptionally well, as is the bid scheme in Dublin City.  These are examples of where the community comes into partnership with local authorities to advance certain enterprise schemes or develop certain enterprise initiatives.  Arising from the changes we are making in local authorities, we want to see local authorities more to the front and centre in regard to enterprise, particularly in regard to promoting small businesses.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the word "consultant" and I agree it was an unfortunate use of word that did not tell the full story in regard to all of the start-up costs required for any public utility.  We needed an ESB, we needed an EirGrid, we needed An Bord G&aacute;is and we needed this public water utility.  As I said earlier to Deputy Cowen, 90% of these costs will be assets of the company.  These costs are necessary to have the asset management systems and for us to sweat down those assets in order to deliver good value.</p><p>  Let me give an example.  Shannon has a very bad situation in terms of waste water treatment systems currently.  Effectively, nobody can connect in to the system there and if we wanted a new foreign direct investment to come into that area, it would be very difficult.  Irish Water is  looking at innovative ways to deal with this, at least temporarily, over the next five to seven years, with a low cost model, pending the new moneys that will come on stream in the future that will mean it can do a much better job.  This is one of the new ways we can tide ourselves over, considering the fact the European Commission is considering launching a new infringement procedure in regard to 80 such plants, which is a concern.</p><p>  The local community development committees which will be and are being established will be the partnerships between local authorities and the communities in terms of operating the local development programmes and new EU funded programmes under the rural development programme.  I expect that after the local elections in July, all of these committees will be in place.  The timescale for the next round is early 2015 and we are working currently on the new plans to be submitted to the European Commission for approval, now that we got agreement in Brussels with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine who is responsible for acquiring the funds for us for the rural development side, just before Christmas.  We are working away at official level with the authorities in Brussels to fine tune the next round and we will come back to this committee to talk about the principles that should underpin this new round of funds.  In regard to the European Regional Development Fund, we are also trying to include an urban based model so that we can accentuate some of the good work that is going on in the context of local development companies. </p><p>  I can confirm for Deputy Humphreys that we will shortly set up the expert group on climate change and put in place the necessary arrangements and funding to make that happen.  I will also make a statement soon on the progress we are making on the climate Bill.  We will take into account some of the important issues raised in committee hearings when discussing the heads of the Bill.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Flanagan, there was open competition for all senior management positions in Irish Water, including Mr. Tierney's position.  He got through the interval panel and he has my full confidence and support for what he is trying to do.  He has a very difficult job in setting up a new utility company, but there are governance arrangements in place for the board and he must report to a board whose members have good skills, including people with legal and governance expertise.  He will report to these people.

Some 50% of the population of Roscommon will have an enhanced water supply.  With regard to people on "boil water" notices, I am prepared to tell the CER that this and such issues must be taken into account before charging these people.  I would see it as very unfair for the regulator not to take these issues into account until such time as the quality of the water in Roscommon is up to the type of standard we should have.  We will include this as part of our submission.</p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the regulator in regard to drinking water quality.  It has a long list of problems where remedial action is required throughout the country and we will need a significant amount of money to deal with the problems.  The EPA has determined there is approximately 1 million people in the country affected by risks in terms of quality, particularly in Dublin and Cork, and of course, Roscommon.  This is a big challenge and that is why we are setting up Irish Water.</p></speech>

If a person discovers there is pollution and suspects it comes from the local authority, whether deliberate or not - it would be highly unlikely it would be deliberate, but accidents happen -  and the person wants to get something done about it, he goes to the EPA and the council then investigates the issue itself.  That is my experience of the EPA.  Despite the best will in the world, it is very difficult for people to investigate themselves.  Let us imagine a member of the public makes a complaint to the EPA in the context of water quality.  People in this country do not like making complaints like this, although they should be proud to do it.  However, if and when they make a complaint about a council supply, they see that the council itself investigates the matter.  We need to change that.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy's experience in Roscommon is that the local authority goes out and investigates itself, but that should not be the case.  The EPA should be doing it as part of the licensing conditions.</p></speech>

We are making good progress on this issue.  The initial funding was for dealing with public safety issues, but a further &euro;10 million was announced in the budge by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This money is specifically for unfinished estates with public realm issues that can be addressed, such as footpaths and public lighting.  We are now asking local authorities to submit proposals for that funding.  The money is for the type of measures mentioned, particularly where there is no bond or an inadequate bond in place.  We expect that funding will also be a stimulus for private funding to be spent on estates like that referred to by Deputy Flanagan.  We expect that if the lenders and developers see there is money coming in from public funds, they will spend money on completing houses etc.  We attend to spend that money in 2014 to address the issues on some estates.  Contrary to Deputy Flanagan's suggestion there is no hope for people, &euro;10 million has been allocated this year to address the issues of unfinished estates.</p></speech>

Deputy Humphreys raised the issue of the shortage of RAS units.  There is a difficulty, particularly in the Dublin area, with regard to the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection for rent supplement accommodation and RAS.  We will keep it under review.  The intention is the funding we have this year will provide for a further 2,500 transfers to RAS.  We will re-examine it mid-year because it changes rapidly.  We will also introduce the housing assistance payment under which people will move to differential rent.  It will be introduced in seven local authority areas in the first phase and will eventually be introduced in all local authorities.  The first phase will start in 2014 and we will monitor it.  The Deputies for Kildare and Dublin will probably disagree with Deputy Flanagan's suggestion that we keep rent supplement going to fill private accommodation.  It is the opposite in some parts----</p></speech>

I stated there is &euro;65 million for local authorities, with &euro;35 million through the voluntary sector.  There is also &euro;15 million, which I did not mention, to bring long-term voids back into use.  Some local authorities in particular have houses which have been empty for a long time.  They are owned by local authorities but have been vacant for a long time because it is very costly and there is not enough money to do them up under the normal housing maintenance budgets.

The local authority would have received rent and the house would not have fallen into disrepair.  I find it incredible that on one street in my town houses have been vacant since the late 1990s.

The Deputy from Fine Gael and I were not given our time slots when we should have been.  We were grouped together, but that is another argument for another day.</p><p>  My question is for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  The banks regularly come before another committee to discuss the issue of mortgage resolution.  The vast majority of shared ownership mortgages are in arrears and the figures we are beginning to receive from local authorities show they are also in arrears on rent on the 50% owned by local authorities.  This is a huge distress factor for the individuals themselves because they are concerned they cannot meet their mortgage repayments and are not able to meet the rental element either.  There seems to be an unwillingness to resolve this issue.  There is no provision in the Estimate for a resolution to these mortgages.  These were all high-risk mortgages in the first instance because they had to have had two refusals from lending agencies.  It is a real drag on local authorities because they are making full repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  The Housing Finance Agency has provision for bad debts or write down.  Is the write down on the mortgage the responsibility of the Department or the Housing Finance Agency?  A large number of families are in a very delicate situation.  It is also causing problems for local authority funding, but there seems to be no resolution for these individuals.  Where should we expect to see funding put in place to resolve mortgage resolution issues in this area?</p></speech>

I agree with the previous speaker that of course the homelessness situation in Dublin, Cork and other such places is worse, but there is homelessness in the four midlands counties and the Midlands Simon Community is trying to firefight.  I ask the Minister and the officials to examine it because I was shocked by the figures.  I also ask for the grants to be re-examined.  Kilkenny received almost three times the amount that Laois did this year for housing grants, mobility aids, housing adaptation and housing aid for older persons, despite the fact the population is only 14% bigger.</p></speech>

Historically many villages and rural areas throughout the country have lost out on water and sewage infrastructure investment because they were not commercially viable and local authorities could not come up with the polluter pays contribution.  How will the interests of those who need services in these areas be safeguarded so that Irish Water does not just use a commercial test to decide it will prioritise on the basis of return on investment, and that these areas, which have suffered and lack infrastructure because they are not commercially viable, will receive the infrastructure promised in due course?</p></speech>

An issue which has been addressed is people on shared ownership can now apply for the mortgage arrears resolution process available to local authority tenants as well as private mortgagees.</p> <p>They can apply under the mortgage to rent scheme as well, which means they return to being renters.

Much of that funding is dependent on the monetary input of the local authorities in the context of the amount allocated overall.  Local authorities have a diminishing ability to put funds towards these grants and they are being penalised as a result in the allocation provided by the Exchequer.  There are four and five year waiting lists, respectively, for these grants in County Offaly.</p></speech>

This is a way of trying to ensure we have as much money as possible for a limited fund and we want the money to go to those who most need it.  The upper limit for the disabled person's grant is &euro;30,000 while the threshold for the elderly person's grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000 but the average grant is &euro;5,000.  Local authorities spread the money around but it is a limited fund.  If we provided a 100% grant from central funds, that would mean less money to go around.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the principal features of the 2014 Estimates for my Department.</p><p>  Members of the House will be aware that my Department oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and. culture.  My Department also seeks to promote the Irish language, to support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of almost &euro;264<b></b>million is available to my Department for these purposes in 2014.  A further &euro;10.5 million - some &euro;6.7 million in current funding and almost &euro;3.9 million in capital funding - is provided through Vote 34 for the National Gallery.<br /><b></b>In broad terms, the 2014 allocations to my Vote group are as follows: over &euro;148 million<b></b>for arts, culture and film, including almost &euro;57 million<b></b>for the Arts Council; over &euro;45 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; more than &euro;41 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; and over &euro;39 million<b></b>for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.</p><p>  As members will appreciate, as a consequence of the need to meet challenging fiscal targets we have just not had the resources available in recent years to fund all the services that we would like to provide.  While the 2014 allocations again reflect the Government's commitment to restoring confidence in our public finances, I welcome in particular the provision of almost &euro;25 million to my Department in respect of economic stimulus measures announced on budget day.  My Department makes a significant contribution to supporting economic activity and employment across the country, both in the sectors that it directly supports and equally in the context of cultural tourism.  The new jobs rich initiatives being funded underline the importance of the role arts and heritage can play in both job creation and economic recovery and will make a considerable positive impact on the arts and heritage sectors throughout 2014.  These initiatives include &euro;10 million for the Cork civic event centre; &euro;6 million for the Limerick National City of Culture 2014; &euro;5 million for the traditional skills and buildings at risk jobs leverage scheme 2014; and &euro;3.7 million for projects relating to the decade of centenaries 1912-1922.</p><p>  I will now provide some further detail in respect of the key areas of expenditure under my direct responsibility.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands programmes.</p><p>  Some &euro;148.5<b></b>million has been allocated to the arts, culture and film subheads, including the National Gallery, this year.  This increased funding, which amounts to more than &euro;2.8 million per week, makes an important contribution to protecting jobs and stimulating creativity across the country.  Ireland's cultural and creative industries also play a major role in defining a positive image for Ireland abroad.  My Department continues to place emphasis on front-line services, as well as on prioritising supports to artists.</p><p>  With regard to film making activities, I was very pleased that the Minister for Finance, in his 2014 budget speech, confirmed his intention to bring forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015 and also to extend the definition of &quot;eligible individual&quot; within the scheme to include non-EU talent.  This will significantly increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment.  The extension of the film tax relief scheme, section 481, until the end of 2020 represented a major vote of confidence in the audiovisual production sector by the Government.  It provides the sector with continuity and certainty for the future and allows projects to proceed in the knowledge that this important underpinning of the industry will be there for the next seven years.</p><p>  Given the significant investment in arts infrastructure in recent years, the focus now is to ensure that resources are made available to support the operation of those facilities.  Nevertheless, a number of significant projects will continue to be funded in 2014 including, for example, the Solas cinema project in Galway and the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen, County Cork.  An additional &euro;10 million<b></b>in funding is being provided to fund the redevelopment of the National Gallery historic wings over the course of 2014 to 2016.  A provision of &euro;1 million is to be provided in 2014, with the remainder in 2015 and 2016.  This project will ensure that the gallery's important collections can be shown and protected in an appropriate forum.  It will also enable the gallery to host international exhibitions and, in the longer term, to increase its contribution towards the country's cultural tourism offering.</p><p>  The valuable work of the Arts Council in supporting the intrinsic cultural, tourism and economic value of the arts throughout the country has been recognised, and this is reflected in the 2014 current allocation of almost &euro;57 million which will allow the council to continue to support arts organisations of varying sizes, from national bodies such as the Abbey Theatre to small, locally-based groups, across a very broad range of individual art forms and arts practices.</p><p>  Culture Ireland, a division of the Department, will continue to promote Irish artists worldwide with the aim of showcasing our world-class strengths in culture and creativity and restoring Ireland's global reputation.  When I announced a new national city of culture initiative last year it was with the aim of delivering a programme of cultural events and engagement in a city for one year, but which also has a longer-term positive impact.  With &euro;6 million in capital funding available, this programme represents a highly significant investment in the arts in the mid-west.  The allocation offers Limerick a fantastic opportunity to unlock the tremendous creativity that has been associated with the city and to put on a programme of events of national importance.</p><p>  The funding of the decade of centenaries is also significant, as it allows us to move ahead with the planning and implementation of major building projects to mark the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  The Government is also providing &euro;10 million in funding for a multi-functional event centre in Cork city.  This project has the potential to provide a significant economic and employment boost to Cork city and county and my Department will work with the city council to progress the project as promptly as possible.</p><p>  Some &euro;10.5 million<b></b>is provided to the Vote of the National Gallery in addition to the &euro;138 million in funding provided for the arts, culture and film sector by my Department.  In 2014, the gallery will continue to focus on delivering the best service possible within the resources available.</p><p>  Funding of some &euro;45.3 million<b></b>has been made available for the Department's heritage programme<b>.  </b>This includes almost &euro;33 million allocated for current expenditure with a further &euro;12.5 million<b></b>in capital funding.  Funding will continue to be made available to support the work of the Heritage Council in its redefined role, the principal function of which will be in the areas of facilitating the grant-aiding of heritage from various sources and engaging with and supporting local government and communities in capacity building and support.  The Department will continue to provide support, protection and advisory services for Ireland's built and archaeological heritage.  This includes policy input in support of cross-governmental sustainability objectives.  With regard to natural heritage, the key outputs in 2014 will focus on the maintenance, development, management and operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and meeting obligations under EU directives.</p><p>  With regard to capital expenditure, the allocation of &euro;5 million on heritage buildings as part of my Department's stimulus measures is the most significant investment in heritage buildings in Ireland in recent times.  The built heritage job leverage scheme will allow for urgent repairs on protected heritage buildings to take place across the country, improving our heritage stock, adding to Ireland's attractiveness as a place to live and work, and generating employment in the construction and skilled crafts trades.</p><p>  I also welcome the decision to extend the living city initiative, introduced last year, to Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin, for all buildings built prior to 1915.  This incentive targets Ireland's historic building stock.  It is a tangible example of the Government's commitment to sustainable development, so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, and it focuses on our existing urban core.  This scheme, which complements the new investment scheme in the built heritage jobs leverage scheme, will ensure that Ireland's major urban cities are enhanced, continue to have vibrant city centres, and encourage increased tourism and direct inward investment.</p><p>  Other capital expenditure in 2014 will focus on two main areas - peatland protection and national park investment.  The protection of Ireland's unique raised bog special areas of conservation is a key concern, as is the avoidance of major fines by the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p> <p>Priority will continue to be given to the turf cutter compensation schemes and investment in alternative turf cutting sites for affected cutters.  A reduced capital budget will target a small number of key tourism investments in the national parks.  Turf cutting and the protection of designated raised bogs remain key concerns for my Department.  I am determined to address this issue in a way that is fair, balanced and supportive of those affected.  The Department and the Peatlands Council will continue to work closely with turf cutters who are required to cease cutting turf on Ireland&rsquo;s 53 special area of conservation raised bogs to ensure their needs are met through relocation to a new bog or compensation.  A national plan will be implemented for the management of these protected habitats, together with an overarching peatlands strategy to set out national policy on the future of all of Ireland's peatlands.</p><p> Other built heritage capital investment will support the activities of the Heritage Council, provide some funding for structures at risk and support the new heritage towns initiative.  My Department is liaising with local authorities and communities with a view to progressing one or more of the sites on Ireland's world heritage tentative list to full world heritage status.  The inscription of another world heritage site could only help to enhance Ireland's growing reputation as a heritage tourism destination and a good environment for economic investment and job creation.  Heritage functions in my Department will continue to be supported through the environment fund in 2014.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has overall responsibility for the operation of the environment fund and will decide on the total level of allocation from the fund in due course.</p><p> Some &euro;41.4 million, comprising current investment of &euro;32.9 million and capital investment of &euro;8.5 million, has been allocated for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands in 2014.  This includes an allocation of more than &euro;17 million for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to enable it to continue its vital work in creating employment opportunities in Gaeltacht areas and developing the skill sets of people in the Gaeltacht, thereby enabling them to take maximum advantage of available employment opportunities.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Estimate for the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and the islands.</p><p> I am committed to developing North-South co-operation within the broader arts, heritage and commemorative activities of my Department, as well as through the funding of North-South bodies.  More than &euro;39 million is being made available to support the two North-South Implementation Bodies, An Foras Teanga - comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency - and Waterways Ireland.  These budgets will be subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council in due course.  The provision will enable Waterways Ireland to deliver on its core activities and targets which include keeping the waterways open for navigation during the main boating season and promoting increased use of the waterways resource for recreational purposes.  This expenditure should also assist in developing and promoting the waterways, attracting increased numbers of overseas visitors and stimulating business and regeneration in these areas.  Capital funding of almost &euro;4 million is being made available to Waterways Ireland to facilitate the ongoing maintenance and restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways, thereby increasing recreational access along waterway routes.  The 2014 provision will also enable An Foras Teanga to continue to support the valuable cultural heritage we share on the island, North and South.  Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency will continue to support language and cultural organisations and schemes throughout the island.</p><p> I am confident that the funds being made available will enable my Department and the sectors it represents to make a significant contribution to growing the economy and helping to create jobs.  I will be happy to expand on any matter Deputies may wish to raise.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh na r&aacute;itis cabharthach at&aacute; tugtha d&uacute;inn ag an Aire agus an Aire St&aacute;it.  Sa bhformh&oacute;r, bheinn i bhf&aacute;bhar formm&oacute;r na li&uacute;ntas at&aacute; luaite anseo.</p><p>  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their presentations.  I will begin with the issue of heritage.  It is important to acknowledge that the Minister deserves to be commended.  While the arts and cultural heritage have an obvious intrinsic value - something of which we were conscious in the context of the recent controversy in Limerick - it is nonetheless worthwhile, valuable and important to emphasise the employment opportunities and economic activity that can flow from the proper development of arts, cultural and heritage resources.  To some extent, this is at play in the Estimates, in which there are two figures in respect of the stimulus package available.  The figure of &euro;18 million is mentioned in one location, while in his presentation the Minister mentioned a figure of &euro;25 million.  Will he give us some indication of how he sees this money being invested and leveraging other funds from the private sector to generate some sustainable employment in particular areas?</p><p>  On a number of occasions here we have welcomed the security the Government has brought to film production and the work of the Irish Film Board.  The investment being made is supported by the arts community and the public.  Given that we have had many years of public investment in film and television production, are we or when will we begin to see some return from that investment to the Exchequer?  I am astonished to read in the document circulated to us the number of films produced with State aid.  I commend all those involved and Bord Scann&aacute;n &Eacute;ireann for the work they have been doing.</p><p>  Expenditure in respect of the National Gallery of Ireland and the national museums is covered by the Estimates.  It is unfortunate that there has been a massive cutback of &euro;740,000 in the funding available for regional centres such as galleries, cultural centres and museums.  I know we are in difficult times, but the value of these centres is enormous.  They are greatly valued by the communities in which they are located.  To return to the point made by the Minister, there are also valuable economic outflows from investment in this area.  Are we, therefore, being penny wise and pound foolish in depriving these art centres of the funding they require?</p><p>  The allocation to the Arts Council has seen radical reductions in recent years.  The Minister now sets out where the focus will be in spending.  One element that has caught my eye is that funding will be concentrated on building based organisations.  What exactly does the Minister have in mind in that regard?  </p><p>  I welcome the provision of &euro;10 million, albeit spread over three years, for the work on the redevelopment of the historic wings of the National Gallery of Ireland.  When we see the numbers visiting the gallery, we know that work needs to be done.  We can appreciate what is being done in it.</p><p>  In regard to the national city of culture initiative, we will refrain from getting into a debate on the situation in Limerick and the unfortunate developments there.  The city of culture initiative is really worthwhile.</p> <p>Everybody who was involved in it deserves to be commended.  I read recently that the Minister has suggested that the next city of culture will not be launched until 2016.  Notwithstanding the hiccups that have been encountered in Limerick, I wonder whether an annual initiative would be feasible.  To what extent has that possibility been examined?</p></speech>

Could consideration be given to the nomination of city of culture on an annual or biannual basis?</p><p>  The investment in built heritage and the Living City initiative are really positive things.  Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin have been prioritised.  Is it intended that the living cities initiative will be extended?  How does the Minister envisage that the leverage system that he mentioned with regard to work on buildings of heritage or architectural value will work?  Does he plan to include other cities or large towns in the initiative?</p><p>  I would like to mention in passing the real tragedy that is befalling this country's heritage.  The loss of our thatched houses, which I have raised with the Minister previously, is certainly a reality in Leinster.  When one drives around the countryside, one notices that the last ten years were particularly devastating for this country's stock of thatched properties.  Sort sort of radical initiative will have to be taken if we are to sustain the small number of remaining thatched properties.  The relevant local authority, as the planning authority, might have to get involved directly.</p><p>  We are all conscious of the controversy surrounding the peatlands work that has been done.  Obviously, the Department has relocated turf cutters and tried to meet their needs.  Can the Minister give us details of the precise cost that has been incurred in all of that to date?</p><p>  The Minister referred to the possibility of adding Irish sites to the lost of world heritage sites.  I think Clonmacnoise has been mentioned in this context.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the huge benefit of heritage and ecclesiastical heritage tourism.  The clerk to the committee will be familiar with the Brigidine centre that is being built in Kildare at present.  Those involved with this development have attracted the attention of substantial numbers of people from all around the world who are interested in the culture and background of St. Brigid.  One would have assumed that this particular field is quite narrow.  When one bears in mind that thousands of people have come to the Kildare area on foot of their connectivity with that issue, one appreciates the value associated with it.  I think the people of Louth want to claim St. Brigid as well as the people of Kildare.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22014012100006#E00800"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for his positive contribution.  He has raised a number of important questions.  The stimulus package can generally broken down as involving &euro;10 million for the centre in Cork, &euro;5 million for the employment leverage fund, &euro;6 million for Limerick and approximately &euro;3.8 million for the GPO project and the development of Teach an Phiarsaigh in Connemara.  That is a general breakdown of the &euro;25 million spend.  All of the projects are very worthwhile.  The contribution from the sale of the National Lottery has been welcomed in those areas.  We are fortunate to have it in our Estimates for this year.</p><p>  The film incentives that were published by the Minister in the recent budget have created broad interest in the film community.  They seem to be attracting a great deal of interest already.  It appears that we will do very well in the film festivals this year.  Films like "Calvary" and "Frank" are getting very good reviews.  We are doing very well in the Sundance Film Festival, which is taking place at present.  It is possible that a number of Irish actors will be in line for Oscars as well.  The film industry is very buoyant at the moment despite the cutbacks at the Irish Film Board.  I am encouraged that so much talent is emerging at production and other levels.  We have a number of young producers and some really exciting new male and female actors.  It is quite encouraging.  There is a very good technical base in this country in areas like cinematography, costume design and set-making.  I hope that this rich source of technical expertise will land some major films for us in the near future.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the return in this area.  It is generally estimated that the film and audiovisual industry is worth over &euro;500 million to Ireland.  A report on the creative industries that we produced over two years ago sets out objectives of increasing that figure to &euro;1 billion and of employing 10,000 people.  At the moment, over 6,500 people - full-time equivalents - are involved in the film industry.  There is a major payback on the small amount of money we are investing in the film industry.  The Irish Film Board is one of the most efficient boards in the country.  It employs approximately 18 people, including a chief executive.  This streamlined and focused organisation has been recognised in Cannes and at other film festivals for the good work it is doing.  The film industry is quite vibrant at present.  The animation industry, which turns over approximately &euro;60 million a year, is making major progress as well.  It is growing because it attracts younger people.</p> <p>They are well versed in technology and so on.  The sector is now attracting that type of individual graduating from the colleges which have adapted to the animation industry and are very animated about the subject.  The film industry is vibrant.  I look forward to the day when either I or somebody else will say funding for it will be increased because it deserves support. </p><p> Let me give another statistic: 20% of the people who visit Ireland choose to come here because they have seen Ireland depicted in a film.  That is why the film industry is so important.  West Kerry has an extraordinary association with the film "Ryan's Daughter" which put it and Dingle, in particular, on the map.  "The Quiet Man" did the same for Cong, County Mayo.  The attention generated by both films is proof that a film can have a major promotional and marketing effect on an area or county.  </p><p> Regional centres were mentioned.  Unfortunately, I agree with the Deputy that cutbacks have an impact across the country.  In general, spending on regional centres is spread across the country.  There has been spending on the Hunt Museum in Limerick, the Foynes Flying Boat Museum which did not have its funding cut, Archbishop Marsh's Library, Culture Night in Dublin and the regions, as well as the James Joyce Centre which also did not have its funding cut.  In general, however, cuts were made to the funding for such schemes.  There is also funding to meet EU and Council of Europe commitments, participation in the European digital library and ongoing support for local and regional museum schemes.  I agree that this is one area in which funding is distributed across the country and the cut in funding was commensurate with others in other institutions.  We will try to limit the cuts as much as possible, but we have maintained the figure for the main agencies and museums to an average of about 4%.  The cuts have probably affected programmes and other initiatives more than the museums.</p><p> Let me explain the rationale behind the choice of Limerick as national city of culture.  After I was appointed Minister, I was in Limerick on a number of occasions when I witnessed the city's vibrant arts community.  It struck me that Limerick was probably not recognised to the extent it should be and was not respected or appreciated for the level of arts activity in the city.  At the time we were preparing for the EU Presidency.  As the European City of Culture initiative was in my area and part of the Creative Europe initiative, obviously I was very conscious of the concept.  Derry had been designated the city of culture - or Londonderry as it was referred to it - in the United Kingdom and received a lot of media attention.  It dawned on me that we should have a national city of culture and Limerick was chosen to be included in the pilot project.  In parallel, the Limerick regeneration implementation group, under the tutelage of Mr. Denis Brosnan, was considering a similar initiative.  In other words, it wanted to capitalise on the strength of culture for regeneration purposes.  Mr. Brosnan and people like Mr. Mike Fitzpatrick, now acting CEO, got a group together and made a good presentation on the connection.  I suggest everyone, including the media, read the presentation, as it proves where the city of culture initiative originated.  It made much of the opportunities the city of culture brand would give Limerick in terms of regeneration.  The city is far advanced in terms of physical infrastructure, but the presentation dealt with the cultural aspects.  The group commenced its examination in October 2011 and presented a very good report in May 2012.  In the meantime, my officials had drawn up the necessary criteria in choosing an Irish city of culture; we supplied a memorandum to the Government in June 2012 and announced Limerick as the first city of culture in July that year.  It was quite clear that Limerick City Council would be the implementing body, together with the regeneration group, and that all personnel and programming issues would be dealt with by them and that the Department would adopt an arm's length approach.  Obviously, we would provide the funding, but we simply did not have recourse to provide it in the 2013 budget.  Again, we were lucky we had national lottery funding available.  If we had not, the funding would have had to come from either a special allocation by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or my Department's core funding for the arts, thus reducing funding for the arts across the entire country.  The sum of &euro;6 million was provided and the city of culture organisers received an indication that it would be provided in April.  They went ahead and produced the programme of events based on that sum.  </p><p> The city of culture programme is a very good one.  There was a great opening night which some Members may have seen on national television.  It was a positive event when Dolores O'Riordan and Paul O'Connell expressed their pride in their city.  The organisers put on a strong display, particularly as it was being held on New Year's Eve.  I have since opened a photographic exhibition by Franz Haselbeck, one of the greatest photographers this country has produced.  The centre that houses the exhibition was full to capacity on that occasion. </p><p> Last weekend a production of Riverdance was performed in Limerick and extra performances had to be added to accommodate the demand for tickets.  The show was a resounding success, particularly for its creator, Mr. Bill Whelan.  It was great for him to return to his city for the first time with the show, which resonated with the audience and attracted a great deal of attention.  I am very confident that the programme for the city of culture will be dynamic for the year ahead and that it will be successful.</p><p> I will respond to the request to extend the Living City initiative.  The initiative which covered Limerick and Waterford last year had come from my Department.  We presented it to the Department of Finance last year and this year it was extended as a result of the Bacon report.  We had engaged Dr. Bacon to examine the initiative and make recommendations.  We will monitor the scheme very carefully.  I agree that if has worked in the designated cities, it can work in core urban areas.  </p><p> I share the Deputy's view of thatched houses and I am quite worried that they are disappearing.  There are a number of reasons for their decline.  First, the cost of insurance is a major factor.  Second, there is the cost of thatch and the availability of thatchers with the necessary skills.  That is also a source of worry.  There is a grant available from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and on foot of what the Deputy has said, I will examine whether another initiative and incentive could be created.  Thatched houses are very much part of the Irish landscape and culture and should be protected as much as possible.</p><p> With regard to expenditure on peatlands, we have spent over &euro;7.4 million since 2011 on relocation, compensation and turf deliveries.  That represents a huge part of the Department's budget.</p> <p>This expenditure is important because, as I have explained to a number of people, we were at the door of the European court.  The European Commission is very serious about this issue.  It allowed us a long period to get our house in order, but ran out of patience and if there was to be any regression now on extensive cutting of the SACs, we would end up in court.  I believe the threat is not an idle one.  This could result in fines of up to &euro;25,000 a day and a lump sum - anything up to &euro;9 million a year.  I would prefer to give money to the people living in rural Ireland and to protect our bogs which are important in the context of climate change, flood control, nature and services for the community and the public.  I would prefer to give the money to people to protect our bogs rather than pay it in fines to Europe.</p><p> With regard to world heritage sites, the brand of world heritage site is important.  When we go to Italy, Greece or other European countries, we see how seriously they promote these sites.  Ireland has several heritage sites, but we only have two world heritage sites, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Skellig Michael.  There is a reason for this.  Clonmacnoise, for example, would be an iconic world heritage site, but the people there, particularly the farmers and landowners, fear they would not get planning permission because of planning restrictions for world heritage sites.  This is one of the main reasons it is not a world heritage site.  The case is similar in regard to the C&eacute;ide Fields.  I have met people from that area and they share the same concerns regarding planning.  </p><p> I organised a meeting and brought people over from Europe and UNESCO to explain the implications for designation as a world heritage site.  Following that meeting, a number of community groups and councils are reviewing their situations and hopefully something will come from that.  I believe that if the fear of planning restrictions was overcome, more proposals would come forward.  Unless proposals are agreed locally by communities and the local authorities, we cannot impose a designation on them.  There are a number of proposals on the tentative list, including Georgian Dublin, that could be pursued.  We hope that following the meeting and consultation, we will receive some proposals we can take forward.  The world heritage brand is an important one to have and could be part of our unique selling point from the archeological, architectural and tourism points of view.  We will pursue this.</p><p> In regard to North-South co-operation, An Foras Teanga gets &euro;13.58 million and Waterways Ireland gets &euro;24.18 million.</p></speech>

The living cities initiative is welcome and appears to have worked quite well in Limerick and Waterford during its pilot phase.  The initiative will now be extended to other urban centres, but will the Minister elaborate on the criteria the Department has laid down for selection of urban centres.  Is it based on scale, on population or on other factors?</p><p>  In regard to UNESCO world heritage sites, we would all welcome the inclusion of some of the sites mentioned today on the tentative list.  I am aware Monasterboice in my constituency is included in the list of monastic sites.  Will the Minister inform us of the current status of the list?  This process has been going on for a considerable number of years, but it is not clear what the obstacles are in terms of advancing designation.  The Minister mentioned fears that have been communicated to him - I have heard similar concerns - from individuals concerned by the planning implications in terms of designation of a world heritage site.  To be frank, the value and richness of our cultural heritage should take priority over some of these concerns, some of which may not be entirely legitimate.  It would be helpful if we could alleviate those concerns in some way.  Are these concerns contributing to the delay in designation of these sites or to the delay in advancing these projects to the next phase?</p><p>  In page 29 of the document, the Minister referred to the decade of centenaries and stated that priority will be given to a limited number of capital projects acknowledging the Easter Rising and the birth of the Republic.  Will the Minister re-apprise the committee of the particular projects involved?  On page 31, reference is made to an updated management plan for the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne world heritage site.  What kind of improvements does the Minister envisage will stem from this and where does he see these improvements happening in terms of management of the site?</p><p>  I would like to refer to the Limerick city of culture initiative.  We are all agreed an initiative of this nature is very important for developing Irish culture, in the context of recognising the contribution that practitioners in particular areas make.  Generally there is a positive contribution, economically, socially and culturally to any area that receives such a designation.</p> <p>Does the Minister agree it would be more open and transparent from the start to have towns or cities engage in a competitive public call for expressions of interest for such a mantle?  This would be a more positive way to approach such an initiative.  It seems we are determined to award city of culture designation to other cities and towns in the coming years.  That would be positive, but we should have a competitive process to ensure the playing pitch is level and seen to be so.  It is also critical that we have a higher proportion of practitioners and artists involved in the process from the outset if it is to be given the legitimacy it should have.  I would appreciate the comments of the Minister on this point.  If we are to pursue the initiative again which is, by and large, positive, I would like to see a commitment from the Minister and the Department that it will be an open process, with public calls for expressions of interest in participating in such a scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22014012100009#H00200"><p>On the last question about the city of culture, the Deputy knows this is an important year for Limerick.  There is a change in governance, with the city and county areas amalgamating, which is seen as a seismic change.  The regeneration implementation group requested that it receive the designation this year to help with the process.  That was the reason.  I said Limerick city of culture would be treated more or less as a pilot project, but from now on there will be an open competition.  Originally, we thought we would hold it every two years.  This would have taken in 1916, which will be a major year of culture.  We thought people would need a longer run-in, but if the regeneration implementation group had sought to cover 2015 or 2016, we would have granted its request.  It is a coincidence that this is a major year for Limerick and the cultural sector was seen as another facilitator in the regeneration of Limerick.  In the future the city of culture designation will be based on an open competition which will be launched shortly.  I hope to announce the next city of culture at the closing event of the Limerick city of culture programme.  There is interest in other cities.</p><p>  In 2020 we will mark the European city of culture in Ireland and there will be a major competition for it.  This will help cities to focus on their applications for designation as European city of culture.  The last Irish city chosen was Cork in 2005.  Dublin has been chosen previously.  We hope the designation in Ireland will focus city on the strength of their applications.  The emphasis will very much be on arts and culture and the events planned for the year.  Community involvement will be very important, particularly among local arts practitioners.  When there were issues with the Limerick board, I requested members of the arts community to be brought on board and they have responded.</p><p>  Fostering creativity is important as one of the criteria set.  Limerick is promoting itself as a technology hub.  Those promoting it see culture as an intrinsic part of promoting Limerick as a technology hub and centre of creativity.  There will be an application system which will be put in place shortly.  We will announce it this year such that there will be a three year run-in to 2018 and it is already attracting attention.</p><p>  The Living City initiative has created much interest.  The Heritage Council carried out a review of how to make towns and population centres more attractive to live in.  The review which ties in with the Living City initiative was carried out by Mr. Peter Bacon.  I launched the report last week and it gives a very good insight into how effective the Living City initiative can be.  We will carry out an overview of its effectiveness and what it yields in terms of conservation, preservation, job creation and a return to the Exchequer.  If it meets these challenges and withstands the economic tests, I will promote its continuation and extension to other areas beyond those specified.</p><p>  A number of issues have arisen regarding Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  My Department met Louth County Council and the local community in considering an updated management plan for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  The current plan is out of date and the most difficult issue concerns planning and how the needs of local communities can be met without putting the world heritage status at risk.  Engagement is ongoing on the new management plan for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and other areas.  Planning is the central issue.  Families living on the periphery are concerned that they may not receive planning permission in the future because the zone outside the site has been frozen.  If it could be loosened up, it would allay the fears of those who are concerned about the matter.  This applies particularly to Clonmacnoise and the C&eacute;ide Fields, but several more sites could be designated.  I have a particular interest in the issue on which I will continue to work.</p><p>  With regard to expenditure on the decade of commemoration, including the 1916 Rising, the capital projects that will progress will be completed by 2016.  They include the GPO which will have a major cultural and interpretive centre located within it.  There has been considerable planning and the artefacts are in place.  A vast number of artefacts remain from 1916.  Last week, at the launch of the military pensions archive, we saw the amount of information available that had not been made public before.  There is the capacity to have something exciting that will not only honour the people of 1916 but also provide a major boost for the GPO and O'Connell Street.  It will result in a high footfall and could rejuvenate that part of the city.</p><p>  Another ongoing development is the enhancement of Kilmainham Courthouse, a fine architectural building in Kilmainham Gaol.</p> <p>There was an issue in regard to catering for the large numbers who visited it.  It did not have proper facilities to hold the groups of people who visited and the result was that it could take only a certain number of people.  The availability of the courthouse will certainly facilitate visitors and provide them with services.  Food, memorabilia and so on will be available.  All of that will be enhanced by the addition of the courthouse.</p><p> The military service pension project incurred some expenditure.  Currently, we are working on Teach an Phiarsaigh in Connemara with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That is a very important project for which funding has been provided.  I suppose they are the main capital projects we envisage.</p><p> There is another private project in Moore Street which, hopefully, will go ahead.  NAMA has announced an allocation of &euro;6.5 million for that project but it is in private ownership.  If planning issues and other issues with Dublin City Council can be resolved, there is a strong possibility that the project could be delivered.  There are proposals for Richmond Barracks and for a tenement building also.  They are the main projects at this point.</p></speech>

In regard to heritage, one of the best moves made was the appointment of heritage officers in each county council.  One of the disadvantages of the downturn is that they have had less money to distribute.</p><p>  I very much welcome the buildings at risk leverage scheme and the provision of &euro;5 million.  I know a number of people who own buildings at risk and, in many ways, they have been victims of the downturn.  One of the criteria attaching to the application for funding under the buildings at risk leverage scheme is that they must provide matching funding up to the maximum of &euro;15,000.  Will the Minister consider revising that because some of those people who are genuinely in possession of key structures may not be able to match funding to that level and yet they would need that level and possibly more?  Will the Minister consider that where people are able to prove they cannot match that funding?  Overall, I very much welcome that scheme.  </p><p>  The Arts Council has been under-funded for years, even at the height of the boom.  The developmental work it is doing in terms of the arts is second to none.  It should be commended on what it is doing.  I am a little worried that the reason for the reduction is that it is to focus its support on the clients' artistic rather than administrative needs.  Many of its clients, in particular smaller companies, would perhaps need the assistance of administrators to help with application forms and so on and I am a little worried that might have a negative impact on them.  I would very much appreciate it if the Minister explained the thinking around that.</p><p>  I refer to the funding of our national institutions.  I do not believe I have ever got in free to museums or to various other institutions abroad.  I have noticed that if a particular project is being developed, such institutions have a donations box.  Is this something at which we should consider in the National Gallery and the National Museum, which are outstanding resources for ourselves and for visitors.  Would it be possible to have a donations box discretely but visibly placed?  International travellers are used to paying for things, so a donations box could be a good way to raise some money.  I would like to know if that has been examined.</p><p>  I very much welcome developments in regard to Irish Film Board, the continued support for section 481 and the work the film board is doing in supporting film-making.  We have some very fine people involved in the film-making business and they are tremendous ambassadors for us internationally.  However, I would like to know if any consideration is being given to encouraging the Irish Film Board to focus on regional film-making.  I see the benefit of regional film commissions, one of which I am involved in, and those involved would like it to be developed throughout the country.  Has the Irish Film Board been requested to examine the potential of supporting regional film-making?  </p><p>  The philanthropy scheme was a great idea.  What has been the uptake?  It has been on the go for a year and half.</p><p>  Culture Night and the City of Culture are great initiatives.  The fact Culture Night has gone nationwide has really added something new to the calendar culturally and artistically in rural and urban areas.  It is a date in almost everybody's diary and I very much support it.  I also very much support the City of Culture initiative, which has great potential.  In the future, I suppose people will vie for it but I would like to see it extended to county towns as well as cities.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by the Peatlands Council and commend the two chairs, Mr. Conor Skehan and Mr. S&eacute;amus Boland, and all of the stakeholders on their very responsible and constructive approach to dealing with this matter.  The Minister mentioned the cost to date but does he have a total figure on what it will cost or is there a fixed budget for it in the short term to solve the problems throughout the country?  </p><p>  In regard to Waterways Ireland, a consultation process is underway to review regulations and costs.  I am a little concerned by some matters raised with me by users of the waterways, in particular the canals, for leisure and recreational purposes and whether these will cause more problems.  They are concerned about having to move their boats on a more regular basis and the costs involved.  Will that have a negative impact on tourists and indigenous users?  Is there a reason for doing this?  Is it to bring us into line with Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

This year we were able to slightly increase our funding to the Heritage Council, taking into consideration the very important work it is doing and to ensure it can continue to support heritage officers.  In regard to the whole area of matching funding for buildings at risk, we are trying to spread the &euro;5 million as far as possible.  The more generous the grant the less funding there is for distribution.  When one breaks it down based on population per county and the number of protected structures in each county, which we are doing, the amount is quite small when distributed to each local authority.  We are trying to leverage as much funding as we can for this scheme.  We will keep it under review.  The reason we have had such a short lead-in time was to encourage people to apply as soon as possible, so work could be carried out and we could evaluate the scheme at the end of the year and perhaps look for more funding next year to continue with it.</p> <p> Regarding the idea of a donation box, that is something I have encouraged.  If one goes into the National Museum next door, one will see a donation box at the entrance.  I have encouraged the other national cultural institutions to provide a donation box so that people who want to contribute can do so.  The amount of goodwill towards in the National Museum, in the form of donations, is quite significant.  It is working very well.  I do not know exactly how much money will be collected by the end of the year but it is certainly the case that people are giving generously.  In the past, visitors to the National Museum who wanted to make a donation there and then could not do so.  On the other hand, it is important to remember that the National Museum, the National Library and our other national cultural institutions belong to the people and access to them should be free.  As with many other museums around the world, we can encourage people to make contributions while not charging an entrance fee.</p><p> On the Irish Film Board and the question of regional distribution, film making in the regions can prove to be very difficult logistically although with modern technology,  that situation is improving.  However, taking film crews out of Dublin and into the regions can be very expensive.  Overall, the film industry is doing quite well.  "Penny Dreadful" is now being filmed in Ardmore Studios, "The Vikings" was completed in Ashford, while "Ripper Street" may be back again in Clancy Barracks.  There have been some very positive developments this year.  At various international film festivals, Irish film makers, actors, producers and others involved in the industry will be recognised this year.  The film industry, despite the cutbacks, is quite vibrant at the moment.</p><p> With the drawing up of the financial framework, it was obvious that my Department, like others, would have its budget cut.  The Government made a commitment to examine the possibility of using philanthropy to make up the shortfall in funding.  My Department introduced a philanthropy scheme.  In the first year of operation, we had a very small allocation for philanthropy of &euro;250,000 but that leveraged up to &euro;800,000.  In the second year we focused on the arts in education and with a philanthropy budget of &euro;190,000 we leveraged a further &euro;400,000.  Parallel to that initiative in the Department, the Arts Council has a programme called RAISE, through which it is funding major organisations to enable them to raise money from business.  Business-to-arts funding is very vibrant at the moment.  Sporting organisations are very professional at raising philanthropic funding and the arts organisations are getting better at it.  In the United States, philanthropic donations are keeping the arts going.  Two thirds of the budget of the Lincoln Centre, for example, comes from philanthropic donations, amounting to $900 million.  We are trying to encourage the same type of giving to the arts here.  The level of philanthropic giving is quite low in Ireland in comparison with other countries, despite the fact that Irish people are very generous overall.  We must promote the arts more as a target for philanthropic donations.  </p><p> Culture Night is going very well and more centres are getting involved every year.  The involvement of Northern Ireland last year was a very welcome development.  The event received an enormous amount of television coverage in 2013, which was very important.  Culture Night involved 34 locations last year and is growing very well.  On the extension of the City of Culture concept, once we have gone through all of the cities in the country, it can be extended to larger towns.  It happens every four years and it involves a high level of collaboration in the designated cities between the various arts agencies.  It is very important to involve the arts community at all times in that.  In larger urban areas, it is a way of bringing split communities together.  Culture is a great uniter, from a national, European and, most importantly, local point of view.  </p><p> On the Peatlands Council, I am glad the committee has recognised the work of people like Conor Skehan and S&eacute;amus Boland.  The members of the Peatlands Council have come up with a very good national peatlands strategy which identifies issues like climate change, flood control, the services that peatlands provide to the farming community through things like pollination and tourism potential.  The consultation document, the National Peatlands Strategy, is the first of its kind in this country.  It looks at a range of issues and includes some 700 submissions.  It has now been put out for public consultation and hopefully it will be added to and improved further.  Our peatlands make up 20% of our national landscape and are quite unique in the world.  The Irish raised bog is unique and that is why the peatlands strategy is so important.  Rural communities are represented by organisations like the IFA and environmentalists are represented by various groups from the environmental pillar.  They have all come together to develop a very good national peatlands strategy.  I would like acknowledge the leadership of Conor Skehan and S&eacute;amus Boland and the work of all those who were involved in developing the strategy.</p></speech>

The Minister said that in the past year, over &euro;7 million was spent on relocation expenses, compensation and so forth.  In the context of the CAP, there was a hope or an expectation that there would be some funding that could be allocated to those landowners whose holdings include special areas of conservation, SACs, but who are paid very little to leave as is.  It was hoped that environmental funds within the CAP budget could be geared in their direction to address issues such as maintenance, flood control and other issues in those SACs.  That would then be more akin to the type of compensation deemed necessary or appropriate for those landowners who have many acres which are designated as SACs and from which they derive very little income.  Such landowners do not have the same options as those who have turf banks in the context of relocation expenses and compensation.  For example, if a landowner has four acres it has a certain value and to be compensated with a turf bank at another location is not adequate.</p> <p>I am aware that the Minister has faced a dilemma in trying to address this issue, but I understand there is an option to address it in the environmental element of expenditure under the Common Agricultural Policy.  I hope it will not be sucked into the REPS which does not shine a light on those caught in this bind.  Having spoken to some members of the Peatlands Council earlier in the year, I know the possibility of offering an olive branch was dependent on a successful conclusion of the CAP negotiations.  What is the position now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22014012100012#L00300"><p>I wish to address the targets set in the Estimates.  The target for 2013 was to end turf cutting on raised bogs.  That target was missed on what the Minister terms SSE raised bogs and what I call "so-called SSEs".  For how much longer will he continue to kid himself, given that there are 9,000 turbary rights land owners on the 53 so-called SSEs and that after 18 years of coercion or trying to convince people - a phenomenal level of scaremongering - only 796 landowners out of the total of 9,000 with turbary rights have followed what he has tried to get them to do?  When does he think he will have the issue resolved?</p><p>  The Minister mentions - in fairness to him, it has been very carefully worded - that he accepts that none of the 53 so-called SSEs has seen successful relocations.  This is borne out by the statement that three groups on three bogs have accepted relocation, but after all this time, since 1997 - some say as far back as 1992 - none of the issues has been resolved.  There is a variety of reasons for this, but the major reason is that people would like to have something similar to replace what they have; it is a case of it being like for like.  The reason this will not work, even in 1,000 years - the same reason applies to the 45 NHAs that the Minister is considering de-designating within three years and having everyone involved agree to relocation - is that the authorities must learn the lesson that until one offers like for like, one will not arrive at a solution.  Whether it be a house, bog or any piece of property or land, if one does not offer like for like, one will not get a deal.  If somebody was to come to the door of a city dweller to tell him or her that he or she had to get out of the house, he or she would be annoyed.  It might be easier to accept if a person was told he or she might be given another house, but if a person were to discover that after 65 years, he or she or his or her family had to leave the house, he or she would not accept it.  Unless the Minister offers like for like, the deal will never be accepted.  The Minister can keep trying to convince people it is working and set himself a target of 2014-16 to stop them cutting turf on the so-called SSEs, but until he plays ball and does things fairly, that will never happen.  </p><p>  On the issue of commemorating the 1916 Rising, I suggest the best way to do so would be to allow people to cut turf without dragging them through the courts and calling them bad citizens and criminals.  The best way to celebrate the centenary of the 1916 Rising is not with a load of fluff but a dose of reality.  Let me say one thing for sure: I will go and cut turf in 2016, as will many others.  The target date of 2013 was not achieved and the target date of 2014 will not be achieved until the Minister treats people fairly.  Otherwise, the memory of the 1916 Rising will only ever be a memory and we will have learned nothing of what those involved stood for - freedom.  There is no freedom to be gained in what the Minister is offering.</p></speech>

The people are far from happy, as far as relocation or the criteria that apply to it are concerned.  They have been told that if a person was not cutting turf, he or she will not get anything, or if he or she was cutting turf when he or she should not have been doing so.  There is confusion and double speak.  It is very clear to me that people are not happy and that the issue should be addressed.  There is no point in saying it has been sorted out and that people have relocated because they are not getting like for like.</p></speech>

I remind the Minister's officials that as this is a select committee meeting they may not participate in the debate and are here only to be of assistance to the Minister, if required.  I mention this because the committee secretariat was suitably admonished recently for allowing interventions by officials at a previous meeting of the Select Sub-Committee on Health.  Under Standing Orders, officials are not permitted to contribute to the debates of select committees.   I remind everybody to switch off their mobile telephones.</p><p>  The purpose of this meeting is consideration of the 2014 Revised Estimates for Public Services: Vote 40 - Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  As Members will be aware, the 2014 Revised Estimate was presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme-based format.  This means that the Revised Estimate, as presented, contains the following information for each programme: how it is proposed to spend the money allocated to this programme and the previous year's outturn in each case; the number of staff assigned to work on the programme and how this compares with the previous year; performance-related information; departmental outputs, again with corresponding information for previous years; and what are termed "performance" and "impact" indicators with previous years' information.  Administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than was previously the case.  </p><p>  The Revised Estimate provides us with an opportunity to review whether targets set and the distribution of moneys across the Vote for 2014 are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate best use of resources.  It also provides us with an opportunity to explore issues facing the Minister in terms of the allocation for 2014.  A timetable for the meeting has been agreed and circulated.  It allows for the Minister and all spokespersons to make a ten minute opening statement, which will be followed by a debate on the 2014 Revised Estimate, with questions on each programme listed therein.  As this is the Minister's first appearance before us this year, I take this opportunity to wish her and her officials a happy and prosperous new year and invite her to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.837" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22014012100003#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the 2014 Revised Estimates for Vote 40 of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Under the Revised Estimates for 2014, my Department has been allocated funding of &euro;997 million, which includes more than &euro;955 million in current funding and &euro;42 million in capital funding.  When appropriation-in-aid receipts of just over &euro;22.8 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2014 is &euro;974.3 million.  This level of funding represents an increase of more than &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million.  I will explain the reason for this increase later, but it is due largely to the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  Under the new performance accounting arrangements introduced in 2012, the subhead structure of Vote 40 is based on three new major programme areas: programme A &ndash; children and family support programme; programme B &ndash; sectoral programmes for children and young people; and programme C &ndash; policy and legislation.  The largest single component of the increase in the Vote for this year is the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which, I am glad to say, took effect on 1 January 2014.  This is a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families.  The level of funding allocated to the agency is over &euro;602 million in current funding and &euro;6.8 million in capital spending.  As Deputies will be aware, the key tasks facing the agency include achieving a better management and consistency of approach so as to deliver a world-class Irish service model of child welfare and protection.  We all know the legacy.  The challenge now is to provide that world class services.  While this will not be provided overnight, we are well on the road to achieving it.  The establishment of the agency brings together key services relevant to children and families, including child protection and welfare and education services previously provided by the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Education Welfare Board.  The challenge now is implementation.  As I stated, reform of services for children and families will not be achieved overnight and requires a sustained effort to address weaknesses. </p><p>  The 2014 Estimates provision is for expenditure due for payment in the current year and will not go towards meeting any over-spending or deficits arising in previous years.  I acknowledge that there are significant demands on the services for which the Child and Family Agency is responsible.  These arise from demographic and social factors, such as alcohol and drugs, and from the fact that people are now more aware of how important it is to intervene and do the best for children.  In recognition of these demands, the Government made an additional provision in budget 2014 of &euro;6.7 million, rising to &euro;12 million in a full year, to support the major reform of child welfare and protection services, which is under way.  This additional investment will support ongoing reforms which are aimed at improving the quality and capacity of child protection welfare services in response to the historic legacy of failings highlighted in numerous reports and in response to increased demand in child protection referrals.  We all know that referrals increased by almost a third in 2012 and 2013 to more than 40,000.  It appears at this point that referrals will continue to increase going forward.  Our population has increased and the number of children going into care is reflective of that increase.  By international standards, we have relatively low numbers of children in care.</p><p>  I have issued a performance statement to the agency under the Child and Family Act 2013 setting out overall priorities for 2014, and specifically the priorities for the deployment of the additional resources provided.  The agency is currently finalising its business plan for 2014.  The plan was discussed by the agency's board last week and I expect to receive it shortly.  The business plan will detail the use the agency will make of the resources available to it and its plans to recruit key additional staff based on the additional funding provided in the budget.  I wish the board of the new agency, led by Ms Norah Gibbons, and all of the staff of the agency, led by the chief executive, Gordon Jeyes, well.  A huge amount of work, in terms of establishment of the agency, has been completed, not least by the staff of my own Department.  A HR programme has now been put in place following consultation with the trade unions, employers and staff.  The transition of the 4,000 staff has been completed and the budget has been separated out.</p><p>  The free preschool year is expected to cost &euro;175 million in 2014.  This is a universal programme and expenditure arising is a function of the number of children in the eligible age range.  I was pleased to learn recently from the latest published tranche of the Growing up in Ireland, GUI, study on children aged five in this country that their transition to primary school had in the main been very successful.  The researchers also commented on the value of the preschool year in terms of preparing children for school.  This information is very helpful.  This is the first time we have had a group of children studied in this detail who have made the transition to school having availed of the free preschool year.  Some 68,000 or 94% of children eligible for the free preschool year are benefiting from it.  Participating service providers are required to implement S&iacute;olta and Aistear as much as possible.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the preschool year is available free to parents.</p> <p>I am glad we have been able to continue to provide that and obviously I hope to develop it, as I have often said previously.</p><p> Funding of child care programmes continues to be a major item of expenditure for the Department.  The funding allocation for 2014 amounts to &euro;79.129 million, comprising current expenditure of &euro;75.879 million and capital expenditure of &euro;3.250 million.  We subsidise the cost of child care for parents with low income and those who are accessing education and training programmes.  We provide for this in the community child care subvention, CCS, and child care education and training support, CETS, programmes, which continue to be rolled out every year.  At the meetings of this committee we have commented on the importance of child care to families, and we are anxious to continue the programmes we have.  We have been able to achieve some developments as well.</p><p> An additional &euro;4 million has been made available to this subhead in 2014 to support the quality agenda for preschool services.  Members of the committee are aware, as we have discussed this several times, of the range of actions that have had to be taken in respect of quality in the preschool sector.  We are making progress on a number of those elements.  That includes legislation to provide for a registration system for preschool services in Ireland, and I thank Deputies in the committee who supported the legislation in the House before Christmas.  A further &euro;500,000 in additional funding is being made available to provide for the recruitment of additional preschool inspectors.  The Child and Family Agency will work on that.  There are a number of preschool inspection reports on the website.  The legislative change provided for the statutory registration of preschool services. There are new enforcement powers for the inspectors and there are increased penalties at District Court level for any offence under the Act.  The process also involves the preparation of new national preschool quality standards, the recruitment of additional inspectors and increasing the minimum qualification requirements for staff working in preschool services.</p><p> The area based childhood programme, co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies, will receive an allocation of &euro;4 million in 2014.  This is an increase of &euro;1.5 million over the 2013 allocation.  It is worth noting that this budget allocation is going to areas where there are huge needs and where children and families need support.  I am pleased that this Government has been able to provide a budget of almost &euro;30 million over the period 2013 to 2016.  It is half funded by the Department and half funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.  I was very pleased to get support from that body because it is finishing its work in this country.  It is a recognition of the work that has already been done by the various community groups around the country in this programme that Atlantic Philanthropies has agreed to continue it over the next three years.  We will continue with a range of programmes to address literacy, speech therapy, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour.  That is being done already in the three sites, Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  It will continue in those sites and will be expanded to the extra sites.  All of the announcements have been made in that regard.  Thirteen sites have entered the programme design stage, which will involve finalising the proposals, to allow them proceed to drawdown and delivery.  Service provision will begin to be effective during 2014.</p><p> I will comment briefly about progress on the national children's detention facility.  The objective is to provide sufficient facilities to enable the child care model of detention to be extended to all under 18 year olds who are ordered to be detained by the courts.  That has been a priority for me since my appointment.  We do not wish to have young children in a prison setting and the Government has made a decision to provide the capital and resources to develop that project.  It is on track to deliver the three new units by the end of 2014.  The timetable has been adhered to since the developers went on site.  The total multi-annual capital funding for the project is over &euro;56 million and &euro;31 million is being provided in 2014.  It will be complete in 2015.  We must replace some of the older buildings.  The existing detention buildings used by Oberstown Boys School will be replaced with improved education, recreation, security and other facilities.  The new manager has been appointed for the facility and I will bring forward the legislation to bring the three units together - the legislation is at a very advanced stage - and to make some other changes in respect of detention.</p><p> The national longitudinal study will be continued in 2014, as well as some other research programmes.  It is really important that we have data about Irish children and that we are not relying on data from other countries.  The longitudinal study has given us a huge amount of data over the last number of years about the progress of Irish children.  We can see that approximately 80% of Irish children are doing extremely well on a range of variables, but there is a group of children who are more vulnerable and we must target and work with those young people.</p><p> I achieved agreement in budget 2014 to reduce the 2014 saving that had been envisaged by the comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE, for youth services.  That has gone from &euro;2.968 million to &euro;1.968 million.  That is very significant because Deputies here have expressed concern on many occasions about reductions in funding to youth services.  Effectively, it has meant this year that instead of facing reductions of 7% to 10% in income, it is a 3.5% reduction across the board.  The youth organisations have told me that this has made a huge difference to them and that they will be able to manage it.  It is a help to them in terms of providing front-line services that the extra &euro;1 million that was allocated in the budget for youth services has meant a reduction in the savings that were expected from them.</p><p> We have a very full work programme.  I am anxious to build on the good work that has been done by both voluntary and State organisations for young people, to continue to reform services and to ensure we deliver the services in the most effective way.  There will continue to be reports highlighting areas where improvements can be made.  That is the reason we have asked HIQA to inspect so many services.  When one reads the HIQA reports one can see improvements in certain areas, and it continues to highlight areas that must be addressed.</p><p> I hope this statement is of assistance to the committee and I look forward to the members' input and discussion on these issues.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that a number of positive developments have taken place in the Department in the past 12 months.  We have finally seen the establishment, on a legal basis, of the Child and Family Agency from 1 January this year.  I wish both the board and the staff well in their new roles.  It is a reform that was broadly supported by all sides of the House.</p><p>  I note from the Minister's statement that the deficit is not being carried forward.  However, last week at a committee meeting her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, had a different view regarding the deficit.  In response to a question from Senator van Turnhout he indicated that the deficit would have to be partly borne by the Minister's Department.  I do not have the exact quote with me but I can forward it to the Minister and perhaps she would confirm the position.</p><p>  I still have worries about some of the key services which have not come under the remit of the new Child and Family Agency, such as child and adolescent mental health, public health nurses and children of preschool age with disabilities who remain under the remit of the HSE.  This is despite the Minister's advisory group recommending that they should come under the remit of the Child and Family Agency.  Will the Minister identify when she hopes to bring these much needed and critical services under its remit?</p><p>  The voluntary sector has received bad press in the last number of weeks, rightly in the case of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.  However, many voluntary bodies are providing good services for the State, where the State is not doing its duty.  Will the Minister identify how many voluntary and not-for-profit organisations will be working directly for the Child and Family Agency?  Are we sure that the money allocated by the State to these agencies will go to the services that are required?</p> <p>It is important we learn from the mistakes identified in the past week.</p><p> The business plan for 2014 must be published by 30 January of this year.  Will we have an opportunity to debate it?  Recruitment of additional staff has been mentioned in the plan.  Where will they be deployed?   Obviously front-line staff such as social workers should be recruited.</p><p> More than 12 months ago I identified and highlighted the need to improve the quality of the free preschool year.  Nothing was done until the RTE "Prime Time" expos&eacute; highlighted major deficiencies in the preschool year initiative, but I acknowledge that the Minister has made improvements in the area.  Earlier the Minister said: "Participating service providers are required to implement S&iacute;olta."  When will the requirement be implemented?  It should only be implemented after the national roll-out of training.  It would be unfair for the requirement to be imposed on the services before the national roll-out of training.</p><p> With regard to the child care programmes, the Minister has said that additional inspectors have been recruited.  Can she confirm that all regions now have a full-time inspector?  How many new inspectors does she envisage hiring this year?  In the last tranche of advertisements for the positions, recruitment was restricted to public health nurses.  Why?  We have debated the matter at Question Time in the D&aacute;il and the Minister agreed that the position of inspector should be opened to professionals from the early years sector.</p><p> With regard to the national preschool quality standards, is the Minister aware that there is a conflict between regulation and legislation?  Is she aware that data protection legislation does not allow training agencies to pass Garda clearance to third parties?  The matter is of major concern to service providers.  It means that if I worked in the early childhood sector, gained a FETAC level 5 qualification and Garda clearance was sought for me, the Garda clearance could not be passed to the service provider that wishes to give me a job.  The provision has caused major havoc.  Is the Minister aware of the situation?  How will she tackle the problem?</p><p> I welcome the Minister's assertion that the national children's detention facility is on target.  Last September there was an issue about the lack of places, and the problem persists.  I know she was involved in intensive talks with the service providers about the matter and HR issues.  Have the issues been resolved?</p><p> For the past number of years at budget time the Minister has identified key outputs that she wishes to achieve in the coming years.  In 2012 and 2013 one of her key outputs was to develop an early years strategy.  I am somewhat surprised she did not mention it in her contribution today.  When will the early years strategy be published?</p><p> My party agrees and supports her wish to pass legislation in the D&aacute;il.  As part of her reform agenda she has mentioned critical legislation such as the Children First Bill.  In fact the legislation was one of the first aims she identified when she was appointed Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in March 2011, which is almost three ago.  She said that it was an agreed priority that the Children First guidelines would be put on a statutory basis.  Children remain in vulnerable situations due to the legislation not being enacted.  I am surprised she did not identify it in her contribution today.  I would appreciate it if she would identify when she will be in a position to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p> Two other key pieces of legislation are the adoption Bill and adoption information and tracing Bill.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on acting in a compassionate manner prior to Christmas when we dealt with adoption legislation.  It was the right thing to do and I advocated the move as far back as August or September of last year.</p><p> I understand we must wait until judicial proceedings are finalised following a challenge to the children's rights referendum before the adoption Bill can be dealt with by the Oireachtas.  Can the Minister give a timeframe for when this key legislation will come before the Oireachtas?  The adoption information and tracing Bill is other key legislation that was promised by the Government and yet remains to be seen.</p><p> Prior to Christmas the Government rapporteur, Dr. Shannon, appeared before the committee.  On that occasion he highlighted the abuse and misuse of alcohol as being the single most important issue in and contributing factor to the neglect and abuse of children.  He called upon the Members of the Oireachtas and the Government to act in a decisive and comprehensive manner to bring about legislation to ban the advertisement of alcohol because he felt the issue was so serious.  There are conflicting and opposing opinions in Cabinet on the banning of alcohol advertising.  I would welcome the Minister's opinion on the matter.  Can she indicate if the ban on alcohol advertising is something-----</p></speech>

The debate is my opportunity to respond and ask her about key issues.  The Chairman was present for the meeting before Christmas and will know how forcefully the independent rapporteur spoke about the issue.  Today's meeting is the first opportunity that I have had to ask the relevant Minister about the matter.  It is only right and proper that I pose the question.</p><p>  Every year the Government rapporteur on child protection produces a comprehensive report.  I have asked the Minister and ask her again to provide an implementation plan for his report.  The rapporteur's recommendations should not be left on a shelf and forgotten about.  We need an implementation plan that is based on the recommendations in his report.</p></speech>

I also apologise on behalf of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who unfortunately could not attend.  He asked me to substitute for him this evening.</p><p>  The backdrop of the Estimates has been revealed, at least in part, by the latest "What's Left" tracker produced by the Irish League of Credit Unions and published today.  It showed that around 1.6 million people have &euro;100 or less at the end of the month once all of the bills have been paid.  The figure has dropped by more than 100,000 people when compared with last September's figure, which is welcome.  None the less it is a very large number.  The group includes people who have less than &euro;100 and simply cannot make ends meet.  Issues of income inequality and poverty, particularly child poverty, continue to play a significant role in determining the demand on services provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  There is a strong relationship between inequality levels and demand on services.  It would be remiss of me not to raise this broader point at the outset.  The mantra goes "We are where we are", but I must add that we are where we are for a reason.  Broader economic conditions have, in real terms, affected the Department's budget just it has for every other Department.  Vital supports and interventions that have a real and meaningful impact on the lives and outcomes for some of the most vulnerable people in our society will be diminished.  This is the reality.  However, we are expected to be grateful they have not diminished by more.</p><p>  I have some queries on individual subheads that I will raise under questions.  At this point I note that the 2014 gross funding allocation for the provision of services under Vote 40 is &euro;997.154 million and is up from &euro;439.106 million last year.</p> <p>In the meantime, there has been considerable reorganisation in the Department, including with the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  I would like to get a sense of the real net gain or loss, as the case may be, to the overall budget for child services and if assurances could be provided that adequate funding will be available for the new Child and Family Agency and that it is not carrying forward any HSE debt.  This would be most desirable.  </p><p> I wish the Minister, her officials and those with new responsibilities in the Child and Family Agency the very best in the year ahead.  I understand the Minister is doing her best in very difficult circumstances.  It is very important work.</p></speech>

As I said, it is a historic development and there is a very strong team in place led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes and the management team.  A huge process has taken place already.  An implementation group has been running for well over a year and a half, chaired by the Secretary General who is with me today.  An outstanding job has been done in terms of the transition to the new agency but many challenges remain for it to meet, to which both Deputies referred.  It is the right direction in which to go.  </p><p>  There is a budget of &euro;602 million for current expenditure and &euro;7 million for capital expenditure.  I reiterate what I said earlier that we are not carrying over any deficit from the HSE.  There has been a separating out of the budget.  In fact, the departmental budget has increased overall by 3%.  The Deputies will agree that at a challenging time that is a recognition of the priority the Government gives to young people, children and the services which will be provided by the agency and our Department.  </p><p>  We have some additional funding in a range of areas and it is important I put that in context.  There has been increased funding and Deputies will see the figures have gone up for child care overall and for the youth programmes compared to what had been intended.  There is also the development of the area based childhood initiatives.  In regard to the point Deputy McLellan made on the overall economic situation, clearly job creation and lifting people out of poverty through the creation of jobs will impact on the very children we are talking about.  In particular, the area based childhood initiatives will make a qualitative difference to the lives of children and families having difficulties.  We have seen that from the work that has already gone on in the three areas where these programmes have been implemented.  That is why the voluntary organisations are so pleased and excited by this and why we have seen in the docklands area of Dublin, for example, 42 agencies coming together to work under the umbrella of the ABC initiatives.  We are seeing that in other areas also.   To take up Deputy Troy's point on voluntary organisations, the approach being taken by the ABC initiatives deals with one aspect of the point he made and I will deal with the other one on increased co-operation among the voluntary sector and accountability.  The umbrella approach being taken, asking agencies to work together, is very positive.  </p><p>  Deputy Troy raised a number of issues, which I will go through as quickly as I can.  He asked about the provision of public health nurses and the CAM service to families and the integration into the agency.  The task force made a broad series of recommendations.  A decision was taken to move ahead with the agencies currently under the umbrella but this year, I intend to start of process of discussion and examination of the best engagement with public health nurses, because that must go on whether they are inside or outside the agency, and with CAMs.  We have started this discussion in terms of making sure CAM services are available to the children and families being served by the agency.  That is very important, as is the question of precisely how that will develop.</p><p>  In the same way we had to have a lot of discussion about the integration of the National Education and Welfare Board, for example, into the agency, the same process will have to be gone through in regard to that engagement with public health nurses and we will begin to do that.  Deputy Troy spoke about discussions with the public health nurses.  Some public health nurses specialise in working with the children and families while others have caseloads which are mixed where they  work with the elderly and deal with a whole range of issues which arise in primary care.  In terms of precisely how that will develop and what the end point will be, the task force said they should be in the agency and we will certainly start that discussion in more detail this year in regard to CAM services and the public health nurses.  However, it is very important we give the agency an opportunity to begin the work from where it is currently and to integrate the agencies it started out with and to develop the services.  In advance of developments in that area, there must be very close co-operation between public health nurses, the CAM services and the agency.  </p><p>  Recently, I had a meeting with officials of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and some of the voluntary organisations to discuss how we can develop that close co-operation between mental health services and the kind of work that is being done by the Child and Family Agency.  It is very important that continues and, as I said, we will begin discussions with both groups with a view to teasing out the current relationship and future potential and how that can develop.</p><p>  Deputy Troy raised a point about the voluntary sector and clearly people are very concerned about governance in that sector.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes has issued a letter to all voluntary organisations which come under the remit of the agency and, more importantly, he met all of them last year and had discussions about the services provided.  The tradition has been to give money to agencies, perhaps without a detailed and specified contract.  I think he is very much moving in the direction of service level agreements with the voluntary organisations with whom the agency works.</p><p>  Some &euro;100 million is provided to voluntary organisations by the agency, in addition to the more than 100 family resource centres.  The establishment of the agency will lead to a greater alignment between the work of the voluntary organisations and the priorities of Government and the agency.  In fact, as recently as yesterday, I spoke to Mr. Jeyes about this issue.  As I said, he had meetings with all of the voluntary organisations last year and he is certainly moving in the direction of service level agreements in line with the priorities he has.  That is very important because there was a more distant relationship previously, as we have seen very clearly in recent discussions about voluntary organisations.</p></speech>

As I said, Mr. Jeyes has been working on that since last year and has been very clear about accountability.</p><p>  The arrangements which need to be made with service providers is spelled out in section 56 of the legislation.  There are very detailed instructions for the agency and how it will carry out its business with the voluntary organisations.  If the Deputies read it, they will see they must submit a copy of the audited accounts and the auditor&rsquo;s certificate and report on the accounts to the agency within such period of time as may be specified by the agency.  The legislation has clarified the situation quite a bit in terms of what is expected from the voluntary organisations under the remit of the agency.</p><p>  Deputy Troy asked about additional staff.  That will become clear when we receive the business plan from the agency but clearly it will be in the areas identified where more staff are needed currently.</p> <p>The management team, having analysed the postion around the country, may come back with recommendations for additional social workers or care workers as inspectors for the preschool service.  That will be determined by the demand perceived by the agency.  This will be clarified in the business plan.</p></speech>

The board discussed it last week.</p><p>  In response to the Deputy's question, all services under the early childhood care and education, ECCE schemes have been required to adhere to the principles of S&iacute;olta and Aistear from the outset.  The local child care committees provide assistance for the services to do this and use the online tools developed for that framework.  In addition, we have piloted a mentoring programme.  In fact, I went to the presentation of that pilot programme, which was really impressive.  More than 20 mentors have been working in the service.  Obviously from next year onwards, I hope to have a new mentoring service in place which will see a further 30 or 40 mentors available to child care services to increase their implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  It takes training, supervision and mentoring for the services to achieve the standards envisaged in S&iacute;olta and Aistear.</p><p>  On the question of recruitment of inspectors, the posts have been advertised but to date they have been confined to public health nurses.  I will have discussions about broadening it out.  Five inspectors have been recruited and it is envisaged that a further ten will be.  They will cover the vacant postions in Louth, Dublin south, east Wicklow, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and west Cavan which will effectively mean that most areas will be covered.  It will bring the number of inspectors up to 50.  We were allocated money in the budget to do this.</p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is addressing the issue of the transferability of vetting.  There are concerns about transferring vetting because if it was allowed to be transferred to every other agency, there is a worry that an offence committed in the meantime would not be picked up.  That is the reason there is such regular vetting.  I understand the Minister is examining the issue and will publish proposals on making the system more effective.  He is examining the issue of transferability to see what improvements could be made.  The Deputy is correct when he states it is very difficult for agencies and many have asked that if a person has been vetted by a child care service, whether it could simply be transferred if he or she was taking up another job in the child care service.  I do not think the proposals have been published yet, but in the meantime additional staff have been made available to the vetting service.</p><p>  There are places available in detention centres.  That is due in part to the recent court decision that young people in detention should have remission.  The provision of places has not been a problem in recent months.  The position varies considerably, as the Deputy is aware, and in the course of last year there were periods when no beds were available. </p><p>  We published the expert group's report on the early years strategy Right from the Start some weeks ago and it is the intention, as I have always said, that, first, we will have an overall framework document and that very quickly after this we will have the early years strategy and youth strategy published.  Intensive and extensive work is in progress on the framework document which will set the scene for these two other policies.  The framework should be published in the early part of this year and the early years study and strategy will follow from it.</p><p>  Progress has been made on the legislative programme.  We had a significant workload on the legislation to establish the agency and the emergency legislation which has been welcomed.  It placed major demands on the Department and, in addition, we had the child care legislation.  Last year the Department had to deal with three pieces of legislation.  I will not go back over the history of Children First, but in all probability it will be the subject of the next piece of legislation to be published and is very close to finalisation.  We have received legal advice on sanctions which has changed the approach we have been taking somewhat.  That is the reason we have needed more time to take account of it.  Let me assure the committee that work is ongoing on the Children First legislation.  The fact that the agency has been established and will have a number of months to get on with the work of implementation before publication of the Children First legislation will work well.  I do not accept the assertion that children are not being protected because the safeguards are not in place.  Obviously, we want to bring forward the Children First legislation to remove any ambivalence among professionals about reporting child protection concerns.  The evidence is that referrals are being made; there has been a significant increase in the number of referrals.  People are also contacting the agency if they have some concerns and are getting good advice from the agency.  The Bills dealing with Children First and adoption will be introduced in the next period.</p><p>  The Government recognises the points made on alcohol by the special rapporteur on child protection.  Many of the issues raised by the Deputy will be covered in the proposed public health Bill.  Just a few weeks ago the Government made a decision for the first time ever to publish a public health Bill dealing with alcohol.  It will take account of and deal with many of the issues that affect children such as advertising, cut-off times for certain advertisements and billboard advertising.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an issue that must be taken extremely seriously and I have expressed my view on it that we must have the strongest possible legislation because alcohol is such a key factor in terms of admissions to care and child protection concerns.  I think one third of children in care are there because of alcohol issues in the family of origin.  It is a very serious issue and the Government has shown that it takes it very seriously by its approach to the legislation.</p></speech>

I hope I have made it clear that there is a budget.  There are clear challenges not least of which are the cost of legal services and the adversarial nature of child care proceedings in court.  Generally, there is significant legal representation.  We will bring forward the guardian <i>ad litem</i>reform which will help in dealing with legal costs.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes has taken more control of the legal budget within the Child and Family Agency to ensure costs are contained as much as possible.  The move to a family court will really make a difference in the approach to child care cases.  That is part of the reforming plan of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  <br />I think I have covered the main points raised.</p></speech>

He referred to having been asked "whether child and family services will carry any deficit forward" and confirmed that they "certainly will bring their proportion of it because otherwise other elements, such as disability and the HSE, would have to take it".  I hope that what the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is saying is accurate.  However, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, seems to think the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will have to take a proportion of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.876" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22014012100008#G01400"><p>I reiterate that very detailed work was done.  We got great assistance in this regard.  As Deputies can imagine, it is not the easiest thing in the world to disaggregate what was relevant to the Child and Family Agency from what was relevant to the other health budgets.  That has been done following a rigorous process.  A great deal of work was done by the team involved.  I have to say they received significant co-operation from the HSE.  A great deal of work was also done by my Department.  The budgets were examined.  The amounts that were used in the delivery of services for child protection were identified and separated out.  As I said in my opening speech, there is no reduction in those amounts which have come across to the agency.  That is the situation.</p><p>  The reality is that there are huge demands on the agency.  The same thing applies to the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and all other bodies that are trying to deliver these services.  We also have to look at reforming how we deliver many of these services.  More co-operation between the voluntary and statutory sectors is needed.  Clearly, I will keep a close eye on those demands.  The board of the agency and the management team will do likewise.  I would expect to hear back from them on how the budget is meeting those demands.  We received some extra money for a range of services.  Clearly, there are more demands in this area because there are more children coming into care.  Expensive special care placements are necessary for a minority - 0.3% - of Irish children.  There a level of demand for these expensive services.  We need more foster placements, but they cost money.</p><p>  It must be accepted that &euro;609 million is a sizeable budget.  It has to be managed by the management team and the board.  Like everybody else, they are aware that substantial amounts of money cannot be found anywhere else in the current climate.  We are subject to the comprehensive review of expenditure.  Having said that, the budget shows an increase despite the current difficulties.  As I have said, it was separated very carefully from the HSE costs.  While there is no deficit, there are huge demands and costs, not least from a legal perspective.  These issues have to be managed and dealt with.  I do not doubt that the agency will come to me during the course of the year.  We will keep a close eye on the budget and the demands on it.</p></speech>

The Family Support Agency and the National Education Welfare Board have come under the remit of the new Child and Family Agency.  That is why there is an increase.</p></speech>

We separated out the funding that had previously been allocated by the HSE for children and families and allocated it without any deduction to the new agency.

Obviously, we will have to see how many staff need to be recruited this year.  It will depend on the stage of completion.  There will be a build-up towards the full use of the new units.  We have got sanction to go ahead with recruitment.  The Deputy also asked whether particular schools have been identified as part of the review of the school completion programme that is taking place at present.  Over 100 projects are involved in that programme.  The projects were concerned earlier in the year that they were not going to continue, but they have continued.</p></speech>

We have made available the budget that is necessary to cater for the children who require the early childhood care and education programme.  It is allocated accordingly.</p></speech>

There seems to be a ceiling in place under the community child care subvention programme.  There is no need for potential new applicants to apply because the various county child care committees are not accepting new applications.  Does the Minister feel there is a need to review this scheme in light of the changed circumstances so many families are finding themselves in?  At the recent launch of a report that was commissioned by the Donegal child care committee and carried out by Indecon, the Minister suggested that she might consider reviewing these schemes in the current year.</p> <p>Have sufficient resources been allocated to carry out a comprehensive review of the schemes?</p></speech>

I have identified this as a priority because the schemes need to be reviewed.  The Department is also developing, in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection, a new child care initiative which will provide 1,800 places for people on community employment schemes.  Having additional child care places available for those who are engaged in community employment will be of assistance to parents.  I believe the demand for places will come from this area.  A cap was applied to the number of places available in the past.</p></speech>

Some 950 community groups participate in the community employment scheme and 2,500 full-time equivalent child care places are provided under the CETS.

Is the Department certain existing services will not be replicated?  The Minister indicated it will be a stand-alone programme administered by Pobal.  The county child care committees could administer the programme, thus reducing administration costs.  The allocation of &euro;2.5 million is small but welcome and we must ensure the greatest possible share of it is used for mentoring rather than administration.</p><p>  On the &euro;1.5 million allocated for the training fund, having taken a particular interest in this fund last year, I welcome the decision to extend its scope in terms of those who can provide training.  The approach taken in 2013 was not appropriate.  The change is, therefore, welcome.  Should the fund not be broadened to allow applications to be made for a wider spectrum of training?  While I accept that certain services require employees to obtain FETAC level 5 and 6 qualifications, others require different types of training which does not qualify for funding under the new regime applicable to the training fund.</p><p>  When will funding under the capital grant programme become available?</p></speech>

What we are doing is redirecting the funding to the area of greatest demand, namely, the community employment schemes.  This is the reason the allocation under subhead B4 has been reduced.  The amount in question remains within the child care allocation and will be used to provide the range of child care services to which I referred.  The allocation for child care has been increased by &euro;3 million, which should be welcomed, and our focus has shifted to the areas of greatest need.  This is the reason certain funding has been reallocated within the two subheads.</p><p>  Deputy Troy referred to mentoring and training support.  It is important to focus on FETAC levels 5 and 6 because we require that child care staff reach these standards.  Our objective is to improve standards and training for those currently employed in child care services, more than 3,000 of whom require basic training.  For this reason, we chose to focus on this group at this time.  Once staff have reached a certain standard and obtained a FETAC qualification, I do not rule out using the training fund for a broader range of training and qualifications.  At this point, it is important to achieve our objective of ensuring that child care workers obtain FETAC level 5 and 6 qualifications.  Many of those who require these qualifications find it very difficult to pay for the training.  Under this programme, they are subsidised to obtain the services they need. </p><p>  On the mentoring service, we have provided &euro;2.5 million for preschool services.  This will involve the recruitment of graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with the services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  It is expected, although agreement has not yet been finalised, that the mentoring service will be administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.  Details should be available in the next few weeks.  </p></speech>

However, some service providers who have acquired this basic level of training need to obtain other qualifications that are critical to the management and operation of services.  The Minister may recall a "Prime Time Investigates" expos&eacute; of certain child care practices which found serious management weaknesses in one of the offending service providers, notwithstanding that staff were fully trained to FETAC level 5 and 6 standards.  The weaknesses in some services are not confined to a basic level.  We should ensure a broader spectrum of training is available.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that there is scope for management to do further work, as became clear in some of the cases we heard about.  Strong management is essential in child care services.

I said previously on Question Time that it was regrettable that such an important element of the Minister's budget, one which provides the best bang for the buck in terms of investment, has once again had a large decrease in its budget.  Have the youth services been informed of their budget for 2014 as prior to Christmas they had not been informed and, therefore, could not plan what works to undertake.  This is very much a disproportionate cut in terms of the percentage of the Department's overall budget.  The previous Government has to take its share of responsibility also given that since 2008 this area has seen a cut in the region of 48%.</p></speech>

Across the whole of Government we have had to examine budgets very carefully.  In fact, I have been able to reduce the pressures on the youth service by ensuring that instead of a 10% or a 7% cut that across the board for national organisations and local youth organisations there is a 3.75% reduction.  Given the national circumstances in which we find ourselves economically, obviously I would prefer not to have to ask the youth services to take a 3.75% cut.  I would point out that a huge amount of my budget, effectively, goes on fixed expenses in respect of child care.  Some &euro;50 million is still being given to youth services across the country.  That is a very substantial amount of funding that is being given to national and local youth services and no local youth service took a cut.  The ETBs were informed before Christmas of the allocation for the youth services.</p></speech>

With respect, the cut this year is &euro;1 million less than envisaged but it is still a cut of &euro;2 million on top of a cut of &euro;5.4 million last year and &euro;3.5 million the previous year.  Quite simply, youth services and youth organisations are at the pin of their collar.  I gave an example prior to Christmas of a youth service in Cabra which had to cease offering tea and toast to its students in the evening.  That is how tight is the funding.  I alluded to the Department of Justice and Equality which acknowledged that services cannot operate below a certain level.  In the past two years it has ceased cutting the grant aid to the youth justice system, the exact title of the grants escapes me, but it has acknowledged that it cannot sustain any further cut.  While the Minister wants praise for making only a &euro;2 million cut, one has to remember what the cut has been in previous years.  Last year the cut was &euro;5.4 million and the previous year &euro;3.5 million.  Quite simply, youth organisations are at the pin of their collar and are not able to provide much needed services at a time when 37% of young people, under the age of 18, are at risk of poverty and social inclusion.  This is a budget which should have been ring-fenced this year, bearing in mind the cuts it had to accept in recent years.</p></speech>

I would point out that we are borrowing &euro;8 billion this year.  Had we not inherited the disastrous economic financial situation we would not have to make these cuts.  In the current circumstances we have had to make the cuts to which the Deputy referred.  I have protected the youth services this year and I intend to continue to do so.  As the economic situation improves and the public finances get in order we will not have this discussion but will talk about investing in youth services to a greater degree.  Like the Deputy, I recognise the value of the youth services and want to support them.  In my discussions with City of Dublin Youth Services Board, CDYSB, and the local education and training boards, making sure the youth organisations can sustain their work, has been to the fore.  In the allocation of funding made at local level through the education and training boards and through the CDYSB, they are very conscious of protecting frontline services, and have been at pains to ensure those frontline services will continue, and have supported the organisations where there were some difficulties to ensure the services described by the Deputy will continue.</p></speech>

The Minister may remember in the summer of last year or earlier that the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>identified these cost in the region of &euro;28 million the previous year for legal services.  In the area we have just discussed, youth work has had a cut of &euro;2 million this year and in the same breadth we provide &euro;28 million - &euro;29 million for legal services.  That is where the savings that have to be made should be targeted, at the provision of professional legal fees and not cutting the budget to frontline services.

It has been in place for a long period and needs to be reformed.  We will reform it.  For example, Barnardos has a very effective guardian <i>at litem</i>system which it provides to the courts.  Clearly the scheme was set up without any clarity on the criteria for either professional qualifications or fees.  It is much too open.  We need to examine precisely when guardian <i>at litem</i>is used.</p> <p>We need to be very clear about how it should develop.  My Department has been working on that with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and we will bring forward recommendations on how to change it.  It has been in place since 1991, under the Child Care Act 1991, and will certainly be done this year.</p></speech>

Now that it is set up, that will not be repeated.

I compliment the Minister and her staff, who in a very short time have done a great deal for children in this State who are vulnerable.  The Minister and her Department have brought to the fore the question of our children, their welfare and safety, etc.  Historically, we do not have a very good track record, to our great shame.  It has taken all of this time, and the Minister&rsquo;s work, to bring about a referendum to give all children in the State some status.  That was never done before because politicians did nothing about it.  This Government and the Minister have done that.  That is to be welcomed, given our track record, as revealed in some of the inquiries that have taken place and documentaries that have been broadcast.</p><p>  Sometimes when I come into committee meetings I have to reflect on whether our country was banjaxed a few years ago, because we are in a different place.  Departments such as this one have survived on loans from our neighbouring states, which should be recognised.  These are not the greatest of times but it is to be hoped we will move to a better place where we can provide funding for vulnerable children and the sort of services they deserve, about which historically nothing was done.</p></speech>

The draft timetable for the meeting has been circulated.  Is the timetable agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Briefing material providing details of the Revised Estimate was circulated to members.  I propose that the following arrangements will apply.  There will be no opening statements, the committee will proceed to consider the Revised Estimate programme by programme, and in the preliminary exchange, each programme is to be considered under the headings of context and impact indicators, key outputs, financial and human resource inputs and 2014 allocation and targets.  Administration will be considered under these headings when each of the programme areas have been disposed of.  I propose that questions on the programmes be taken together at the end, at which point the Minister can respond.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  Has Deputy Dooley some questions?</p></speech>

The tender was completed and all the rest, but the amount of money spent was negligible.  The main spend will be this year, and that means spend will go towards preparing other Departments to get their databases and systems synchronised.  Almost 50% of the cost of the project is to do with other arms of the State bringing their databases and so on up to kilter.</p></speech>

We looked at all the alternatives on offer and a great deal of care was taken.  If we get this wrong, we will know all about it.  I got a great deal of correspondence and read some commentary that An Post was going to win the tender, but a company called Capita won the tender.  That company employs almost 1,000 people in Ireland already, and the unique identifier system that it has come up with is reckoned by the experts working on the project as the most effective and most suitable to our peculiar circumstance.  We have issues relating to the Irish language, the number of families in one townland with the same name and with nicknames to distinguish them, and so on.  The advice I have from the experts is that this unique identifier system is the best available with the most modern of technology.  It is more modern than when this idea was examined seven or eight years ago, as the progress made since then has been significant.  This should be a considerable success; at least I hope it will.</p></speech>

It has been roughly &euro;6 million every year for three years, and this will connect up 274 schools that are outstanding and ensure they have industrial strength broadband.  We are looking at what element of input might be necessary to encourage or ensure schools make optimum use of it.  The performance among the teaching profession is probably variable.  Some are really ahead of their time, have been doing it on their own steam and are very far advanced, while others are not so advanced.  We might have to look at optimising and encouraging maximum usage of the technology.  The intention is to complete the programme by September, which is the beginning of the 2014-2015 academic year.  My Department bears the running cost for the first year, along with the cost of the installation of the system, and then the running cost goes to the Department of Education and Skills from there.</p></speech>

The rural broadband scheme was intended to address individual premises that did not have a service for whatever reason and which were not catered for by the national broadband scheme.  In 2013, there were a small number of takers and there is no provision for it in the budget for 2014.  We are in the middle of the mapping exercise for what I might loosely call rural Ireland for a submission we have to make to Brussels for state aid approval.  It is there that the service to rural Ireland will be picked up.</p></speech>

An increase of almost &euro;4 million is involved.  We pride ourselves on our ability to attract technology companies, but we have been particularly lethargic in the roll-out of services in an e-environment, and one only has to go back to the debacle about the broker, e-government and the e-delivery of services, which seems largely to have fallen flat on its face and gone away quietly.</p> <p>Based on a renewed focus on the economy and focusing on issues of, perhaps, greater importance, would it be fair to assume the Government is continuing a lack of investment in the delivery of services through the Internet or in an electronic environment?  It is regrettable that we have not succeeded in upping our game as a nation in terms of delivering more services online and bringing it through a central processing system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.990" nospeaker="true" time="14:10:00" ><p>Deputy Pat Rabbitte:There is some validity in that criticism.  It is something we share with other member states in terms of the take-up and e-government interaction but there are a number of measures in progress centrally.  The Government appointed a CIO that is seeking to pull all of this together.  The publication of the national digital strategy in my Department last summer is a step towards addressing the issue raised by the Deputy.  A programme run in the Department, for example, benefit 3, now benefit 4, was designed for a relatively small amount of money to address the issue of the digital divide to try to teach people basic digital literacy skills and the partnership with the community and voluntary sector is very significant in that regard.  For example, in the Deputy's constituency, I attended a launch of this programme in Ennis with organisations such as Age Action and others who all attest to the value they have got from a relatively small spend in terms of encouraging digital literacy among people who did not have the opportunity when in education or in employment but now would like to tax the car, book an airline ticket or whatever online.  On that front we are making progress.   I appreciate the Deputy's question focuses on more on e-government.  We are also making progress in the area of SMEs in the sense that we are seeking to encourage the transacting of business online.  The Deputy will see in the subhead that we have made a provision of some &euro;5 million for 2014 in terms of the trading online voucher system that is designed to bring 1,000 SMEs online, actually doing business online this year.</p></speech>

I will speak about the postcodes.

It is as much a response to business in the logistical sector, for example, where there has been a growing demand in recent years and a believed capacity to grow employment in this sector, a demand from Departments such as the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners, CSO, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and so on.  It would make the task of delivering services, which was one aspect of the point raised by Deputy Dooley, immensely more efficient and effective.  It is not purely a postcode system to modernise the delivery of post.  It is as much a tool for business to grow employment in the digital age and in the context of growing digital enterprise in this country as it is to provide a basic mail service.</p></speech>

Very sophisticated technology and systems are required, for example, if one were to exploit the potential of e-health, but at the rate that new technologies are being introduced in health and the cost and expense of them, we will have to continue to adapt our capacity to avail of that technology more cheaply.  Therefore the strides that Deputy Colreavy envisages that might be made in e-health are very far-reaching but we are still some way off that, not because we are constrained by inadequate broadband.  At present broadband in urban areas compares favourably with any other city.  I was at an energy conference in Paris recently and there were serious difficulties about the quality of broadband available in the French capital.  One can look at the investment plan and what Eircom is rolling out, and also at the strides made by competitors such as UPC.  The quality is very high.  We have a problem in rural Ireland with a very basic broadband service.  The Deputy is correct that this is an area that must be addressed.</p></speech>

One cannot relax in the belief that it will happen automatically in all cases.  There is constant contact between the two Departments because as I explained to Deputy Dooley, it is not just the installation of the system, but we entered into an arrangement with the Department of Education and Skills to bear the running costs of high speed broadband for the first year .  The Department of Education and Skills takes over in the following years.</p></speech>

The Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Education and Skills have made provision for what they call switch on workshops, which have been advocated under the national digital strategy.  The purpose of the workshops is to help the weaker schools make use of the technology that is now available.  It will be very interesting to monitor the progress of that programme.</p></speech>

In other schools, pupils will be showing the teachers what the system is capable of.  We need some structured way that parents and those in the community can assume that all teaching staff have a certain level of competence and training, otherwise we will be providing a very expensive resource that will be used as tic-tac boards.</p></speech>

I want to reassure Deputy Colreavy that regardless of how this started, there is now a close ongoing working relationship between the two Departments.  It is envisaged on foot of the national digital strategy that the switch-on workshops I mentioned, which are expressly designed to try to assist weaker schools, will take place.  The point that the standards in schools will vary is a fair one.  Our priority is to ensure schools have the technology.  The education sector will gradually have to take responsibility for how it is used.  Some of the examples we have seen are quite remarkable.  Some pupils are remotely studying subjects that their own schools are unable to provide.  For example, a small number of students are doing honours maths remotely from a different school because their own school will never be in a position to provide all the specialist courses that a particular cohort of students might be interested in.  The capacity of technology for better teaching and for more efficient use of resources is very far-reaching.  In fairness to the Department of Education and Skills - we were down there two or three weeks ago to discuss a different aspect of this matter - it has taken on board and is building on the possibilities presented by technology from a pedagogical point of view.  It has some innovative programmes in this area.</p></speech>

Perhaps the time is coming when there will be an engagement between the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am aware of business parks in more remote areas that have broadband but it is not adequate to enable them to compete.  Second level schools have been quite well served by broadband infrastructure.  Maybe a change in focus towards economic work and economic generation would be useful.  The Minister has provided &euro;5 million for the online trading scheme under subhead A5.  I believe that was a pilot project involving the Dublin City Enterprise Board.  Will this allocation provide for a greater national roll-out of the scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.1046" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62014012100006#E00700"><p>The pilot was done in Dublin with the Dublin City Enterprise Board before Christmas.  The programme has been tweaked as a result of what we learned from that experience.  The programme will be mainlined throughout the country from June of this year.  We expect to get 1,000 small companies involved.  Approximately 23% of small companies do business online.  Our survey work tends to show that after the crash small companies felt besieged by other problems and that those difficulties continued during the recession.  At that stage, they were not as amenable as they might have been to exhortations to do business online.  We are trying to step up that level of engagement.  This country's e-commerce sector was worth &euro;3.7 billion in 2012, with 70% of the products or services in question being imported into this country from outside the jurisdiction.  The only way we can deal with such a big spend is to compete.  We are trying to persuade small and medium-sized companies that their capacity to grow employment and output would be significantly enhanced - there is literature to demonstrate this - if they were to transact business online.  There are a number of initiatives in this area.  The point the Deputy made about the interaction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is not unrelated.  Obviously, we are addressing the related issue of the quality of broadband in rural Ireland.  Later this week, I will bring to the House a Bill that will allow the ESB to use its supply system if it engages with a partner on a joint venture to roll out fibre to parts of rural Ireland.  We are clearing the legislative way for it to become a reality.  If that happens, when taken with the very extensive programme of investment that has been laid out by Eircom, for example, it will certainly continue to improve the quality of broadband that is available to people outside the large population centres.</p></speech>

I welcome the investment in broadband provision in schools.  It is important that the facility is available.  There is no doubt that the challenge for the education system is to avail of this investment by using this infrastructure and maximising its potential.  It cannot be said that the facility has not been provided.  I commend the Minister and the Government on that.</p><p>  Like Deputy Harrington, I agree that the focus needs to change now.  I know the Minister is interested in balanced regional development, which we often discuss.  Forf&aacute;s has identified - this was reflected in the economic strategy for Waterford city following the amalgamation of the city and county councils - that the extension of the Aurora dark fibre network to the south east, the region from which I come, is essential to give it an equal footing on which to compete for business.  I ask that provision be made in that regard, perhaps when future Estimates are being planned.</p><p>  Significant investment has already been made in the metropolitan area networks.  The Minister referred to the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013.  I will support that legislation, as a result of which another service provider will have access to infrastructure and will be able to deliver broadband to the regions.  I will support the Minister when we consider that welcome legislation later in the week.  Is there an overall system of co-ordination of the various broadband service providers?</p><p>  A great deal of taxpayers' money has been invested in the metropolitan area networks.  Have all of them been lit now?  Are they being accessed to the degree that was planned?  Are they being co-ordinated with the various other networks, such as those provided by ESB Telecoms and Eircom?  I think Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has some networks as well.  If we are to maximise those networks so that businesses in the regions have competitive access to broadband, there needs to be an overall co-ordinating strategy.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that.</p></speech>

I have seen criticisms of the metropolitan area networks and the investment that went into them.  I have seen criticisms of how well the national broadband strategy works in parts of rural Ireland.  The long and the short and the tall of it is that if those investments were not made at the time, the situation would be much inferior to what it is.  There has been a transformation in the contribution of the metropolitan area networks in the last couple of years.  I am not taking credit for that on the basis that I happen to be the Minister.  It would have happened anyway.  Some 83 of the 88 metropolitan area networks are now lit.  Less than half of them were lit when I came into this job.</p> <p>They are undergoing studies about what greater contribution they can make locally where they ring the towns about which the Deputy knows.  It is significant.  There is co-ordination in terms of planning and fierce competition between the different telecommunications providers and suppliers.  That is as it should be.  I take the Deputy's general point about regional development.  As the Taoiseach said recently, we can only effectively disperse employment to regional Ireland where the infrastructure is fit for purpose, be it broadband, water or energy.  These are the basics on which modern business can build.  In the particular area about which we are talking, the broadband service must be improved.  It is not adequate.  It is improving all the time.  In respect of the steps envisaged in the broadband plan, we are halfway through the mapping exercise for the submission to Europe and so on.  Once we get the green light, we will get on with it next year.  That will leave us in a position that is at least comparable to anything in Europe and is certainly better than the small number of countries that would have the kind of dispersed, sparse population we have in some parts of the country.</p></speech>

The Deputy knows that we are in the middle of looking at the BAI report and other work that has been done on the funding of public service broadcasting.  On the one hand, the Deputy has pointed to less revenue coming in from the television licence as a result of the decision to which he referred.  On the other hand, there has been a significant fall off in revenue from commercial advertising.  In terms of planning for the future, we must make some assessment about commercial revenue in the future because we now have more and more channels beaming into this country, sucking out advertising revenue and not really making any contribution to the State.  We live cheek by jowl with a larger country with whom we share a language.  We have an almost unique problem in the sense that these channels target advertising to our audience but the economic return to Ireland is minimal.</p></speech>

In the first instance, it is a matter for the regulator to have a look at.  RTE has been restructuring its business and effecting cost savings.  Some 500 people have left the company.  There has been one agreement with the staff for pretty significant savings on the payroll.  They have been trying to compete with advertising revenue migrating online and to opt-out channels.  I will shortly be taking a report from NewERA which has been in RTE seeking to establish whether further operational efficiencies are feasible.  I imagine that I will have that report within a couple of months.</p></speech>

He rightly identified that we live cheek by jowl with another country with whom we share the same language that has the economies of scale that have allowed the development and creation of some very considerable mega-broadcasting authorities.  He is right to say that they are targeting our audience and advertisers and have the wherewithal to develop content that our audience finds amenable.  The Minister has identified the savings RTE has already made.  It is my contention and certainly that of the chairman of the RTE authority that a reduction of &euro;5 million will hamstring RTE to an inordinate extent in terms of the development of the kind of home-grown content that is important to attract an Irish audience.  The documents that find their way into <i>The Irish Times</i>today under the by-line of Harry McGee and Arthur Beesley clearly identify that the Minister has already recognised that RTE has taken a hit of about &euro;11 million if one takes into account the reduced licence fee that social welfare provides for it.  Could the Minister talk a bit about that?  Does he agree with the chairman of the RTE Authority that RTE is effectively being asked to bear the cost of a national welfare policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.1065" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62014012100008#G00100"><p>In circumstances where the contribution from the Department of Social Protection is 27% of RTE's revenue, one cannot ignore this very significant contribution.  At some time in the past it was capped at the rate of the television licence at the time.  In fact, the contribution is something like &euro;144 per licence whereas the rest of us are paying &euro;160.  It would be unconscionable were that to become the pattern, that &euro;5 million is taken this year, &euro;6 million next year and &euro;7 million the following year.  This, in turn, would have very serious implications for the major change that is proposed which is a transition from the traditional TV licence to a household-based charge designed to tackle the level of evasion and deal with the issue of converging technologies.  What would be the point of making that transition if one's income was being diminished by the Department of Social Protection on a different basis?  This is an issue for my Department and for RTE.  It is not proposed to introduce a new charge nor an additional charge; it is proposed to transition from the existing TV licence at a levy or charge not greater than the existing TV licence, to improve the efficacy of the collection system and to acknowledge that people are now accessing public service content on platforms other than the traditional TV set.  </p><p>  I agree there would be implications.  Clearly it has aggrieved people in RTE who believe that in order to deliver the injunction placed on them by the Department or the Minister to break-even last year, this was such a big request, given the deficit of &euro;67 million reported the previous year and that then to be hit without notice and two months before the end of the year with a further &euro;5 million reduction, was difficult.  However, the Government was faced with circumstances where it had to make savings wherever it could find them because of the exigencies of meeting a budget deficit figure to which we had subscribed and which was required of us by the troika.  The Government was in a very awkward position but I would like to think that this is the end of it.  In my judgment, if this were not the end of it, it would raise a question about the merits of the transition to a household-based charge.</p></speech>

What we do not have is any understanding or discussion of what transpired between the Minister and RTE.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to communicate with Mr. Savage in writing or in formal discussion about understanding how the chairman and Mr. Noel Curran, as the chief executive officer, intend to try to continue to break even while carrying this significant burden?</p><p>  Does the Minister believe there will be an increased pool of money which may help to address this shortfall which he has been forced to impose on RTE this year?  Will the household charge and a different collection method result in a greater level of compliance and more money which may be favourable to RTE?</p></speech>

They left me in no doubt that they have kept their side of the bargain which was that when it did not seem very feasible this time last year - as I made plain to this committee before and to competitors in the broadcasting space - that we required RTE to break even.  This is the middle of January but the advices I have received are that RTE will break even.  I acknowledge it was aggrieved at the additional hit of &euro;5 million above and beyond that requirement.  On the question of whether I think there will be a bigger pool of money, evasion is creeping up towards 20% which is a lot of money.  On the question of whether the household-based charge will address this shortfall, it depends on the efficacy of the collection system.  Provided it can be comprehensively and efficiently collected the theory is it should generate more revenue.  There is not much point in taking in more revenue with one hand and having it taken away with the other.</p></speech>

It is recognised that RTE had to trim its sails in recent years and it did so.  This needed to be done.  The director general, Noel Curran, and the chairman, Tom Savage, have done a very good job over the past couple of years in difficult circumstances.  However, I am deeply concerned that the &euro;5 million has the potential to be the straw that breaks the camel's back at a time of increased competition.  Another broadcaster is about to establish a base here and will compete directly with RTE.  What will be the ultimate cost to RTE if it is forced to trim &euro;5 million?  Will it be unable to create the kind of programmes that retains the station as a relevant option for viewers?  A battle has commenced with the multinationals and the large-scale broadcasters which has the potential to be detrimental to what we understand as public broadcasting.  The Minister will agree that the media right across the globe has largely fallen into the hands of people with more money than sense, on occasion.  I would hate to see that type of effect impacting on what I believe to be a good public service broadcasting organisation, notwithstanding all the frequent arguments both I and the Minister have with it on issues.  This Government and this cut in particular seeks to strike a blow at the heart of public service broadcasting which both the Minister and I hold dear.</p></speech>

In fact, I do not disagree with any part of his contribution.  If quality is sacrificed then the claim to be a public service broadcaster discharging its responsibilities under the legislation will fail.  The BBC has &euro;4 billion in licence fee revenue compared with RTE's budget, yet we expect quality output.</p> <p>If we do not get it, people question the fundamental purpose of public service broadcasting.<br />I agree with Deputy Dooley.  In any civilised society, public service broadcasting is a public good however much we might, from time to time, disagree with its inability to see any silver lining in any cloud.  <i>C'est la vie</i>, as President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande might say.</p></speech>

In that sense, it has resources to back it up and connections to ITV in terms of programme material that another incoming channel might not have.  One cannot deny that it may, in the medium to long term, have implications for the shape of the broadcasting sector in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Deputy is working very hard at it.  The Deputy is not, in all fairness, alone in that regard.  The dispersal of the national gas networks is decided on established economic criteria by the regulator.  A number of additional towns were linked up last year, the biggest of which is Wexford.  The last town admitted for connection is Nenagh.  The test applied was not met by Sligo.  I accept that it would be a boost to the town and region but the case made locally did not meet the criteria that are well established by the regulator.  It is a matter that might be looked at locally.</p><p>  The note I have on the matter states that the extension of the natural gas network to the town of Macroom, County Cork, was completed in 2012.  The regulator approved the extension of the gas network to Cootehill during 2012.  This project is currently under construction.  Contractual discussions with commercial customers to facilitate the connection of Tuam continued in 2012.  The connection of Wexford town to the gas network was approved by the regulator subject to Bord G&aacute;is networks securing contractual commitments from key energy users in the town.  The network is being expanded and extended but there is no immediate prospect of the criteria required being met by Sligo.</p></speech>

Has any decision been made yet in regard to refining, particularly in the context of the future of Whitegate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-21a.1111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62014012100010#J00800"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the existing contract and arrangement subsists until 2016.  The existing owners of Whitegate have indicated that they are in the market to dispose of the facility.  I met the American senior officials prior to Christmas, who informed me they have not yet secured a buyer.  It is not for me to make judgments in regard to whether a buyer will be secured but my impression is that the facility will continue as is and that the challenge to Government and the industry is to deal with the impending 2016 situation.</p><p>  The refining sector generally in Europe is in contraction.  Oil refineries are being closed on a consistent basis.  We commissioned a consultancy report approximately a year ago in relation to the then lie of land and how to proceed into the future.  That consultancy report is now available on the Department's website.  The Deputy might want to have a look at it in terms of its recommendations.  I met the group of unions at Whitegate last week and, as stated, I met with officials from the company prior to Christmas.  The position of the Irish Government, given we are an island nation, is that we would be more comfortable with the facility continuing as is for obvious reasons, not least the fact that there are people employed there and making a valuable contribution.  We do not have an indication this far out in regard to what will happen post-2016.  The view has always been that if there is a threat to the future of Whitegate continuing as a refinery, it would be maintained as a storage facility.  However, that would not be good news for the people employed there.  We still have a long way to go.  I set out the detail of this in my meeting with the unions last week.</p></speech>
