    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#E00300"><p>Horse Racing Ireland is the commercial semi-state body responsible for the administration, development and promotion of the thoroughbred horse industry in Ireland.  My colleague, Michael O&rsquo;Rourke, director of marketing and communications, is before the committee with me today.  We are grateful for the invitation to appear before the committee today to address the issue of harness racing and any other matters which the committee members may wish to raise.</p> <p>  I wish to place on record on behalf of the board of Horse Racing Ireland our appreciation of the strong interest in our industry that this committee has taken over several years.  I know that our sector has been a regular agenda item for this committee in recent years, not least during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill.  The interest our politicians take in the industry, as well as their understanding and appreciation of it, is frequently commented on and a source of much envy for competing racing and breeding jurisdictions.  This is understandable as, in relative terms, the industry is more important in Ireland than in most other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  Horse racing is Ireland's most successful international sport.  The industry contributes &euro;1 billion annually to the Irish economy.  Ireland is the largest producer of thoroughbred horses in Europe and the fourth largest producer in the world.  This year, it is likely that more thoroughbred foals will have been born in Ireland than in Britain and France combined.  Our breeders are widely distributed throughout every county with, on average, three horses on each farm.  It is primarily an agricultural industry and sustains up to 16,000 jobs, mainly in rural areas.  This is a high-value sector which plays a key role in Ireland's overall economic recovery.  It is environmentally friendly, labour-intensive and a source of much inward investment in rural Ireland.  In short, it is precisely the type of industry that the country should be developing and one that needs careful minding and protecting.  We believe that the industry has the potential to double in value by the end of the decade.  Horse Racing Ireland has set out a strategy to achieve this in a plan that we have presented to the Minister.  Our confidence in realising the potential of the Irish thoroughbred industry is based on its current position of strength, which is the result of many years of investment by successive Governments as well as the achievements of our present-day owners, trainers, breeders, jockeys and horses.  These achievements are built on a centuries-old tradition of breeding and racing horses that has established the Irish thoroughbred as a world leader.</p> <p>  Throughout the recession, demand for Irish thoroughbreds remained strong.  This was largely driven by overseas buyers, who recognised that we have the best horses and horse people in the world.  Last year, Irish thoroughbred horses worth &euro;230 million were exported to 34 countries worldwide.  Our bloodstock sales have grown every year since 2010, well ahead of the pace of recovery in most other sectors.</p> <p>  In recent years, we have also seen resurgence in foreign direct investment in Irish training and breeding establishments.  International owners at the top level are buying into the brand of the Irish thoroughbred by placing horses in training here or keeping their breeding stock here.  This is an important point, since breeding is where the added value lies.  We should remember that the racecourse is where we establish which horses are the best of the breed in terms of speed, stamina and endurance.  The range and availability of racecourses in Ireland is one of the keys to our success.  Racing success and breeding success are linked and complementary.  This is why it is so important that Irish thoroughbred racing is positioned within the agricultural rather than the sporting sector.</p> <p>  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 specifies that one of the functions of Horse Racing Ireland is the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  This leads to an essential starting point for today's discussion: the distinction between the thoroughbred and other horses.  Another function of Horse Racing Ireland is the development of authorised racecourses.  An authorised racecourse is one licensed by the Turf Club under the rules of racing, and these rules are specifically restricted to racing involving thoroughbreds only.  A thoroughbred is a strict definition of a type of horse and this is the foundation of the global racing and breeding industry.  In short, all thoroughbreds must include, down all lines of its pedigree for at least eight generations, horses registered in the general stud book or associated approved stud books.  In fact, all modern thoroughbreds throughout the world trace back to one of three stallions: Byerley Turk, Godolphin Arabian and Darley Arabian.  Other equines cannot be classified as thoroughbreds; it is an absolute distinction.  This is the principle on which the entire global horse racing and breeding industries are founded.  Members who are racing fans will forgive me for making this point, but the difference is frequently misunderstood and may have added confusion at times to the topic in hand today.  The horses that compete in harness racing are not thoroughbreds.  They are standard breds, a breed that has shorter legs, a longer body and a more placid nature than thoroughbreds.</p> <p>  In addition to my role as chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, I serve on a number of international racing bodies.  It is remarkable to see the extent to which thoroughbred horse racing has become an international business as well as the extent to which Ireland is placed to influence and benefit from this business.  One example of internationalisation which I have heard referred to in earlier committee debates is the Longines Irish Champions Weekend, which was developed specifically to compete at the top level internationally.  At this year's event in early September, CNN produced a documentary news item on the Irish thoroughbred industry which was broadcast in over 200 countries to more than 300 million viewers.  Another illustration was what happened in Hong Kong last Sunday - I was lucky enough to be there myself.  The Hong Kong International Races are the self-styled world thoroughbred championships.  This is the most important race meeting in Asia.  It was remarkable and a source of great pride to me to report that of the 55 horses trained in eight different countries competing for almost &euro;10 million in prize money in the four international races, one third of them were born and raised in Ireland.  Even better, two of the four winners of the international races were Irish bred horses, including Highland Reel, which was trained in County Tipperary by Aidan O'Brien.  There was an emotional moment when, in the middle of Hong Kong on a sporting field, "Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann" was played with aplomb by the local brass band.  This serves to illustrate that what happens in Irish racing and breeding attracts worldwide attention and business.  Horse Racing Ireland is charged with ensuring that our reputation is enhanced and defended in the global marketplace.  This is the context for my observations today about harness racing.</p> <p>  I emphasise that Horse Racing Ireland is not opposed to the sport of harness racing or any other equine sport in Ireland.  However, they are not within our area of responsibility and it is not our place to take positions on their development.  Harness racing is part of the sport horse sector, the non-thoroughbred sector.  That sector has its own structures and operating procedures, whereas our responsibility, set out in governing legislation, is the administration, development and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and the promotion of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  Horse Racing Ireland has a duty of care to protect this &euro;1 billion industry which is so ingrained in the fabric of Irish life.  If we put it at risk, we would rightly face questions from the committee members and others over why we had not acted with greater caution.</p> <p>  One issue we have to consider as part of our risk assessment in respect of harness racing is the question of what would happen to Ireland's herd of thoroughbred horses if cross-contamination occurred and there was an outbreak of a serious equine disease.</p><p>There is no question that, in the first instance, the sales of Ireland&rsquo;s thoroughbreds would stop.  There would be other consequences in terms of liability, cost and reputational damage.  Quite apart from veterinary matters, the staging of harness racing on authorised racecourses causes significant difficulties in areas such as fixture allocation, media rights negotiation and the operation of bookmaker betting, for which detailed arrangements are carefully set out in legislation.</p><p> These concerns were set out in a letter from me to the assistant secretary general of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 22 July.  I will be happy to elaborate on them during our discussion, if necessary.  It is because of our duty of care to the entire thoroughbred industry that we are so cautious in the face of risk.  The safest direction in future is to maintain separation of the two codes, and in this respect we welcome the stated intention of the Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, to develop its own facilities.  In our meetings with them the IHRA explained that while racecourses are useful potential stopgap solutions, in the long term they are not ideal, mainly due to the track configuration.  This includes the all-weather track at Dundalk.</p><p> As members of the committee will be aware, a trial harness race meeting took place at Dundalk on 27 September this year under tightly controlled conditions which were approved by HRI.  We have asked the Turf Club to produce a two-part report, the first being its views on the veterinary controls and welfare standards at that trial meeting, and the second being a similar assessment of biosecurity at a random sample of harness racing yards.  Such yards would typically be small premises.  Animal health is established and cared for in these yards, so the importance of yard inspections is paramount in avoiding what is called biohazard to other equines.  HRI has met and is liaising with the IHRA and its veterinary adviser on this.  Production of this report is imminent, with yard visits scheduled for January, and we would be happy to share the findings with the committee once finalised.</p><p> In conclusion, and as mentioned earlier, it is not HRI&rsquo;s role to take a position for or against harness racing or any other non-thoroughbred pursuit.  The thoroughbred racing and breeding industry is an agricultural industry and harness racing is a sporting pursuit within the sport horse sector, to which it is affiliated through Horse Sport Ireland, HSI.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has stated before this committee that he will commission a report in the new year on the potential for development of harness racing in Ireland, and this is something we would welcome as the sport seeks to define its own path and overall direction.</p></speech>

Since then it has been fully engaged with us and is keen to develop its sector.  We have found its members to be committed and ambitious for the future of their sport.</p> <p>  HSI is an umbrella for lots of different horse sports.  The issues Mr. Kavanagh raised with regard to equine health and welfare are equally big issues for us.  It would be the equivalent, for example, of a hypothetical Ball Sport Ireland, which would include table tennis, basketball, rugby and hockey all under the one umbrella.  We have affiliates as diverse as polo, mounted games, the hunting association, show jumping and dressage.  The issues of equine health and welfare are crucial for us also.  Harness racing is there because it had nowhere else to go.  Mr. Bolger will outline what has happened up to now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Bolger" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#F00300"><p>I am the director of finance of HSI.  Damian McDonald, our chief executive officer, sends his apologies as he is travelling to Switzerland in preparation for the court of arbitration case that will hear the appeal made by HSI and Cian O&rsquo;Connor in seeking an Olympic place for the Irish show jumping team.  That hearing will take place on Wednesday, 16 December.</p> <p>  HSI was established in 2007 when the Equestrian Federation of Ireland and the Irish Horse Board were amalgamated following the publication of the Dowling report, which recommended new governance structures for the sport horse industry.  HSI is responsible for devising and implementing strategies for the development and promotion of an internationally competitive Irish sport horse industry.  HSI is the governing body for the sport horse sector in Ireland and is recognised by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Equestre Internationale, FEI, which is the international governing body, Sport Ireland, the Irish Olympic Council and Sport Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Harness racing, also known as trotting, is a form of horse racing.  This racing code is regulated in Ireland by the IHRA.  The other forms of horse racing in Ireland are National Hunt and flat racing.  On 10 November, the IHRA presented this committee with the details of its activities, the nature of the sport and the size of the industry.  The IHRA is a professional and progressive organisation seeking to develop this industry in Ireland and its reach abroad.  The IHRA became an affiliate of HSI in 2013.  It sought recognition by HSI, as Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, did not see it as part of its remit.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had also asked if HSI could give help to the IHRA.</p> <p>  The HSI board agreed to grant affiliation to the IHRA as a temporary measure with the intention that the IHRA would in time become more appropriately aligned with horse racing governance structures.  It was clearly understood between the parties that HSI would help the IHRA where it could.  Access to race courses, funding and betting infrastructures, however, were areas that HSI could not help with.  It was agreed that HSI would assist the IHRA by facilitating dialogue with HRI.  HSI does not have responsibility for the governance of horse racing in Ireland. HSI does not own any lands or race courses, nor is it involved with integrity and betting regulations at race courses.  The IHRA has always recognised this, and because of that has never sought financial funding from HSI.  The nature of HSI&rsquo;s funding does not extend to cover horse racing activities.  HSI received State funding of approximately &euro;3.6 million in 2015.  In 2015 the State allocated approximately &euro;54.4 million towards HRI&rsquo;s horse racing activities.</p> <p>  HSI understands that the IHRA wishes to work collaboratively with HRI.  It is also understood that the IHRA also seeks to enter into commercial arrangements with Dundalk racecourse to provide access in the interim to an all-weather race course facility, which it views as critical to the promotion and development of harness racing.  The IHRA is seeking funding for ongoing business development, veterinary needs and long-term funding to develop dedicated tracks for trotting.  Recently, the IHRA was approved as the passport issuing organisation, PIO, for the standard bred breed in Ireland by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  HSI is in the process of finalising agreement with the IHRA to provide administration back up to the IHRA to process the passports on its behalf.</p> <p>  The IHRA is progressing from strength to strength, having staged a successful race day at Dundalk racecourse in September of this year and previously at two race meetings in 2008.  Its participation with Le Trot mentoring programme, its active membership of the World Federation of Trotting and its application to become a member of the European Trotting Union are some of its recent milestones.  An Irish horse recently became the first international harness racing horse to race in the Inter Dominion race in Australia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#F00400"><p>I am fascinated by the submission from HRI.  The one case it makes that might have any traction is the veterinary case, and I would be very interested in any independent evidence it has that using a race track for harness racing and for thoroughbreds on different days and at different times would in some way put the thoroughbreds at risk.  I would have thought that sport horses and thoroughbreds were not always kept apart in other circumstances.  I do not know, for example, if these horses are mixed in farms in a much less regulated situation than on a racecourse.  HRI might outline in more detail the veterinary evidence with regard to the risk in sharing the facilities at racecourses around the country.</p><p>Mr. Kavanagh says he thinks the Irish Harness Racing Association should develop its own facilities.  I presume he would say we should divert State money to do so, and wind up with duplicate sets of facilities.  That would have a huge effect on the money available for Horse Racing Ireland, Horse Sport Ireland and everything else.  State moneys are a finite fund and depend on whatever the taxpayer pays in.  Borrowing is always only a short-term expedient; it always has to be paid back.  Is Mr. Kavanagh suggesting that we build duplicate courses all around the country to facilitate harness racing?  Would he be willing for money that would have gone to HRI to be diverted into that?  That seems to be what he is suggesting.  It is a bit like saying hurling and football are incompatible and that we need separate stadiums for them, or that soccer and rugby cannot be played on the same pitches and we need a second Aviva Stadium.  I think that argument would be met with a little bit of scepticism by the public.  If the race tracks were unsuitable, the first people to tell us so would have been the harness racers.  Presumably Mr. Kavanagh means that the tracks are unsuitable for harness racing, not for horse racing.  Surprisingly enough, the harness racers have not raised that issue with us.  I am sure they would be very interested to hear that Mr. Kavanagh has raised it for them.  I think it is slightly disingenuous.</p><p> Mr. Kavanagh has also said that stadium harness racing on authorised race courses causes significant difficulties in areas such as fixture allocation.  We would all accept that the owner of the course gets priority on it.  My understanding is that the harness racers were going to race courses and getting days on which racing was not taking place, so this issue did not arise.  I am sure things like media rights negotiation happen between all sports.  Maybe Mr. Kavanagh could talk to the IRFU and the GAA about what happened when rugby matches were played in Croke Park.  I presume there was rent paid for Croke Park and the IRFU got the media rights negotiation.  It seems to be a bit of a red herring, as does the issue of the operation of bookmaker betting.</p><p> For us as a committee, the most serious thing is the allegation HRI has made about veterinary issues.  I am a little puzzled by it.  I would be very interested to get HRI's detailed veterinary report outlining the threats on the veterinary front.  We could get it peer reviewed before we write up our own report on the whole horse industry, which I hope will be issued before this D&aacute;il is completed.  I would also be interested to hear Mr. Kavanagh's response on the issue of funding if we have to build duplicate facilities for the followers of both sports.</p><p> Am I right in understanding that Horse Sport Ireland took the homeless child in and gave it a home?</p></speech>

There is always a blur.  Everything in life is a continuum and very few things are discrete or have a clear boundary.  Would I be right in thinking that if there was a boundary, Professor Wall would think harness racing fell more on the racing side of it?</p> <p>  Until somebody decides otherwise at a higher level - i.e., the Oireachtas - is HSI willing to give harness racing a home?  Am I right in understanding that if we were to leave this sport with HSI to develop, it would require a lot of money to do so in terms of facilities?  One thing is certain: a show jumping arena is not much good for harness racing.  I understand that HSI does not own any facilities and so on.  How would Professor Wall see that working?  Would we have to change the whole way in which we operate towards Horse Sport Ireland and give it money for facilities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#G00500"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  I must say at the outset that the behaviour of Horse Racing Ireland has been disgraceful.  I think it is snobbery.  I have read the communications from Horse Racing Ireland to the harness racing group.  People are genuinely trying to bring support to an economy in various areas.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p> <p>  Two harness racing meetings were conducted in Dundalk in 2008, of which Horse Racing Ireland was probably aware at that stage, and were carried out according to the criteria that were to be adhered to.  From 2008 until September of this year, however, they have been denied access.  Horse Racing Ireland has told Dundalk track not to allow them to go ahead.  What authority has Horse Racing Ireland over a privately owned track to tell the owners what they should or should not do?</p> <p>  I am looking at other correspondence here from 3 December 2009.  It came from Horse Racing Ireland and states that Horse Racing Ireland has not made it a condition of race course authorisation of Dundalk or any race course that harness racing will not be staged, because Dundalk stadium has voluntarily accepted HRI's decision that harness racing should not be staged.  However, it states, if Dundalk were not willing to accept HRI's position by agreement, then the HRI board would consider making it a condition of its ongoing authorisation as permitted under the legislation.  Reading on further, another communication states that there were a number of factors in reaching this decision, including reputational concerns, commercial concerns, welfare and disease control concerns, potential impact on the race surface, and loss of potential future fixture flexibility.  I cannot understand reputational and commercial concerns.  Is that because it was going to be in competition with Horse Racing Ireland?  Was harness racing being denied access because Horse Racing Ireland desired to maintain a competitive advantage?  </p> <p>  Then we come to the 27th of this year.</p><p>On 24 May, Horse Racing Ireland made a presentation to the executive on these events and again said that they should not be allowed.  Yet, they took place again two or three months later under strict controls.  I assume the controls were as tight as those which operated in 2009 for the two events that took place then.  If HRI was doing its job correctly, there would have been strict veterinary controls and so forth.</p><p> The one positive element of Mr. Kavanagh's presentation is the fact a report is being prepared and if it finds that the strictest controls were adhered to, that will enable these events to go ahead in the future.  Horse Racing Ireland was allocated &euro;54 million this year and has received very generous levels of funding from the Government at a time when many people in the country were suffering greatly.  This committee was requested to approve such funding by the Minister but I will never again support such funding levels for the organisation if this kind of snobbery is going to continue.  We must have equality of treatment and fairness.  The only legitimate arguments that could be made centre on welfare and disease control.  I hope the report, when published, will lead to equal treatment for all.  That is what is required.  These events can be staged in places like Dundalk and can generate significant income in local economies, which must be welcomed and supported.</p></speech>

I accept some of the points made in the presentations by both organisations.  I agree that veterinary issues, animal welfare and disease control are critical to the well-being of our very valuable thoroughbred stock.  I understand that where there is fixture displacement or any interference with planned events, the race tracks should not be made available.  However, during quiet periods or down time, surely a track like Dundalk, if available, should be allowed to host harness racing events.  Those involved in this sector have high standards too.  They are not fly-by-nights.  The Irish Harness Racing Association is a genuine organisation.  It is not receiving tax-free stallion fees or anything like that.  Its members are ordinary people.  I like to speak for the ordinary people and that is why I have made such efforts to protect our smaller race tracks all over the country.  Somewhat like the set-up with regard to the accountancy firms, there are the big four tracks and then &quot;the rest&quot; but I will make sure that the rest are up there with the best.  They must be treated equally and like Deputy Martin Ferris, I make no apologies for fighting their corner.</p><p>I understand the importance of biological hazards and would respect what Professor Wall has to say on these matters as he is an expert on biosecurity.  That said, how could such concerns arise, given the levels of disinfection and the efforts of all organisations to protect animals, when these events are not clashing?  I understand the issue surrounding animals mixing with one another and am fully aware that the thoroughbred is a different animal.  Mr. Kavanagh's argument was well made in that regard but if there is no crossover, then where is the problem?  If we are only talking about one or two harness racing events per year, then the tracks are available for more than 50 weeks of the year for so-called ordinary racing.  Mr. Kavanagh's description of ordinary racing was accurate in terms of the agility, speed and breeding of the racehorses as well as one's ability to check their pedigree in the stud book and so forth.  </p><p>The harness racing industry is trying to secure its own venues.  The use of the HRI tracks is only an interim solution, in some ways.  We all accept that the HRI tracks cannot be a permanent home.  As I understand it, it will not involve every track in the country.  It cannot involve every track because some are entirely unsuitable for harness racing and the Irish Harness Racing Association is acutely aware of that.  We must all live in the real world and accept there are some obstacles that cannot be overcome.  However, favourable consideration should be given to those tracks where it is possible to stage harness racing events, like the one in Dundalk.  We await the report which will not be available for another ten weeks.  Mr. Kavanagh has indicated there will be two elements to that report.  He wants both elements to be completed before it is published, which I understand and accept.  The report will examine all aspects of controls and standards, which is very important.  It will also pay attention to the biosecurity measures in operation in all of the yards, which is fair enough.  Animal health is extremely important and we do not want to set off a train of events which could undermine the very important, multi-million euro industry that exists in this country.  </p><p>If harness racing can be facilitated, is HRI predisposed to doing so?  Is there goodwill in the organisation in terms of allowing more events to take place?  We are not talking about a huge number of such events, or at least that is my understanding of what the Irish Harness Racing Association is seeking.  I accept we could not have a harness racing event every month in Dundalk, for example.  Is it possible that one or two more events could take place while the aforementioned association works towards opening its own venues?  As my colleagues have pointed out, this committee was given information on the success of the harness racing industry in France.  It makes an enormous contribution in that country.  That said, I am not suggesting that we could reach those heights in Ireland any time soon, given that the industry in France has been around for far longer than the Irish one.  Can the witnesses see any possibility of providing interim support?  If the Irish Harness Racing Association is not active and is not holding events reasonably regularly, the sport will not take off or gain ground.  In order to gain ground, it needs interim support prior to setting up its own facilities.  Then it will be away in a hack, as we say here.  It is a sport which attracts an audience and generates economic activity but it will need some funding initially.  The sum in question has been defined by the association.  It is not seeking an unlimited pool of money - indeed, there is no such pool available, regardless of who is in Government.  The next Government will not be in a position to hand over huge sums of money to support horse racing because there are numerous far more pressing demands on the Exchequer in areas like health and housing.  </p><p>This committee is trying to come up with a fair solution.  We hope to see the harness racing industry eventually strike out on its own but it will need the support of the more established organisations in the field.  Horse Sport Ireland, as Professor Wall said, fitted it in and gave it a home.  Is that <i>pro tempore </i>or does he see the Irish Harness Racing Association eventually becoming affiliated to his organisation?  I am sure that Professor Wall will say that his organisation is okay with that but that it has a lot of mouths to feed and as long as it has the funds, it will feed all of the mouths.  The sum of &euro;3.6 million for Horse Sport Ireland was referred to earlier and the Irish Harness Racing Association is looking for approximately &euro;300,000.  No doubt Professor Wall will say that if the Government provides &euro;4 million then everything will be fine.</p><p>We mentioned &euro;300,000.  It appears Horse Racing Ireland believes it will require &euro;4 million to get us into that space.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We had this conversation last week and Deputies Ferris and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will really have to come on the road with me.  I do not know where the words "snob" and "elitist" come from.  I do not know any lads doing harness racing but I know people doing showjumping, eventing and horse racing with thoroughbreds.  Deputy Penrose talked about the ordinary man but I have a lot of ordinary friends who have just sold their horses at the sales and have enough money to keep going in rural Ireland until next year.</p></speech>

We have a &euro;1 billion industry and stand with the best in the world in fourth place.  We have a reputation.  I do not know how to make the analogy without appearing to be a snob but I was never allowed to keep my ponies anywhere near a racehorse.  That used to make me mad with my father but we were never allowed to cross the farm and contaminate the sport animal with the thoroughbred.  They needed to be protected because we lived by our horses.  Thoroughbred horse racing and other horse sports are as different as the pizza industry is from the burger industry - they do not belong together.</p> <p>  I hear about France, Australia and Scandinavia but why has England never amalgamated the two sports?  England is one of our biggest competitors and we want to be a better place for wealthy Arabs to breed their horses.  We have to mind this industry and we have excellent people doing a damn good job but it is competitive and, while we have to find a way to help the harness industry, mixing it with the thoroughbred industry is not the way forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#J00500"><p>I thank the gentlemen for their presentation.  Mr. Kavanagh addressed my thoughts when he stressed the importance of the horse racing and breeding sector coming back under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and clearly differentiated between sport and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There is a good reason racing and breeding are under the Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food, which is that it is a key agricultural activity in parts of rural Ireland.  Sport has connotations of recreation.  I partake in sport and follow sport, generally at the weekends and in my spare time.  I am also involved in agriculture and that is a job.  It pays the bills and does a lot of things for a lot of people.  We need to take a step back and ask why we are giving &euro;60 million to the horse and greyhound fund for this year.  We are not doing it because we like to go racing and to back dogs or horses but because it is an industry that is worth more than &euro;1 billion to our economy and employs 16,000 on the equine end and 10,000 on the greyhound end.  It is real economic activity and provides real jobs in parts of rural Ireland where there is very little alternative.  It needs to be protected.</p> <p>  I was at a breakfast not long ago when the Minister for Finance made the point that he was not a big racing man and did not understand the industry very well but based on the figures, he gets why we need to invest in the industry.  It is far better for the racing and greyhound industry that the Minister for Finance provides funding because it is the right thing to do financially rather than have a Minister who supports the industry because he is into the sport.  </p> <p>  Perhaps concerns over welfare and disease control can be circumvented and Professor Wall might talk about the risks of cross-contamination.  A few years ago this committee had a lengthy discussion about raw milk and producers of raw milk who appeared before us were very aggrieved that they could not sell their raw milk at markets any more.  It was made very clear to us that the dairy industry was worth &euro;3 billion to our economy.  Somebody could continue to sell raw, unpasteurised milk and everything might be okay but the risk was that if one person got ill from drinking raw milk, the whole Irish milk brand would be tarnished.  We could not justify the risk of reputational damage to the overall industry and there is an analogy here.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said it was like telling hurling players and football players they had to play on different pitches but I do not agree with him.  There are dual players and the same people play hurling and football.  Sports horses and thoroughbreds are very different animals.  It is great to see harness racing develop and I would be very supportive of it but I would hate undue pressure to be put on the thoroughbred sector to open up the gates and leave genuine concerns aside for populist reasons.  I look forward to the report which is being worked on at present and to see what the best way forward is for the harness industry.  However, the concerns being raised are genuine.</p></speech>

There were problems with insurance when we closed off the roads on certain dates.  I was also a legal adviser to the group for 20 years, so I would not like them to be isolated.  It is popular in Wales and throughout Ireland.  </p> <p>  I understand there is a move to stall or stop the inspection of draft and thoroughbred horses.  Half my family live in America and I have heard this is sending out the wrong message.  Has this been done, or has it been proposed?  If it has been proposed, what are the merits of this?  I have heard that it sends a signal that we are going backwards rather than forwards.  Might this tarnish both the draft horse and racehorse industries?  These are very important to the economy of this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#J00800"><p>I welcome the presentations from Horse Racing Ireland and Horse Sport Ireland.</p><p>I also compliment HRI on its national and international achievements in recent years.  It is a wonderful example of the strength of the industry in Ireland and how it is being promoted here and abroad.  It has been a wonderful success story for Ireland and has been appropriately supported by the taxpayer.  It is from the latter perspective that this joint committee has an overriding responsibility in examining what is the position.  I come from west Cork, which anyone would admit is not the most premier thoroughbred area, but it has a strong horse harness racing tradition.  As has been outlined well before the joint committee, the two sports are like chalk and cheese.  They are different animals, sports, bodies and organisations and are as different from each other as football is from tennis, were one to use a sporting analogy.  From that point of view, there obviously is some reason this issue is being discussed before an Oireachtas joint committee.  The Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, has been trying for some time to improve the sport's integrity, funding and prize money, and has been working in association with French sporting organisations to that end.  Moreover, the French have invested in Ireland in support of the IHRA in its endeavours.</p><p> Although there should not be a conflict between the thoroughbred industry and the standard-bred horse racing sector, somewhere there is, and at this meeting I am particularly keen to find out a couple of things through the Chair.  I can understand the issue of cross-contamination in terms of how there would be separation of animals at a meeting or a stadium.  I also take the point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien about animals going from one side of a farm to another, but that may not always happen.  It may not be the best practice in every landholding or farm on which thoroughbred animals are being born and bred.  Consequently, while I understand that cross-contamination is an issue, it is not an issue everywhere.  The case stands that in France, for example, trotting and thoroughbred meetings take place over the same courses, quite often on the same day and I believe sometimes on the same card.  When horses travel to France, do they suddenly become immune from contamination?  Alternatively, does Horse Racing Ireland suggest that this is a global best practice and we are so far ahead that we know what is best?  I do not believe the IHRA is seeking this.  From what I have heard, the association's ultimate aim is not even to seek access to stadiums or courses; it is looking for its own place or home.  In the interim, however, it seeks to develop harness racing to that position.  I note the comment in the presentation from Horse Racing Ireland to the effect that it supports, encourages or agrees, and that appears to be the view of HRI.  If this is the case - I take it at face value - then why are members here?</p></speech>

Is it the case that the development of harness racing could appear to be troublesome in terms of funding for the thoroughbred industry?  I acknowledge that the witnesses have outlined the huge amounts, running to millions, involved in the thoroughbred industry, and harness racing does not generate that type of income by a long shot.  However, could Horse Racing Ireland perceive harness racing ultimately to be an threat in the long term to funding to the thoroughbred side?  Could Horse Racing Ireland state unequivocally its support, albeit in some respects in separation, for the objective of the IHRA to find a suitable home for itself and to find a suitable niche industry for itself that would not be in direct conflict with Horse Racing Ireland and the thoroughbred industry?  Did Horse Racing Ireland view the use of Dundalk Stadium by the IHRA, once, twice or whatever it was, positively or negatively?  If it was positive, is it of a mind to allow the association to do that again, scheduling permitted?</p> <p>  I read the transcript of the last meeting of the joint committee when the IHRA appeared before it.  There was an issue at Killarney and the harness racing representatives felt highly aggrieved about what happened there.  I wish to specifically ask Horse Racing Ireland whether it has made an intervention with the board of Killarney racecourse on supporting or otherwise the IHRA's efforts to hold a meeting at that racecourse.  Finally, I compliment the sports body on its support, as it has been noted the Irish Harness Racing Association has benefitted positively from its membership of the council, which also should be noted.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Kavanagh to deal with the relevant questions.  As there were seven contributors, there are a number of questions for both organisations.</p></speech>

As for Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on the veterinary side of things, which probably is the principal issue, one function that the Legislature has given to Horse Racing Ireland is to protect the health and welfare status of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  This is a responsibility that the board of Horse Racing Ireland, and indeed the thoroughbred industry, take seriously.  They run the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown, County Kildare, which is a world-leading centre charged with protecting the health of thoroughbreds, disease surveillance and such issues.  The Irish Equine Centre is funded through a combination of funding from Horse Racing Ireland, contributions from thoroughbred breeders through the foal levy and the commercial activities of the centre itself.  This is not done simply for the good of the industry but because we have seen the effect of disease and health issues and the devastating effect it can have on industries elsewhere.  This could be seen in Ireland when the entire agricultural sector was closed down for a time due to foot and mouth disease.  In an example specific to our sector, this could be seen in Australia when the New South Wales thoroughbred industry was shut down for three months approximately ten years ago because of the arrival of some infectious disease into Australia.  This had a devastating effect on the trade and the business of that sector.  As I stated, it is for this reason, allied to the responsibility given in legislation, that the board of Horse Racing Ireland would act cautiously in such an issue.</p> <p>  I can assure the Deputy it is not a question of snobbishness; far from it.  I have worked with this board since all its members were appointed and there is no question of snobbishness.  The status of the thoroughbred industry in Ireland is the product of hard work by many people, including, as I noted in my contribution, the positive approach that politicians and the Legislature take to the industry in Ireland, which is the envy of other countries globally.  My counterparts in other countries would give their eye teeth to have the level of engagement between the horse industry and their politicians that we enjoy with Members.  Consequently, the issue of disease control, or biosecurity, is taken extremely seriously by our industry for good reason - the protection of trade and so on.</p><p> We have had a number of meetings with the harness racing representatives, particularly to discuss the trial meeting that was taking place in September.  We agreed that there would be a two-phase approach to the veterinary matters.  First, we would have an assessment of veterinary controls at the race meetings.  That took place at the meeting of 29 September.  The report is being produced and, anecdotally, there is no issue there.  As one would have expected, it was run to veterinary standards similar to those that operate at race meetings.  The second element of that exercise is a series of inspections and visits to harness racing establishments off-track to assess the welfare and veterinary standards within those premises.  That will take place in January.  That is a prudent and sensible approach to what could be a devastating issue for our sector.  This is an issue which the board of Horse Racing Ireland takes seriously and it is working through that process.  As I stated in the presentation, we will be happy when the process is concluded to share it with the harness racing authorities and with this committee, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and whoever it may be of interest to.  However, the issue of biosecurity and disease control is a matter of the utmost importance to the thoroughbred sector, and that is the approach which the sector has taken.</p><p> With regard to the other issues, they all were set out in my letter of 22 July.  These are complex issues.  On the impact on the race track, for example, harness racing wants an all-weather fast-track while and horse racing wants an all-weather slow-track.  Therefore, there is a conflict over the type of race track and the way the race track is presented.  We have had a situation with regard to Dundalk in the past year where the entire surface of the track has had to be flipped because there were some complaints from the riders and trainers about the quality of the surface.  They are facing up to the fact that the track will have to be replaced in its entirety at some stage within the next four or five years.  There are issues of concern there.</p><p> A number of the activities that take place on an authorised race track are specifically defined in legislation, be that in regard to betting services, allocation of bookmakers' pitches at race tracks, negotiation of media rights, allocation of fixtures and regulation of the sport.  Once a race meeting takes place on an authorised racecourse, it falls under the jurisdiction of that legislation.  That complicates matters significantly and from our point of view is another reason to be cautious about sharing facilities between horse race meetings and harness race meetings.  The committee may be familiar with the fact that there is a long-running legal dispute in the High Court between the bookmakers and Dundalk race course over the allocation of pitches at Dundalk, which is unresolved and still subject to appeal, and running harness race meetings, which have a different method of allocating bookmakers' pitches. This creates an extra complication in that area.</p><p> In that regard, the other area to consider is the overseas examples.  Generally, while in some countries, particularly France, which as been quoted, there is a lot of sharing of facilities, that is not the case in a number of other jurisdictions.  Where harness racing and thoroughbred racing take place at the same venue on different dates, they are almost always run on different tracks.  The harness racing track is a separate track inside the race track.  That is for the simple reason that most race courses, particularly those in Britain and Ireland, are too big for harness racing.  Most tracks here are approximately a mile and a quarter in a circuit whereas we are told by the harness racing authorities that they require a track of a shorter distance.  In France, no harness racing takes place on any of the seven all-weather race tracks.  In the United Kingdom, three fixtures a year are run on race tracks - two in Musselburgh and one at Wolverhampton.  In Scandinavia, only 4% of the trotting races take place on tracks that also stage horse racing.  In Germany, it is 22 out of 181 fixtures, or 12%.  In Italy, it is 81 out of 505 fixtures.  The two are not as compatible as one may think.  I accept there is some sharing of facilities, but not on a wholesale basis.  As I said, the board has taken the view that the primary issue to be satisfied is that of veterinary health welfare for which it holds a responsibility under legislation.  There are a number of other complicating factors which require careful consideration.</p><p> In response to Deputy Harrington's question, in my letter of 22 July on behalf of the board, I stated clearly that, "The Board are mindful of the ambitions of the Irish Harness Racing Association to develop their sport"-----</p></speech>

In "the long term", there is a degree of separation there.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Martin Ferris' questions, it is not correct to use the term "snobbery".  We have engaged with the harness racing representatives, we are carefully looking after our own responsibilities and we are going through a process in a clear and cogent fashion.

It is not a question of snobbishness.  That is not correct.  We have engaged in an ongoing process in consultation with the harness racing authorities.  The board has genuine concerns in this area.  If the board was not doing that, I believe it would be open to criticism, from both within and outside the sector, that it was not carrying out its legislative functions.  The type of veterinary review that I am talking about here is merely common sense due diligence that one would conduct before any decision would be made.</p> <p>  The question of running harness racing side by side with thoroughbred racing on the same race tracks has other implications, not only for us but for the members, as legislators, in terms of the context of the legislation which applies exclusively to thoroughbred racing as, indeed, it does in all other jurisdictions where harness racing is popular.  There are separate codes for both sports.  They are run under different authorities.  They are run, to a limited extent, on the shared venue but on different tracks at each of those venues.   That is the process that our board is following and on which it feels strongly.</p> <p>  It is wrong to link a careful diligent approach to a development such as this with a threat to the funding of a sector.  There are many requirements.  I mentioned the Irish Equine Centre, which is doing an outstanding job for disease surveillance on limited resources and needs a lot of extra resources put into it.  It is wrong to suggest that the sector would have its funding cut because it is being careful about issues such as biosecurity.  More funding is needed by the Irish Equine Centre to protect the development of trade, not only for the thoroughbred sector but also for the non-thoroughbred sector, which could in time include harness horses or standard-bred horses, although the breed involved comprises mainly horses imported from France.</p></speech>

We have just completed a strategy, Reaching New Heights, through which we are trying to develop the sector for the breeding and production of competition and leisure horses, which form a global industry.  We want to make Ireland the go-to place for horses for all levels of riders.  Since the sector is worth &euro;700 million to the economy and accounts for approximately 16,000 jobs, we are just as interested in equine welfare and disease.  Mr. Kavanagh rightly pointed out that gathering many horses together poses a risk of disease transmission.  When horses go racing, they often return carrying diseases that they spread among themselves.  The biosecurity levels of some trainers' operations differ from others'.  Many trainers speak of going to racetracks where the stables are not always cleaned and disinfected between race days.  That presents an opportunity to spread disease.  This issue must be addressed.<br/><br/>The report on the trial run in Dundalk will be sent to this committee.  Dundalk mimicked what happens in Fairyhouse.  The Turf Club observed and two vets were present to supervise.  The committee must await the final report but nothing untoward was observed and the visits to the yards will occur in due course.<br/><br/>As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, we took in the homeless child.  We take in all comers because we try to be helpful to everyone.  We do not have access to tracks, so we cannot help people the way they want to be helped.  We do not have legislation, govern betting or so on.  If tracks are not used all of the time and are vacant, I take the point that they could be adapted instead of new facilities being developed.<br/><br/>Senator O'Donovan referred to inspections.  We are not stopping them.  Rather, we are reviewing the inspection process to ensure that it is effective and value for money.  We are trying to develop the sector.  Sometimes, the <i>status quo</i>is not good enough and must be changed.  This is a process of continuous improvement.  A radical reform is under way.  We are trying to make the situation better, not worse.  We want everyone to be a winner.  We are conducting a detailed analysis on which every breeder will have an opportunity to express a view before we make any major change.</p></speech>

It has committed to providing to this committee a five-year business plan.  It is trying to grow step by step and slowly.  There is a definite opportunity for new commercial income streams.  The French have already started putting money into the system.  The association is not out to compete with or take income away from Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, or Horse Sport Ireland, HSI.  It views itself as a distinct operation that can grow and has potential.</p> <p>  Biosecurity is a matter for HSI and HRI.  For them, protecting it is a paramount concern.  The IHRA understands this.  It held three successful days, two in 2008 and one in 2015.  Under controlled circumstances, I see no reason not to allow it days at a racecourse on which to operate.  Let the business grow step by step.  It will need funding to develop its integrity.  I understand that it is seeking an investment of approximately &euro;375,000 in this regard to help it to develop its systems, etc.  Currently, it is seeking access to a racecourse.  We mentioned Dundalk, which races 37 times per year.  The IHRA is seeking a small number of days to grow the business and see how it goes.  I see no particular financial downside but it should be done in a controlled environment to protect the horse sport industry.  The IHRA understands this, which will be borne out by the reports on the trial days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#M00500"><p>Two harness meetings took place in Dundalk in 2008.  They were negotiated directly with the Dundalk racecourse.  The IHRA received a positive response from the thoroughbred industry observers who were present, including the independents from the Turf Club.  Between 2008 and 27 September 2015, however, every effort that the IHRA made to hold a meeting at that track was thwarted by HRI.  I do not say this lightly, Mr. Kavanagh.  I concur with everyone regarding the protection of the thoroughbred industry.  I have no problem with that.  As a legislator, however, I cannot treat one section differently than another.  I would not be associated with that.  To deny the IHRA the opportunity of running meetings in Dundalk or anywhere else when such meetings do not collide with thoroughbred racing because they are run on separate dates is unreasonable.  Obviously, the IHRA's reasonable request fell on deaf ears.  Last June, HRI refused it again.  The IHRA had to address us and, by so doing, inform us of the situation.  In turn, we had to raise it with the Minister.  To his credit, an event was held on 27 September.</p> <p>  I understand that the two meetings in 2008 were inspected by vets and everything was done according to plan.  The meeting on 27 September was inspected and again complied with the veterinary requirements.  The IHRA is prepared to comply with inspections of its stables and so forth.  HRI must comply with the legislation that enacts it as well as with the expectations of equality placed on it by legislators.  This is the reason for my point.  There must be equality.  In good conscience, I cannot be associated with inequality.  That is why I made my comments on funding.</p></speech>

When people do something like that, it normally rebounds against them.  I get the feeling that HRI hopes this will go away but it will not.  However, I will resist the temptation to get into a slagging match, as we should address the issue.</p><p>At the end of the day, we are legislators and a number of issues have been raised.  I agree that some should have been dealt with but I do not understand why that took seven years.  HRI's letter referred to hygiene and welfare standards.  I understand that the standards at the race meeting in Dundalk passed muster with the Turf Club but I presume that, had there been engagement in the past seven years, it would have been agreed that the same standards would apply to harness racing as applied to thoroughbred horses.  I endorse the witnesses' comments on the inspection of IHRA premises and presume that the same happens at all thoroughbred premises.  The same standards should apply and I do not see why they would not.  I cannot understand how this issue cannot be negotiated and resolved.</p><p>The letter states in respect of disease surveillance in the non-thoroughbred sector that:</p><blockquote>The Board is greatly concerned that there has been no progress on the recommendation of the Cawley / Walsh report that a funding contribution be made from the non-thoroughbred sector to the Irish Equine Centre which provides a research and disease surveillance service for the entire equine industry.  As you will appreciate, disease risks are as likely or more likely in the non-thoroughbred as in the thoroughbred sector, but a serious outbreak would have a catastrophic impact on the thoroughbred population, 75% of which is exported to trading partners overseas.</blockquote><p>Any of us would have recognised that, as with other animals, if there is a disease outbreak, keeping them all apart will be difficult anyway.  Therefore, our aim should be the highest standard across thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred to ensure that as far as is humanly possible we do not have disease here.  I hope that Horse Racing Ireland and HSI already co-operate.  It seems to me that they are saying it is more likely to be an issue with the non-thoroughbred sector than the other side.  I hope the chairman of HSI might give this committee his view on whether disease outbreak is more likely in the non-thoroughbred sector and what it is doing to ensure there is no outbreak of disease among non-thoroughbreds.</p></speech>

I appreciate the clarification.  In respect of the issue of money, it seems to be a cheap shot.  I cannot see how the harness racing people could be responsible for some debate that is going on as to who should fund the equine centre.  In the heel of the hunt, if HSI is going to fund the equine centre, I presume the taxpayer and the Legislature must make the money available to it to do so because it has already made a pitch that it could develop its industry if it had more money.  What this committee is looking at in the round is whether more money should be invested in horses of all types here.  It is one of the issues we are looking at but I am not sure how relevant it was to the IHRA issue.</p> <p>  I would be very interested in one practical question.  If I brought horses into a place and if no horses were entering that place for a week or a fortnight, what steps would I have to take to make sure there was no transmission of disease?  Would it relate mainly to the dung that would left behind?  I understand that a lot of disease is transmitted by physical contact or proximity.  Allowing for a fortnight, a week or ten days apart or whatever time the experts would say, is it possible to ensure that one really minimises disease transmission risks by, for example, disposal of all dung?  I would be interested in hearing the views of the expert witnesses in front of us today on how this issue might be dealt with or how high that risk is.  In other words, is there a significant risk at different times and on different dates compared to other risks in the industry?  I am sure the Irish Equine Centre would be able to give some information on that because, presumably, it has a risk analysis concerning the cross-transmission of disease.  Horse Racing Ireland told us it has it, but it is not telling us what they are telling it.  I hope that before we finalise the report in January, we can get a detailed breakdown from the equine centre of where it sees the risks of cross-contamination and how it would measure them.  It is like all human activity.  One thing we must start doing is measuring risk, because somebody could tell you every day that something is high risk.  The only way we can do it is by calculating it scientifically and mathematically and asking, if one were taking insurance out on an actuarial basis, how they would rate the various risks, how they would eliminate the risks and where they would prioritise the elimination of risks.  When we come to that issue, we need that kind of scientific and analytical approach to it.  That would be much more constructive for all of us than a more emotional approach.  </p> <p>  I am very interested in what was said about the impact on the race track, because a fantastic solution has been proposed.  There are two major horse racing meetings in Galway, which has a fantastic track and a fantastic location on the edge of the city.  In fairness to the greyhound people, they always benefit from horse racing and run greyhound races, because people are people.  There are fantastic facilities at the back of the stand that could be used for concerts in the summer, similar to the Milwaukee festival.  Like the RDS, it is hard to see a facility like that down for the rest for the year.  Horse Racing Ireland seem to be telling us that if we put tracks inside the tracks, we could use them for harness racing at different times of the year.  On the other hand, we would be sharing the stands, toilets, catering facilities, car parking and all the other fantastic facilities that all of these places have.  Let us be honest about it.  Most of the time, they are very under-utilised when one stacks up the number of events and the facilities in most places.  Even places such as Ballinrobe are used for the agricultural show in the summer.  I am not sure whether they bring in sport horses in on that particular day.  </p> <p>  The issue of veterinary standards goes back to the Irish Equine Centre.  We need to involve the Irish Equine Centre.  I think we all agree that veterinary standards should be the same, but my understanding is that, in terms of the actual day, one is looking at the premise that this is in hand.  </p> <p>  In respect of fixture flexibility, I go back to the Croke Park analogy.  I presume that conventional horse races on Horse Racing Ireland tracks, which were built for conventional horse racing, would take priority.  I do not think the harness racing people were complaining about that.  The flexibility relates to when they are not in use.  If facilities were built, I do not think they would have any problem finding plenty of days and plenty of seasons where no conventional horse racing is taking place.</p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned legislation.  Could he spell it out for us?  We can always change the legislation.  If there are issues relating to legislation, it would be a good idea to know exactly they are.  Perhaps we need to change the definitions.  People seem to think that legislation is immutable.  If we need to redefine racing, we can do so very easily by bringing in a one-line amendment to a number of Bills.  The 2001 Act was mentioned.  There is no problem with amending the Act.  Horse Racing Ireland just needs to tell us what we need to do to sort out that problem for it and we will willingly do it.  I do not think legislation should be seen as the major bugbear, because we can deal with that as legislators.  We do not know whether all of us will be legislators after the election, but those who take over from us will be able to look at that issue.  Direct negotiations between harness racing authorities in Ireland and France are matters for negotiation and if necessary, legislative change.  They are practical issues.  The point was made that it would take seven years to move forward.  </p> <p>  We need to take all the issues raised and look at them analytically.  I hope Horse Racing Ireland can start the process by giving us the information I requested today so that, over the Christmas period, we can look at it in conjunction with our report.  Unfortunately, most of us are not banking on being here after 30 January 2016 in this session of the D&aacute;il, and we would like to get our horse report out by then.  Perhaps we could get all of this information between now and Christmas Day.  It would inform us in writing our report.  I take the view that all sports, activities and things people want to do should be facilitated within reason.  I might favour some sports over others but I do not want to deny anybody else the right to enjoy sports that I might not favour.  We must recognise that there seems be some interest in harness racing.</p><p>They seem to be very committed to it and to be willing to adhere to the highest standards.  We concur fully with HRI that we need the highest standards, given that we have a very valuable industry.  I ask Mr. Bolger to outline how valuable the non-thoroughbred horse sport industry in Ireland is and the number of people involved in it nationally when one takes into account the special breeds and all the rest who are turning over a few euro there.  Am I right in thinking that top show jumpers, which we have not, unfortunately, produced in the quantity we should have, given our natural advantage, are worth very significant sums of money internationally?  Mr. Bolger might indicate to the committee what a top show jumper would be worth on the market?  What is the value of a top show jumper that would win the Olympics or a similar competition?  Mr. Bolger might give us a sense of that and the size of his industry.  Our view in the committee has been that while the thoroughbred industry is incredibly important and nothing must be done to damage it, the sport industry reaches out to many and puts a few euro in many pockets and that should also be developed significantly.  Money should be provided to that sector to develop also.</p></speech>

Arising from Mr. Kavanagh's response to some of the questions, he mentioned the international experience of harness or trotting racing in others countries, where they represented 3% or 5% of overall meetings.  I understand that the IHRA's request would not even come close to the examples Mr. Kavanagh put before us in terms of what it would like to see as an interim solution in the advancement of its own sport.  I refer back to the Dundalk meeting that was facilitated, which was very successful in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  The IHRA requires that kind of support if it is going to improve the integrity of its sport in terms of compliance, which Mr. Bolger says is good at any rate.  If the IHRA was successful in getting an interim solution and increasing the number of meetings it could hold, where would it come in the international standards Mr. Kavanagh quoted in terms of a league table of meetings?</p> <p>  I asked if HRI felt threatened by a very successful IHRA or harness racing sector.  Would it be financially threatened in the long term?  Would it feel some discomfort in its finances if the IHRA were to become a very successful organisation?  I did not attend the last meeting of the joint committee but I got the transcript and read that a meeting was planned in Killarney which did not go ahead.  The implication in the transcript seemed to be that HRI was to blame for the meeting not going ahead, but no reason was given.  I am coming to that because it is just hanging there.  If HRI stopped the meeting, was there a reason for that?  What engagement did it have with the board or management of Killarney Racecourse?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015121500002#O00500"><p>That would be on a par with the UK, slightly below Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and somewhat more below France.  The issue we have is that the IHRA's first request was for three meetings in Dundalk, which has moved to six.  On the last occasion, there was a discussion about 20 meetings a year in Dundalk.  There was also a discussion when the harness racing people were with the joint committee about using other tracks in addition to Dundalk, which brings us to the broader issue that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v touched on.  It is not clear to us what the IHRA's current requirements are in that respect.  It has said to us all along that it does not see Dundalk as its long-term home and wants to develop its own.  In 2009, it spoke about developing a facility at Collon in County Louth.  Obviously, there are existing facilities in Portmarnock and in other areas both North and South of the Border.  The debate moves from one to the other.  To answer the Deputy's direct question, if it was staging three race meetings a year in Dundalk, it would be on a par with the number of meetings staged on racetracks in the UK, slightly below Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and significantly below France.</p> <p>  Feeling threatened is not an issue whatsoever.  I would regard the development of harness racing as something welcome.  It would sit in the same way that greyhound racing and horse racing sit together.  With regard to Killarney, which was some time ago, there was an intended meeting on Killarney racetrack which was stopped by HRI for the same reasons and concerns we are debating here.  At that time, the position of HRI was that it was not supportive of harness racing on authorised racecourses, and that was proposed in Killarney.  The background to that type of position and the position we are debating today is concerns expressed by various bodies represented on the HRI board, including the trainers' association.  While they are agreeable to meetings being staged on a trial basis, they do not see harness and horse racing as compatible in the long term on the same race tracks.</p> <p>  I was asked about equality and legislation.  In his question, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v outlined the complexities we face.  There is detailed legislation governing our sport, which we welcome.  It is the envy of other countries.  Allocation of race fixtures, capital grants to racecourses, negotiation of media rights, levies on foals, regulation and the rules on racing and integrity are all done in accordance with legislation that is handed down.  To give equality of treatment to and apply the legislation to harness racing would be a major exercise.  It is not comparable with other countries, where harness racing is far more popular than here.  They are both run as separate sports with separate codes, governing bodies and rule books.  That is an indication of the complexity.</p></speech>

Presumably, HRI has no difficulty with that.  If harness racing is not racing, it is not racing.  Really, the only issue that arises then is that we might have to bring in legislation to cover harness racing.  That would be our business.</p></speech>

When he was out of the room, I said we have agreed to, and are undertaking, a two-phase process.  The first phase was to examine the veterinary standards that applied at the race meeting on 29 September.  We have a report on that and no major issues arose, which is what we expected.  The second phase is a prudent risk assessment of veterinary welfare standards within harness racing establishments.  That will be carried out in January on our behalf by the Turf Club.  The Deputy suggested the Irish Equine Centre, which may be a body well worth involving in that as well, and that information will be available and fully open for sharing at the end of January.</p></speech>

If race meetings were held two weeks apart and good protocols were employed to dispose of the stable manure and so on, how high is the risk, even in that circumstance, of cross-infection?  I would like the two bodies to comment on that.  Have they even analysed that issue?  That seems to be the nub of the issue.</p></speech>

Runners will often perform below standard in races and it turns out they were sick.  Members will read that in the newspapers.  Those horses have potentially left a virus behind in the racecourse stable.  The stables have to be appropriately cleaned and disinfected between race meetings but that does not always happen.  When horses are looked after properly, have good nutrition, have their vaccinations are up to date and there is better husbandry, the risk is minimised.</p> <p>  The IHRA has links with other international harness racing federations and it is trying to benchmark itself against international best practice.  There is another subset of horses that have nothing to do with the IHRA.  These are road racers, sulky racers and urban horses owned by Traveller and settled Travellers.  That is a huge concern for us.  I acknowledge we are not discussing this today but I want to flag it for the committee because this group cannot be left out of its report.  This has to be an area of concern for disease transmission, as Mr. Kavanagh highlighted, but this also has the potential, when there is adverse publicity associated with welfare, to reflect badly on the entire island, the land of the horse.  There is a &euro;1 million fund for urban horses and nobody has drawn down that money because the people in that subset are illiterate.  They are not in the way of putting a proposal together.  This is a separate subset that poses a risk for welfare and disease.  A fund is not being spent because they do not have the wherewithal to draw it down.</p></speech>

When we debated the issue, the county manager and welfare body representatives appeared before the committee.  We put a great deal of time into the urban horse issue one day and the thoroughbred representatives appeared the same day.  They said if even if all the non-microchipped ponies were removed from the county, they would be imported as fast as they were removed.  If there was, for example, a once-off disposal programme, it would not do what one would think it would do, because as quick as they were got rid of, more would come in.  Am I correct in thinking that, relatively, that would be a high risk to the entire horse industry if one of these unregulated horses, which is not microchipped, came into contact with other horses?</p> <p>  Professor Wall mentioned viruses.  Is organic matter needed for viruses to transmit animal to animal or can they be transmitted through dung and so on?  What precautions are taken against virus transmission?  I presume the highest risk is physical contact and risk is graded downwards from there.</p></speech>

They need living cells.  They do not survive as long in the environment.  The ideal is one horse coughing beside another horse.  A virus transmits easily in the same air space.  Bacterial infections can survive in the dung.  If a horse spits on the wall, it will survive on the wall between one race meeting and the next.  Currently, some racecourses do not clean the stables adequately.  They need to be cleaned and disinfected between meetings if it is be ensured there is no disease transmission.</p></speech>

They are separate industries.  I was involved a little in the sport horse industry.  They operate differently but they are compatible and that is what we are trying to address.  From the point of view of the committee's work, I thank the witnesses for their insight.  If we want the various aspects of the horse industry to develop to their full potential, that could happen with goodwill from all sides.  Shared venues at different tracks would be a useful avenue to pursue as long as the other matters are addressed, particularly security.</p><p>I appreciate that HRI is very cautious, no more than the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Food Safety Authority, about the reputation of its industry, which it represents and governs under legislation.  Likewise, we have to make sure that all sides can operate.  Professor Wall touched on the issue of sulky racing.  The misunderstanding and lack of awareness out there, because everyone sees the two as the same, needs to be clarified.  There may be an opportunity, if we could develop a better model of harness racing, to eliminate some of the other practices that are taking place and that are in the best interests of neither the animals nor the participants.  That is probably something we should look at.</p></speech>

In light of the cross-sectoral nature of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the range of views held in respect of the TTIP process, it is important for this committee to engage in a constructive and comprehensive consideration of the TTIP issues within its remit with a view to a specific output; namely, a report to the D&aacute;il.  If we are to produce a balanced report, it is important for us to hear from a wide range of stakeholders on all sides of the debate.  Therefore, I propose that we ask the Library and Research Service to prepare a scoping note which includes a list of stakeholders and sets out a proposed focus for our engagement with them.  This can be considered in conjunction with the list suggested by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n when we discuss the committee's annual report for 2015 and work programme for 2016 at our first meeting of the new year.  I would like to put the motion now.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Mary Buckley, executive director, Mr. Kieran Donoghue, head of global financial services and strategic policy, and Ms Regina Gannon, chief financial officer.  The committee has indicated that the focus of this session is on the 2014 IDA annual report.  I will make some brief introductory remarks on this and will provide the committee with some up to date information on 2015 and current activity.</p> <p>  The committee is obviously aware that IDA Ireland is the Government agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment, FDI.  In 2014, the year under review, we reported a very positive year from an FDI perspective.  Just over 15,000 new jobs were created by IDA client companies during 2014.  When job losses were taken into account, the net increase in employment was just over 7,000.  A total of 197 investments were won in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in greenfield investment, with 88 new name investors coming to Ireland in 2014, equating to a 13% increase on the previous year.  There were 174,488 people employed in IDA client companies at the end of 2014, the highest level in the history to date of IDA Ireland.  Among the leading investments secured during 2014 were Amazon, Bristol Myers Squibb, Fidelity, LinkedIn, Survey Monkey, Airbnb, PayPal, Ericsson, SAP, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, West Pharmaceuticals, Zendesk, Adroll and New Relic.  Some of those investments are regional investments and I will elaborate on some regional announcements in 2014.  They included Jazz Pharmaceuticals in County Roscommon, Becton Dickinson in Drogheda, NuVasive in Waterford, Teleflex in Athlone and ClearStream Technologies in Enniscorthy.  Particularly strong performances were posted by several regions, notably the north east and south west.</p> <p>  While the results in the 2014 report relate to direct employment, IDA Ireland estimates that an additional 122,000 jobs are supported indirectly by IDA client companies, widening the economic spin-off.  This is based on a multiplier of 0.7.  It is also estimated that approximately 10,000 people were employed on construction projects under way with IDA client companies in 2014, providing a considerable economic boost to the areas in which that construction activity was undertaken.  </p> <p>  In February 2015, IDA Ireland announced its new strategy for the next five years entitled, Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019.  The target of this strategy is to increase investment by 40%.  IDA Ireland aims to win 900 individual projects, creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the next five years.  This will be based on an ability to respond to clients' needs efficiently, effectively and ahead of the competition.  These are ambitious targets and if they are delivered, they will bring total direct employment by overseas companies in Ireland to 209,000 people by 2019.  This will obviously deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for the people of Ireland.</p> <p>  IDA Ireland is targeting a 20% increase in spending by overseas firms within Ireland during the life of the next strategy.  In particular, IDA Ireland is committed to showcasing the capabilities of Irish industry to its client companies as a source of products, services, technology and innovation.  A 20% increase in cumulative spend on research and development is also being targeted.  This would mean a &euro;3 billion spend on research and development over the life of the strategy.  We view this as feasible as overseas companies place additional high-value added activity and research into Ireland.  A key element of the IDA Ireland strategy over the next five years is a focus on increasing investment in regional locations outside of Dublin.  IDA Ireland has set a target to increase investments in all regions outside of Dublin by 30% to 40%.  This target is extremely challenging given that the global trend is towards FDI locating in large urban areas of scale.  IDA Ireland is implementing a range of measures to achieve this objective.</p> <p>  Increasing globalisation, technological developments and geopolitical influences have resulted in a worldwide FDI portfolio that is in a constant state of flux and transformation.  New sectors will emerge, some existing sectors will thrive and others will decline.  The past ten years alone have witnessed many such changes.  We have seen global business services develop into a key driver of FDI.  Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector has been transformed with the reduction in lower value-add activities and a new focus on high value-add manufacturing and research and development.  The manufacturing sector remains very strong with 23% of Ireland's GDP attributable to manufacturing activity.  This figure is high in a European context.  Ireland is particularly strong in high-value and highly-regulated zero-defect manufacturing.  Ireland's future FDI success will require bolstering existing sectors, exploiting new opportunities and replacing declining activities.  A critical element of IDA Ireland's new strategy will be a continued strong focus on the traditional key sectors of technology, encompassing everything from hardware through to software and the Internet; life sciences, which includes pharma, bio-pharma and medical devices; international financial services; media and content; engineering; business services; and food.  IDA Ireland will continue to help support these sectors to thrive by winning new investors as well as partnering with clients to explore development opportunities.  </p> <p>  While IDA Ireland will maintain its current sector focus supported by detailed sectoral strategies, it will also look towards new sources of FDI.  Many exciting opportunities exist at the point where the sectors in which we have existing strengths converge and intersect.  Given Ireland's scale and the strength in these sectors, IDA Ireland believes there is significant scope to capitalise on these opportunities.  The rapid growth of technology is seeing a wave of new opportunities which Ireland is perfectly positioned to exploit.  Trends towards cloud, social, mobile and data analytics are having a profound impact across a range of sectors.</p><p>We will seek to exploit those opportunities in future.</p><p> IDA Ireland is looking to other sectors to widen the flow of investment into Ireland as the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector changes, expands and develops over the next five years.  Key targets over this time period will be the marine economy, investments linked to infrastructure, property, arts and culture and energy services.  Long-term investments made by the Government in areas such as infrastructure, education and technology have underpinned the attraction of FDI to date.  These investments created the environment within which we are marketing to companies and we need that level of investment to continue in order to remain competitive.  We need a continued focus on investment in skills, property and infrastructure in order to replicate past successes.</p><p> The US continues to be the key source market, with 70% of FDI coming from there.  Europe is our second-largest market, with 20% of FDI originating there.  The US economy is performing strongly now but Europe is not performing as strongly and it is much more subdued.  Approximately 10% of investments come from the remainder, which is what we term emerging or growth markets.  That includes the Asia-Pacific area, Brazil and Russia.</p><p> The strong performance in 2014 has continued into 2015.  Final results for 2015 will not be available until January next year but we published some interim results mid-year, which demonstrated that 110 investment projects were approved, with 9,000 jobs associated with them in the first six months of the year.  This compares with 100 investments for the same period in 2014 and 8,000 direct jobs.  The flow of investments is ahead and I can confirm that the performance has continued into the second half of the year.  A notable feature of announcements in the first half of 2015 were the large number of investments, particularly with a capital-intensive element, going to locations outside Dublin.  Currently, 59% of employment in the FDI portfolio is outside Dublin.  Approximately half of the investments to the mid-year point were new-name investments into Ireland.  A long list of companies have announced investments, although not all companies do so.  They include the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Vistakon plant in Limerick, which is investing &euro;100 million into expansion; DePuy Synthes of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, investing &euro;53 million, with 80 new jobs; Northern Trust, with 300 jobs in Limerick; Facebook, seeking planning for a new data centre in Clonee in Meath; Agora Publishing setting up with 100 jobs in Portlaw in Waterford; Viagogo, expanding in Limerick with 200 jobs; Zimmer investing &euro;51 million in Oranmore, creating 250 jobs; ABEC Inc going into Fermoy, north Cork, with 100 jobs associated with the project initially; Apple going into Athenry, announcing what will be one of the largest data centres in Europe when it is finished, with &euro;850 million invested; Alexion Pharmaceuticals announcing that it will build its first biologics plant outside the US in Blanchardstown, west Dublin; Zalando, a Berlin company, setting up in Dublin, creating 200 jobs; and Slack, one of the many information technology companies from San Francisco - a high-growth company - setting up its European headquarters in Dublin, creating 100 jobs.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General signed off on the annual accounts on 29 May 2015.  The total funding for 2014 was &euro;130.8 million.  Our employment control framework number of 272 staff in 2014 was operated within during the year.</p><p> The immediate pipeline is encouraging across a range of sectors but we take nothing for granted.  Every single job created in Ireland by overseas companies is hard-fought both by us and the subsidiaries of the companies based here already.  They are won against ever-increasing competition from a growing range of overseas locations that are becoming more sophisticated in their offerings and marketing activity.  We need to be vigilant and avoid complacency, particularly in the area of cost competitiveness, which is one of the key metrics that companies consider when they are coming to Ireland.  A poor growth outlook for Europe will also be a challenge.  I mentioned the importance of investment in education and training, as a supply of talented graduates will be an element on which we will either win or lose investment.  Despite a challenging environment, IDA Ireland is confident the out-turn for 2015 will be reasonably strong and we have a very clear strategy for 2015 to 2019.  The performance to date and the strong announcements this year are based on the work of the IDA Ireland team across the globe, both here in Dublin and in 19 other locations.  They are the people who go out and win the investments.</p></speech>

To start with the point on which Mr. Shanahan finished, I pay tribute to him and his team on this island and across the world for the work they do.  There is no doubt they continue to break records everywhere and they will manage to keep ahead of the competition.  Approximately 15,000 jobs have been created and nearly 8,000 have been lost so how does that compare with other international agencies?  We nearly create two new jobs for each one we lose.  Are any specific sectors losing jobs in particular?</p> <p>  The witness mentioned a number of large-scale capital projects and some of those were delayed in planning.  Is our planning system fit for purpose of the kinds of companies that IDA Ireland is trying to entice, particularly with regard to the likes of data centres and other buildings that take up much space?  There has again been a negative focus on our corporation tax while the quality of our labour force and research and development, for example, is ignored.  Is that an ongoing negative issue with clients?  Is it on the radar?  Cost competitiveness was mentioned, as well as the need to keep on top of it, so what are the specific cost areas that you are concerned about?</p> <p>  The witness will not be surprised when I mention the regions.  There were six regional action plans published and they commit to 427 new investment projects outside Dublin between now and 2019.  The IDA strategy commits to 900 individual investments.  With some plans yet to be published, the various regional jobs action plans are committing to nearly half of those plans being outside Dublin, with each area getting an increase of approximately 30% or 40%.  Given that IDA Ireland has not yet broken 40% in terms of investments, how will it be done, given the pressures mentioned in terms of urbanisation?  Do the regional jobs action plans dovetail into the IDA Ireland plan?  What specific new strategies are to be engaged to ensure that kind of investment can be achieved in the regions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015121500002#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The net figure arising from jobs created and lost compares reasonably favourably to international norms.  In the period from 2008 to 2013 or 2014, the number of job losses as a function of the global economic downturn increased.  Our job is essentially maintain job losses at their lowest possible point.</p><p>We work with companies in order to help them to transform and develop.  There will always be a level of churn within the base which is the same all over and is not just a feature in Ireland - it is a feature of international economies in terms of their structure.  I do not think there is anything particular out of order in that regard.  We look at what is done in other jurisdictions.  In particular, we examine at what is done in other jurisdictions which we believe are equally engaged in attracting foreign direct investment.  Last week, I met my counterpart who is the head of the Economic Development Board, EDB, which is the Singaporean development agency, to discuss its outlook for foreign direct investment and to share our outlook for foreign direct investment with it.  Obviously, we compete in the marketplace on a lot of matters.  There are also areas on which two small economies such as ours can share experiences.  We are  satisfied that we are doing as well as anybody else in terms of what we do to create jobs, to market Ireland and to sustain existing jobs.</p><p> The level of investment in capital projects is very encouraging because, essentially, it makes the jobs "sticky".  In other words, if companies are going to invest a significant amount of money in buildings, in the kitting them out and in the case of pharma, biopharma and medical devices, in particular, in very sophisticated equipment, all of which is not easily transported and means that the companies are here for longer periods.  These projects are complex in nature and, therefore, the planning processes tend to be more complex.</p><p> To answer a point made by a member, we are happy with the planning processes.  We engage heavily, we have our own property portfolio and we help clients through this process.  The quicker the process is, the better from our perspective.  We compete internationally so having certainty about the timeframes for the process is really important.  The quicker a process can be  expedited the better, while ensuring that the planning process is robust.  Obviously, we would not want it to be anything less than robust.  The more certainty there is about the process rather than the outcome is desirable from IDA Ireland's perspective and from the point of view of winning foreign direct investment.</p><p> There is a continued and disproportionate focus on the part of the media, both nationally and internationally, on taxation in Ireland.  We have a very transparent, consistent and competitive taxation regime.  We should be unapologetic about the fact that we compete in the area of tax.  All jurisdictions compete on tax.  Ireland has been a full participant in the OECD process in respect of base erosion and profit shifting.  Ireland has made changes to its taxation regime over the past two budgetary cycles.  It has addressed the issue of stateless companies.  It has also addressed the residency rules, which means that if one is registered in Ireland, one is now also tax resident here.  There is a grandfather period for a number of companies.  In the most recent budget, the Minister for Finance announced that Ireland would be one of the first countries to introduce country-by-country reporting.  Independent studies show that Ireland's effective tax rate is very close to its headline rate.  Therefore, we have nothing to be concerned about.</p><p> Companies are interested in taxation but they are interested in what the Irish offering is and what our plans are.  They are interested in understanding the features of the Irish taxation system.  Companies want to know that the 12.5% rate, which has been constant for some time, will remain.  They are interested in the new developments over the past two budgetary cycles where we have improved the research and development tax credit.  The knowledge development box has been introduced, which means income associated with intellectual property, as a result of research and development in Ireland, will now attract a 6.25% rate and companies are interested in same.  The rules around amortisation of IP are attractive.  All of those aspects add up to a fairly competitive offering.</p><p> Two companies were mentioned that have been involved in mergers and acquisitions activity recently - Pfizer and Allergan.  Companies make decisions for commercial reasons.  Often when they engage in mergers and acquisitions activity, the first order of business is deciding whether they are a good fit.  They have to make a commercial decision.  I suspect the second aspect is analysing location from a tax perspective.  I am not saying that is always the case but when two big companies come together, there has to be more to it than just proceeding for tax reasons.  Both of the companies in question have had a long engagement with Ireland - in Pfizer's case since the late 1960s and in Allergan's case since the late 1970s.  Collectively, they have multiple plants in Ireland and employ over 4,000 people.  We work with both companies individually at present.  When the merger happens, we will work with them jointly.  We view the merger as an opportunity to increase substance even further as they transfer their international headquarters to Ireland.</p><p> In terms of costs and cost competitiveness, I shall outline the areas that we continually need to consider but first I wish to point out that Ireland is cost competitive.  There has been a lot of negative impacts from the economic downturn.  However, one of the positive impacts, if one can call it that, is that Ireland became more competitive in terms of property prices and rents and in the context of wage levels remaining constant.  There has been an upturn in the economy so we need to ensure that we do not lose our competitiveness and keep it relative to everybody else.  That is the bar for us.  We are competing with other countries so we must be relative to everybody else not relative to what happens here over time whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  That is what we must keep an eye on.</p><p> In terms of regional strategies, IDA Ireland has been heavily involved in the development of regional strategies and the regional Action Plan for Jobs, together with our colleagues in Enterprise Ireland and a number of other agencies.  We very much welcome the development of regional strategies.  It puts a focus on job creation and enterprise development at a regional level.  It brings together stakeholders that can make a difference at a regional level and develop plans for a region.  Job creation is obviously not just about foreign direct investment, it is about what is being done by Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, Bord F&aacute;ilte, local authorities, IDA Ireland and everybody else.</p><p> The numbers announced for the targeted projects are consistent with what has been published on pages 35 and 36 of IDA Ireland's strategy.  In our strategy, we set out the number of investments we are targeting.  As Deputy Calleary pointed out, they are of the order of between 30% and 40% over the five-year period.  There is nothing easy about the challenge we have set out in our strategy.  It going to be very difficult but everything we do is done with a view to increasing investment in regional areas.  Let me outline some of things that we are doing in that regard.  First, the development of regional action plans will be of assistance.  Different regions will come together to identify what can be targeted and what areas to focus on.  We have increased our teams at regional level.  We have appointed new regional managers in a number of regions which did not have them previously.  We have aligned marketing activity internationally through the operations division in Dublin with different regions.  Therefore, we have targeted specific activity at certain regions.  That focus will continue.  The Government has provided us with &euro;150 million over the five years to develop new property solutions at regional level.</p><p>Again, one of the features of the economic downturn was that developers stopped developing.  Private sector developers have been very slow to come back into the market, particularly at regional level.  The IDA has set out a programme of building advance buildings in a number of regions and that process is now under way.  We also must acquire some strategic sites over the coming period as existing strategic sites come to the end of use because they are let to multinationals.  We also plan to upgrade our business and technology parks around the country, of which there are approximately 33.</p><p> All of that is the focus.  There is no mistaking that it will be a huge challenge against the backdrop I set out in my opening statement, which is that the international trend is towards investments moving towards urban areas of scale.  Again, I remind the members that we are competing not just within Ireland - it is not just between different urban areas, regions, towns or parishes within Ireland - but also in an international game.  We are competing with 190 cities in China that have a population of over 1 million people, 36 cities in Europe with a population of over 1 million as well as 50 metropolitan areas in the US with over 1 million people.  They are all potential targets for the type of investment we are chasing.  That is the reason our approach is a regional one, where we can show scale by aggregating up regions rather than at a lower level.</p></speech>

First, I congratulate the witnesses on the level of job creation in which they have been involved.  From our perspective, we sometimes like to see what types of things can be fixed within a process to make it even better for the country, and the IDA can be coy about discussing those because it does not wish to send out a negative message and so forth.</p> <p>  However, a couple of matters have caused people concern with regard to our competitive advantage.  The witness mentioned different competitive advantages.  Our rating in the International Institute for Management Development, IMD, talent report has dropped ten places as regards talent.  There are also major pinch points at present with residential rents and availability, commercial rents and availability and infrastructure, with capacity levels being reached.  What effect is that having on the IDA's role and what do the witnesses believe should be changed there?  There is an example in America where multinationals decamp from places such as Silicon Valley to satellite locations.  If a similar culture can be developed in this country, it could be quite useful for the companies and for the country's spatial strategy.</p> <p>  Also, with regard to spatial strategy, the national spatial strategy was developed in 2002 and is now largely defunct.  We are awaiting the next national planning framework.  What is the IDA's guiding role with regard to the delivery of locations?</p> <p>  Taxation is a sore point in many respects.  The chief economist of the Department of Finance, in an appearance before the finance committee, stated that he did not know for sure what was leading to such volatility with corporation taxation.  There is also the fact that 140 FDI firms account for 70% of corporation tax.  It is a very narrow corporation tax base.  What are the witnesses' views on the volatility in that area?</p> <p>  How can we link better with SMEs?  The witness said there is some work on linking SMEs with FDI but in international terms, and I am aware that Ireland is an outlier because it is smaller than Germany and so forth, the linkage between SMEs and FDI is a little lower here than it should be.  Some people say that FDI operates as an island to a certain extent, as it imports a sizeable chunk of its inputs.</p> <p>  The witness spoke about regional development, so I will not go back over that.  He outlined what the project is, to resolve the lopsided economy that currently exists.  Interestingly, the north-east Border region appears to be quite successful.  There was a 51% increase in IDA supported jobs there in the four year period of 2010 to 2014, which is fantastic.  Perhaps we could discuss the key success factors in that and how that has worked.  My native county is Meath.  Unfortunately, I am criticised when I mention this but it is still a poor relation when it comes to the IDA.  When jobs are created in Dublin, there is one job for every 17 people.  In Kildare, there is one job for every 50 people but in Meath there is one job for every 147.  Meath is way down on the list in the mid-east circle around Dublin in that regard.</p> <p>  Finally, Mr. Shanahan mentioned the IDA's standing in the context of key performance indicators internationally with regard to the level of jobs it has created and saved.  However, as far as euro per job is concerned, is there any mapping of key performance indicators among some of its competitor agencies?  I realise they are not all directly comparable.  The Scottish competitor looks after indigenous and external development, but it would be interesting to hear about the per euro issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015121500002#J00400"><p>I will take the matters in the order in which the Deputy put them.  The competitiveness factors the Deputy mentioned are all a concern for the IDA, and will continue to be a concern.  We will never resolve them because there will always be somebody else doing other things.</p> <p>  To return to something I said in response to Deputy Calleary, the talent availability will determine Ireland's success in attracting, or not attracting, foreign direct investment into the future.  That is where investors are focused.  They want to be able to set up in a jurisdiction, attract talent quickly and be able to scale up and add to that talent quickly.  Focusing on education and skills, ensuring that we perform in the rankings and ensuring that we have the right match between skills availability and the demands of our client base are really important.  We spend much time articulating what those demands are.  We liaise with the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS, and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on a regular basis to try to ensure that matching.  Obviously, the performance of our universities internationally is important in that regard.</p> <p>  However, what comes through our university or institute of technology systems or through the apprenticeship system is not the only source of talent.  Another source of talent is the fact that we have access to a European labour market of 200 million people who are free to come and work in Ireland.  More important than the fact that they can come and work here without impediment is the fact that they want to come and work here.  Ensuring that Ireland remains attractive and open and is marketing itself to those talents and skills, including returning Irish people who may have left for economic or other reasons over the recent past, is hugely important.</p> <p>  We have seen some increases in commercial rents.  However, there is variability in the market, so the significant increases are largely isolated to particular areas of Dublin, for example, and close to what is termed the silicon docks, where there have been increases.  There is still very good value to be had in Ireland and in Dublin, outside of that area, and, indeed, outside Dublin.  The same can be said about residential rents.  Residential rents within the city centre and close to the central business district, if one can term it that way, have risen, but there is really good value still available outside that area and outside Dublin.</p> <p>  Essentially, that speaks to why we set out the strategy we outlined back in February.  We intend to target the same high level of investment into Dublin, but we want all of the increase in investment to happen outside of Dublin.</p><p>There are good social and economic reasons for doing that.  The social reason is to spread wealth creation and the availability of employment into the regions.  The economic reason is that if we keep putting all the increased investment into Dublin we will meet some of the constraints the Deputy mentioned, with higher prices on the residential and commercial sides.  Our strategy is to try to push that investment out of Dublin.  We want Dublin to be successful and are achieving a high level of investment into Dublin, and the flows this year show that.  It is not a competition between Dublin and the rest of the country.  We could achieve high levels of investment into Dublin and into the rest of the country.  That is the objective.  The more we spread it, the more we will achieve value for investors, who will reinvest if they receive a return on investment.</p><p> We use a somewhat similar approach to the one the Deputy outlined of companies decamping from Silicon Valley.  We call it a second-site approach.  Companies may have invested, or be planning to invest, in Dublin because there is activity they wish, or need, to undertake in Dublin but there may also be activities they can carry out in a regional location.  That is what we seek to do.  </p><p> The national spatial strategy is in the past and there are plans for a new approach.  We had an opportunity in our strategy to set out our plans and had some regard to the previous spatial strategy, but our approach is to achieve a 30% to 40% increase in each of the regions.  In the regional Action Plan for Jobs we have set out in more detail some of the things that need to happen in order to develop the regions.</p><p> I am not sure about volatility, but there is an increase in the corporation tax take.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners are best placed to comment directly on what they observe coming in.  I do not have access to that information.  I do not think it will look incongruent when the IDA publishes its results next January.  The flow of investments in 2015 is strong, as it was in 2014.  We are seeing an increased amount of investment, which is substantiated by the numbers employed.  There is a congruence between those results.</p> <p>  In respect of SMEs and the international experience, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, EI, work extremely closely together on a range of matters.  I regularly meet my counterpart in EI, Julie Sinnamon, to see how we can co-operate across many sectors we have in common to ensure there is synergy and complementarity in our work with multinationals, how the indigenous base can benefit from the presence of multinationals, and how we can use our strong cadre of Irish firms in several sectors to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, in the sense that multinationals can partner with them, use their technology or use them as sub-suppliers and do joint ventures together.  That might ultimately lead to acquisition, although that is not what we set out to achieve.  We want to see Irish firms grow and prosper and make independent public offerings, IPOs, if that is to be.  There is a great deal of co-operation.  Under the new strategy we will focus on that area and have outlined some of the things I have spoken about to achieve those ends.  We have put in place some very practical measures to expedite these synergies.  We share with EI details of every new IDA client that comes on board, with its blessing, saying who it is and what business it is in.  That gives EI the opportunity to put together lists of sub-suppliers which might pitch to this new client.  We do this particularly where there is substantial capital investment, and there may be Irish companies which can play a part in that investment.  We have had that streamlined process in place since the start of this year.  We are going back over the existing portfolio to see what opportunities exist to make those connections.  We have introduced, together with EI, new initiatives, such as trade missions to Ireland.  In the same way as EI brings Irish companies abroad to expose them to multinationals, which might acquire and procure from them.  We bring Irish companies around Ireland to pitch to existing multinationals so that they may get access to the global supply chain of those companies.  This is the second year we have done that and it has proved very successful.</p> <p>  We are studying other areas where we may work with EI around mobile entrepreneurship.  We pitch to emerging companies that have already set up; they may be small and they may be going international for the first time.  EI does similar work with entrepreneurs who do not have any presence but have a good idea and seek funding.  We are working on how we might do that in a more cohesive way.  There is a lot of activity. </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned how we compare with others in this regard.  That is difficult to assess, given that the presence of FDI is much more concentrated in Ireland than in any other country.  That makes it much more difficult to judge how we are doing.  At a macro level, Ireland has achieved between three and four times the amount of FDI one might expect given our size, based on GDP or size of population.  There are no neat comparisons.  I meet with my colleagues from other investment promotion agencies.  They are typically judged by slightly different metrics and count slightly different things, so it is difficult to get a universal comparator.</p></speech>

I was delighted to be in Galway for the announcement of jobs in Phenox, which is very welcome.  I acknowledge the level of job growth in the west since 2010, from 14,614 supported by IDA and associated companies up to 18,652 in 2014, which equates to some 4,040 extra jobs, or a 27.6% increase, one of the largest increases outside the Dublin area.</p> <p>  I understand the cost of jobs supported by the IDA has decreased from over &euro;14,500 between 2004 and 2010 to &euro;11,800 between 2008 and 2014.  Does that reflect the downturn in the economy or improving competition?  Does Mr. Shanahan have any comment on that?</p><p> I would like to repeat a question that I put to representatives of Enterprise Ireland when they were in here recently.  To what extent can the increase in projects be influenced by the new approach to embassies and consulates in places like the United States and elsewhere?  I refer to the sort of Ireland House initiative in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the embassies and consulates.</p><p> I would like to ask about IDA Ireland's regional facilities in the context of the allocation of an extra &euro;21 million to the authority from the supplementary budget of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  An advanced facility in Galway is earmarked for 2017.  I was surprised to hear the managing director of Phenox highlight at yesterday's announcement that it took over a year to find a suitable building in Galway.  These facilities need to be expedited, certainly in my area.</p><p> I missed Deputy Calleary's comments, but I understand he touched on certain planning issues.  Do the witnesses think we have unnecessary planning delays in this country, by comparison with our European counterparts?  Have the companies with which they deal mentioned that they find it difficult to secure planning?</p><p> I am aware that IDA Ireland has notified Ministers about certain problems in Galway, such as the traffic issues at the Parkmore site.  I understand there is a possibility of getting financing for that site.  Certainly, IDA Ireland is looking for financing at that location.  Has it had any consultation or engagement with the National Transport Authority regarding bus solutions at this location?  Believe it or not, there is no east-west bus route that does not go through Eyre Square.  It seems rather basic that there would be such a route, but it has not been delivered.  What level of engagement has IDA Ireland had with the National Transport Authority?  Have companies based at the Parkmore site highlighted this problem with IDA Ireland?</p></speech>

As Deputy Kyne pointed out, the cost per job has been declining.  The cost per sustainable job currently stands at &euro;11,817.  It is calculated on the basis of jobs that are sustained over a seven-year period.  My role and that of my colleagues is to try to win jobs at the lowest possible cost to the State.  We try to win investments that have no grant support, or the lowest level of grant support, attached to them.  The cost per job has declined over recent years.  We would hope to maintain a very competitive cost per job.  It is not necessarily a reflection of the economic downturn.  The cost per job is based on the number of jobs we are getting in.  Regardless of whether it is large or small, the cost remains the same.</p> <p>  The types of supports have changed over time.  Regional aid guidelines have placed greater constraints on what we can support.  That is not necessarily an issue when we are competing with other European countries, but of course it can be constraining when we are competing with the rest of the world.  Our ultimate target is to get in as much investment as possible at the least possible cost to the State.</p> <p>  We have very good relations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We have 19 offices across the globe.  Where possible, we have engaged in an Ireland House solution, which involves representatives of IDA Ireland being co-located with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland and other agencies.  In some areas, such an approach has not yet been possible but it will be possible as different organisations exit their leases, etc.  In some cases, we have slightly different business models, we are targeting different cohorts or we are in slightly different locations within a country.  For the most part, we work very well together as part of the Ireland House approach.  I was in Japan, Korea and Singapore early last week and the previous week.  The ambassadors and embassy teams in each location offer substantial supports to IDA Ireland's operations locally, which are one-man operations for the most part.  We need that backup.  Given the small footprints we have, we need the Irish agencies on the ground - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the embassy staff - to work closely together to achieve our collective objectives.  I meet my counterpart, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and many other colleagues in that Department on a regular basis.  We have annual engagement on our plans.  I think that approach is working quite well.  In the past two years, we have engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other agencies on local market plans to ensure all of the players know what the other players are doing.  We make sure we are not tripping over one another in the market and we are identifying any opportunities that may exist.  I think that is working quite well.</p> <p>  The advanced technology building in Galway will start in 2016.  It may not be completed until 2017, but it is scheduled to commence in 2016.  We have completed two advanced technology buildings, in Waterford and Athlone, and a further three buildings are now in the pipeline, in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  We have three more planned for next year.  As I outlined in response to Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Calleary, we have stepped in to provide property because we would ideally like to see the private sector come in and respond to the undoubted need for more commercial property - advanced office and advanced technology buildings - in these areas, but this has not happened to date.  The availability of property, particularly office buildings, is quite tight in a number of locations.  IDA Ireland's property team, working with clients, is heavily involved in making the significant effort that is required to identify suitable property solutions.  We are currently advancing to build these solutions as quickly as our internal resources and financial resources allow.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy Kyne that we are engaging with the National Transport Authority to try to identify a solution to the difficulties at Parkmore.  One solution may involve greater use of public transport.  There may also be a requirement for an infrastructural solution in the form of a slip road or something.  We are currently engaged with the National Transport Authority and the council in relation to that.  It is high on our agenda.  We have engaged with all of the clients in Parkmore on it.</p></speech>

It is good to see such a buoyant report.  I note that over the last couple of years, IDA Ireland-supported companies in my own county, which has not received many visitations, have increased the number of jobs they provide.  That sort of news is always good.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions, the first of which relates to IDA Ireland's links with other funding agencies within the State, such as Science Foundation Ireland.  I suggest that such agencies could be used as a source of finance to attract investment in our research and development and knowledge box package.  What links are associated with such agencies?</p> <p>  Mr. Shanahan mentioned in his report that Ireland has an above-average number of manufacturing firms, by comparison with Europe as a whole.  Does he see the high number of such companies as a problem as we go forward?  Does he think there is a skills shortage in this area?  I am thinking particularly of apprenticeships.  Does IDA Ireland have links with the Apprenticeship Council in this regard?  Is it able to issue directions in this respect?</p> <p>  Many Irish entrepreneurs have set up companies overseas.  Does IDA Ireland keep a database of them so that it might be able to entice them to come back?</p><p>I know we are not going to get the Intels or similar into the country but the smaller companies.  Has IDA Ireland a database of Irish entrepreneurs involved in such overseas companies?</p><p> Has the agency identified constraints in the economy?  I am referring to infrastructural constraints.  There is much argument about whether we are spending enough on infrastructure, be it roads, broadband or the rail network.  Has the IDA spoken out about it?  The agency must be getting indications as to reasons companies are not coming here.  Is one of these reasons concerns about infrastructure?  Yesterday, IBEC said that more money, particularly the recent corporation tax windfall, needed to be invested in infrastructure.  Some may call it a windfall but companies are paying corporation tax because they are making profits.</p><p> On my earlier point about IDA site visits, is Kildare not a sexy county?  Does the IDA go to other counties rather than Kildare?  As Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, it is the counties on the periphery of Dublin that do not seem to be as attractive?</p><p> What are the consequences of the recent Supreme Court judgment on a compulsory purchase order, CPO, of lands in Maynooth?  What are the costs associated with that?  We are all talking about regional development and acquiring landbanks.  The case in question and the judgment has caused problems for IDA Ireland and local authorities.  I saw the consequences of such a judgment on CPOs affect local authorities because of the McHugh case in County Kildare many years ago.</p></speech>

It has some of the largest employers in the country, including Intel and HP.  We continue to market Kildare.  Tying in with Deputy Lawlor&rsquo;s final question, our interest in Kildare remains because we believe there is development potential and that is why we were trying to acquire a landbank there.  Several years ago, we started trying to acquire the landbank in question, which was the subject of a recent Supreme Court judgment.  We did that because we believed the land in question was well suited and had significant development potential, given the activity we have already secured in that area.  It was a prime location to secure further development.  The Supreme Court has made its decision.  We have no intention of revisiting those particular lands.</p> <p>  On the costs of both the High Court and Supreme Court cases, the IDA indemnified itself through insurance for the costs of the judicial review of the case in question.  The costs are limited to &euro;200,000, which is the excess on the policy.  We still require a landbank in the mid-east to win more investment for Kildare and other counties.  We will go back to the drawing board now to see what our next step will be to progress a strategic site for development in the mid-east.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland is probably closer to Irish companies which have internationalised.  If there are Irish companies which have solely set up abroad and never had a presence in Ireland, there are a number of processes where we can capture this diaspora.  The Global Irish Network would be one of those.  Many of the individuals involved were present at the Global Irish Economic Forum recently in Dublin.  Trying to identify people abroad who have a business or some clout in a business is very much the way the IDA works.  We are plugged in in those locations where we have a presence, whether that is the US or in Asia, to understand who we might be able to influence.  That includes Irish people who are operating at senior levels in those businesses or who have businesses themselves whom we might attract back.</p></speech>

In recognition of its importance and as part of our new strategy, we have set up a corporate strategy and public policy group.  We have assigned two executives responsibility for all forms of infrastructure, whether it is broadband, energy, waste and water, transport, property or anything else.  We want to get on top of what the needs of our clients are and get a handle on the current carrying capacity of the economy regarding those infrastructure items.</p> <p>  What we detected in recent times is that the economy is moving from a phase in which it had excess infrastructure capacity as a consequence of the downturn and the economic recession to a phase now in which we need to think strategically about what infrastructure we need to put in place to elevate the carrying capacity of the economy, which will allow us to deliver more foreign direct investment into it.  That is an exercise that we are undertaking with our clients.  We will be feeding our proposals for where there needs to be infrastructural investment, both nationally and regionally, to the relevant Departments next year.  We would like to recognise and acknowledge the Government's capital programme and decision to involve NAMA, the National Asset Management Agency, in the provision of commercial real estate, housing, etc.  This is recognition of the need to now begin to invest in infrastructure for the next phase of growth in the economy.</p></speech>

To my mind, we need to continue ensuring costs are maintained at a reasonable level.  That does not mean that there cannot be inflation in costs.  However, it means we cannot outpace our competitors in terms of cost increases.  That is probably a significant issue now, as the economy is experiencing increased levels of growth.</p></speech>

Let us take this back a step and look at the example of an international manufacturing company coming into Ireland.  I am using manufacturing as an example because it remains significantly important to Ireland as it comprises 23% of gross domestic product, GDP.  Our nearest neighbour, the UK, is at 10% or 11% in this regard.  Deputy Lawlor earlier asked whether we should be concerned about manufacturing representing this percentage of GDP.  No; we should try to increase it.  We are really good at high-value, highly regulated, zero-defect manufacturing.  However, there are significant inputs in this sector.</p><p>On the point made by Deputy Collins regarding costs, there are costs for labour, energy, water, wastewater and construction.  When international companies are making a decision, they have an Excel spreadsheet with columns for each of these costs and they compare different jurisdictions from a cost, productivity and availability of labour perspective and so on.  We need as many of the cells in the spreadsheet to be green for Ireland so as to put us ahead of competitors in all of those areas.  I do not suggest we have significant competitiveness issues currently, but that we need to ensure these issues do not arise.  Some of our strategy in terms of spreading investment throughout the country is an effort to ameliorate cost pressures in any one location.</p><p> The main issue is not competitiveness but the availability of talent.  This is the biggest issue.  Throughout the US, Asia and Europe, companies talk about the availability of people to undertake the work they want done.  If we are to compare Dublin to international locations in terms of the availability of talent, we compare well currently.  Much of the talent required is available here, but we need to ensure we continue to produce as many people as possible for the sectors that need them through our education system if we are to continue to remain attractive to people from Europe and further afield.  We need to continue to train highly skilled, talented people who will contribute in terms of productivity and our potential to attract investment.  From the competitiveness perspective, this is the most important issue on our agenda.</p></speech>

Well done to him on maintaining a professional approach on the day.  I do not know how he managed it.</p> <p>  In his report, Mr. Shanahan alluded to the fact that any kind of regional balance beyond the urban areas is a challenge when it comes to foreign direct investment.  I agree and have felt this is the case for some time.  I am the only Dublin Deputy here today, but I respect the fact that people outside Dublin find it hard to ensure jobs are delivered in their areas.  Given that 70% of jobs of foreign direct investment originates within the US, the main challenge lies there.  Mr. Donoghue mentioned capacity issues that are coming down for all regions and said the IDA would feed in to the various bodies to ensure these can be addressed as far as possible.  From the Dublin perspective, are there ways our local authorities - the four regional authorities within Dublin - could do more to ensure we continue to remain as good as we can be in driving what is, whether one likes it or not, the energy hub of the country.  Dublin is the powerhouse that drives the economy and it and the regions around it will remain its main driver.  Are there areas our four local authorities could improve?</p> <p>  Mention was made of the challenge to achieve a regional balance and of the regional plans in place to create pathways for foreign direct investment to get to other areas.  This is a great idea and I hope it works as well as hoped.  Now we need that balance, is it possible that the situation may arise whereby IDA Ireland will tell a company that we have reached our target for Dublin for a particular year, but it can offer the foreign company region X?  Has that ever happened or will it ever happen?  I am obviously concerned about the interests of the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

Dublin is the only international city of scale we have.  It has proven very attractive to international investors and we continue to win investment.  It is not an either-or situation.  Many of the companies that select Dublin will never move to a regional location.  No matter what we offer them or how we present our offer, they will come to Dublin only.  Dublin is attractive, vibrant and cosmopolitan and has been able to attract in much of the talent available.  This brings me back to the comment I made earlier about the availability of talent.  The fact companies can get multilingual, technology-savvy people in Dublin is much of the reason for this, because much of the business is technology based.  Manufacturing remains important, but it is more likely to be regionally based and even if it is based in Dublin, it is on the outskirts or in Meath or Kildare, not the city centre.</p> <p>  The flow of investment into Dublin this year continues to be extremely strong and just as we have developed an action plan, with other stakeholders, for the regions, we are developing one for Dublin.  We are in the process, with the local authorities, our sister agencies and other stakeholders, of developing a plan from the point of view of enterprise and jobs for Dublin.  Deputy Lyons is right that Dublin remains the engine of growth and will remain so for some time.  One of the issues facing us in Dublin is the pressure on commercial property availability.  That said, in the central business district, the area between the two canals and the Barrow Street area, we have 1.82 million sq. ft. of grade A office buildings due to come on stream in the next 18 to 24 months.  This will alleviate much of the pressure.  We welcome the announcement by NAMA that it will invest in residential property because we see that lack as a potential constraint.  The presence of a number of universities and institutes of technology in the Dublin region make Dublin very attractive in terms of talent availability, but also in terms of research an development.  We continue to market Ireland as a research and development location and work closely with Science Foundation Ireland on that.</p> <p>  My assessment is that Dublin is very attractive as an international location.  It is particularly attractive as an international location for technology and that reputation has travelled far and wide, given the global brand names we have based here.</p></speech>

These are areas such as the Internet of things, big data, cloud, social, mobile and security.</p><p>IDA Ireland's perspective is to identify and connect with what these new opportunities might look like and target companies that will use these technologies in the future.  That is where Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland come in and we work together to develop technology centres.  We have some really good centres in a number of areas - insight is important in data analytics - which because they are developing talent and, in some instances, also IP, they can act as anchors to attract particular companies with needs in these areas.  Part of our remit is to follow the technological development and ensure true dialogue with Science Foundation Ireland and our sister agency Enterprise Ireland with which we work on technology to ensure we keep pace with what is happening in the various sectors.  Apart from the two mentioned, new areas in manufacturing include additive manufacturing and industry 4.0 - the Internet of things.  These will have a significant impact.  We must try to keep pace and develop solutions in Ireland as anchors to attract companies.</p></speech>

However, when one looks through the list, it is apparent to me as a person from the midlands that there is not much activity in Laois-Offaly or Tipperary or Longford.  I do not think, however, that it can be said of Westmeath.  Public representatives in the midlands region are most anxious to find out what can be done, or if there is something wrong, as these areas are not getting the attention they wish to receive from IDA Ireland and IDA Ireland companies.</p></speech>

The Chairman is correct in pointing out that Athlone has been particularly successful to date, but there have been other investments outside it.  In the first half of the year Nexvet Biopharma moved into Tullamore and there have been some very strong existing clients such as Medtronic Covidien and so on.</p> <p>  The number of site visits to the counties mentioned by the Chairman has increased to date as a result of IDA Ireland's focus on the regions.  I understand that if one is in Laois or Offaly, progress in Westmeath may not be relevant, but progress in Westmeath and Athlone means that a cluster is being built and that we can use it as a reference point to sell, which is important.  As an agency, IDA Ireland's single biggest tool is being able to point to existing investment, people who have already made investments and are operating successfully and building out.  I assure the Chairman that IDA Ireland will focus on Laois-Offaly, as we do on other counties.  We are at the start of a five year strategy and this is the first time IDA Ireland has set regional targets.  I have outlined the list of activities undertaken to underpin the regional strategy and as they take effect, I am sure we will see success in the counties mentioned.</p></speech>

It offers opportunities to create critical mass outside Dublin.  </p> <p>  On the comments made about Meath and the levels of IDA Ireland jobs, I know that all of the Deputies are obviously engaged and fired up about the issue and I do not wish to have the poor mouth too much, but Kildare has about seven times more IDA Ireland jobs than Meath, Wicklow has three times more and Louth about four times.  These are the actual figures extrapolated from IDA Ireland's data.  IDA Ireland will typically state - there is some logic to it - that a job in Maynooth is available to people from Meath and that a job in Mullingar is available to people from Tullamore, etc. but counties like Meath-----</p></speech>

It is important for the health of the county, economic and socially, to have this type of enterprise developed locally.  Will Mr. Shanahan clarify what spatial guide IDA Ireland uses for location choices for these companies?  Rather than blame IDA Ireland, what can counties such as Meath proactively do to attract these companies?  Mr. Shanahan made reference to IDA Ireland looking for a land bank in the mid-eastern area.  Is there something Meath proactively could do to change these stats to being more favourable?</p></speech>

He has said there are "IDA Ireland jobs" in particular counties.  They are company jobs.  The ultimate arbiter on where jobs are to be located is where companies want to locate.  That is the bare fact.  IDA Ireland's job is to make Ireland as attractive as possible and then try to ensure all regions can compete.  That is the purpose of the Action Plan for Jobs at regional level; to to try to outline what else can be done to make regions attractive.  An action plan for the mid-east is in development and Meath should engage fully in that process and outline what it has to offer and see what else could be done or targeted for the region to make it attractive.</p> <p>  Travel to work times or to work zones does come into it.  On the one hand, a company could locate in Meath as it could in Dublin because the workforce would be commuting to and from Dublin.  However, companies see that if they locate in Dublin, they will have a huge array of amenities and a vast workforce from which to draw.  Why would it not do this in the first instance?  It is often the case.  IDA Ireland will revisit all options regarding decisions on securing strategic sites.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Shanahan explain what IDA Ireland is doing on the potential implications of a Brexit in the context of the Dublin-Belfast corridor and how it might impact on IDA Ireland's plans? Are there contingency plans in place?  It was not mentioned once in the Border region jobs action plan, but it is, presumably, on everybody's radar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015121500002#O00900"><p>Yes, it is very much on our radar.  Regarding the Dublin-Belfast corridor, a lot of the success achieved in the north east has been in Dundalk which is well located on the corridor, with access to Belfast, Dublin and the airports.  It has an institute of technology which also makes it attractive and there are a number of large tech companies which have located there.  Brexit is, therefore, very much on IDA Ireland's radar.  The Deputy is aware  that our position is similar to that of the Government; that it would be better, for many reasons, if the United Kingdom stayed within the European Union.  It is our nearest neighbour, largest trading partner and closest political ally on any business related issue within Europe.  An ESRI study shows that if the United Kingdom was to leave the European Union, while there might be some benefits for Ireland in foreign direct investment, the impact on trade would far outweigh the benefits.  As our nearest trading partner, the impact would be judged to be about a 20% drop in trade worth &euro;3 billion.  The United Kingdom wins significant foreign direct investment, some of which is in companies which will service the UK domestic market, while some locate in the United Kingdom to service a European market.  Between now and the actual holding of a referendum, investments to service the UK domestic market will continue.</p><p>However, it might give those who are making decisions about setting up headquarter locations to potentially service Europe, the Middle East or the rest of the world from the UK some cause to think about that potential location.  For those companies and some of the existing companies in the UK, as they scenario-plan for the "what if" of a UK exit, Ireland features as the next possible location.  This does not mean we will win all that investment but it means we are in the mix.</p></speech>

It is great to have the opportunity.  I will be very parochial in terms of my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Mr. Shanahan is right when he says the decision on where a company will locate ultimately rests with the company.  However, to use a simplistic comparison, if a person were to ask an auctioneer to sell a house in the morning and realised it was not being marketed or shown to buyers but an alternative house was being shown at every opportunity, he or she would not be too long telling the auctioneer he was not doing his job well and giving the house to a competing auctioneer to sell.</p> <p>  In my constituency, there have been two IDA Ireland visits to Longford.  How can Mr. Shanahan expect anyone to locate to a place if it is not advertised and potential clients are not brought to see all it has to offer?  We can compare Longford to Westmeath, and I acknowledge that Athlone is thriving.  Yesterday, we had the announcement of 200 new jobs associated with the expansion of DPD Ireland.  This is fantastic news.  However, do we have a capacity issue?  Do we have sufficient IDA Ireland lands for future expansion of the IDA Ireland park in Athlone?</p> <p>  Seven or eight years ago IDA Ireland purchased a 68 acre site in Mullingar, which is closer to Dublin and presumably an easier sell.  It kitted out the site to the last and put in the necessary roads and infrastructure, including broadband, but the site has not been marketed.  Has IDA Ireland considered the need for a purpose-built innovation centre in the park?  If an innovation centre was in place, a person with a good idea would not have to wait for the planning and tendering processes to complete and for the development to go out to construction.  I am sure Mr. Shanahan will agree that someone who is  looking to locate will not wait for 12 or 18 months while we get our house in order to provide a facility.  Will IDA Ireland consider the park in Mullingar as an appropriate location for an innovation centre?  </p> <p>  Mr. Shanahan referred to the figure of 23% when speaking about manufacturing.  Is it that 23% of GDP is from manufacturing or that 23% of our employment is created in the manufacturing industry?  Is Mr. Shanahan concerned about the increase in labour and energy costs and development levies?  Are we retaining our competitiveness in terms of manufacturing?  My understanding is that many manufacturing jobs are leaving Ireland and relocating to countries where labour and energy costs are much lower than they are here.</p></speech>

Some come with definitive views, some less so.  We present as wide an array as possible of location options to client companies.  There are extremely aggressive targets in the new IDA Ireland strategy for all regions.  The Deputy can be assured that we are exploiting every opportunity for all counties in terms of showing client companies the opportunities available, where client companies are open to such suggestions.  In some cases, they are not open to these suggestions.</p> <p>  It is in the agency's best interest, for reasons outlined earlier, to spread investments as far and wide as possible and that is what we have committed to do over the next five years.  We have committed to grow investments in all regions by 30% to 40%.  As I stated at the outset, this will not be easy.  There are no easy answers.  We have set about a programme of work to try to increase investments in regional location.  I have already mentioned that we have strengthened the regional team and we recently appointed a new regional manager for the midlands.  This is just one step along the way.  The regional action plan for the midlands was the first to be launched and it recognises that there is a lot of work to be done in this area.  I hope that there will be an increase in the number of site visits to Longford and Westmeath by year end.  This is my expectation based on what I see coming through, but it will take time.  </p> <p>  I am happy to consider and engage with Deputy Troy, bilaterally and separately, on what he imagines an innovation centre in Mullingar might look like and what it would add.  We are happy to engage on the matter and are open to all suggestions.  </p> <p>  Manufacturing makes up 23% of GDP.  It was not a reference to employment figures.  However, that 23% and the employment associated with it is very important for the reasons I outlined at the beginning of the session.  There is very significant capital investment associated with that manufacturing and we are manufacturing.  Some of it is in tech, where there is manufacturing of hardware, but much of it is in medical devices and the pharma and biopharma industries.  It makes the jobs associated with those investments sticky.  They remain here because significant capital investment is associated with them.  They also tend to be high value jobs.  The type of manufacturing undertaken in Ireland is high value, zero defect and highly regulated manufacturing.  There is major international competition for this type of manufacturing but it is a space we can play in unlike low value added manufacturing.  </p> <p>  Labour, energy and development costs all remain a concern.  This is not to say we are uncompetitive.  We are competitive but we need to keep check on all of these issues.  Energy costs is an area where we have struggled to be competitive.  Labour costs have become competitive but we need to ensure we do not become uncompetitive.  The lower the costs and the lower the development charges, the easier it is to win investments.  This applies in all locations and not just the midlands.</p></speech>

These draft regulations relate to provisions concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each House of the Oireachtas must approve draft regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>  The draft amending regulations make changes to the exempted development provisions set out in the planning and development regulations 2001 to 2015.  These amendments relate to changes of use of particular types of premises providing accommodation and include changes that have general application, in addition to amendments specific to particular classes of persons.</p> <p>  The change of general application is the insertion of a new subclass of exempted development, class 14(g), into Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning and development regulations, which comprises the change of use of a premises from a hotel to a hostel.  Under this amendment, a premises previously operated as a hotel may be used to accommodate persons in hostel-type accommodation.  While the change of use is not confined to any particular class of persons, this amendment will be of particular benefit in clarifying the planning status of hotels that provide accommodation for homeless persons, asylum seekers and refugees.</p> <p>  This exemption does not apply to a hostel where care is provided.  In this connection, the existing regulations define &ldquo;care&rdquo; to mean personal care, including help with physical educational or social needs.  It should also be noted that, except in the specific case provided for in another proposed subclass of exempted development, the amending regulations do not provide that the change of use of a premises in the other direction, from a hostel to a hotel, shall constitute exempted development.</p> <p>  Allied to exempting the change of use of a hotel to a hostel from planning requirements, the draft regulations amend two definitions in the planning and development regulations to remove the distinction in them between a hotel and a hostel.  The amendment of one of these definitions, that relating to &ldquo;business premises&rdquo;, allows hostels to benefit from the same classes of exempted development relating to renewable energy infrastructure that is currently available to other business premises, including hotels.</p> <p>  The other main changes in the draft regulations relate to facilitating the use for refugees and asylum seekers, as defined in legislation for which the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible, of particular accommodation-type premises without recourse to the planning system.  The types of premises involved are a hotel, motel, hostel, guesthouse, holiday accommodation, convent, monastery, Defence Forces barracks or other premises or residential institution providing overnight accommodation.</p> <p>  As indicated, under the proposed changes, planning permission will not be required for the use of these types of premises to accommodate refugees and asylum seekers or as emergency reception and orientation centres for such persons.  These changes are made by inserting new subclasses 14(h) and 14(i), respectively, into Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning and development regulations 2001 to 2015.  Furthermore, a change of use of these types of premises from one of these subclasses to the other will not require planning permission.</p><p>These specific exempted development provisions will allow the Government to continue its humanitarian policy of providing protection and accommodation to those most in need under its refugee resettlement programme in association with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Irish refugee protection programme and the related establishment of emergency reception and orientation centres as part of our EU and international commitments in this regard and the provision of accommodation to those arriving into the State and seeking asylum here.</p><p> The draft amending regulations insert a further consequential sub-class into the planning regulations, that is to say class 14(j), under which a premises where the use changed under class 14(h) or (i) may be returned to its former permitted use within three years without planning permission being required.</p><p> Assuming the draft regulations are approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force as soon as they are made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I commend the draft regulations to the committee and I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have on this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has spoken about this.  It is not good for people, particularly children, or for wider society.  We have used institutions in the past in this country for different purposes and it damages people and society.  It would be better to move away from it.  I know it cannot be done with the wave of a magic wand but we should try to move people as quickly as possible out of direct provision.  I see what is being doing with the regulation.</p></speech>

Before outlining the main provisions of the Bill, I will provide some brief background and context to the proposed legislation.</p> <p>  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are not-for-profit housing organisations formed for the purpose of relieving housing need and the provision and management of housing.  AHBs consist mainly of voluntary or co-operative organisations registered under the Companies Acts, societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts and-or trusts incorporated under the Charities Acts.  At present, there are 536 approved housing bodies and the sector is largely reliant on a mix of fragmented regulation under various legal instruments, including the Companies Act, the Charities Act and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts.  The sector has grown over the past 20 years but largely in a low-risk environment where the State has provided high level capital funding at 95% or 100%.</p><p>More recently, the sector has had to rely less on such grants and more on current funding, that is to say, borrowing, to develop social housing.</p><p> Approved housing bodies, AHBs, have a key role in the delivery of social housing, as recognised and set out in Social Housing Strategy 2020.  In this context, the need for regulation becomes more pressing to underpin stability in the sector, to better protect tenants and to provide reassurance to potential investors.  At present a system of voluntary regulation is in place.  A voluntary code, Building for the Future, was published in July 2013.  In February 2014 an interim regulation committee was established as an independent committee working within the Housing Agency.  A dedicated regulation office is established in the agency as well and I understand the committee heard from representatives of the regulation office last week.  The regulation committee includes experts on housing, finance, regulation and law.  Encouragingly, the number of AHBs that have now signed up to the voluntary code - some 210 at the last count - represents approximately 82% of all housing stock held by such bodies.</p><p> All the relevant people in AHBs who sign up to the code are expected to submit a signed charter of commitments and make themselves available for interview, if necessary, and for assessment.  In July 2015, the Housing Agency published the financial standard and assessment framework, a further development of the voluntary code, as well as its first annual report.</p><p> In the programme for Government, a commitment was given to facilitate larger housing associations to access private sector funding for social housing.  More recently, Construction 2020 and Social Housing Strategy 2020, to which I referred earlier, affirmed the central role in which approved housing bodies have been placed for the provision of social housing.  The strategy includes a specific commitment to establish a statute-based regulator for the sector.  This was first signalled in the voluntary code.</p><p> The interests of the tenant are very much to the fore in the development of regulation as well.  This priority is explicit in the regulator's oversight role of the performance of AHBs in respect of landlord functions but it is also implicit in the regulator's focus on financial feasibility and the good governance of AHBs.  These functions underpin stability and security for all parties concerned.  Against this background, the Government approved the general scheme of the Bill in September.  The purpose of the proposed legislation is to: safeguard public and private investment in AHBs and the associated assets developed; provide the necessary legal arrangements for the oversight of AHBs in respect of their governance, financial feasibility and performance as landlords; protect the interest of tenants and other stakeholders through the regulation of AHBs in their provision of housing-related services; and give assurance to investors that the AHB sector is well governed in Ireland.</p><p> I will conclude with an overview of the main provisions.  The first is the creation of an independent regulator.  The regulator will be responsible for establishing and maintaining a register of AHBs and for granting or refusing approval to applicant bodies for approved status.  The regulator will also set, monitor and assess standards.  The regulator will set and publish standards and then assess the AHBs against those standards in respect of their performance generally.</p><p> The Bill will provide for a suite of enabling powers to allow the regulator to make inquiries in respect of AHBs, carry out investigations, if necessary, issue guidance and make assessments regarding the performance of approved housing bodies.  The Bill also gives certain intervention powers that will allow the regulator to intervene in many different ways according to the risk identified.  The Bill also provides for AHBs to adhere to certain obligations under the regulatory framework, including, for example, the submission of information to the regulator and notification to the regulator of any change to articles of association or memoranda.</p><p> The Bill is complex.  It includes many provisions that will require careful legal scrutiny in the course of drafting.  As the drafting of the Bill proceeds, I expect the proposals to be refined.  The Minister will of course consider any views of the committee arising from its consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal McManus" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee.  I will go through the detail of our presentation and pick out some key points.</p> <p>  The Irish Council for Social Housing is the representative federation of housing associations or approved housing bodies.  We have almost 280 members.  Collectively, we provide over 30,000 homes for families, older people, formerly homeless people and people with disabilities.  At the peak, the sector would have taken over 3,500 people off the waiting list in 2009.  That gives some idea of the scale.  As well as providing social rented housing, a number of housing associations and approved housing bodies undertake a wide range of additional services, such as community-based education and social and health-related supports.  Housing associations include a large number of organisations which provide housing and related supports.  They were established as approved housing bodies by local communities.  Often they cater primarily for specialist groups such as older people, the homeless and people with disabilities.  A small number of larger associations provide housing over a number of locations and manage a significant number of homes.</p> <p>  Housing associations have delivered through new-build provision, acquisitions, Part V delivery and regeneration projects with local authorities.  More recent initiatives include various forms of leasing with the private sector and, importantly, non-Exchequer finance, which has played a major part in recent years.</p> <p>  I will outline the structure of our associations.  The majority of housing associations are incorporated as companies limited by guarantee.  They are governed by a board of directors.  Where housing associations have sufficient scale they employ specialist staff to undertake the operations.  A large number of smaller locally based approved housing bodies have no staff and their work is undertaken on a voluntary basis at no cost to the State.  Overall, housing associations are motivated to provide good-quality, well-managed housing at affordable rent levels.  A small number of housing associations are also currently examining additional types of housing, such as cost rental and affordable rental as part of mixed tenure developments.  Currently, due to the range of activities that approved housing bodies undertake, the bodies often have to comply with a range of regulatory requirements from a number of different bodies.  These include provision of audited accounts and returns to the Companies Registration Office, returns to the Revenue Commissioners and the HSE, where required, as well as compliance with terms and conditions of the capital funding scheme with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.</p> <p>  Following recent changes, approved housing bodies will have to comply with the requirements of the Charities Act and the newly amended Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act, under which housing associations have to register their tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  At present no single body has full oversight of the sector.</p> <p>  The introduction of a regulator for approved housing bodies will provide an important level of assurance and confidence for the various stakeholders the sector engages with, such as private financial bodies, elected members, local authorities, tenants and the general public.  The legislation is focused on the organisational regulation aspects of approved housing bodies rather than the landlord-tenant relationship, which will come under the Residential Tenancies Act and which approved bodies now have to comply with from 2016.  Committee members can appreciate the range of increased existing regulatory requirements that the sector has to comply with.</p> <p>  It is important for a new statutory regulator to be fully aware of the regulatory requirements from other regulators which have role in the sector.  In this context we believe there is a need for a memorandum of understanding to ensure the housing regulator is fully cognisant of the requirements of other regulators.  This should be provided for in the Bill.  We believe the regulator should be independent to ensure credibility and that the regulator is not captured by any specific public or private interests.  It should be set up in the public interest, while also having a key enabling role to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.  The regulator should set standards on finance, tenant services and housing management.  It should also set standards on governance and provide oversight with a plan of engagement and intervention where required.  The regulator should not undertake a role that could be viewed as that of a shadow director nor should it micro-manage the business activities of approved housing bodies.  In part, we envisage the regulator having to provide consent to an approved housing body for disposal of an asset to the value of &euro;10,000 as overly punitive unless this measure was focused purely on physical assets such as stock.  This could require, for example, the sale of a maintenance van or photocopier from the regulator.</p> <p>  I will summarise some of the points in response to questions posed by the committee.  We will make a full submission on the heads of the Bill.</p><p>We welcome the introduction of statutory regulation as an able and supportive role for the sector but believe that, as the heads are currently worded, the spirit is not fully captured as yet.  Our key objective is that assurances be provided to tenants and there is detail to be worked out on that.</p><p> The principle of proportionality needs to be maintained to ensure that smaller local and voluntary housing bodies are supported rather than undermined during this transition to statutory regulation.  The heads of the Bill introduces seven offences for non-compliance which is harsh for many small housing bodies and this needs to be handled proportionally to be flexible in this transition.  </p><p> There is a need to ensure greater clarity over how the extensive powers of the regulatory body will work; under head 11 on consent of a disposal, head 12 on appointing board members and head 16 on investigative powers.  These are extensive powers and, unless dealt with carefully, may be seen as intrusive by some bodies.  The proposed co-ordination across agencies is needed and this is why the regulator will drive co-operation in interacting with the PRTB and the charities regulator.</p><p> The Irish Council for Social Housing welcomes the continued engagement as a representative body in the development of this legislation and its future implementation.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Co-operative Housing Ireland was formed as NABCO in 1973 to represent, promote and develop the co-operative housing movement in Ireland.  We work with local housing co-operatives to help households meet their own housing needs in any tenure and we have supported 3,500 families into home ownership through local building co-operatives.  The society is also an AHB in its own right and today manages more than 1,800 social rented homes through a network of affiliated local co-operatives across Ireland.  The organisation is fully committed to playing its part in delivering the objectives of the social housing strategy and we have plans to deliver a further 1,500 homes by 2020.</p> <p>  Co-operative social rented housing is distinctive because tenants are also share holding, owner members of their local society.  Members elect the management committees of their local societies and select representatives to the national board of the organisation.  Co-operative Housing Ireland has a board with majority tenant representation, supplemented by external expertise in governance and housing.  Housing co-operatives are typically formed as industrial and provident societies and registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  They apply for AHB and charitable status in the same way as other housing bodies.</p> <p>  Co-operative Housing Ireland signed up to voluntary regulation on publication of the voluntary regulatory code in autumn 2013.  The society has participated in two years of regulatory assessment.  In addition, the society has participated in further voluntary oversight of financial performance in 2015.  The experience of the voluntary regulation code has been a positive one.  The interim regulation office has engaged on a proportionate basis and with a view to enabling compliance with the terms of the code.  This spirit of enabling and facilitation should be brought forward into the emerging statutory framework.</p> <p>  Co-operative Housing Ireland welcomes the move to statutory regulation of the AHB sector.  While the motivation for introducing this legislation may be to protect public investment or to promote further investment by the private sector, it is the view of the co-operative housing movement that the primary aim of regulation must be to provide assurance to tenants of AHBs that their homes are secure now and into the future.  We recognise that the suite of powers developed for the regulator has been drafted with a view to the worst case scenario, requiring legal enforcement and even the transfer of an AHBs housing commitments.  Nonetheless, we remain convinced that the main approach of the regulator should be towards enabling the sector to play a fuller part in delivering social housing and in recognising the diversity of approaches that the sector can bring to bear.</p> <p>  To be effective, the regulator must be independent and must be seen to be independent.  While the context of the current legislation is to facilitate private sector investment by way of meeting the ambitions in the social housing strategy, the regulator must have an eye to long-term sustainability.  For this reason we advocate establishing the regulator on an entirely independent footing and creating a clear distinction between the regulator and the Housing Agency.  We advocate that positions on the board of the regulator be advertised publically and that provision be made for appropriate tenant representation on the board.</p> <p>  The enabling approach which we recommend for the regulator will be critical in the period during which the Act comes into force and in the early period of its operation.  We suggest a process whereby AHBs who do not hold stock, or do not intend to develop stock, can notify the regulator before they find themselves subject to the full set of statutory requirements.  It is also key, especially for smaller and voluntary AHBs,  that the regulator is given sufficient flexibility to engage informally around compliance before the statutory powers are invoked.</p> <p>  We welcome the clear recognition of the role of industrial and provident societies in providing housing and that the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies is mentioned throughout.  We ask that the Bill would also mention, under heading 11(3)(a), the term "rules" which are the co-operative equivalent of the constitution or memorandum of association.</p> <p>  The explanatory notes to the Bill suggest that AHBs are not expected to contribute to the running costs of the regulator.  We would suggest this provision is removed from the Bill so any future change of policy in this area would require new legislation.  The proposal in the Bill that AHBs would contribute to a fund to be used in the event of a future AHB asset transfer should also require further legislation.  AHBs already pay local property tax for their stock and pay contributions to the PRTB.  Further requirements to fund the operation of the regulator would add another unwarranted financial burden that would hamper the ability of AHBs to meet pressing housing needs.  Heads 13 and 17 relate to the issuing of further standards and guidance.  Due consideration should be given to the proportionate impact these further standards would have on the sector.  We recommend that a regulatory impact analysis be carried out on these standards and that consultation with the sector is a requirement.</p> <p>  In our response to the committee&rsquo;s questions we raised concerns about the proposed restrictions on the disposal of assets.  The suggested limitations do not appear to be proportionate or appropriate and we question whether they will assist in promoting confidence in the sector among private lending institutions.  We are also concerned about the proposed process for the transfer of housing between AHBs.  The acceptance of new housing by the recipient AHB does not necessarily mean that it gains an asset; there are potential liabilities attached to any properties.  Due consideration should be given to the supports that may be required, including the provision of State funding, other than the lending from AHB funds described in the Bill.</p> <p>  We thank the committee for its engagement around this vital issue.  Co-operative Housing Ireland will make a full submission on the Bill by 21 December 2015 and we have already submitted answers to the detailed questions posed by the committee.</p></speech>

I will adhere to the order in which the contributions were made.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee today.  The committee is looking at every available option for scaling up and having a more diverse housing stock.  The approved housing bodies are very much part of that process.  As it is a precursor to this legislation, I am curious to hear if the voluntary code worked and if there were parts of it that did not work which we are in danger of repeating.</p> <p>  With regard to scaling up, will the proposals assist in this? When the Housing Agency appeared before the committee on a previous occasion it told us there was a lot of money available that could have been accessed, for example from the European Investment Bank or pension funds.  However, the housing associations tell us how difficult it is to access those funds.  It is useful for the committee to understand that and what might be done about it.</p><p>We are talking about some level of co-responsibility or co-guarantee with the approved housing bodies.  Do the witnesses have any assessment of what might be possible in the next ten years in terms of scaling up the sector?  How does what is proposed impact on that?  Is it positive or negative?  Is there something that should be included which has not been?</p><p> A thread seems to run through the general scheme, which is that there is a great deal of additional obligation being put in place.  Are these additional obligations balanced?  I heard somebody say the regulator should have an enabling role rather than one that is to oversee good governance, and that it is a question of trying to find a balance between both.  I am curious to hear what can be done and what it would look like if it were an enabling role.  The regulatory impact analysis is a good idea in general because it is quite difficult to visualise the change in an academic sense.  This would be quite useful.  In terms of co-operative housing and the 3,500, what is the breakdown in terms of tenure?  Have there been different experiences with stock that is tenanted as opposed to purchased?</p><p> We have quite a fragmented approach to much of how we do things.  In many ways, it has not worked to our advantage.  Why is it so important to have the role of the regulator being independent of the Housing Agency?  The witnesses might just articulate that for us.  Someone said the regulator will not govern the landlord-tenant relationship.  Should it?  While there is other legislation and an independent regulator, it is one thing to manage the physical stock.  There is a significant role of tenant management, if one likes.  How might that work where there is a mixed scheme?  Is it seen as something that could be incorporated here?</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy has asked most of the questions I wanted asked but I have a couple more.  I get the impression from their contributions that, broadly speaking, the witnesses are in favour of the Bill.  Do they see it primarily as improving how approved housing bodies work?  Do they see it having any role in improving the delivery of housing, which is a vital and important issue?  I would be very interested in the responses of witnesses to the issue Deputy Murphy raised about the Housing Finance Agency and the capacity to access that funding.  While this is not directly to do with the Bill, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, mentioned that there were 536 housing bodies.  How many are active and likely to deliver housing?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damian Allen" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#F00400"><p>I will deal with some of Deputy Murphy's questions first.  In terms of how the voluntary code has worked, the evidence is that it has worked very well.  It has been a positive experience for the bodies that have engaged with the interim regulation office.  The principles of enabling and learning that have been inherent in the application of the voluntary code are something we want to ensure are maintained through to the Statute Book.  That is something we have been keen to observe and maintain.  For example, in the publication of the financial standard by the regulation office during the summer this year, it can be seen how it has been made proportionate.  For example, if it applies to one of the larger approved housing bodies, there will be quite an onerous requirement on it to provide information.  However, in so far as it applies to the smaller, so-called tier 1 approved housing bodies, the same level of long-term business planning and strategic plans do not need to be provided.  Instead, they need to provide detailed income and expenditure accounts.  As such, the application of the code has been tailored.  It has worked very well and it is something we would like to ensure is maintained as the legislation develops.</p> <p>  I was asked if the Bill will assist in upscaling.  I think it will because the presence of regulation has been shown in other jurisdictions to be an important consideration for lenders in order that there is some structure to underpin the overall sector.  From that point of view, it should help.  However, it is but one of a number of measures required for upscaling to take place.  The Department works very closely with the sector in the context of the social housing strategy and the working groups there to look at what those various levers might be.  Regulation is one, obviously, but the funding schemes and the mechanics behind them on the release of funding and at what stage in a project and how quickly it happens are all important considerations.  While it will help, it is just one of a number of levers that need to be in place for upscaling to occur.</p> <p>  I was asked if the obligations are balanced.  I think they are.  I acknowledge that crafting the legislation is a balancing act in terms of providing sufficient powers for the regulator to function when it needs to while not wanting to interfere with the boardroom decisions of approved housing bodies, AHBs, on their own investment decisions and so on.  This is a balancing act and something of which we are very conscious.  We are trying to ensure a balance is present in the general scheme.</p> <p>  I was asked whether the landlord-tenant relationship could be integrated.  Only two weeks ago, we enacted the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 which extended the Residential Tenancies Act to AHB tenants and landlords.  That has worked to some extent to remove one of the areas of fragmentation that existed.  At least now tenants in the private rented and AHB sectors have a common place to go.  However, we still do not have a one-stop shop for all tenancies and providers of housing.  What we propose in the context of the Bill is a very specialised outfit.  There is merit in the short term at least in focusing on that and getting the regulation right before looking at a catch-all structure to encompass all tenancies and providers.</p><p> In terms of the number of bodies that are active, Deputy Dowds is correct that there is a large number of approved bodies at 526.  There is a huge disparity, as the Deputy probably knows.  Many of those bodies are very small local community projects which are providing one to four houses in their community.  At the other end of the scale there are quite large bodies that are providing hundreds and even thousands of homes for people.  It is quite a disparate sector.  A total of 210 bodies have registered or signed up to voluntary regulation.  One could say that is an indication, perhaps, of the ones that are most active and developing.  However, looking at the regulation office's report, I believe the regulation office plans to undertake a review of all the approved bodies, and the Department will work with it on that, in terms of trying to get a better handle on the balance of 300 or so as to where they are, what they are doing, whether they are still in the business of providing housing, whether they are still in the business of wanting to develop that or whether they are happy with the service they currently provide, which might be just to maintain their service for the small number of properties they have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal McManus" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#G00200"><p>To follow up on what Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Dowds mentioned about the scaling up aspect of the sector and how this regulation can deliver, it was mentioned earlier on the voluntary code that there are probably four dimensions to assisting the sector in scaling up.  One is certainly regulation and the others were new financial models which have emerged, building capacity and predictable funding streams.  Bringing those together will provide the platform for upscaling.</p> <p>  In terms of what the sector can offer, a couple of years ago we conducted a survey of the larger bodies and their ambition was to deliver 5,000 homes over three years.  That is with private finance.  The context should be borne in mind.  Many other countries brought in private finance 30 years ago, and it took almost 30 years for that to be a major issue for delivering social housing.  We are doing it in five years.  We are trying to introduce regulation and to have funding for private finance at the same time, so a few things must come together.  It is those four elements, including policy co-ordination, financial models and building capacity.  Building capacity is related to the land supply.  Land supply is another element the sector needs in terms of delivery.</p> <p>  There is ambition in the sector, especially for the larger bodies that want to supply more housing.  They have targets for what they wish to deliver.  We believe the sector has much more to provide over the next five and ten years.  Private finance does not just manifest itself in housing over a couple of years.  If we are looking at ten years as a life cycle, we believe the sector will move from being very much dependent on the public sector for 100% finance into private finance, but we must have the other elements in place as well.</p> <p>  With regard to the smaller, tier 1, bodies, we have been working with some of them to build up their capacity in the regulation process as well.  Bear in mind that three or four elements of regulation were introduced in the last couple of years, such as the charities regulation and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and HSE regulation.  This has come on the back of a number of issues.</p> <p>  In terms of the landlord-tenant relationship, it is probably better to separate the regulation of the organisation rather than the landlords and tenants.  Tenants and landlords have their own rights to seek remedies.  Certainly for the future we see regulation as the key element of the four elements to assist the sector and build the confidence of investors.  Over the last year we have found that the single biggest question from investors is whether the sector is regulated.  Investors such as the European Investment Bank with the Housing Finance Agency, a number of private banks and a number of bodies in the capital markets see regulation as a very useful tool to build up confidence for them.  That will certainly continue.</p> <p>  The four elements I mentioned, working together, will help to upscale the sector over the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieron Brennan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#G00300"><p>To a large extent I agree with what Dr. McManus said, but I will add some points.  First, Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about the voluntary code.  It has been largely successful.  It has governed the activities of most of the social housing stock.  However, it is very limited in its application.  It does not bestow many powers on the regulator, so this new Bill provides a deeper and more appropriate framework.  We would very much welcome that.</p> <p>  In terms of upscaling, I echo what the last two speakers have said.  A number of items are required for the social housing sector to make a leap forward.  Regulation is one.  Regulation is a requirement for any large-scale investor so they can have confidence in what is happening in the sector.  The fact that it will be on a statutory basis should increase that confidence and should bring us to a position where we can look at other forms of finance which are put forward in the social housing strategy.  Indeed, we welcome the strategy.  It speaks in three or four sections about enhancing the capacity of social housing bodies, so it sets out an aspiration that the sector will be upscaled in terms of its capacity.  Again, there are a number of issues around that.  There is funding, which we have already mentioned, and regulation.  There is also access to sites as non-State agencies.  That must be put on some type of proper footing.  Without knowledge of the availability of sites on which to build it is very hard to put a programme of work in place within a very short time frame, which is what we confront at present.</p> <p>  The other issue is co-ordination from the State side.  We welcome the fact that the Department is reviewing its funding provisions for social housing, and they are improving.  However, there is also the issue of co-ordination among State agencies.  The average AHB must deal with quite a few.  It must deal with the local authority under a number of headings, including planning as it is the housing authority and the allocator and nominator, the Housing Finance Agency, the Department, the Housing Agency and others, and it must deal with them repeatedly.  A degree of co-ordination on the State side, with perhaps one agency taking the lead role in that regard, could take huge amounts of time out of the period necessary to produce housing, and we are anxious to produce as much as we can as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy also asked about the different tenures within co-operative housing.  There are two main aspects to it, although we believe co-operative housing is for everybody regardless of their socioeconomic status.  As a rule, Co-operative Housing Ireland manages social rented units, but in the past, and up to this day, we have assisted many people into co-operative ownership.  Typically, what happens is that a group of people comes together and acquires a site, perhaps from the local council through the low cost sites scheme.  Through their co-operative efforts they collectively produce housing at a lower cost and at less risk for themselves.  Once complete, that housing would go into private ownership.  Our organisation has assisted over 3,500 people to do that.  We still do it, and we wish to continue doing it.  Again, however, we believe it is something which must be enhanced and enabled with further assistance brought to it.</p> <p>  Deputy Dowds asked about the enabling aspect of the proposed regulatory arrangements before us.  It is good that we are involved at an early stage on this.  On the one hand one can fully understand why a new regulator would wish to set out its stall and gain what it would consider to be the appropriate powers.  We wish to have appropriate, strong and independent regulation, but there must be some balance where the regulator has an enabling role.  It is not just about protecting the asset and promoting security around tenure, it is also about the matters we have just been discussing.  In other words, the regulator also has a role in enabling the entire social housing sector, not just by providing confidence but also by promoting standards and helping us all move to a place where we can aspire to do much more than we do today.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy asked why it was important to separate the regulator from the Housing Agency.  As Kieron Brennan mentioned, there is a need for a single, stronger point of contact for us to work with and we would see the Housing Agency playing that role.</p><p>However, if one is holding oneself out as the regulator and the arbiter of good governance, it then is vitally important one's own governance is whiter than white.  Consequently, if one has a regulator that sits within a Government body which is tasked with promoting delivery and securing highly challenging targets and objectives, it naturally follows there should be a split between the organisation that is trying to push delivery and the organisation that is trying to protect the interests of tenants and public investment.  This is why we argue for that split between those two roles.</p></speech>

Mr. Brennan mentioned one matter that obviously is highly important.  To what extent can the bodies obtain access to land by contacting county councils or must they deal with private developers because in some cases, councils will have land?  Does this depend on the bodies themselves or are there leads out to them from councils asking them to show an active interest?  Second, I refer to the issue raised by both Deputy Catherine Murphy and me on the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, and access to its funding.  Although it may not be directly connected with this legislation, it is a matter that arose at a recent meeting of the joint committee.  The aforementioned agency appears to have quite an amount of money that seems to be simply sitting there at present.  It would be far better if it were used for housing construction in some shape or form.</p></speech>

Deputy Dowds asked about the availability of sites or the seeking of sites for approved housing bodies, AHBs.  I believe all AHBs are in the same position, that is, there is no entitlement to sites, if I could put it that way.  As the Deputy suggested, one must go foraging among local authorities, the private sector and elsewhere.  However, we are in a crisis situation in respect of social housing and there is a degree of co-ordination being brought to bear through the governing structure for the social housing strategy.  We hope protocols will be agreed shortly with some local authorities on the allocation of resources, be they sites, completed Part V units and so on.  I suggest voluntary bodies wish to avoid a situation in which they end up competing unnecessarily for sites or properties and, for example, pushing up prices against one another.  That would be completely unwise and a bad use of our resources and those of the State.  We think it is vitally important that protocols are agreed in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1202" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#H00400"><p>It is very useful to hear some of the practical points, such as on co-ordination on the State side to enable the bodies to get on with what they are doing as opposed to spending a lot of time interacting with various State agencies, and on the availability of sites.  In respect of the latter, it appears to me as though at the least there should be a national register of what is available and what can be brought into beneficial use as quickly as possible.  Several witnesses have referred to the importance of regulation in respect of drawing upon international or institutional funds.  I note it will take some time for this legislation to be enacted as it is only in its early stages.  While I acknowledge it may not be the ideal situation for investors, is it still possible, under the voluntary code, to draw down some of the funds that might be available?  All members are acutely aware of the country's level of indebtedness, the general Government deficit and the debt profile, which mean there is a limited capacity for Ireland to draw down funding on its balance sheet and obviously, the bodies are seeking opportunities off-balance sheet.  It could be another year or 18 months before this legislation is enacted, as a couple of processes must be gone through before that stage is reached.  Has operating under the voluntary code been an impediment, given that the witnesses are telling members it is?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-15a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal McManus" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015121500002#H00500"><p>I will respond to a couple of the issues.  In respect of the Housing Finance Agency, quite a lot of finance is coming into this sector at present because investors know they can get a reasonable return from the payment and availability, P and A, agreement.  Government gilts are at a low level and the return is much higher in the sector.  Consequently, there has not been much of an issue in respect of the scale of finance coming into the sector as such, it is just a process of translating that loan finance into schemes on the ground.  While we have finance on one side, what we do not have at present is product.  Over the past four or five years, the sector used acquisitions in the private market, that is, it bought properties and used the Housing Finance Agency and other finance bodies to acquire those properties.  However, that product no longer is available to the same extent as it was.  This is why, as has been mentioned, the whole emphasis now is on new build in order to get sites assembled.  We have called for a land assembly programme.  Sites have been identified by the Housing Agency and others and this should be translated into a land assembly programme.  For a number of years, we had a very good low-cost site scheme operated by the local authorities.  That worked very successfully as housing associations accessed that scheme and translated it into new build.  In respect of community councils, that was a key tool 20 years ago, when community councils and voluntary groups donated sites to housing associations to deliver units.  However, that option is no longer there as most of those sites have been taken up.  Consequently, we have been relying on the private sector to bring forward both sites and new-build developments.  However, we still need a number of options for sites and that is why a low-cost site scheme, which was successful a number of years ago, should be reactivated.  In addition, there is land within the land aggregation scheme that could be used for the sector.  It is important to focus on the issue of land now because it takes two or three years for it to go through the system.  This is why a land assembly programme in place now would help to translate into units over the coming years.</p> <p>  As for the issue of the purpose of regulation, it is not a complete inhibitor for finance bodies that there is only a voluntary code at present because three years ago, we did not have the Housing Finance Agency and did not have the participation of the three banks.  They now are coming in because they can see a return and as long as one can repay the loans, there is a return.  Moreover, there is a structure in this context.  The payment and availability agreement is quite a useful structure even in European terms.  It is a cash flow for housing associations to repay investors over 30 years and is reasonably solid.  Consequently, I do not believe that, in itself, it is an impediment.  However, what I think will help is that as it becomes more statutory, it may help to lower the price coming in at that time.  At present, there are approximately 12 approved housing bodies that have been approved by the Housing Finance Agency and probably a further half-dozen housing associations are accessing private finance.  One thing that has not been done yet is accessing the capital markets, although there have been some discussions internally within the sector on whether it would be possible to have a special finance vehicle controlled by AHBs.  Deputy Catherine Murphy should note that idea is off-balance sheet and we are trying to progress.  However, the lack of statutory regulation has not been a full inhibitor up to now because some financial institutions realise this will happen, albeit perhaps within six months or in one year's time.  The benefit of having statutory regulation is it could bring in even more investors because they know there is intervention and engagement and consequently, it will not go awry.</p></speech>

We estimate there are approximately 3,200 units in the pipeline for delivery by 2017.  As with all development pipelines, schemes will fall in and out of that but we estimate the capacity of the sector has been growing, albeit incrementally, in recent years.  Even if one considers the level of applications to the Housing Finance Agency, I note it has increased over the past year.  I believe &euro;180 million in applications are with the HFA at present, even though only &euro;60 million has been drawn down.  This is part of stage payments and the building process and will be drawn down over time.  Moreover, up to &euro;500 million is available there and it is to be hoped the particular pipeline to which I refer, the 3,000 units, can be built.  However, the question regarding some structural barriers, such as the co-ordination of the schemes and access to sites, must be tackled now in order that from 2017 onwards, the pipeline will be built up in advance.  It has been well stated that it takes 18 months to two years for a scheme to come to fruition and those structural barriers and, in particular, access to sites in a co-ordinated and programmed way should be considered because local authorities and public bodies have sites in their ownership.  Were a programme in place in this regard, it would make a significant difference over the lifetime of the strategy because there is very little product available on the market at present from the perspective of acquisitions.</p><p>We need to construct - and to be planning for that now - in order to ensure delivery during the coming year.</p></speech>

This year there was a capital assistance scheme, CAS, call at the beginning of the year and approvals were granted at the end of July.  If there was a CAS call, they would be spread fairly well throughout the country.  However, it is difficult to plan ahead for CAS when it is based on a call.  One may have a scheme in mind for a CAS programme but one cannot submit an application until there is a call in place.  That is part of the co-ordination issue we are talking about.  We do not know from year to year when the next CAS call will be.  It is a matter of being able to bring together such systems in place so that we can predict and plan to deliver better.</p></speech>

It is evident that they want a framework that gives them safety.  In that sense, the proposed regulator's Bill and the office will enable better delivery.  Some of the members' questions were on the performance aspect and on the delivery by the sector, which is understandable in the current context, but I would refer back to the heads of the proposed Bill.  The powers being proposed for the regulatory are substantive.</p> <p>  We all would be of the view that the enabling aspect - of enabling the sector to develop and providing safety in respect of it - is important in terms of the governance of the sector and to ensure that boards and the sector deliver and that there are common criteria on performance standards.  The sector has worked with the voluntary regulator's office to have an agreed financial code.  We are now going to engage on performance standards with the voluntary regulator's office as well in order to ensure that there is common measurement of how we deliver our services.  It is reassuring for everybody that there is transparency in respect of what we are delivering and how we are delivering it.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation is quite complex.  It is alluded to even in the heads of the Bill.  There are constitutional aspects to this that are alluded to in terms of the suggested powers being given to the regulator's office of intervening over the disposal of assets.  That is not an insignificant statement and it is noted.  I am sure the principal officers and the Attorney General will have to deal with it.  It is really important.</p> <p>  Equally, it will overlap with other legislation, such as the Companies Act 2014 and, no doubt, the Finance Acts.  It is not simple legislation.  It will need careful preparation by the Department, consideration by the members and, equally, input from the Irish Council for Social Housing and the co-operative movement in terms of trying to temper this in an effective, efficient and transparent way for the delivery of housing under regulation.  It is quite a large and complex proposal and it will take some time to progress.  It is important that it is enacted.  The sector welcomes it in broad terms.  We have engaged with the voluntary regulation code to which most are signed up.  We see it as being necessary for public confidence among both citizens and legislators.  I can only wish the committee well in its endeavours over the coming months.</p></speech>
