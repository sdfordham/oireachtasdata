    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for facilitating us in taking this issue.  This was essentially an inadvertent omission from the Companies Act, which, as the committee knows, is quite a tome.  Basically, section 1120, which is being amended here, provided for the application of provisions that were set out in Part 1 of the Bill - sections 310 to 313 - that applied to private limited companies.  It transferred their application to other types of companies in Part 2 of the Act.  They were companies like designated activity companies, companies limited by guarantee and so on.  Unfortunately, in drawing up that provision, one group of companies was omitted, namely, unregistered traded companies, of which there are very few.  They do exist, most significantly, in the banking area.  One of them is Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  I wish to make it clear that what we are doing here is applying the very same rules to a credit institution that is an unregistered traded company - one formed under charter before independence - as would apply to any other credit institution.  The effect of applying section 1120 to an unregistered credit institution in Schedule 14 is to ensure that the law governing the disclosure requirements in a credit institution's financial statement is the same for all companies trading as credit institutions in Ireland.  If the section is not applied to unregistered traded companies, such companies would be placed at a significant disadvantage in respect of all other credit institutions, for example, by having to break the confidentiality of family relations of directors where loans from an unregistered company to them would have to be disclosed in the financial statements, which never was the intention.  Credit institutions, regardless of the manner in which they are formed, must adhere to company law code as defined for traded companies.  The various sections that are being provided here - sections 310 to 313 - essentially set out the requirements for disclosure of loans or other like transactions between directors of the company and the company.  They do not apply to connected persons so they do not have to return in their financial statement the detail of loans to connected persons.  However, there are a number of safeguards that apply in all these cases.  First, the aggregate information about such loans must be provided in the financial statement.  Second, a register of all of those transactions in their full detail must be kept by the bank.  It must produce this register to the Director of Corporate Enforcement if required and facilitate the director in examining and making copies of it.  It also must make the full statement available not less than 15 days before the annual general meeting for inspection by members.  </p></speech>

There is a provision that the statutory auditors of the company have a duty to examine the statement and to make a report to the members on that statement.  A final safeguard in section 313 is that these are the provisions in respect of company law but, of course, most of the oversight of credit institutions is conducted by the Central Bank.  These provisions do not in any way dilute the obligations of such credit institutions under Central Bank law, which is the primary overseer of credit institutions.</p><p>I hope that is an adequate explanation for the committee of what is being done.</p></speech>

However, the question of their not being included was raised when the Companies Bill was progressing through the Oireachtas process.  I am curious as to the reason this issue was not addressed at that time.  Are there likely to be other unregistered firms similarly omitted from this section?</p> <p>  It is a real pity that the opportunity presented by the Companies Bill 2014 was not availed of to address the threat of tactical insolvencies.  Seven months on from the Clerys dispute, the State is on the hook for &euro;2 million and workers have not yet received justice.  The Department has drawn up a report on the matter and it is now to undertake a review of this area.  I am disappointed that we are not utilising the short time remaining to us to ensure there is no legal loophole which would allow unscrupulous companies to separate assets from their legal responsibilities to workers, creditors and commission holders. </p></speech>

I do not know at what point this issue was raised specifically.  This was an inadvertent oversight in an Act that runs to 2,500 sections.  On the issue of tactical insolvencies, the Companies Act 2014 sets out, in section 599, additional protections for workers and creditors in situations of the type we have described.  We have yet to see the impact of those.  They have not yet been tested in the courts and may well be tested in the context of a debt to the State, such as that which occurred in the case referred to by the Deputy.  Notwithstanding that, we believe that the circumstances of the Clerys case does justify an examination under both company law and employment law to see if there are things we ought to be changing.  We have arranged for such a review to be conducted over the coming seven weeks.  It will be a useful addition.</p> <p>  Provision is made in the Act to improve the position of creditors in these sorts of insolvencies.  That provision is yet to be tested.  It is our view that, notwithstanding that part of the legislation, we need to look afresh at this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Darina Allen" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#G00300"><p>I wear not just the Slow Food Ireland hat but also some others, including the Taste Council of Ireland, Euro-Toques Ireland and Good Food Ireland.  I thank members for the opportunity to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, agreement poses a serious threat to the well-regulated Irish and European food industry.  One of the objectives of the TTIP negotiations is to achieve mutual recognition and harmonisation of food standards between America and Europe.  While nobody could argue against that, of course, the devil is in the detail.  The organisations I represent reject these proposals.  The following are some of the areas over which we express serious concern.</p> <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s stated TTIP negotiating position is to abandon what is termed the "precautionary principle".  This is the system whereby chemicals and pesticides used in our food system must be proven to be safe for animal and human health prior to use.  In the US, the reverse is the case.  Many carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in food production there are banned in Europe.  The proposed TTIP mutual-recognition system means we would no longer be able to ban these chemicals.</p> <p>  EU regulations currently require measures along the whole chain of production to guarantee the safety of the final product.  However, the US system mostly verifies the safety of the end product and is therefore prone to resorting to pathogen-reduction treatments.  For example, instead of preventing chickens getting infected with pathogens during all stages of rearing and slaughter, the poultry industry there resorts to dipping chickens in chlorine to eliminate bacteria at the end of the meat production chain.  Again, the harmonisation of food standards proposed in TTIP would make it impossible to maintain our standards and continue to ban the import of such foods.  With more chemical inputs and higher capital costs of production than in Europe, the US factory-food system produces food at a lower unit cost, and will therefore create unfair competition.</p> <p>  In the US, growth hormone-injected beef and dairy herds lead to lower unit prices for consumers but also to lower quality meat, and the associated human and animal health implications meaning that only those using intensive factory farming methods and liberal use of antibiotics are able to stay in business.  The objective of TTIP is to allow not only US unlabelled hormone-injected beef to be sold in Europe but also to allow the sale of unlabelled American GMO, genetically modified organism, products.</p> <p>  All existing food regulations not explicitly overturned in the TTIP, and all future higher and improved standards of food regulation will be subject to being overturned by a proposed quasi-judicial system of arbitration called ISDS, or investor-state dispute settlement.</p><p>The Commission has declared it would prefer not to have this now in TTIP and would rather replace it with the new ISDS, which it calls the investment court system or ICS.  The ICS, as envisaged by the Commission, is almost exactly the same as the old ISDS except that all the people who act as arbitrators would have to be qualified to practise as judges in the EU before they are considered qualified to act as arbitrators in the new ICS.  The latter would have an appeal system, which is a new idea.  Mr. Finnegan will explain why nothing much has changed in that regard.</p><p> The EU-US proposal for TTIP is to establish a new legal system just for foreign investors so that they can bypass the Irish, European and American judicial systems when they feel their current or future profits are being infringed upon as a result of vague, ill-defined government action, such as "unnecessarily restrictive barriers to trade" or "overly meddlesome barriers to trade".  That would include everything from what constitutes organic food standards to correct labelling and highlighting food allergy contents on labels.</p><p> So who will benefit from this agreement?  It will certainly not be consumers - who will see food information further weakened as a result of longer food supply chains - nor will it be the large majority of small-scale producers who service local markets and who make up the societal and economic fabric of quality food production, the guardians of the environment and food traditions.</p><p> It seems that TTIP will give rights to corporations to sue governments over decisions that may harm their potential profit margins.  There are already many examples of that as a result of a new law being introduced.  They will be able to do that through an ISDS, investor-state dispute settlement, mechanism, where cases are held in private.  Corporations can sue governments using the ISDS system but governments cannot sue corporations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorna Gold" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#H00300"><p>We are.  Both Tr&oacute;caire and ATTAC Ireland welcome the opportunity provided by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to represent the deep concerns that we and many other civil society organisations across the world with which we collaborate share about the potential implications of TTIP, specifically in respect of policy space for human development, the right to regulate and climate change mitigation.  While TTIP covers a vast agenda, Mr. Finnegan and I will aim to keep our remarks to three main areas, which he will outline.</p> <p>  We strongly believe that TTIP, if taken as a blueprint for international trade, is in direct contradiction with the sustainable development goal for "enhanced representation and voice of developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions".  It also contradicts the provisions in the Lisbon Treaty that require the EU to ensure its policies are coherent with its human development policy.  Our key message is that there are already existing, significant power imbalances between the capacity of states to meet their duty to protect citizens from human rights abuses by third parties and the resources of transnational corporations and the scope and impacts of their operations.  That is particularly the case in developing countries, although not exclusively so.  Those power imbalances would become even more deeply entrenched if core elements of TTIP, such as an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS - to which Ms Allen already referred - are not challenged and overcome.  State capacity and policy space to deal with urgent concerns, the most pressing of which is in respect of climate change - which will have an impact on everyone - but particularly those relating to the poorest in society, would be undermined by TTIP.  The 3.28 million EU citizens who have signed a self-organised European citizens initiative against TTIP also recognise the risks.  My colleague, Mr. Barry Finnegan from ATTAC, will now outline some of the key concerns in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Finnegan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#H00400"><p>The European Commission position is to make TTIP the gold standard for future bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral trade agreements.  That directly contradicts the stated objectives of the United Nations sustainable development goals which ensure "enhanced representation and voice of developing countries in decision-making in global international and economic and financial institutions".</p><p>It is implausible to believe this aim of the UN's sustainable development goals could be implemented when developing countries, which have had no hand, act or part in the creation of the TTIP should be expected to adhere to its so-called standards.  The European Commission stated, &ldquo;We want to create user-friendly rules that guarantee that products benefitting from TTIP really are produced in Europe or the USA&rdquo; and make sure that &ldquo;goods from other countries do not enjoy the same benefits&rdquo;.  The EU seeks to take account of development objectives in all of its policies that are likely to affect developing countries.  However, its trade and sustainable development paper on the TTIP states that it only expects countries to adhere to the International Labour Organization standards of work to which they have signed.  America has not even signed up to the basic eight principles of these standards of work.<br/><br/>The UN sustainable development goals, which replace the millennium development goals, commit world governments to &ldquo;end poverty in all its forms everywhere&rdquo; and to &ldquo;strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development&rdquo;.  It would be impossible to introduce legislation to force companies to reduce fossil fuel consumption if the TTIP is introduced.  The European Commission held online submissions about the TTIP which was the most popular consultation process held with 150,000 submissions.  Its report stated:</p><blockquote>In these submissions, the ISDS, investor-state dispute settlement, mechanism is perceived as a threat to democracy and public finance or to public policies.  It is also considered as unnecessary between the EU and the US, in view of the perceived strength of the respective judicial systems.  Such views are largely echoed by most of the trade unions, a large majority of NGOs, Government institutions and many respondents in the &lsquo;other organisations&rsquo; category, including consumer organisations.  Many among the collective submissions express specific concerns about governments being sued by corporations for high amounts of money which in their view create a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the right to regulate.  In addition, certain replies from trade unions express a generic mistrust with regard to the independence and impartiality of the arbitrators or are concerned that ISDS may create a possibility for investors to circumvent domestic courts, laws or regulations.</blockquote><p>There is a list of successful cases where governments have been forced to remove environmental regulations.  For example, TransCanada has filed a lawsuit for $15 billion under the North American Free Trade Agreement over the US Government's rejection of the company's proposed Keystone XL pipeline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Bradley" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#J00200"><p>I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the Irish Cancer Society to present our concerns, as well as those of the public health community, on the current negotiations on the TTIP.  The Irish Cancer Society is not anti-trade, anti-EU or anti-US.  We are for fewer people getting cancer and those who get cancer to have the best chance of survival after treatment.  We want to see a trade agreement which protects the right of the Government to produce and implement public health policies without the interference of multinational corporations.  We should know about such interference.  As a country which is fighting global tobacco companies in the domestic courts, we consider it important that no additional opportunity be given to such companies to block, amend and delay public policies that will reduce the cancer rate.</p><p> In July 2015, the Irish Cancer Society commissioned Dr. Joshua Curtis of the London School of Economics and Dr. John Reynolds of Maynooth university to examine the potential impact of the investor state dispute settlement or ISDS on Irish public health policy.  In their conclusion, they state that public health policies such as plain packaging could be under serious threat if an ISDS is included in the final agreement.  Ireland is well used to battling with tobacco companies in the Four Courts, however, ISDS allows these companies to bypass the domestic court system.  It is a tactic that the tobacco industry is increasingly using. </p><p> In 2012, global tobacco companies sued Australia for its introduction of plain packaging on the grounds that it infringed on intellectual property.  The domestic courts found in favour of the Australian Government because, and this is important, public health trumps the rights of the tobacco industry.  The tobacco companies lost, and lost spectacularly, and they were even forced to pay the costs to the Australian Government.  However, having lost this case, Philip Morris International &ndash; which manufactures brands such as Marlboro &ndash; used an ISDS mechanism in a little known bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong in order to sue the Australian Government.  The company even deliberately restructured its Asian business in order to justify the case.  The case took three years and cost the Australian Government an estimated AU$50 million, or &euro;30 million. </p><p> The Irish Cancer Society report on the TTIP makes a number of recommendations and is designed to offer constructive suggestions in regard to the final agreement, one of which is that ISDS be taken out of it.  Ireland is currently subject to just one minor ISDS clause within an energy charter and the fact that we are the fourth largest destination for US foreign direct investment questions the argument that this is essential to trade and development in this country. </p><p> The Irish Cancer Society commissioned research on 1,000 adults prior to Christmas and it found that fewer than one in five Irish people are aware of the TTIP while 46% agreed, in principle, with a deal that sought to boost trade but when they were informed that, under a similar trade agreement, Australia was sued by a tobacco company, 47% were concerned it could prevent Ireland from introducing its own new public health measures.  This figure rose to 70% among those who were initially aware of the TTIP.  One in three people surveyed also believe that the TTIP definitely needs to be reformed in order to limit the opportunities for multinational companies to sue the Irish Government.  Again, this rises to 55% among those who were initially aware of the TTIP. </p><p> The society has had fruitful discussions with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as well as the European Commission.  While we welcome the plans by Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m to replace ISDS, and her comments that cases such as the Australian case on plain packaging will not happen under the TTIP, the society wants to see this made explicitly clear in any final agreement.  If there is any element of the TTIP that is subject to interpretation or allows public health law to be challenged, big industry will seize upon it.</p><p> Should the investment court system go ahead, the society is asking for public health laws to be excluded from the threat of ISDS.  This idea is not without precedent.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, negotiations concluded in November 2015 includes a specific carve-out that stops the global tobacco industry from suing countries for introducing measures to curb smoking.  The significance of the inclusion of this provision in the TPP cannot be overstated and we believe that this now sets the minimum benchmark for the final TTIP agreement.  Ultimately, we believe the Irish Government should be seeking, as a minimum, a carve-out for all public health policies.  We believe this is a proactive approach that reflects our position as a global leader in public health initiatives.  To offer on a plate the opportunity to sue the Irish government for introducing policies that will save lives is very short-sighted.</p></speech>

I greatly welcome the evidence with which the delegates have provided us.  One of my greatest fears with respect to the TTIP is the complete secrecy in which the process is being carried out and the lack of debate and information among the public in that regard.  The European Commission has met about 600 lobbyist groups throughout Europe, 88% of which, I believe, have been private companies lobbying the EU.  Have any of the delegates' organisations had an opportunity to meet the Commission and discuss their fears and details in that regard?</p> <p>  There is talk about the TTIP being a major boon to Irish enterprise and jobs but the Centre for Economic Policy Research, CEPR, study indicated that ten times more benefit will go to foreign direct investment rather than small businesses and that in six of the eight areas it discussed, there would be a negative effect on small indigenous businesses.</p><p>Six of the eight areas discussed would have a negative effect on small indigenous businesses.  What is Ms Allen's business perspective on this and how the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, will affect small business?</p><p> A key issue in TTIP is non-tariff barriers, which I read as standards.  My worry is that with regards to workers' rights or environmental and health and safety standards, we will not see an upward shift towards a common denominator but we will focus on a lowest common denominator.  Will the witnesses speak to what elements of those standards converge within TTIP and what happens outside TTIP?  We heard recently that the European Commission scuppered plans for tight control over pesticides due to the fact that US officials were seeking this common denominator when it came to standards as well.</p><p> It seems this trade agreement is a radical shift in the balance between the power of states and corporations and, in addition, between people and corporations.  I say this with regard to the investor-to-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  I am very concerned in particular about developing countries locked outside the agreement that will be at a disadvantage in many ways.  Is there any way that Tr&oacute;caire, for example, can quantify the material effect on those countries of TTIP?  If I have a couple of minutes later, I might ask a supplementary question.</p></speech>

Jobs growth was one of the big arguments made for TTIP.  At this stage, the movement with concerns about TTIP has demonstrated successfully that the economic model used to calculate job growth from TTIP is based on a series of impractical assumptions.  An example is that a person who loses his or her job in the beef industry or beef farming in Ireland would at no cost and overnight move to a job at a chemical plant in Germany.  The Commission's independent research indicates a best case scenario of a twentieth of 1% rise per year in economic growth after full TTIP implementation.  That is negligible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Finnegan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#L00400"><p>It is important to realise that although we are talking about TTIP, other trade agreements that are exactly like TTIP have already been finished.  These include the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, the EU-South Korea free trade agreement and the EU-Canada free trade agreement.  These contain the investor-to-state dispute settlement and have the same threat to standards, food safety and workers' standards.  Even if we scrapped TTIP, any American company could set up an office in Singapore, Vietnam or Canada and all our fears about TTIP would become real through those agreements.</p> <p>  On 13 May, the Council of Ministers of the European Union will be asked to vote on the text of the comprehensive economic trade agreement between the EU and Canada.  The European Commission is convinced that this is what it called an exclusive competence trade deal, which means there is absolutely no need to have a vote in any of the 28 member state parliaments.  In order for the 28 Ministers dealing with trade to disagree with this, there must be unanimity among all 28 trade Ministers and it is unlikely that it will happen.  There will be a qualified majority vote on 13 May and the comprehensive economic trade agreement with the ISDS will be approved.  That will come from a representation of 16 countries and 65% of the population.  The European Parliament will then be asked to vote on the text, probably before the end of July.  This is where we must focus our concerns.</p> <p>  With regard to ISDS and small businesses, the Bavarian Spar shops have come out against TTIP.  They want to be able to sell particular brands and types of German meat products made in that part of the country.  They do not want to sell the products made in Vietnam, Mexico or America.  The German equivalent of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association has come out against it because it read the relevant documents provided by civil society.</p><p> I will give the committee an example of these investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms.  Some 95% of all the money paid out across the globe in the past 50 years as a result of these investor-state dispute settlement resolutions has gone to corporations with an annual turnover of more than $100 billion.  These corporations have a success rate of 71%.  Smaller companies - those with approximately $1 billion in annual turnover - have a success rate of only 58%.  There is absolutely no evidence provided by the European Commission or the Government to demonstrate how - given that the average cost of an ISDS is $8 million - this might help smaller producers.  If Mick and Mary's jam company tries to get the contract to provide jam to the California State Board of Education's schools and the latter decides to use an American company instead, Mick and Mary may decide to fight the decision on the basis that theirs is a small and medium-sized Irish jam producer.  In reality, however, is such a company really going to risk $8 million in legal costs to sue the American Government?  The answer is "No".</p><p> The ISDS is exclusively a mechanism for multi-billion dollar corporations.  There are many documents written by eminent legal scholars which show that the ISDS overturns all the principles of democratic accountability.  In the European Commission's very detailed proposal for the replacement of the ISDS - called the investment court system, ICS - the people who are being asked to go on a panel of arbitrators do not need to have ever practised as a judge, they just have qualified as a judge.  These are not pan-European qualifications so while a person may qualify as a judge in Slovenia, he or she may not qualify in Ireland.  The Commission proposes that these judges will be paid &euro;2,000 per month.  Does the committee know any senior legal professionals who survive on &euro;24,000 per year?  I think not.  Interestingly, if this panel of would-be judge arbitrators is called upon to arbitrate in an ICS dispute, they will be paid &euro;3,000 per day.  Again, this overturns a centuries old idea of the independence of a judiciary where it does not matter to the judge whether the plaintiff or the defendant wins the case because the members of said judiciary hold solid, secure, permanent and well-paid positions.  The ICS proposal from the Commission means that it is in the arbitrators' short-term financial interest to make cases last as long as possible and to ensure that corporations win cases so that more cases will be brought.  In addition, one week the legal teams could be working for a fracking corporation which is suing the Canadian Government for banning fracking and the next week they could be on panels as arbitrators whose job it is to decide on an American company which plans to sue France - which has already introduced a ban on fracking - as soon as the TTIP is enacted.  This arbitrator could have been a lawyer arguing for a corporation that is suing a government in respect of environmental legislation and then, three weeks later, he or she could be acting as an arbitrator in an environmental case.  The only person who is allowed to decide whether there is a conflict of interest is the person who is proposed as the president of the ICS.  That individual will be a political appointee and he or she will be appointed by the President of the European Commission.  He or she will be the only one who will decide whether there is a conflict of interest.</p><p> The other thing we are missing completely with this new generation of trade agreements is that they are not agreements, they are revolve around investment, regulation and democracy.  We have incredible examples from around the world where Veolia - which operates in the west of Ireland with private business water customers and holds a 50% share in Dublin's LUAS - successfully sued the Egyptian Government for having the temerity to introduce a minimum wage.  Egypt backed down at the last minute.  Another example is the Government of Argentina which said "We will give this privatisation a go with our water".  After two years, the water was undrinkable and unaffordable.  The Government of Argentina said the company had to fix the problems and Veolia said it was not going to fix it, that it was a private company and that the Government had no business interfering with it.  The company was kicked out of the country and Veolia successfully sued for $186 million by means of an ISDS.</p><p> We want developing countries to rise to the standards of Europe.  Europe is the beacon of light to which the world aspires.  We are the longest living, most well fed, well educated, literate people in the world, not just today but in all of human history.  We have the highest levels of workers' protection, the highest environmental standards and the best public services.  We want developing countries to rise to our standards.  If it becomes an unnecessarily restrictive or overly burdensome barrier to trade to insist on high regulations of water quality or workers' rights or the banning of particular chemicals - and we are in the business of dumbing down our regulations - how can we ever expect the developing world to have a hope of rising to our level?</p><p> All the bodies in the United Nations who have studied the ISDS phenomenon in fine detail are vociferous in saying it overturns the principle of an independent judiciary and elevates private companies to the status of sovereign states, and higher, to the point that when governments intend to introduce regulations they have to consider the profits of private companies.  We have numerous examples around the world where that has been overturned.  On looking closer there is a range of articles that need to be read in tandem with the import control system, ICS, proposals from the European Commission, while if one takes a clause here or there it appears that governments have the right to regulate.  They will have the right to regulate and then be sued and pay billions of dollars in compensation for unearned future income that a private company reckons it will not earn as a result of the regulations being put in place.</p></speech>

We have also had a meeting with the European Commission in Dublin as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, all on the back of that report.  The report is very clear on standards.  It is not a question of if standards will be lowered but by how much.  That will be the question if this agreement sees the light of day.</p> <p>  We have concerns on the public health front.  In the UK, for example, there has been a lot of chat about the National Health Service, NHS.  There is a question of how to strike the right balance between economy and society.  We want to make sure standards are brought up to our level.  On the other side of the Atlantic there are situations, particularly in the public health sector, where the standards are lower than they would be here.  That is a huge concern for us.</p> <p>  On the economic benefit, the part of the report, done for us by Drs. Reynolds and Curtis, that sticks out for me is that after ten years the conservative estimate is that gross domestic product, GDP, will grow by approximately 0.2% and that would be the equivalent of every European being able to buy an additional cup of coffee every week.  There is a cause for concern about the economic benefit for the people of Europe versus how standards may be cut ultimately. </p></speech>

I am pleased the witnesses have come in here.  The debate is very useful.  My concern is that the sounds I hear are very negative, instead of the witnesses saying let us find the best way out and temper and adjust it in order to do so.  There are so many people starving in the world, yet I hear people say "No" to genetically modified organisms and fracking, instead of saying let us find a way to make this work for the benefit of the all the people of the world.</p> <p>  Our objective, and Tr&oacute;caire&rsquo;s objective, is to end poverty.  That is everybody's objective.  Let us make sure we find a way to do that but most of what I hear is people saying stop this, control it so that it does not develop.  History has shown we can solve problems.  Mr. Finnegan, I think, said how Europe has done very well and set very high standards.  We can set those standards but we will not do so unless we open our eyes to the opportunities.  I believe the TTIP gives us a chance to do that, to expand our horizons and do a large amount in many different ways.</p> <p>  In the 1700s when the Luddites said the shoe factories were a disgrace because they would put the shoemakers out of business they won a great deal of attention.  Eventually, the shoe factories did come in and solve the problem.</p><p>Those who are saying we should put a stop to this or not proceed with it are actually like those shoemakers in the 18th century who said we should not change.  I am of the view that we should be looking in a different direction.  Mr. Bradley has certainly looked in a different direction.  There is little doubt tobacco is outrageous and whatever steps have to be taken to ensure we control tobacco, they must be taken.  However, I do not see that as part of TTIP.  We must find a solution but we have to do it by starting in a positive rather than a negative way.</p></speech>

I do not think any of us are against what we would see as progress.  I absolutely agree with the Senator's sentiment in that all of us would like to find a way.  In fact, in some ways it is rather ironic to hear me arguing against regulation when I spent a great deal of my energy in the past 20 or 25 years arguing in favour of regulation proportionate to the risk involved and to the effect that the cost of compliance would not put people out of business and so on.  I am not at all against what is supposedly the spirit of this but it is very difficult to find any of the points we have discussed in respect of which one could really argue in favour.  I do not know if I am allowed to ask Senator Quinn a question.</p></speech>

However, for us, the biggest threat associated with TTIP is in regard to how we handle climate change.  Climate change is now the single biggest threat to addressing poverty.  Ban Ki-moon came to Ireland last year and said that if we want to be a leader on hunger, we have to be a leader on climate change.  Tackling climate change entails a number of things in terms of mitigating our emissions but it can essentially be boiled down to one thing, which is that we need to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and the fossil fuel industry.  We need to drastically reduce our emissions in a very rapid way and we have signed up to doing that through the Paris agreement reached just before Christmas.</p> <p>  How TTIP interlinks with those stated objectives creates serious dilemmas in terms of policy coherence and policy objectives.  We know tackling climate change means regulating and reducing the influence of the fossil fuel industry.  However, we know also that the energy chapter in TTIP - Mr. Finnegan can speak on this in more detail - would lock in investments for increasing fossil fuel use for the next 30 years.  Therefore, there is a very deep contradiction between TTIP and our stated objectives to reduce poverty and mitigate climate change.  We also know, from Tr&oacute;caire's long experience, that ending poverty is above all about enhancing a state's capacity and democratic accountability.  If TTIP is taken as a gold standard for international trade, then, for all the reasons that have been outlined, it reduces the democratic accountability and the capacity for state action in third countries, or it will do.  If countries are locked into a system where, as a result of the ISDS - when it becomes the norm - they are not able to increase their standards or, in a sense, match European standards, how are those who are currently living in poverty meant to work their way out of it?  We see TTIP as undermining many of the international standards that are already in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Finnegan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#O00800"><p>I could not agree more with Senator Quinn.</p><p>After an incredible amount of lobbying and the threat of legal action by our then Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, in Brussels, the Commission eventually released the nine-page mandate given to it by the 28 ministers and we see that it is a very negative document.  The Commission went into the TTIP negotiations with the express intention of ending government monopolies, forcing the privatisation of public services and getting rid of what it called "non-tariff barriers".  We have a very good system to help trade and it is called democracy.  The non-tariff barriers in question are the laws and regulations that we, as a society, have put in place to protect ourselves.  My understanding of democracy is that the rules and regulations which govern the interactions between individuals and between individuals and companies reflect the values of the people.  It is quite clear, if one reads the nine-page mandate for the negotiations, that the TTIP is set against these values.  When we sound negative, it is due to the fact that the starting position is that the regulations and laws in place are bad because they interfere with private profit.  We say that those regulations are good because they defend consumer rights, defend environmental protection and allow for the operation of a competitive business environment.  Think of what happened to the poor Luddites.  They were living in little villages and making shoes in family-owned businesses, with children running around learning the skills of their fathers.  People were in charge of their own destinies, deciding when and when not to work in sustainable community-based businesses.  Then hell on earth came with gargantuan ten-storey factories in which children's' arms were chopped off, there were no safety regulations, workers who spoke out were beaten and pregnant women did heavy lifting.  Life expectancy was reduced from the late 60s down to the late 20s and mid-30s.  That is what mechanisation did.  In the 1800s in Europe, we then had the wonderful idea of the Enlightenment and evidence-based policy-making.  The democratic vote was used to protect people in their work environment.  The entire objective of TTIP is to get rid of those rules and regulations that protect both the quality of work and of consumer goods.  If we come across as negative, it is because we are against that and we are for democracy.</p></speech>

With regard to the perceived negativity coming from ourselves, which was commented upon by Mr. Finnegan and Dr. Gold, the report produced by the Irish Cancer Society is designed to be very constructive.  Not only does it recommend that the ISDS be removed from the agreement, it also says that if an ISDS or an investment court system, ICS, arises, these following principles should happen.  Ultimately, as I have already said, we are not against trade.  We understand that trade happens and we just want to protect public health.  I believe that will be very important.</p> <p>  The topic of the tobacco industry was touched upon and I very much welcome what was said.  However, tobacco sums up the issues around the ISDS, particularly for the Irish Cancer Society.  It showcases the reasons why we are arguing for a public health carve-out to protect public health policy from an ICS.  It was summed up by David Sullivan, the EU ambassador to the US, who was in Ireland before Christmas.  When asked about the potential lobbying by the tobacco industry and the potential use of the ISDS, he said that it is not going to happen under TTIP.  About five minutes later he said he was afraid that there might be some very constructive lawyers - his phrase - who may interpret or misinterpret the final agreement around TTIP.  We would also share that concern.  Ultimately we would like to see a public health carve-out and to protect public health policies from the tobacco industry also.</p></speech>

One of the key points appears to be that the standards set in Europe are also expected of the products which come from the United States.  Coming from a farming background, I acknowledge that there was always a fear that we would get hormone-treated beef.  From the evidence I have heard during this debate, it appears that the standards we have set here and those set across Europe are, unfortunately, different.  Ms Allen might know that when one goes into country markets in France and in Ireland there are two different standards.  We in Ireland have adopted standards at the higher end.</p><p>I have heard Ms Darina Allen speak before about the regulations and that sometimes we are over-regulated.  The small farmer who might butcher a few sheep has been regulated out whereas in France and in other places he would not have been as regulated.  We have to look at ourselves and within our own country as to where we set standards.  Sometimes we may set impossible standards for ourselves even though we are now in Origin Green.  We do like to trade among ourselves also.  I am confused.  Are the standards we have in Europe the standards by which trade will be done with the United States under the TTIP?  Can Ms Allen clarify to the committee if she has difficulty in getting her own produce into the United States market currently?

There were discussions going on for some five years beforehand.  I often wonder what would have been the outcome if Ireland was this negative about entering the EU and did not go in.  My father often spoke to me about the economic war and the hardship it brought upon this State.  I look on the TTIP as an opportunity but we have to be careful about it.  We have to make sure the opportunity is there.  I was in a school today in Leixlip and I saw young children working on IT projects where they produced video and games.  I was very enlightened.  Here we have a future generation and are we going to curtail them in not being able to trade with the world?  I worry that if we come out totally against TTIP that we will curtail a future generation.  I have listened to the arguments on climate change and know that we have to protect our future generations.  I have been to Africa many times and I have worked as a volunteer in various parts of the world.</p> <p>  I believe trade is a way of helping people out from the poverty of which Tr&oacute;caire talks.  I have seen it first-hand.  However, if we keep putting up stronger and stronger barriers it will create long-term poverty in certain areas and create less opportunities for those school children I saw today.  We have to look at this much more carefully and we also have to embrace the fact that we are in a global world now.  Trade is done on a global basis and I would like to see that small young farmer who can kill his few lambs in his abattoir and be allowed the opportunity in 20 years to expand globally.  I would also like to see African trade coming in here.  We have to look at this on a global scale - to embrace it but be careful about what we are embracing.</p></speech>

I wish to make it clear, and I believe I can speak for everybody, that there is no way we are against trade.  We have a wonderful record with the EU of very high standards in regulation and so on, although I might disagree with the severity of some of it.  However, what is really being proposed is that we dumb down our regulations in many different areas - not just in the area of food and labour laws - to coincide with US regulations, which in many ways are less stringent.</p><p>We argue against the dumbing down of regulations.</p><p> Ireland exports much of its beef and dairy and Europe has higher standards.  Basically, Irish producers would have to compete with US farmers and food producers who produce food of a much lower standard than ours.  It would be extraordinarily difficult for Irish agriculture to compete with the US in terms of economy of scale and price.</p><p> I am grateful for being credited with making Ballymaloe relish but I do not make it, which I think is what was referred to.  It is my sister-in-law who makes Ballymaloe relish.  We are a big family.  I can confirm that the relish is for sale in the US and that it has gone through all of the various things without difficulty.</p></speech>

In terms of small farmers, this trade deal has nothing to do with small farmers except to make their lives more difficult.  In America, some sheds house 100,000 head of cattle and the animal health and safety standards are very low when compared with those in Ireland.</p></speech>

Let us not forget that in the US just four companies control the beef market, that three control the chicken market and that a further three control the mutton and lamb market.  The objective of this trade agreement is to do the same.  Having so many small farmers is viewed as inefficient.  In order to have a capital-intensive industry, one must have a huge amount of money.  Also, when animals are housed in unhygienic conditions they must be injected with an endless amount of antibiotics and hormones which costs a great deal of money.  In addition, the end unit cost to produce a kilo of beef is much lower in America than it is here.  As far as the meat industry lobbyists and the American Government are concerned, the problem is our rules and regulations.  Of course, the latter have led to high standards.  The problem for the Americans is our high standards.  The objective of TTIP is to sweep our high standards away and create one of two things.  Either harmonisation where everybody comes down to the same level or recognition.  That viewpoint has come straight from the European Commission and the negotiators and it is the stated objective.  It is going to be one of two things, whether it is workers' rights, chemical regulation, food standards or animal husbandry standards.  There is a possible twin-track and the US will go for one or the other.  First, harmonisation would mean everybody ends up at the same level.  Second, recognition would mean that Ireland would keep its high standards and the US would retain its low standards but we would recognise both.  It would mean that the US could sell its capital-intensive, low-unit-cost and chemical-filled food products on our shelves and we could not ban such a move.</p> <p>  The US also objects to the testing of its foods.  For example, if documentation for a container ship full of wheat states that the product is regular wheat and non-GMO then our inspectors can test to see if that statement is true.  We have numerous examples of where wheat, meat products and other grains have been found to contain GMOs when, in fact, the producer had stated otherwise.  Under the new agreement we will not be allowed to test such products any more and no second test will be conducted.  The idea behind this trade agreement is to reduce the cost to industry generated by having two sets of standards.  In America, there is what is called a scientific method.  That involves a private company hiring the scientist, no peer review research, no sharing of data between scientists even those working in the same company and voluntary regulation whereby its Government does not carry out its own testing.  We in Europe are expected to trust that a huge multi-billion dollar corporation has carried out all of the tests and told the truth when there is much evidence to the contrary which proves that products that ended up in Europe were not what was stated on their labels.</p><p>It is not about everything meeting EU standards; unfortunately, it is the absolute opposite.  That is the reason there is such massive opposition from farmers' lobby groups, the Slow Food movement, Euro Toques and all those in the industry who are concerned about producing high quality food in Europe.  They are up in arms because the explicit objective is harmonisation of standards and recognition.  I will give one example that is related to standards and also employment.  </p><p> In Europe there are 1,328 chemicals that have been banned from use in cosmetics because, as far as we are concerned, using the precautionary principle of science, we reckon they cause cancer and other heinous diseases.  In America 11 chemicals are banned from use in cosmetics.  Chemical-filled hair spray, mascara, lip stick or whateverelse will be for sale on shelves here, but we will not be able to ban it.  European food and cosmetic producers will then decide not to stay in Europe with its high standards and to move their capital to the United States and manufacture their product there and where wages, pay and conditions are lower and where regulation is exercised purely by the corporation, not by the government, and sell their product into Europe.  Therefore, we will end up with fewer manufacturing jobs in a range of areas.  The jobs will be moved to America where production will take place, more chemicals are used and from where product is sold into Europe without being regulated and tested.  </p><p> This is what has happened all over the world with similar free trade agreements, the biggest being the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, under which agriculture in America was decimated and ten of thousands of jobs were lost.  There has been a 236% increase in agricultural exports from Mexico to the United States and a huge reduction in American agricultural exports to Mexico.  Those producing food in the United State when NAFTA came into force in 1995 shut up shop and stopped producing chickens and beef and moved across the border to Mexico where wages, pay and conditions were lower and there were no government inspections.  That is what we are talking about in this instance.  </p><p> We need to recognise that those involved in the quality food industry, both in America and Europe, are speaking with one voice.  In the United States small quality food producers, the high food quality trade unions and other civil society groups gave out stink about NAFTA in 1995 and everything they had said came true.  They are still there 20 years later making exactly the same points about this trade deal.  It is important to read what civil society has to say, get our head around the arguments we are making and burrow more deeply into the details of the Commission's documents and move past the marketing bumf in press releases.</p></speech>

I fully agree.  The issue we have had - I am sure people here agree - is that we do not see this reflected in the Minister's position.  We would like to hear him talk not only about the opportunities the TTIP agreement offers but also the potential issues and problems.  He is a signatory to the letter calling for Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m, the incoming Trade Commissioner, to introduce the ISDS within the TTIP agreement.  Forgetting about the issues related to public health and agriculture, I would like to see the Minister acknowledge the issues about which we are talking because his speech last Thursday in the D&aacute;il Chamber provided a very good example in that it focused purely on the economic brief.  I understand this, given that he is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, but the issues around the TTIP agreement are much greater.  Therefore, we would like to hear him acknowledge this.</p></speech>

The challenge presented by climate change trumps this discussion.</p><p>We have to recognise that, unless we have State capacity to mitigate against climate change, we will see a reduction in yields of up to 50% globally by the end of the century.  We have to recognise that fact and the capacity for State action must trump it.  There is a whole series of changes within the existing policy frameworks that need to happen urgently in order to address climate change.  This applies to Europe, the US and developing countries. </p><p> TTIP is about us trading with the US and the US trading with us.  To return to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's initial question on the impact on third countries, a full analysis on the potential direct impact in terms of trade diversion does not exist but we know that it will have a negative impact on developing countries.  There will not be a massive increase, as predicted in some reports, but there is an obligation on the EU under the Lisbon treaty to carry out a full analysis on policy coherence and on how third countries will be impacted.  This has not been done although a limited study, which looks at labour standards, has been carried out.  </p><p> Investor-state dispute settlements already exist in bilateral trade and investment agreements and given it would cover 40% of world trade, it is predicted the TTIP system will universalise this kind of trade agreement.  If this happens, it will set a precedent and there will be a serious risk, alongside the risk of climate change, to the capacity of developing countries to produce their own food.  Some 50% of food produced globally is produced by small holders, yet TTIP will place an unprecedented advantage into the hands of multinational corporations.  They already have a very strong advantage globally within the world food system and this will only serve to increase their monopoly in it.</p><p> There will be a further impact.  It will not have a direct impact on the food system but an impact on the capacity of the least developed countries to bring in other public financial flows.  Therefore, there will also be an acceptance of a TTIP-style trade liberalisation which will be seen as a condition for aid and other sources of finance and investment coming into those countries.  It will also have a spiral effect on the capacity of those third countries to set environmental and social standards.  From our perspective in Tr&oacute;caire, we see this as a serious concern and one on which we will do further work in the coming months and year.</p></speech>

One relates to Mr. Finnegan's point about cosmetics and the ban in Europe.  I do not know anything about cosmetics but I remember that 30 or 40 years ago, Europe allowed thalidomide.  One person in America, who was in charge of health, said, "No".  She was not convinced that this particular drug should be allowed.  Europe had a huge number of cases of children suffering from thalidomide for many years.  America did not have one such case because it did not allow it.  We would want to be careful not to take individual cases on that basis.  It depends on having control.  Let us encourage TTIP but on the basis that we can control, watch and influence it, which is what we are doing to a certain extent here today.</p> <p>  My other point concerns genetically modified foods.  I am again talking about the old days but way back in 1970, Norman Borlaug won the Nobel prize because he had discovered an ability to put a new strain of wheat into production and thereby saved millions of lives.  I think he was Norwegian.  This is the sort of thing we should be encouraging rather than trying to dampen it down by saying we will not have these changes.  We have great opportunity in our hands; let us ensure we use it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2016012600002#U00100"><p>The first point Senator Quinn makes is good in that the existence of two different standards and two different regulations within Europe and the United States meant that in the United States at least, there was a capture of the threat posed by thalidomide.  The problem is there no longer will be those two different standards and regulatory regimes and, therefore, there no longer will be two chances to capture the problem.  Volkswagen probably offers an example in this regard, whereby the existence of two standards meant the Americans at least found efforts by Volkswagen to hide the level of emissions from its vehicles and so on.  The issue of regulatory balance is important because there undoubtedly must be balance.  However, we have some democratic oversight of this regulatory balance at present and were we to cede that to the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism, we no longer would have direct control over it.  The other issue is we have a functioning judicial system in Europe.  We have a strong, powerful and useful system which has democratic oversight, which is very important, and is highly respected internationally.  I have had conversations with people representing the view of the American Government and they have admitted they think it is a good judicial system.  One point they will get across is that were they to give us an opt-out in Europe in this regard, how therefore would they approach an emerging country, which may not have as strong a history with regard to jurisprudence, and demand it from it and so on?  Nevertheless, our judicial infrastructure is adequate for companies and individuals to defend and represent themselves.</p> <p>  I have two further points.  First, the climate change issue is a massive change and a leaked document indicated that the European Commission had told its negotiators that if climate change issues came up for discussion which militated against the freeing up of trade, they were to put the pressure on the latter, rather than the former, issue.  I seek the witnesses' views in this regard.  Second, my understanding is this will be a living agreement and were people to sign up to an agreement at this point, such an agreement then would have the ability to evolve in the future.  The witnesses also might give their views in this regard.</p></speech>

One is that in a way, one alarming thing about this as far as democracy is concerned is that, to a great extent, all these negotiations have taken place behind closed doors.  It is extraordinarily difficult to get any information about it and we only know as much as we do because some of those involved in the negotiations leaked some documents because they were so spooked by some of the things being proposed.  This is one reason we know what we do know at this point.  In addition, in case there is any misunderstanding, it is not just in Europe that there is concern regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, in its present form.  There also is enormous concern in America and a friend of mine, Alice Waters, who runs Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, and whose name may be familiar to some members, represents, and is one of the many voices of, those people who are concerned about what Mr. Barry Finnegan referred to as high-quality food, that is, food that nourishes and is wholesome and healthy for the population.  Such people already were enormously concerned about the dumbing-down of regulations on food and food products in the United States, not to speak of TTIP.  Therefore, there are huge concerns and as many people are lobbying from the United States with concerns about TTIP, it is not just a case of Europe versus the United States.  Many people there have similar concerns.</p></speech>

If one examines the history of how the ISDS mechanism came about, it was because of a concern among investors that they would be going into countries that did not have a functioning judicial system and in which there almost would be the politicisation of the judicial system.  This is how the ISDS mechanism came about.  However, this proposal pertains to the European Union and the United States, that is, two places that have functioning, operating judicial systems and there is no problem in this regard.  The issue now is some countries are seeking actively to get rid of ISDS from existing trade agreements.  South Africa is one such country that has examined its bilateral investment treaties with Germany and other European countries and has sought actively to get rid of the ISDS clause within those agreements.</p><p>There is a realisation among countries not only in Africa but also in South America that it is not really worth putting ISDS into trade agreements and ultimately, a trade agreement can happen without ISDS in any event.  Australia has decided that in the pursuit of its trade agreements, if possible, it will not include ISDS, so it can be done.  We would argue that it can be done here as well.</p></speech>

It created a atmosphere of suspicion within civil society but also on the part of other countries who were unaware of the way the EU was planning to negotiate on the issue.  The TTIP is predicated on an economic model that relies on fossil fuels being used on current and increasing rates marginally, but then increasing rates towards the middle of the century.  We do not trade with the US in renewable energy but we do trade in oil and other fossil fuels.  It is predicated on a model of ever-increasing consumption and production, which we know must be addressed if we are going to address climate change.  Therefore, it does not factor the reality of climate change into the agreement.  There has been no open debate on how this model relates to the issue of climate change.  A very interesting study by the International Institute for Environment and Development has just come out.  It puts figures on the carbon costs of a projected TTIP.  I do not have them at the moment.  It basically says that the costs will be very high in terms of the lock in that the TTIP will ensure towards the middle of the century in terms of fossil fuels.</p> <p>  Its effect on third countries like developing countries in respect of their lack of capacity to tackle the kind of measures that need to be taken to mitigate against climate change is very serious.  If one looks at President Obama's move to stop the building of the Keystone XL pipeline as the first major infrastructure cancellation on the grounds of climate change and the fact that the US Government is now being sued for $15 billion by TransCanada for that, one can see that a small developing country that wants to take similar measures on a much smaller scale to address climate change mitigation will not have the capacity to challenge these kind of companies.  The turnover of these companies often far exceeds the entire budget of countries for a year.  There is an imbalance there which the TTIP does not take into account.  From a climate change perspective, it is a serious concern.</p></speech>

Any company that has a problem with any and all regulation will be able to sue the Government directly in this private arbitration behind closed doors where the longer the case lasts, the more it is in the interest of the so-called judges because they get paid more.</p> <p>  There is no mechanism to control the TTIP once it is established.  This is why 3.2 million people across Europe have signed a petition against it.  It is why Ms Allen, Mr. Bradley, Ms Gold and I are here.  It is why 250,000 people protested in Berlin.  There has not been a protest of that size in Germany in over a generation.  Our concerns are justified.  Even if one simply accepts the released documents of the European Commission it is clear what the objectives are.</p> <p>  I would very much like to think that our young people have a future using information technology and computers and learning how to use them.</p><p>I would love to see the continuation of a genuinely open and free market on the Internet, but that is not provided for in the TTIP agreement.  One might wonder why, when a young lad develops a new website from which he will later make money, a telephone company does not charge him &euro;50,000 per annum for allowing his website to be accessed by other computer users via its telephone line.  The reason telephone companies do not do so is that it would be illegal.  There are laws in Europe and America on Net neutrality.  There is no doubt in my mind that AT&amp;T, Horizon, Vodafone and other Internet service providers are very clear that it would be immoral for the Government to force them to treat every website in the world the same.  They want to be able to charge to have websites accessed through their telephone lines to people's computers.  Net neutrality can easily be seen as what corporate lawyers call "an unnecessarily restrictive barrier to trade" or "an unnecessarily and overly meddlesome barrier to trade", as opposed to the least meddlesome regulations.  The purpose of the TTIP agreement is to stop small companies from starting new websites and maintaining this oligopoly, controlled by a handful of huge corporations.</p><p> On the environment, the Spanish Government is very concerned about climate change.  The south of Spain has turned into a dust bowl.  Droughts are being experienced and farming has been decimated.  Olive farmers in the Alicante area and along the east coast of Spain have gone out of business.  Many of them are now planting almond trees.  In order to be seen to be doing something about climate change, the Spanish Government proposed that those who wished to engage in the production of electricity should invest in eco-energy production technology such as wind turbines and wave and solar energy units because in a few years it proposed to put a 6% tax on electricity production using oil and gas.  This practise by a government given a mandate by the people in a election in a democracy should not be allowed.  What business does it have in interfering with the business of a private business?  It is not on.  The objective of the TTIP agreement is to end the practise of governments interfering with the business of private businesses.  When the Spanish Government was threatened with being sued for thousands of millions of euro for interfering with the profits of private electricity companies, it dropped its proposal like a hot potato.  That is what we are looking at.  </p><p> This is not a case of business as usual.  I like to drink coffee every morning and eat a banana every day at 11 a.m.  I am in favour of trade, the same as the next lad, but I am also in favour of democracy.  I favour high standards and regulations, but I am also against these trade deals which I have been following since 1997.  In a submission I made in 2008 to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs I set out what would happen if the Lisbon treaty was adopted.  This it is.  At the time of the Nice and Lisbon treaties I gave talks in universities all over Ireland, but nobody listened to me.  They thought I was a bit of a geek who did not know what I was talking about.</p></speech>

This is important as it causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  Today's business is the overview of the banking sector and issues relating to the Central Bank of Ireland.  I welcome Professor Philip Lane in his new role as Governor of the Central Bank.  While this may be last committee meeting before the much anticipated election, it is important that we have the opportunity to consider developments in the banking and financial services industry as well as developments within the Central Bank itself.  The format of the meeting will be such that Professor Lane will make some opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I will focus in particular on the domestic activities of the bank.  As part of the euro system and the EU system of financial regulation, the Central Bank has heavily engaged with a wide range of European policy committees.  In recent years there have been considerable changes to the mandate and structure of the Central Bank in response to the many lessons learnt from the domestic and international crises.  With the passing of the most intensive phase of crisis management, it is now time to establish new priorities for the Central Bank.  Our recently published Strategic Plan 2016-2018 provides a detailed guide to our plans for the next three years.  Our mission statement, "safeguarding stability, protecting consumers", encapsulates the dual priorities of the bank in the period ahead.  These are to preserve financial stability and ensure that the financial sector operates in the best interests of its customers.  I will focus on the domestic side of the bank's affairs, but having said that, allow me to spend a moment discussing our role in regard to European Central Bank, ECB, monetary policy.</p> <p>  In common with similar initiatives by the other major central banks, the ECB has recently adopted a number of unconventional measures in pursuit of its inflation target.  These include the expanded asset purchase programme, which is intended to run at least until March 2017.  In implementing this programme, the Central Bank of Ireland has been actively engaged in asset purchases.  At the scale of the euro system as a whole, total purchases of euro area public debt securities were close to &euro;500 billion by the end of 2015, and that includes &euro;7.6 billion of Irish sovereign debt.  At the ECB level, I would argue that the accommodative module policy has contributed to Ireland's excellent recent performance.  The low interest rate environment has been a boon to many indebted households, while the Government has been able to issue debt at low interest rates.  </p> <p>  More generally, as indicated in its press conference last week, the assessment of the ECB Governing Council is that the module policy measures adopted since mid-2014 are working.  Noting the increase in downside risks since the beginning of 2016, the governing council will review and possibly reconsider the module policy stands in early March.  In regard to the longer-term agenda for the euro area, the crisis made clear that the original design of the euro area suffered from a lack of risk-sharing and crisis management mechanisms.  While there has been significant progress in reforming the institutional set-up of the euro area, the recent Five Presidents' report highlighted that further reforms could help to improve the resilience of monetary union.  This reform agenda should be a high priority for European policymakers.  </p> <p>  With regard to the Central Bank's domestic situation, our latest quarterly bulletin was published this morning.  It projects that the economy will continue to grow strongly this year, with GDP growth expected to moderate only slightly, to around 4.8%.  This reflects confidence arising from several positive factors, including the employment-rich nature of the recovery, a less constrained policy environment, the boost to purchasing power from lower energy prices, the ongoing easing of the balance sheet legacies of the crisis and broadly favourable conditions in the export markets.  It is the combination of these factors that has helped the current recovery.  However, while much is improved, vulnerabilities remain.  The strong growth outlook provides an opportunity to address the legacies stemming from still-high levels of public and private sector indebtedness.  Externally, the main current risk factor relates to economic and financial conditions in some emerging economies.  Closer to home, the Central Bank is also keeping a watchful eye on Brexit-related risks to the economy and the financial system.</p> <p>  Even in a period of good economic performance, the core issue remains the fact that a small, highly-globalised economy such as Ireland is inherently more volatile than larger economies.  We can grow strongly for extended periods, but we are also especially vulnerable to negative shocks.</p><p>For this reason it is essential that the bank is proactive in the deployment of macroprudential policies that can improve resilience and mitigate the pro-cyclical dynamics associated with excessive leverage.  The new rules that impose loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits on most mortgages were introduced to protect borrowers and contribute to a safer financial system.  A safer financial system will in turn contribute to a more stable economy overall in the longer term.  Therefore, the bank is firmly committed to deploying these tools on an ongoing basis with periodic reviews to ensure that the measures are appropriately calibrated.  As I mentioned last week, I expect the first review of the rules to be published by November this year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#E00300"><p>The review of the mortgage rules will be based on an analysis of the evidence provided by data on the first year of the operation of these rules while taking into account other factors that may have influenced the mortgage market during this time period.</p> <p>  The rules-based framework is intended to promote the resilience of both banks and households and should be viewed as a permanent feature of the system.  As I have previously indicated, the bank is open to tightening or loosening the calibration of these rules in response to the evidence.  Nevertheless, the value of stability in a rules-based framework means that the evidence threshold to justify adjustments to these rules is significant.  Tools such as mortgage rules and the recently introduced system of counter-cyclical capital buffers would have mitigated the costs of the boom-bust cycle in the mid-2000s.  The Irish economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks so that limits to household leverage offer protection to households and to the banking system.</p> <p>  Turning from macroeconomics to microeconomics, with regard to financial regulation supervision, the banking sector is in the middle of a multi-year transition to higher capital requirements, reduced leverage and increased liquidity on the balance sheet.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism has been in place for just over a year.  It is the first pillar of banking union, implementing a common, area-wide approach to its supervision with centralised responsibility for the supervision of approximately 130 of the largest banking groups, including the main Irish retail banks.  The second pillar, the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM, has come into effect now.  By ensuring that financial institutions can be resolved in an orderly manner, the SRM should significantly reduce the adverse impact of an institution's failure on the financial system and the taxpayer.  The third pillar of banking union is the European deposit insurance scheme.  This is still under negotiation at a European level.</p> <p>  Regarding the banks, a major topic is the treatment of mortgage arrears.  The latest data show that the number of accounts in arrears of more than 90 days was just below 66,000 at the end of September.  That is a high number, but there is progress to report.  The overall levels of arrears started to decrease three years ago, and we are now starting to see a decrease in the number of households in long-term arrears, that is arrears of more than 720 days, in the third quarter of 2015.  At the same time, the economic recovery is gaining pace, and we see an increase in the number of legal proceedings against mortgage holders.  The role of a central bank in this area is to ensure the banks adhere to the code of conduct of mortgage arrears, meet the criteria for sustainable solutions and continue to engage with their customers to find non-repossession solutions where possible.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 is important legislation in this respect as it seeks to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated transferees maintain the regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.</p> <p>  It is imperative that lenders continue to work with over-indebted house consumers to try to resolve any arrears situation and achieve sustainable solutions with co-operating borrowers.  There is no quick remedy or solution to long-term arrears in many cases, therefore careful, empathetic but realistic approaches are required.  In this context, I welcome the new co-ordinated programme of assistance for those in long-term arrears, with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, acting as a one-stop shop for borrowers in need of advice and support.</p> <p>  Another important part of the credit system are the credit unions.  New credit union regulations came into effect at the start of this year.</p><p>These regulations will enhance soundness and provide for enhanced confidence in the sector and support its role in providing important financial services to the community.  The bank will continue to work with credit unions to support appropriate restructuring measures, the embedding of the strengthened regulatory framework and will facilitate prudent and appropriate development.<br/><br/>This is a landmark year for the insurance sector, with the Solvency II framework going live.  Solvency II involves a whole-balance-sheet approach to capital calculation combined with the strong emphasis on a firm's risk management and a supervisory review process which will result in a much-transformed regulatory and supervisory framework.  This year, the supervised firms and the Central Bank supervisors will be putting this framework into operation.<br/><br/>In December, we released new regulations on SME lending.  These aim to strengthen protections for SMEs while also facilitating access to credit.  The regulations provide for greater transparency around the application process and the reasons for refusing credit applications, greater protections for guarantors and an expansion of the grounds for an internal appeal. <br/><br/>There is growing international recognition that financial regulators should be more proactive in protecting consumers, in view of the complexity, risks and costs of financial products.  It is not our role, as a central bank, to run the firms we regulate or to determine their business models or strategies, including in the setting of prices and rates charged.  Rather, our work on consumer protection is primarily focused on increasing transparency to enable people make informed decisions with full clarity about the risks, costs and long-term impact of financial products.  This year, we will further enhance our engagement with boards of the larger retail firms to push for a more consumer-focused culture within firms and will carry out on-site consumer risk assessments across a number of retail firms. <br/><br/>Firms must be able to demonstrate that their products are fit for purpose.  This means that firms must ensure that products are fully understood by customers and are suitable for their individual needs.  We therefore expect firms to conduct consumer testing on their products, including their product literature, and to simplify them where necessary; to use plain language; and to go beyond disclosure and <i>caveat emptor</i>to ensure consumers have a good general understanding of products before launch and also during the sales process.  Firms must be satisfied that products remain suitable for the target market and provide the best solution for existing as well as new customers.<br/><br/>We also plan to continue our supervisory work on particular products, including the tracker mortgage examination, and reviews of structured products and health insurance.  Another important initiative is to increase our firm-specific engagement with low-impact firms, including intermediaries and debt management firms.  We also plan further work to strengthen consumer protection code requirements, including for variable rate mortgage holders, as well as carrying out an examination of the impact on consumer outcomes of commission payments to insurance intermediaries. <br/><br/>On regulation, members will have seen a good deal of enforcement activity reported in the press in recent months.  This reflects our philosophy where high quality supervision must be underpinned by a rigorous approach to enforcement.<br/><br/>A new activity in the bank is the establishment of the central credit register.  The credit reporting obligations will apply to more than 500 lenders, including banks, credit unions, asset finance houses, local authorities and moneylenders.  It is in process this year and will be fully operational from 2017.<br/><br/>Taken together the expansion in the scope of monetary policy, the adoption of a more intrusive approach to financial regulation, the introduction of new regulatory mandates, such as Solvency II and the single resolution mechanism, the continuing expansion of the investment funds sector in Ireland and the professionalisation of corporate services within the Central Bank mean that our staff numbers are growing.  This year we expect to recruit an additional 150 staff, bringing the staff total to about 1,650.<br/><br/>I hope we will move to our new headquarters on North Wall Quay at the end of 2016.</p><p>The layout of the new building has been designed to promote a collaborative working environment, which will facilitate the teamwork that is so critical to the delivery of the bank&rsquo;s multifaceted mandate.  In parallel, we are working on the redesign of the organisational and reward models and we hope to complete them in the next few months.<br/><br/>A greater level of openness about how the bank conducts its activities can help improve the level of public trust in our organisation.  We believe that people will be more confident that we act independently and in the public interest if they have greater insights and understanding about what is going on inside the bank.  Last week, I announced plans to publish the minutes of the meetings of the Central Bank Commission.  While information on the supervision of regulated firms and some market-sensitive financial operations activities cannot be disclosed, the publication of these minutes will contribute to greater understanding of our corporate governance, internal debates and the initiatives we take to deliver on our mission.  We also put on the website last week details of our salary structures, pay scales and HR policies.  In this way we aim to enhance understanding about the Central Bank as a public organisation and prospective employer.<br/><br/>In summary, during my tenure as Governor in the coming years, my aim is to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years in recasting the Central Bank as an efficient and effective Central Bank and Financial Regulator.  The staff of the Central Bank can be proud of the new reforms, which were recently recognised by our international peers through the Central Bank of the Year award from <i>centralbanking.com</i>and the <i>Central Banking Journal</i>.  I wish to also mention a number of recent peer reviews from various external bodies.  A summary of those was put on the website last week.  By and large, the reviews recognise the Central Bank&rsquo;s consistent adherence in recent years to the highest international standards.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his new role and congratulate him on his appointment.  I will start with a domestic issue in terms of the new mortgage deposit rules and the loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits that apply to most mortgages.  I put the case to him of somebody who is currently renting - an individual or couple - who may be paying &euro;1,000, &euro;1200 or &euro;1,500 per month.  People in such circumstances would find it impossible to save the required level of deposit and they are at a very serious disadvantage compared to somebody who is able to stay at home with his or her parents, for example, or somebody whose parents are able to help him or her come up with a deposit.  Specifically on the issue of people who are paying rent, to what extent can the rules be reviewed to take account of people's track record in paying rent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#G00400"><p>What is at issue is one's track record of paying rent or good credit standards, for example, such as one's ability to repay a car loan.  It will be easier to keep track of the situation when the central credit register is up and running as it will provide a fuller picture of the credit quality, if one likes, of an individual or couple.  I imagine that banks would value that evidence in terms of the reliability of a given couple to make repayments.  Rents, such as the examples Deputy McGrath gave, are especially relevant for loan-to-income ratios in the sense that if one demonstrates that one can sustainably pay whatever rent out of a given income, that is relevant in terms of the loan-to-income ratio more than the loan-to-value ratio.  When we review the rules later in the year and issues relating to measures on what is a sustainable level of debt of a mortgage loan relative to income, we can definitely look at what Deputy McGrath said about the evidence coming from people's track record in paying rent as part of it.</p><p>It sounds sensible that a track record of paying rent would be relevant when approving a mortgage.  Having said that, taking out a loan to buy a house is fundamentally different from renting in terms of commitment, namely, there is a quite irreversible commitment to manage a loan.  The concept of having loan-to-income ratios or related ratios, such as debt-to-income and so on, is because it is fundamentally different from renting in the sense of allowing for the fact that over a 20-year or a 30-year mortgage, one has to allow considerable margin in terms of shocks to income levels and employment.</p><p> In line with elsewhere, we have been careful to allow some margin.  I agree it is a 15% margin in terms of the mortgage value.  Again, however, I imagine when banks are working out who can go over the thresholds, the track record on renting can help in that situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#H00200"><p>I welcome this response and the fact rent can be considered as part of the forthcoming review later in the year.  The Governor said it is directly relevant to the loan-to-income issue more than the loan-to-value issue.  However, in practical terms, if someone is buying a house worth &euro;300,000, he or she will have to come up with a deposit of &euro;38,000.  He or she will have to find and save that money.  The reality is that if he or she is renting and paying &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 a month, he or she will find it next to impossible.  I welcome the fact this will be considered in the review.  However, the Central Bank will need to take into account the simple fact that those renting privately are seriously disadvantaged compared to a first-time buyer who could be in a position, for example, to stay at home with his or her parents.  Such first-time buyers can save at a much more accelerated rate.</p> <p>  It is a simple practical reality that affects thousands.  People want to have hope and many aspire to owning their own home.  We are meeting them on the doorsteps and they inform us they are feeling trapped.  They can never see their way to saving that level of a deposit to buy a home.  They have to be given some hope.</p></speech>

When one thinks about what happened in the mid-2000s when credit was more readily available, we know the disaster of people taking on too much debt.  Again, the banks were offering these generous mortgages to them.  However, we have to have a system which limits that risk.  One way in which the sector will adjust is, essentially, the pricing of homes will moderate.  There is much evidence, especially from the Irish situation, that when there is not a complete but a partial adjustment and when credit is less available, part of the adjustment over time will be that the bidding war on houses will be less intense.  Accordingly, people will be able to buy houses at lower price than if credit were unregulated.</p></speech>

The reality is that there are tens of thousands of existing mortgage holders still paying between 4% and 4.5% on a standard variable rate product.  In some cases, it is closer to 5%.  We do not have an active mortgage switcher market.  Even if there were one in place, many mortgage holders are trapped because of negative equity or because their financial situation has changed and, accordingly, they would not qualify for a new mortgage.  It is fundamentally unfair that the rate reductions given to new customers are not extended to the existing customer base across the banking system.</p><p>Professor Lane is the new Governor and I hope this is an issue he will tackle.  I note his comment that he is not there to run the business of regulated entities.  However, this is a clear case of discrimination against existing customers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the offers of which new customers can avail and it is simply not fair.  I put the case to Professor Lane and challenge him on what he can do to address it.</p></speech>

When they can do it, firms like to differentiate in pricing across different groups.  I fully understand the perception that it is unfair, if one has been in that position.  At the same time, the Central Bank will hold to the position that banks have to be run on a commercial basis.  We can discuss the level of competition in the banks and whether the existing high rates are likely to persist, but the Central Bank cannot interfere in the contracts between lender and borrowers.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned switching.  I agree that there is not a lot of switching taking place.  The Central Bank's research indicates that there are more options than one might think where households could benefit from switching.  One of our goals is to make the switching process easier.  In the same way as mobile phone contracts and so on, the more one makes it easier for customers to switch phone company or bank, the less a company or bank will be able to separate existing customers and charge them a high rate.  The Central Bank can work on making the switching process easier.  However, on insisting a bank treat new and existing customers the same, that is not really within our power.</p></speech>

There is a code for those who want to switch their current account and one might save &euro;20 or &euro;30 a month as a result.  Those who are in a position to switch their mortgage should be shopping around and they could save a few hundred euro every month as a result.  The Central Bank needs to make it easier for them to do so and the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage switching would be relevant in that regard.  I repeat the point that at a time when the cost of funds for banks in Ireland has fallen to between 1% and 1.5%, it is unjustifiable that they continue to charge rates that are multiples of these figures - between 4% and 4.5%.  The perception is that they are targeting their existing variable rate customers to make up for losses they are incurring on their tracker mortgage book.  They are offering more attractive deals to new customers and there is some evidence of competition in the mortgage market for new entrants, first time buyers and so on, but if one is an existing variable rate customer, seeking to remortgage and move to another bank is not an option.  One is then trapped, despite the fact that the cost of funds for banks is a fraction of what they are charging customers.  In its role as consumer watchdog - it has a key statutory role to play in consumer protection - the Central Bank could do more on the issue.</p></speech>

We have all come across instances where they have acted aggressively and unfairly against both personal and corporate borrowers.  Some of them have sought committal orders against borrowers who are struggling with their debts and in at least one case of which I am aware they flagrantly breached the terms of a personal insolvency arrangement.  Businesses are being placed at serious risk of failure because of the activities of these funds and the way they are treating businesses.  We were snubbed by them in early December when they refused to come before us.  It seems the are are able to act and conduct themselves with impunity.</p><p>They are accountable to nobody in this jurisdiction and they make decisions to suit themselves.  They are totally unregulated here.  Will the witness comment on that?  They are only accountable to their own shareholders and investors, and they are, naturally, outside the jurisdiction.  Are additional legal measures required for homeowners and small and medium enterprises in these cases?  Will Professor Lane give us the benefit of his views on the matter?</p></speech>

I tried to point out in the opening statement that the new Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 seeks to maintain regulatory protection for borrowers whose loans are sold to these types of firms.  I agree that there was a gap in the legislation but it has been filled.  I note that various credit servicing firms are currently seeking authorisation from the bank.  That process is in train, at least for the treatment of mortgages.  These firms may well act differently from the local banks and so on and one difference is probably in terms of the level of regulation.  Taking the entire process by which they have come into the market from a global level, the fact that Irish banks and various creditors were able to transfer some of their troubled loans to global investors is a very common pattern in many crisis countries.  Essentially, the risk for a loan being repaid is transferred from the original creditors to these firms.  In many cases, the issue is politically controversial because there is less of a domestic stake than with a local bank but it is part of the crisis management process.  It is definitely part of the method by which the Irish economy has recovered; this was done by the transfer of some amount of the troubled loans to outside investors.  To the extent that we can, we will ensure these companies treat their debtors in the same kind of way as they would under domestic regulations.  The new Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 does that to an extent.</p></speech>

That sounds grand, with respect, but we know these companies bought these loans at knock-down prices and that they are screwing the people.  They have been able to carry on with impunity because we are powerless.  I accept Professor Lane's comments about a gap being filled but when will there be an effect and when will we have some control over the practices involved and the way these companies conduct their business?</p></speech>

It has been stated that the inquiry's report is critical of the institution that Professor Lane now leads.  What assurances will he give the committee and, more importantly, the Irish people that he will, as Governor of the Central Bank, intervene in instances where intervention is necessary and that the necessary resources and powers are in place to facilitate such intervention?</p></speech>

I believe it is essential that the bank is proactive.  Looking back over time, one view of what was going on in the mid-2000s is that, very rapidly,  in 2004, 2005 and 2006 there was this incredible credit boom, not just here in Ireland but internationally.  Therefore, it is not the case one can take years to decide what should be done.  One has to have the toolbox to hand and be willing to use it.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, one element is the mortgage rules.  A second element which we now have, although it did not get huge publicity, is that across Europe every country now has a system of counter-cyclical capital buffers.  This system is reviewed every quarter under European law, so it is not something we say we will do in December every year.  Every quarter we look at this and ask whether we are concerned that a credit boom is starting to happen or whether we should insist the banks raise more capital because the risks are increasing.  Around Europe most countries, including here, have it set at zero because the market for credit is not booming.  Some countries outside the eurozone are also using this method.  Therefore, we now have the toolbox in the sense that we have a process of review.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath raised the issue of the mortgage rules.  The reason I am committing to a review of the mortgage rules is that we should have a system where we take a look at them rules every year in order to avoid a situation where we simply watch a major development in the financial system and do nothing.  The challenge for me going forward is that, as the crisis recedes, one can imagine there might be forces towards complacency which take the view this will never happen again.  For the bank to have those tools, and to have a method by which we are not just talking about financial stability but also asking what we can do about it in terms of capital buffers, mortgage rules and the supervision of individual banks means I am much more confident going forward that we will be able to proactively intervene.</p> <p>  The possible cost of that, and everyone has to get used to this, is that we will get the counter-argument that there is no need to intervene because there is no current evidence that the country is melting down.  This goes back to the independence of the Central Bank.  I anticipate there will be quite a bit of chatter about why the Central Bank is intervening now - if there is no crisis, why intervene?  Of course, the issue is to pre-emptively intervene to minimise the risk of a crisis developing.</p></speech>

To take three large institutions with large loan books, what type of staff numbers are involved in supervising AIB, Bank of Ireland and Cerberus, which has &euro;20 billion of Irish loans on its books?</p></speech>

All I can say is that the way the banks under SSM, such as AIB, Bank of Ireland and so on, are regulated is called a joint-supervisory team, JST.  The joint-supervisory team has officials in Frankfurt who are working jointly with the people here in Dublin and there is a lot of traffic between Frankfurt and Dublin, in terms of both telephone calls and meetings.  The people in Frankfurt come here and <i>vice versa</i>.  I do not think there is any shortage of resources being put into supervising the largest firms.</p><p>Since Matthew Elderfield's time, supervision in the Central Bank is organised under a model called PRISM, or the Probability, Risk and Impact System, which looks at the proportion of risk.  Through another regulatory innovation across Europe, large banks such as AIB and Bank of Ireland have been named by the Central Bank of Ireland as "other significant institutions".  They are so big - though not globally significant, such as JP Morgan, for example - that they are required to hold extra capital.  We have announced extra capital ratios for those firms.

Fundamentally, on the regulation of the banking system, Deputy Doherty is right: it is about protecting depositors.  If a firm is financed by the world's financial system, it is not coming through the Irish banking system or other banking systems.  Cerebrus is not a bank, it raises its money through non-deposit forums.  There are all kinds of regulations for public financial firms but privately-held firms choose to remain outside that.</p></speech>

One proposal being put forward is that the Government would provide a grant of up to 25% of the mortgage rate to people to try to circumvent these rules.  How does the witness believe that would affect the spirit of the rules the Central Bank has introduced? For example, if somebody had to raise &euro;20,000 as a mortgage deposit, the Government would provide 25% of that figure as a grant to help them to reach the deposit minimum.</p></speech>

If a person receives a fiscal grant, the risk has essentially been absorbed by the State.  It slightly cuts across Deputy McGrath's issue about showing a track record of regular payments.  That element would have to be separately tracked.  That is more about the loan to income ratio.  In terms of the loan to value ratio, if the Government decided to offer a fiscal subsidy to a group of people, from the banking sector's point of view, the banks would be made safer by that lower reliance on debt funding, but that in turn would come at a fiscal cost to the Government.  Therefore, I think that is for the political system to debate.</p></speech>

We know from the Nyberg report, for example, that commercial property was the main reason for the collapse of the banks.  Given the fact that we have seen an increase in the supply of commercial property - over 21% in the last year - is the witness concerned, or how concerned is he, in regard to this rise?  People understand houses and mortgages, and when we talk about the banking crisis people think it was all to do with 100% mortgages and tracker rate mortgages because maybe they may not be as familiar with commercial property.  Are alarm bells starting to ring in the Central Bank in regard to commercial property in the country?</p></speech>

This shows up in two ways, one of which is how these acquisitions are being funded.  Many of them are not being funded from the Irish banking system.  Therefore, in terms of the risk associated with new lending, so far it is limited.  The secondary issue is that the recovery also affects the bank's thinking about existing loans, the history of these loans and the value of the collateral against these commercial property loans.  I am sure bank supervisors are engaging with the banks on how they should think about this.  The recovery is so visible in Ireland that this is definitely one of the big numbers at which we look.</p></speech>

However, as Professor Lane said in his opening statement, the number of mortgages heading towards the courts has increased quite substantially.  He did not raise the issue of buy-to-let mortgages and the number of those in arrears for more than 720 days.  The statistics released on 11 December 2015 indicated that there were over 6,000 buy-to-let properties subject to receivership.  I am sure the professor is aware that there is significant dissatisfaction with the actions of receivers, particularly their behaviour towards tenants in properties subject to receivership.</p> <p>  Professor Lane mentioned the role of the Central Bank in consumer protection.  Does he see any role for the bank in examining the possibility of introducing a code of conduct in the context of the actions of receivers in the case of buy-to-let properties, in particular their actions against tenants?  I know from personal experience that some tenants have found themselves outside the door with their belongings in black sacks.  There is definitely an issue with the actions of some receivers, although others have not behaved in that way.  Is there a role for the Central Bank in regulating the actions of receivers?</p></speech>

There has been a massive increase in rents in the past year and a half.  There is no question but that people who are renting are trapped and will be for the foreseeable future if the deposit rules for house loans are not amended.  Professor Lane mentioned the credit boom in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  What we have now are an 80% LTV ratio, income to loan values and deposit requirements, following a situation where we practically had loan to value ratios of 120%.  Sometimes the figure was even higher.  To some extent, are we not comparing apples and oranges, rather than apples and apples?  My concern is that the definition of what is sustainable is very narrow and does not really take into account the realities of the alternatives people face when they cannot access mortgage finance.  </p> <p>  My question relates to some of the concerns raised about the Central Bank's policy by organisations such as, for example, the Society of Chartered Surveyors.  They state the Central Bank's rules are hindering and hampering the recovery of the construction sector.</p> <p>  My next question relates to the construction sector.  There is an issue with the lack of bank financing for development.  This is part of the overall picture in terms of the failure of the construction sector to recover.</p><p>Again, does Professor Lane see any role for the Central Bank in dealing with that issue, where there is clearly a distressed construction sector - there are no two ways about it - in the same way that there are distressed borrowers and people who have been distressed in terms of their credit card debt, their car loan debt and so forth?  There is a generation of people who have been subject to distress financially.  We are depending on the construction sector to get back into business, but the lenders do not want to go there in terms of funding more than maybe 60% of the debt that is required.</p></speech>

However, going back to what I said earlier, the really big losses during the crisis were on development loans, which is such a troubled category.  The banks cannot go back to having very high ratios of debt finance because developments take so long, from purchasing a site to planning and so on to the final sale of the housing, commercial outlets or whatever is being developed.  That is an intrinsically risky prospect and my understanding is that the international norm, for example in a very developed financial system such as the US, is for maybe around 40% of the financing not to come from debt but from equity.  This is a big cultural shift for the Irish development sector, and if that sector has not been making money for a number of years, how is that equity generated?  In this situation it is important to have a better equity market so that small developers can raise equity financing, possibly through the entry of foreign investors into that market coming into Ireland with innovative schemes.  Therefore, I agree that such an equity market, for development, needs to grow.  Another way of saying this is that I would not be in favour of the banks overly relaxing their attitude to how much debt should go into a development project.  The counterpart to that is that in the same way that at the European level the capital markets union project tries to improve equity financing across Europe, I am sure much can be done here by the Government to improve that market.</p></speech>

There has been some dissatisfaction with the action of banks relating to vulnerable customers, particularly, as I am sure Professor Lane will know, the introduction by Bank of Ireland in the latter part of last year of rules that set the minimum over-the-counter withdrawal amount at &euro;700.  This discourages customers from interfacing directly with bank staff.  There is an issue here with vulnerable customers and those who do not use their Bank of Ireland 365 online or AIB interfaces when doing their banking business.  Does Professor Lane see a role here in protecting such vulnerable customers?</p></speech>

Clearly, as a society, it is important to recognise that not everyone is Internet-expert or has a big-data mobile telephone contract to make it easy to do online banking.  The question is what the relative responsibilities of the banking system are, as opposed to our responsibilities as regulator of the banks, and whether there are other possibilities in terms of social banking.  There are various options but again, it is probably safer for me to inquire whether there is any specific issue here that we can deal with.</p></speech>

On 10 January I received a communication, including a protected disclosure in respect of the Central Bank, from somebody who describes himself or herself as a whistleblower.  I am assuming it is the same communication Deputy Mary Lou McDonald received prior to Christmas because they sound pretty similar.  Obviously, the person in question is not happy with how the protected disclosure process is proceeding but it obviously relates to a serious matter.  I would like Professor Lane to tell us what is going on.  As he probably knows, this person is alleging that while conducting an internal audit within the Central Bank, they were instructed to delete parts of that audit.  The person consulted the professional body of which they are a member, which told them that under no circumstances should they ever suppress any findings in a report.  Nonetheless, those more senior to them wanted these findings suppressed and deleted from the report.  I understand that, subsequently, this person was let go from the Central Bank.  That person reports further that having been let go from the Central Bank, and he obviously sees a connection with what happened in the bank, he was warned he would find it difficult to get work elsewhere in the financial sector, having made a protected disclosure against the institution.  He obtained employment at another financial institution but, shortly after he lodged his case with the rights commissioner, he was also let go by his new employer, at which a former director of human resources in the Central Bank was employed.</p> <p>  These are pretty serious allegations.  I wonder whether Professor Lane could respond, in light of the whole question of proper oversight, internal reporting, whistleblowing and so on is of enormous importance and everything that has happened and given the failings of the Central Bank during the period of the economic madness that, frankly, crashed this economy.  In any event, it is a very serious matter.  If Professor Lane-----</p></speech>

I do not really want to talk about that individual case.  I understand there is still an ongoing case in front of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Let me provide as much reassurance as I can.  When I heard about this matter before Christmas, we did examine it.  Internal audit is a vital function.  The first point is that the Central Bank - in line with many other corporate areas that any organisation will have - is investing quite a bit to expand its internal audit team.  In this period of reform, reorganisation and improvement, we have no reason to not take on board any suggestions coming from the internal audit process.  This year, routinely, there will be 14 internal audits.  The process is there in order for the bank to learn from any shortcomings.</p> <p>  This matter relates to an internal audit on governance.</p><p>All of the issues identified in the internal audit were about how the Central Bank organises itself and whether the process of governance adheres to what it should be.  It identified several issues.  The implementation of the identified recommendations is virtually complete.  In terms of substance, the process worked, the internal audit was done and the recommendations have been taken on board.  In terms of how the internal audit was handled, of course when an allegation is made and given that it is an internal audit, this was handed over to an external firm to assess how it was handled.  That external firm concluded that the bank had a reasonable process to deal with that internal audit.  Going beyond that, the individual and the bank are engaged at the Workplace Relations Commission and I do not want to get into the individual issues.  This is not the right forum to deal in too much detail with the allegations and the risks the Deputy identified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#Q00200"><p>I will not pursue it any further except to say I have read the Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche report and it did not shed any great light on the rights and wrongs of this situation.  It does carry a lot of weight with me that a professional association would advise somebody not to suppress findings.  If Professor Lane is saying that reforms took place subsequently in the areas identified in the audit, that gives more weight to the whistleblower&rsquo;s allegations.  Maybe we can pursue that another day.  It is entirely justified to flag it.</p> <p>  I have been involved, as have many Deputies, in trying to assist people in mortgage arrears as a result of the mad lending by banks and in many cases encouraged by them, including this case, during the period of economic madness.  At the end of very protracted negotiations in the case, finally a deal was done, payments were made, arrears were written off and an arrangement was reached between the bank and the individual.  When this person, who was self-employed, with a small business, went back to the bank to get a small loan to keep the business going, the bank said the person was blacklisted for further credit because the original terms of the loan had not been fully discharged.  Is that common practice?  People who were caught up in a situation, created by the banks with reckless lending in the period of economic madness, and who have done their best to negotiate deals with them and have come to a resolution with them are blacklisted when they return to those banks.  Is this going on and if it is, should it be?  Is it allowed?  Is it fair?  Do we need action on it because it seems absolutely unacceptable? </p></speech>

In this kind of case, where a small firm looks for credit, the way a bank assesses that firm&rsquo;s prospects is one of the big challenges for the Irish banking system, for example, does it have credit assessment policies that can assess small business loans on the basis of the prospects for that firm, as opposed to asking who owns the firm and what is that individual&rsquo;s credit history.</p><p>I share the aspiration that there should be a much bigger separation between personal debt and the kind of credit available to a small firm.  In any individual case where the finances are co-mingled, I would need to know the details.  There is an ombudsman appeals process, and this is helped by the new regulations for SMEs.  I would encourage the person involved in this case to pursue the appeals process to see what can be done.</p></speech>

Having done a deal, is a bank within its rights to blacklist a customer because of a failure to discharge the conditions of an original loan, a loan which everybody knows was problematic?  This is not somebody who ran off and did not pay, this is somebody who has put in financial statements, who has made their precise economic position known to the bank, somebody who knows that in order to maintain the income and even repayments to the bank itself, certain things are needed to make the business function.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett indicated a case where a bank, perhaps in an arbitrary way, says it simply will not give a loan.  Under the spirit of the new regulations, the reasons a loan is not given have to be laid down in a structured way.  In turn, that documentation could be brought to the ombudsman or the appeals process if the customer does not accept the bank's reasoning.  A customer may feel that he or she has made a resolution of a mortgage and that it is a totally separate entity from the small business loan he or she is looking for.  With a more formalised, transparent approach, a bank's ability to rely on that kind of casual reasoning will hopefully be in the past.</p></speech>

One approach to supervising banks is to look at the individual bank, its behaviour, its data and so on.  Another approach, in the spirit of the macro-prudential view, looks at the whole system.  If one looks at the whole system, as was happening in the mid-2000s, and one sees extraordinary rates of collective credit risks, one might think: "I do not know which bank is taking more risks and which is taking less risks, but collectively this is excessive."  From the macro data, a determination is made that, collectively, there is too much lending going on and it must be insisted that banks reduce their risk-taking collectively and hold out more capital against their lending.  If that is done promptly - and the Central Bank is obliged under EU legislation to look at this every three months - the hope is that this can be a help in reducing the risk of a future crisis.</p></speech>

We have an Italian firm which runs the infrastructure for credit registers around the world and has the technology to do this.  We are currently in important consultations with the Data Protection Commissioner because there are a lot of issues to do with privacy, how to handle data and so on.  It will be a phased implementation starting with the main banks but, over time, including anyone making loans above the threshold of &euro;500.  There is a lot of engagement in the process because the banks and the other firms must have the technology systems to track these data and hand the data over.</p><p>I agree that it is a bit below the radar at the moment but I think one of the big projects for the Central Bank is to communicate about this as we go live later this year.  This is a big change to the way the financial system runs.  There is a clear reason for it; many countries have this kind of system.  For the banks, the customers and the other financial firms involved, it is a significant change to the how the system will work.</p></speech>

I am sure in terms of those involved in the supervision of firms, that is a clear risk factor that is going to be looked at.  Currently, at a European level, one of the big projects is called AnaCredit.  Its aim is to build a very detailed sectoral data set of loans across Europe.  This is led by the ECB - I believe they were at the European Parliament yesterday - as it is a big issue.  That is not going to be available for a number of years.  The principle there is that knowing more on a loan-by-loan basis about which sectors are concentrated, not just in Ireland - because there are correlations between Ireland and the property markets elsewhere - but across the European system, will help in the future.  It will help debtors who are not in high-risk sectors to be differentiated from those in high-risk sectors.  Both in terms of the bilateral relationship with banks, and also in the macro view, that is definitely a big priority area.  Another application of this is in climate change.  One can think about which types of firms are more or less exposed to weather risks and so on.</p></speech>

I want to return to the internal audit report on compliance with governance with State bodies which the Central Bank helpfully published just before Christmas, on foot of the controversy to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred.  This report made very bad reading.  Partial compliance and non-compliance was the order of the day.  I thought it was quite shocking given that this is the Central Bank and we should expect the gold standard from the body that oversees all others.  Some of the issues included a lack of risk expertise on the risk committee; not subscribing to the code of remuneration or pay; a general disregard for risk management in internal controls; an internal audit that had not been updated since 2011; not subscribing to the code for tendering or procurement; and so on.  According to its website the Central Bank has remedied some of the issues that arose.  Would the Governor accept that the report made very bad reading?</p></speech>

When we regulate firms, a lot of it is about internal culture.  I agree with the goal that the Central Bank should be held to the highest standard but how does it get to the highest standard?  The process includes this kind of internal audit which makes sure that if there are areas where that standard is not being reached, the issues are identified and fixed.</p><p>That is the process that worked.  The nature of audit reports is that they describe risks in the different categories of high risk, medium risk and low risk.

I do not know the history of those reports, and we can get back to the Deputy about what is possible.  This goes back, maybe, to something that I stated in my speech last week and restated in the introductory statement today - one way we are responding is that the Central Bank is significantly expanding its corporate staff.  This includes the internal audit function itself, the organisational risk department, the legal department and the communications department.  As a policy organisation, the temptation is to focus on the policy issues, but one also has to make sure the organisation itself is well run.</p></speech>

We were among the first central banks in the world to appoint a chief operating officer, which other central banks are now doing.  We have built up the idea that we must take seriously that the organisation itself has to be run to the highest standards.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, I am pleased to hear that.</p> <p>  My time is very limited so I will move on.  I do not have time to explore the issue of pay with the Governor.  For the life of me I do not understand why it is deemed appropriate that the Central Bank be outside the public pay framework of the State.  That is arrogance on the Governor's part and on his organisation's part.  He might reflect on that.</p> <p>  When the whistleblower came forward - and I appreciate that we cannot get into the specifics or identify people - his view was that he was leaned on and encouraged to change a previous report which made for even worse reading than this.  The Governor said in response to an earlier question that he brought in an independent body to adjudicate on that.  That was Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche, is that correct?</p></speech>

An issue arose; it had to be independently adjudicated on - we absolutely agree on that - but it was adjudicated on by a firm that was subsequently used by the Central Bank to address the issues in the audit report.  I have no doubt that the same firm does a myriad of other work for the bank.</p><p>That gives rise to a question regarding the capacity to really rigorously and independently make a judgment on a very sensitive disclosure.  The final report is by no means definitive in acclaiming the rightness of the actions of the Central Bank.  Professor Lane is correct in stating that the whistleblower has an action before the Workplace Relations Commission.  We are limited in what we can say on that.  However, what I can tell the Governor is that the individual in question took a second case against Pioneer Global Investment Management limited - the second employer - in respect of wrongful dismissal and actually won it just after Christmas.  There is a major concern here regarding the quality of internal governance.  The Governor referred to the culture of organisations.  What is that culture?  Is it to ballyrag people if they step forward and are critical?  Is it the culture of the Central Bank to let people go if it does not like what they are saying?  Is that the culture and, if so, what does Professor Lane propose to do about it?</p></speech>

The bank has absolutely no reason to aspire to anything but the highest standards and is - and, I am sure, will be in the future - totally dedicated to its very important public service mission of maintaining financial stability, protecting consumers and performing its other functions.  As I said last week, part of that means being self-critical and involves the bank being as open as it can be in how it does its business.  I see no reason for the bank to want to suppress awkward issues in any way, especially those - such as internal governance - which it can fix.  These are issues on which everyone can agree, particularly those relating to internal audit.  I imagine no one would argue against the points being made in the internal audit report on governance.</p></speech>

It says something very different.  To give due recognition, one area in respect of which the bank is compliant is that relating to travel and travel expenses.  Sin &eacute;.  On everything else, the bank is either partially compliant or non-compliant, and Professor Lane thumbs his nose at the idea of compliance in terms of pay.  That is obnoxious on the part of the institution he represents.</p></speech>

Essentially, we consciously do not comply in those areas because of our responsibilities to deliver our mandate as an independent central bank and as part of the euro system.  I agree with the Deputy: we consciously do not comply with the State salary levels.  I emphasise that Central Bank staff accepted all the cuts relating to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2015, so that aspect of the public sector adjustment made during the crisis was completely implemented.  We consciously make the decision that if we need to hire at certain rates in order to fulfil our mandate, we will do so.  The other area where we do not comply relates to a relatively minor difference in the limit for public procurement.  Again, the decision in that regard was made and the difference involved is not gigantic.  On all other elements of the code, the aspiration is to comply.  At this stage, my understanding is that all of the other points have been dealt with.  It is not the case that-----</p></speech>

Having spent the past two years sitting on the banking inquiry, one of the big lessons is that we should have a proper engagement at committees with the Governor.  Unfortunately, we usually have to skim over a number of important subjects and we do not get to the nuts and bolts of anything.  I hope if some of us are returned following the general election that there will be a deeper relationship between the Central Bank and this committee, which will be more meaningful.  Many of the reports and speeches delivered to this committee have been delivered to other committees without getting below the surface.  That is a disservice to the people unless we delve deeper.</p> <p>  I refer to economic growth rates and the bank's role in financial stability.  Professor Lane has identified vulnerabilities in the context of the growth rates.  Will he elaborate on them?  I am sure he read last week's IMF report, which cautioned against the erosion of the tax base and called for sustainable public investment, which the fund claims would lead to more sustainable growth in the long term.  He made comments recently about the fiscal space and what should be done with that.  Is he concerned about stability?  Does he support the IMF's view regarding the erosion of the tax base and sustainable public investment?  Will he comment, in particular, on the vulnerabilities affecting Ireland's economic growth in the years ahead given the storms on the horizon in China and other factors that are emerging?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#V00500"><p>It is always important for us as central banks and for other parts of the financial system but also for governments to take on this risk-based approach.  This morning, in the bulletin, we gave an optimistic view of Ireland this year and that is our expectation but we could be wrong on the upside or on the downside.  The collective view in Europe - and Mario Draghi also spoke about this yesterday - is lots of the dynamics within the euro area look okay at the moment - not fantastic but okay.  However, there are big concerns about whether the adjustment in China from exporting to domestic activity will go smoothly.  One manages risk by asking what happens if one is wrong.  For us, it is to say to the banks, "You need to have enough capital so if you are wrong and you are taking losses, it is not disastrous".  No matter who is in the next Government - and this is in the spirit of the fiscal treaty - we must not only forecast the spending and tax levels for next year but also, "What if I am wrong".  This approach says a system is needed under which public debt comes down.  It has come down a good amount in the past couple of years and it will come down more but the idea that public debt should be left at approximately 100% of GDP is too risky.  I agree it is hard to explain to people that we could cut taxes this year but we want to get the public debt down because it is in the background in comparison to taxing and spending.  It will be an ongoing challenge to get the public debt down because, as the Deputy said, while policies relating to pensions, social welfare and so on are important, there is a public investment issue regarding how a good amount of such investment is funded on top of everything else.  Members are about to go into election mode but I hope the next Government take seriously the need to reconcile not just a genuine public spending need, but also the importance of getting back to a safe level of public debt, which is no easy task.</p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy that though the Central Bank is independent, that does not mean it is unaccountable.  Accountability through Oireachtas committees and other dimensions is important.  I would welcome a more rigorous exchange between the Oireachtas and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Professor Lane said there are 66,000 mortgages in arrears of 90 days or more.  Overall, the number of residential mortgages in arrears was approximately 98,000 at the end of the last quarter.  This does not include buy-to-lets.  Behind each statistic is a family.  I have spoken to families in which individual members have contemplated taking their own lives as a result of these pressures.  Unfortunately, some people have done so.  Others are struggling to get by or they are sticking their heads in the sand hoping the problem will go away.  Some are making difficult choices in terms of the priorities for their families and their lives.</p> <p>  I am critical of the Central Bank and the banks about this.  Banks are allowed to treat voluntary surrender as a sustainable solution and the European Commission says it is being applied in up to 40% of these cases.  This is not acceptable.  It is also not acceptable that almost eight years since the beginning of the crisis, this number of people are still in arrears.  For example, if one took the principal mortgage holder out of each family, they would not fit into Croke Park and this is more than seven years later.</p> <p>  While Professor Lane said there was positive news in the results, the trend is that we will still be talking about unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears in five years.  This affects families and it affects the banks in terms of cleaning up their balance sheets.  It also has an impact on the wider economy.  The Central Bank can make a fresh start with the new Governor.  I do not criticise his predecessor who did a good job in many areas at a difficult time.  Will the bank take a strong approach to dealing with this crisis for once and for all?  It is unacceptable that this number of families is still in mortgage arrears.</p> <p>  We know the banks accrued their losses on commercial property because NAMA wrote them down but the write-downs for ordinary families are few and far between.  I have a theory which revolves around supporting the increase in house prices to allow the value of assets to increase, therefore, helping the banks' balance sheets as people move out of negative equity and so on.  The Government is involved in this.  However, the arrears remain and the banks are moving in because the repossessed homes are more valuable, which is why the number of repossessions is increasing. </p></speech>

I have spoken about using a carrot and stick approach in the past but the problem is that only the carrot was used.  Additional capital requirements were imposed but when the Central Bank allowed the banks to seek voluntary surrender or repossession, it put the stick back in its pocket.</p></speech>

I am sure there are many counter-examples but the firm belief is the more those in deep arrears engage seriously with their bank, the better.  This may require a great deal of assistance from MABS and other advisers to help them present their case about whether a viable solution is possible, insolvency is better or whether repossession should happen in limited cases.  I do not necessarily agree with the Deputy's comment about five years from now.    Many of these cases are coming to a conclusion.  Given the way the legal system works, there are some years to go on this.</p><p>I believe the Central Bank ensures that the supervisory teams who engage with the banks are achieving sustainable solutions.  That is a significant effort.  We also make significant efforts to ensure the banks follow the code of conduct on consumer protection.  </p><p> My predecessor towards the end expressed deep regret that it was taking so long to deal with the issues.  It is taking a long time to deal with it.  Let me also emphasise that this is a strategy that maximises what is possible for the Central Bank in terms of the capacity of the political system to help these people.  There are other ways to help these people, but from the point of view of the Central Bank, I think through these strategies, the Central Bank is doing as much as a Central Bank can do. </p></speech>

If there are issues about enforcement, perhaps Deputy Doherty would explain to me in more detail what he has in mind.  The firm intent of the Central Bank is to ensure we have sustainable solutions.

The person who carried out the internal audit has stated that information is being suppressed and was then subsequently let go.  It is a sequence of events that stinks.</p></speech>

We are constrained because this person is in front of the workplace commission.  I am trying to be as respectful as possible about the differing views.</p> <p>  In terms of the substance of this internal audit process on governance, the process worked as intended, the internal audit process identified a list of procedural issues that need to be dealt with and the bank has been dealing with the issues up to the limits of what it can do.  In terms of the process, this is the way internal audit is supposed to work.</p> <p>  It is not a correct description to state that this person was the internal auditor on this project.  There was a team of people, of which this individual was one person.  The language the Deputy is using is not exactly precise about the role of the individual versus others involved in that project.  </p></speech>

At the end of quarter 1, 2016 all of the issues that were identified that can be fixed have been fixed.</p> <p>  In other areas, there is a conscious choice that the bank holds itself outside of that code.  In terms of the internal audit process, I take the opposite view of the Deputy.  The message I take is that this process works.  In terms of speed and so, we are expanding the internal audit team to ensure it has the capacity to deliver this year 40 internal audits.  That is quite a lot of work and the bank is committed to it.  We have no reason not to achieve the excellence we want to.  </p> <p>  We fully support internal audit and internal audit projects will be fully respected.

Is it not a dangerous game to be playing, to be predicting very impressive growth figures and basing election promises on them when all of the commentary internationally is that big clouds are gathering on the horizon and so many will say this is a small open economy which is very vulnerable to what happens in the international economy?</p></speech>

It is what we think is most likely to happen.  It is still the case that possible risks in Brazil, China and so on are emerging.  Whether they will really shake up the world economy is open to question.  Again, the philosophy of a central bank has to be to protect the financial system by stating that if bad events happen, it will try to keep the system stable.  Equally, in terms of manifestos for governments and so on, it is a good question to ask as to what would happen if one is wrong?  If it turns out the world moves back into recession - it is not the main forecast, but one cannot rule it out - what would the strategies be in that case?  One needs to have a risk plan also.</p></speech>

During the review process we can consider this issue in greater depth.  The aim is to establish the risk factors.  One risk is a person buying a trophy house on which a bank can make a massive loss versus taking smaller losses on a greater number of medium priced houses.  There are different risks at which we can look.</p></speech>

I think the factor in Ireland at the top was 12.  There was the era during which houses cost 2.5 to four times average income.  Would this be a goal to help us to solve a lot of our housing problems?  I am worried about excess credit growth causing bubbles.</p></speech>

From very early on it has been much more interventionist in the mortgage market.  Let me emphasise that in how we design our own rules we definitely look at the experience of the Asian economies.</p></speech>

Professor Lane mentioned the issues in China and some of the emerging economies.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2016012600002#Z00100"><p>I hope this is concluded quickly.  It would be good if they do have the referendum in June so that, either way, we will know what we are dealing with.  With China, we more or less know the nature of the risk and what would happen if there were a big slow-down there or a big devaluation of the yuan renminbi, RMB.    The issue with BrExit is that there are so many different scenarios following it.  I am definitely on the side of those who say the cumulative impact on Ireland would be quite adverse.  It is something for which we do not wish from an economic and financial perspective, let alone as regards the politics and so on.  I would hope that the vote is taken quickly and that they vote to stay in, although it is obviously up to the UK electorate to decide on that.</p></speech>

Are we seeing any evidence of that in the Irish economy?</p></speech>

Any sensible major firm considering a location decision in which the competition is between the UK and Ireland will, I am sure, stall for a few months.  I would say the number one issue is delay.  The uncertainty is going to delay decisions about projects.  I think we are seeing sterling weaken in recent weeks, which is partly the result of speculation as a hedge against the BrExit risk.  As for what happens after that - whether firms decide to come here instead of the UK and so on - there are a lot of different scenarios.  It is hard to make strong predictions about it.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Caoimhe N&iacute; Chonchuir, Paul O'Hara, Elisa Cavacece and Karl Finnegan from the Department.</p> <p>  The motion seeks D&aacute;il approval of the terms of the agreement establishing an association between the European Union and its member states, on the one hand, and Central America, on the other.  The six countries which form Central America are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.  Diplomatic relations between the European Union and Central America were formally established with the San Jos&eacute; dialogue in 1984 and were driven partly by the desire of Europe to help bring to an end the political violence and instability that afflicted the region at that time.  Europe and Central America concluded a framework co-operation agreement in 1993 and a political dialogue and co-operation agreement in 2003.  In 2007, the European Council authorised the Commission to begin negotiations on an association agreement.  Talks on the agreement concluded in 2010 following the EU-CELAC summit in Madrid.  The association agreement was signed by all parties in Honduras in June 2012 and received the approval of the European Parliament in December of that year.  </p> <p>  Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and the republics of Central America, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement.  It is called a mixed competence agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence while others remain within the competence of member states.  The agreement contains three pillars: political dialogue, co-operation and trade.  It was agreed that the trade pillar of the agreement, which involves European Union rather than member state competence, would be provisionally applied pending the ratification by all EU member states of the agreement.  The trade elements of this agreement therefore came into effect during 2013. </p> <p>  To date, all six Central American republics have ratified the agreement, while on the EU side, 12 member states, including Ireland, have yet to notify the European Commission that they have completed all internal procedures necessary for the ratification of the agreement.  For Ireland, receiving the approval of the D&aacute;il is the last step of our domestic procedures necessary for its entry into force.  </p> <p>  I will turn now to the substance of the agreement.  This agreement has real value for the European Union and its people and for the people of Central America.  There are significant economic advantages for both sides.  The trade pillar of the agreement will eliminate high tariffs, tackle technical barriers to trade, open up services markets and public procurement markets and protect EU geographical indications.  For Europe, this means new business opportunities for European exporters and investors.  For Central America, it means access to the European market of 500 million consumers and a chance to move up the industrial value chain and create better quality jobs for workers.</p><p>Over time, under the agreement import duties on industrial goods and fish will be eliminated.  It is estimated that the overall value of tariff elimination on European exports will be in the region of &euro;90 million.</p><p> Agricultural trade will also open up, while protecting sensitive products in both regions.  Central American exporters of fruit and vegetables stand to gain significantly from the agreement.  Conversely, key European exports such as whiskey and wine will enjoy zero tariffs.  This is good news for the producers of Irish whiskey which we already export in significant quantities to Panama.</p><p> The agreement also simplifies customs procedures.  All Central American countries will, within three years, use a single customs document, thereby reducing the administrative burden for European exporters and traders within the region.  In addition, our partners in Central America have committed to removing barriers to services, trade and investment, which will make the region more attractive for European investors.  When fully enacted, the reduced costs of trade should have a beneficial impact on growth and job creation in all Central American countries and it is expected that the agreement will have a poverty-reducing effect overall in the region.  EU data suggest Central America&rsquo;s GDP could grow by over &euro;2.5 billion as a result of the agreement.  Economic resilience will also be improved by reducing reliance on the United States as a destination for Central American exports.</p><p> In 2014, the first full year in which the trade pillar of the association agreement was in effect, goods trade between the European Union and Central America was worth &euro;10.5 billion, an increase of 1.2% on the figure for the previous year.  The European Union is Central America&rsquo;s second largest trading partner after the United States, excluding intra-regional trade.  In 2014 there was a trade surplus of  &euro;1.7 billion in favour of Central America.  The chief imports to the European Union from Central America are data processing machines, coffee, bananas and pineapples.  The main EU exports to Central America are machinery, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and steel products.   </p><p> I reassure the committee that the agreement contains very strong safeguards for human rights, the rule of law, democratic principles, respect for the environment and workers&rsquo; rights.  The very first article states human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles constitute an &ldquo;essential element&rdquo; of the agreement.  This means that, in a situation where a government violates this essential element, any of the parties would be able to react unilaterally by taking proportional measures that could go as far as the suspension of the whole agreement.  This provision is a powerful statement of our commitment to uphold our values.  The co-operation pillar of the agreement commits the two sides to co-operate to achieve full compliance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the building and strengthening of democracy.  It commits the parties to work together in promoting good governance, fighting against corruption and supporting the participation of civil society in decision-making.  </p><p> The agreement has sustainable development at its heart and commits both sides to respect, implement and enforce a series of universal standards for labour rights and the environment, including the eight core conventions of the International Labour Organization.  The agreement contains a binding arbitration mechanism to ensure these commitments are respected, which can be triggered unilaterally by the European Union or any of the Central American countries, even against the will of the country concerned.</p><p> In regard to oversight, the agreement foresees the creation of a committee of parliamentarians, composed of MEPs and Deputies from the Central American parliaments.  The committee will have the right to demand information and make recommendations to the European Commission and Central American governments.  The agreement will also establish a civil society dialogue forum and a consultative committee, designed to allow civil society to hold government parties accountable.</p><p> I now turn to what the agreement means for Ireland.</p><p>Many Irish people feel an affinity with Central America.  From the late 1970s up to the 1990s, a solidarity movement grew up in Ireland in reaction to the political upheaval and civil wars affecting El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras and many Irish people travelled to the region in that period as volunteers.  There is also a tradition of Irish missionaries in Central America, particularly from the 1970s onwards.  Our relations with Central America received a significant boost with the visit of President Higgins to El Salvador and Costa Rica in 2013, where he received a very warm reception.  We do not have an embassy in Central America and most Central American republics are accredited to Ireland from their embassies in London.  There is, therefore, significant potential to develop our relations, which can only be assisted by an agreement such as this. </p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s trade with the region is small but growing.  Ireland&rsquo;s chief exports to the region include medicines, infant food, medical equipment, industrial machinery, computers and alcoholic beverages.  Our chief imports from Central America include vegetables and fruit, coffee, sugar and honey. </p><p> In 2013, total trade in goods between Ireland and the region was worth &euro;106 million.  In 2014, the first full year of operation of the free trade agreement, total trade grew to &euro;126 million, representing growth of almost 20% in our trade.  Figures from January to November 2015 show continued strong growth in Irish exports, particularly in trade with Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica.  While it is not possible to prove causation, trade data seem to indicate that there is at least a correlation between the entry into force of the trade elements of the association agreement in 2013 and recent growth in Ireland&rsquo;s trade with the region.</p><p> This agreement will provide a framework for strengthening the relationship between the European Union and Central America in trade, policy dialogue and co-operation.  It provides a platform for bi-regional engagement on issues concerning health, the environment, climate change, energy, education, employment and science and technology and will allow us to work together to tackle global challenges, such as migration, terrorism, money laundering, organised crime and corruption.  It contains important safeguards for human rights, workers&rsquo; rights and the environment.  The ratification of the EU-Central America Association Agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Central America but also charts a course for political and economic reforms.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of this agreement, we will show our support for the people of Central America. </p><p> I thank the committee again.  I hope this motion will meet with the committee&rsquo;s approval and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of the agreement so that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future.  I am happy to take questions at this point. </p></speech>

He mentioned Panama being a good export market for our whiskey.  I presume that if he is asked to recommend a particular brand, Midleton would not be far down the list, given where he comes from.  It is good to know that the people have a discerning taste for drink.</p> <p>  I hope the implementation of agreements happens in the spirit in which we agree them on a macro level and that they can lead to additional trade and increased job opportunities in Europe and in Central America.  The Minister concluded by referring to human rights.  The EU is formally committed to respecting human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  Its aim includes promoting a society in which justice, solidarity and equality prevail but we often do not recall that its founding treaty stated explicitly that it would apply these principles to all its activities, agreements and interaction with other countries and trading blocs.</p><p>When we sign up to trade agreements, it is particularly important we ensure workers' rights and human rights are protected.  A trade agreement should not be just about increasing the quantum of the trade but should also be about trying to improve the living standards of those on either side of the agreement who will be the beneficiaries of it.</p><p> Climate change has been in the news recently, particularly in terms of the Paris conference.  My understanding is that, in global terms, there are hot spots for adverse climate change impacts in Central America.  If droughts are likely to intensify and become more prolonged, there will be an adverse effect on those countries' ability to have a sustainable food production system and, sadly, it will be the poorest of people who will suffer most if there is a decline in production of food.  All the research shows that food security, particularly for the rural poor, is an issue that must be kept at the top of the agenda.  Whatever the European Union can do to help the farming systems in those countries to adapt and try to mitigate the effects of climate change, it is very important that is done and that Europe makes a meaningful contribution to the greatest extent possible to try to ensure there is not a lessening of food production due to climate change.  We know we cannot deal with everything nature throws up but there are methods, including technology and knowledge transfer, that are essential in terms of those agricultural and food production systems being given the benefit of what Europe has achieved in that respect.  I sincerely hope that will not be left to one side in the implementation of this agreement.</p><p> On imports, we have demanding and exacting standards within the European Union in regard to animal health, welfare, traceability and environmental standards for exporting food, which should be the case.  Likewise, the same standards must be applied to food products coming into the European Union.  There must be equivalents in the standards we set to export our products and those we demand for products that come into the European Union.</p><p> The Minister of State mentioned sustainability.  Sustainability is hugely important in the Central America context and from the point of view of subsistence farmers and fishermen.  We want to increase trade from Europe but at the same time, we must respect producers in Central America and not make them uncompetitive.  We must respect local markets that are developed for local produce and ensure that we do not end up displacing local small producers.</p><p> We must ensure also that there are ongoing mechanisms to review the implementation of the agreement and that the human rights, workers' rights, sustainability and environmental awareness issues are continually addressed, monitored and implemented in the best way possible.  That will ensure that Europe and the Central America countries are both beneficiaries of the agreement as it is implemented and that it benefits in particular the poorer people living in difficult conditions in remote rural areas and that their needs are respected in the implementation of those deals.</p><p> I welcome the advancement of this agreement but I emphasise that we can look at the agreement only on the macro level.  We do not have the knowledge or competence to invigilate every aspect of the agreement but we trust that it will be implemented according to the founding principles of the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2016012600002#E00100"><p>We had a meeting some time ago with the ambassadors of Central America countries.  As far as I can remember, the ambassador of Belize was also in attendance, but that country is not included in the agreement.  Some years ago, when it was being discussed, there was considerable concern among civil society organisations about the need to have binding mechanisms and monitoring systems in terms of the protection of human rights.  Based on what the Minister of State has said, it appears that these concerns have been taken on board.  However, there can be a huge difference between what is written on paper and the reality.  Is the Minister of State assured that what he says about what is included in the agreement will prove beneficial in terms of the protection of human rights and the pressures on natural resources such as land and water because there is significant displacement in South American and Central American countries?  He has said that when the agreement is fully enacted, the reduced costs of trade "should" have a beneficial impact on growth and job creation.  How confident is he that they "will" have a beneficial impact?  Significant work has been done and a paper prepared for consultation on business and human rights in Central America.  It is vital that we be clear on what we mean in this regard.  I am always struck by the fact that Ireland is an exporter of infant food when we know that support for and the encouragement of the breast-feeding of babies are more beneficial.  There seems to be a contradiction in that regard.  We also export whiskey, but I hope we are not exporting our alcohol problems with it and that it will not end up costing Central American countries what it is costing this country.</p> <p>  Are there plans to have a trade mission to Cuba or to develop more contacts with it?</p></speech>

It makes me feel proud that, as Europeans, we support emerging democracies and provide substantial development aid to assist them in key areas such as the protection of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.  I note that we are funding them to the tune of &euro;120 million in the context of regional economic integration; security and the rule of law; and climate change.  We are pumping &euro;35 million into assisting them in addressing the issues of climate control, land development, food production and water resources.</p> <p>  In the past five years I have noted the concerns expressed by NGOs.  I respect their views and the fact that they are on the ground in countries such as Colombia and Peru and that they have first-hand experience of the abuse of human rights such as land grabbing by multinationals or criminals.  On the other hand, we have seen a very brave President Santos in Colombia negotiate with the FARC rebels in order to bring stability to his fine country in order that it can take its place among the nations of the world.  At the time of the debate on the issue we expressed our concerns about human rights there and were assured that the European Union had core workers on the ground monitoring implementation of the agreements in place, which was excellent.</p> <p>  As we are in the last few weeks of the Government's cycle, it is important to recall that this committee also dealt with the Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Chile is in Latin America rather than Central America.  It was fascinating to see his enthusiasm for trade agreements and hear how beneficial such agreements with the European Union were for the Chilean people.</p><p>He was going further and further into the negotiations.  Therefore, I think that sometimes, we, as Europeans, forget that we are acting in the best interests not just of pure capitalism, grabbing land and produce, but are actually contributing to the key areas of developing law, human rights and workers' rights.  We are now trying to influence, in these Central American countries, all of those liberal democratic processes that we take for granted in the West.</p><p> We have already completed one agreement with Colombia and Peru.  The Chilean foreign minister, who is a socialist, has spoken about the redistribution of wealth there and how he was opening up the educational system to all and sundry, whereas it had been privatised under the previous government.  It is important that we, in the West, including Europe, recognise that there are democrats going through struggles in their own countries.  They are deserving of support, financially, politically and through development aid.</p><p> I am enthusiastic about what I have read here.  I see that the Minister of State's remit covers some of these countries.  As often as I can, I buy fair trade produce.  I know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is keen on advocating fair trade production.  We import produce from many of these countries.  The more we develop trade and diplomatic contacts, including by establishing embassies, the greater will be the understanding between NGOs, parliamentarians, governments and the whole European process.  I am enthusiastic about these agreements and I hope they will go through the House without any great difficulty.</p></speech>

These agreements are a progressive step in establishing trade relations with emerging, developing countries.  Unlike some other countries, Ireland has a good record of having treated trade and development aid as two separate issues.  Some countries tend to tie the two together, so that one becomes conditional on the other.  We have never pursued that approach.</p> <p>  Obviously, opportunities will arise for Latin American countries from the agreement.  The only rider I would put in, as always, is to say that I hope multinational corporations will not get the bulk of the benefit.  That has happened in the past, certainly in the African countries.  We need to closely observe the progress of the agreements as time goes by.  Does the Minister of State wish to make some closing remarks?</p></speech>

I will endeavour to reply to some of the issues that have been raised.  As regards labour rights and the universal standards that apply to them, the eight core principles of the ILO are part of that agreement.  As regards the main provisions of the agreement concerning human rights, if one examines the various articles inherent in the agreement, for instance, article 1 deals specifically with protections around human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles.  Climate change is inherent in articles 50 and 51, so there are specific references to responsibilities in respect of those issues.</p> <p>  It is evident through Irish Aid support that we have committed more than &euro;17 million since 2012 to this region.  We do much work through our partners, including Tr&oacute;caire, which is a key example in terms of capacity-building to assist the people who are most directly affected, namely, the primary producers.  We do much work at ground level in that respect.</p> <p>  Articles 41 to 46 specifically refer to addressing poverty, inequality and exclusion.  Provisions are made through specific programmes in that regard.</p><p>There is a programmatic element which ensures decent work for all, respect for workers' rights, equal access to education and public health and special initiatives aimed at vulnerable groups such as indigenous communities, something on which we are very strong from an Irish perspective.</p><p> Let us look at the trade terms.  As I said, they favour Central America in trading with the European Union.  In that sense, we are on a good footing.  It means that primary producers trade in coffee and fruits, in particular.  As Deputy Eric Byrne said, in Ireland we are good consumers of coffee.  In the case of Fairtrade Ireland, Java Republic, Bewleys and other brands, not to be too brand specific at this committee meeting, there is a very strong impetus towards purchasing unroasted beans directly from producers through intermediaries but giving a fair price to the primary producer.  This is now inherent within the Irish consciousness when we consume coffee.  We have moved a long way from buying jars of instant coffee.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State remember it?</p></speech>

We are satisfied that the agreement contains protections in that regard.</p> <p>  I will restate the following for the benefit of the committee.  In 2014 there was a trade surplus of &euro;1.7 billion in favour of Central America.  That shows that the trade terms favour Central America.  Ireland is growing its level of trade on a bilateral basis. </p> <p>  On climate change, Ms Cavacece might want to reiterate what the nature of the relationship is with NGOs from an Irish Aid perspective.  We are confident that everything we are doing in respect of the agreement corresponds with our foreign affairs policy on inclusive economic growth.</p> <p>  I will come back to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on her question on Belize.  I am pretty sure Ms N&iacute; Chonch&uacute;ir has the answer.</p> <p>  On Cuba, I met Dr. Herrera in the past few weeks and we had a very positive discussion on how we could enhance and improve the relationship between Ireland and Cuba across a range of sectors, including medicines, pharmaceuticals and education.  Work is ongoing between him and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that regard.  If there are specific areas about which the committee has ideas, I can assure members that the Department operates an open door policy when it comes to areas in which we can enhance co-operation.</p> <p>  When we talk about equivalence, there are very specific measures in the areas of food safety, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, energy, mining, tourism, science and technology, as well as governance in terms of taxation and small to medium-sized enterprises.  We are trying to reduce technical barriers to trade.  Sometimes there is a certain connotation surrounding the liberalisation of markets, but we are satisfied that the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated is such that there will be very stringent checks and balances explicit within it.  Also, there will be a parliamentary oversight function through the European Parliament.  If one also has directly elected Members of the European Parliament overseeing these agreements, it means that when issues arise, they will come to the fore through the European Parliament.</p></speech>

Irish missionaries have been present in Central America since the 1970s, with Irish NGOs joining in the 1980s.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the core focus of our support to civil society partners in Central America is around two areas, climate change and its impact on the poorest and most marginalised people.  Our civil society partners are working very closely with communities to make sure that more resilient and more sustainable livelihoods are developed.  For example, in the agriculture sector much work is being done around developing more effective irrigation systems, introducing more modern agricultural practices and also increasing the focus on agri-processing and ensuring the poorest small holder farmers have a link to market to sell their produce at a reasonable price.</p> <p>  The other important area in our development assistance programme in Central America is around making sure the poorest and most marginalised people are able to hold their government accountable in terms of how it makes decisions on the allocation of resources and the allocation of power.  These include issues such as access to land and access to water.  There is much work done at community level by civil society partners to ensure citizens, with a particular focus on women, are able to influence decision making.  We are quite comfortable that through the very solid partnership we have with organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid, Misean Cara and front-line defenders to look at the human rights issues we will be able to receive information on what is happening on the ground and have a good understanding of what is happening in the countries. </p></speech>

While Belize geographically would be considered part of Central America, culturally it tends to see itself more as part of the Caribbean group.  Belize formed part of the CARIFORUM group, a delegation from which appeared before the committee prior to Christmas with the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, in regard to the EU free trade agreement that replaced the Cotonou deal.  In terms of the  mechanisms for oversight, there are various levels of oversight, ministerial oversight, official level oversight and the creation of this parliamentary committee, which is an interesting innovation.  This will improve the capacity of Central American parliaments.  There is also a civil society dialogue forum, which is an excellent innovation and will encourage Central American society to build its oversight capacity.  The agreement foresees that where any party feels there may be a problem with workers or environmental rights, they can call for the creation of a panel of independent experts who will adjudicate on those standards and in a transparent manner deliberate and deliver a public report.  It is also foreseen that if the balance of trade become drastically disproportionate in a given country that country can implement measures to redress that and can temporarily suspend the agreement.  I hope that addresses some of the concerns.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-01-26a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2016012600002#H00500"><p>Perhaps the Minister or State or his officials would clarify the following matter.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is the lead Department in these negotiations whereas with the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is the lead Department.  Is there a reason for that?  Some time ago, some groups appeared before the committee and made a presentation to us in regard to the TTIP and the concerns that have arisen.</p><p>I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister of State's Department as such but it is worth our while putting on the record our concerns regarding some of the proposed provisions within that agreement.  We know that if the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership comes to fruition, it will create the world's largest free-trade area.  There are obvious concerns in this country about retaining our food standards and the current EU law on GMOs and hormone-treated beef.  These are issues that are particularly important for Europe.  We could not have the American way imposed on us in respect of those food standards.</p><p> One other area in respect of which there has also been considerable concern is the controversial investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.  Those of us who are parliamentarians or who are in government could not countenance, in any agreement, giving powerful multinational corporations the ability to sue sovereign governments.  This would not be acceptable in any agreement.</p><p> As an exporting country, in practical terms we should benefit disproportionately from trade agreements.  The proposed EU-US trade agreement, if implemented while upholding workers' rights as well as maintaining food standards, would benefit this country.  It is estimated that perhaps 10,000 jobs would be created here.  However, if that particular proposed agreement is advanced, these important issues must be kept to the fore at all times.  Ireland must continue to defend its interest in agriculture and the agrifood sector when it comes to international agreements.  We know the importance of that particular sector throughout all of our island and the exacting standards which are quite rightly imposed by the regulator agencies and implemented and put into practice by our farmers.</p></speech>

I share some of his concerns, as do certain European member states, on the dispute mechanism.  However, we must remember that this agreement is far from being concluded.  We are currently engaged in the 12th round of talks and a mechanism has been proposed by the European Union on the investment courts but we are a long way off an agreement.</p> <p>  I absolutely concur with Deputy Smith on the protection of agriculture standards in particular.  We have exacting food health, food provision and food production standards.  There is no way we would want those in any way diminished.  Agriculture is a key component of our export strategy.  I totally agree with the points made by Deputy Smith, which have now been put on the record.  However, an agreement is still a long way off.</p> <p>  On the procedure around the negotiation of TTIP, for an association agreement, it is not just about trade as we are talking about it today.  There is also political dialogue and co-operation given TTIP is a trade agreement.  Mr. Karl Finnegan, who represents the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is with us here today and if the committee would like a little insight - after the meeting - on where negotiations are from a technical point of view, we would be happy to facilitate that.  In political terms, we are a long way from an agreement and we all, as parliamentarians, have concerns about the dispute mechanism and the power of corporations relative to member states.</p></speech>

Certainly, there will be no drop in standards.  This has been clear and has been accepted by both parties.</p><p> As for the investor-to-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism for investor protection, the updated piece on that, as alluded to by the Minister of State, is that the European Commission has proposed its views on a reformed ISDS piece, which it has called an investor court system.  The Commission has sought to tackle some of the existing outlined issues and concerns expressed by member states, Members of the European Parliament and generally.  The Commission is waiting to hear back from the United States regarding its formal response to the proposal and that will be negotiated, possibly, or discussed at the next round of the negotiations, which will be later in February.</p></speech>
