I welcome our witnesses, those watching and members.  For this morning's session, we will engage with representatives of the health workforce, who will outline their vision of health service reform.  Health professionals including nurses, doctors and non-medical support staff are the beating heart of our hospitals and community health services, as we know.  As Professor Keane emphasised at last week's session, reform programmes need to achieve buy-in from members of the public and staff.  This is critical and is the message coming through from a number of the witnesses we have had to date.</p> <p>  Our first session will be with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  We will meet representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, at 10.30 a.m. and those from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, at 11.30 a.m..</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Patricia King, general secretary of ICTU; Mr. Liam Doran, general secretary of the INMO, Mr. Paul Bell, health division organiser at SIPTU, Mr. Terry Casey, general secretary of the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, Mr. Eamonn Donnelly, national secretary of the health and welfare division of IMPACT, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer, public sector, ICTU.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>I understand that Ms Patricia King and Mr. Liam Doran will be making opening statements.  I now invite Ms King to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#B00200"><p>Congress is pleased to accept the invitation to address the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  The establishment of this Oireachtas committee and the attendant focus on formulating a long-term vision for a reformed public health service is a positive and welcome development.  Congress has made a detailed written submission to the committee and my comments and the statement to be made by my colleague, Mr. Liam Doran, chairperson of the congress committee, are based on that submission.<br/><br/>The views expressed in our submission to the committee have been developed in consultation with our affiliated unions.  However the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, has independently developed a strategy for the organisation of the health services.  As mentioned by the Chairman the committee will hear evidence from the IMO later in the next session.  Members will have noted that in our submission we referred to the fact that over the last three decades there have been several proposals to reform or overhaul the public health service.  However, it is clear that real transformational change has not occurred and we continue to have a dysfunctional system in which the perverse incentives that encourage private over public practice continue to persist.  The failure to bring about real transformational change has also had a very demoralising effect on staff within the service.  There is strong evidence of a developing and growing culture of restructuring fatigue.  It is for these reasons that congress believes that the establishment of the committee presents a real opportunity to begin a programme of reform that should begin with a declaration of intent that, over time, we will move to a universal, fully integrated, single-tier public health service that guarantees access and quality care, regardless of income.<br/><br/>We have argued in our submission that the public health service should be funded through a progressive taxation system.  At a minimum, the service should be allocated dedicated funding of 10% of GDP per annum, with a further recognition that significant additional capital spending will be required in some years.  It is crucial, as part of the reform programme, that, over time, the State will cease to subsidise all forms of private health care provision.  We strongly believe that the development of a network of public, locally-based community health care centres is vital to the future restructuring of the service.  For the vast majority of citizens the first point of contact with the public health service will be these centres.  These centres should provide an expanded range of clinical and diagnostic services and will lead health promotion campaigns in the communities in which they are based.  The network of public hospitals will continue as a vital cornerstone of the public health service but the role of the public hospital will be re-focused, with some services devolved to the community health care centres.  Vital to reform of the health service will be a move to a team-based approach to patient care which is consultant-delivered and where all hospital staff are respected and enabled to perform tasks appropriate to their qualification levels and competence. <br/><br/>The increase in the number of older people living longer lives is the biggest challenge facing our public health service.  This challenge is such that it will require the State to reverse its current policy of privatising elder care and to re-engage as the principal provider of health care services for older people.  The incidence of mental health disorders continues to rise and demands a renewed commitment to deliver in full the proposals contained in the <i>A Vision for Change </i>strategy published in 2006.  Not-for-profit organisations currently provide the bulk of health services to people with disabilities.  A small number of highly publicised failures have highlighted the need for better oversight and a focus on quality assurance and patient care.  A strategy of providing services in community-based settings must be part of an overall approach to the care of people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The committee must accept that moving to a universal, fully integrated, single-tier public health service presents a number of workforce planning challenges, not the least of which is understaffing.  In designing the new system, full regard must be had to appropriate remuneration, reward and recognition systems and other conditions of employment, such that the Irish public health system is ultimately viewed as the employer of choice and is capable of attracting and retaining the most talented staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#B00300"><p>It is the view of congress that there is a growing consensus across Irish society that a single-tiered public health service which treats all citizens equally is in the common good for communities and our economy.  I remind members that congress represents 750,000 workers and their families and has debated the issue of health extensively over its last number of biennial conferences.  We believe there is significant unease about the current two-tiered health system where money buys quicker access to many services.  There have been many examples of this.  However, despite the many limitations with accessing our public health service, patients report a very high level of satisfaction with the quality of care and treatment they receive.  This high level of performance, once the public health service is accessed, must be maintained as we transition to a public health service which is resourced, structured and available to all citizens equally.  Access and equality must be the two measures against which progress is measured.  Against this background congress wishes to stress that the transformational change required must be commenced against a number of guiding principles.  These include the point that the change to a single-tiered, universally accessible public health service will require far more than a decade.  Moreover, the change process must involve a long-term multi-annual commitment for the provision of ring-fenced core funding for the public health service at a minimum of 10% of GDP per annum.  In addition, there will be a requirement for a significant capital programme to improve existing infrastructure and provide for new services and all funding should be provided through a system of progressive general taxation with a declaration that the State will, over time, cease to fund or to subvent any form of private health care provision.  This will require the phased elimination of all tax reliefs for private health care insurance and direct subventions, that is, to existing private nursing homes.  Another principle of the transformational programme must be that all existing public health services are maintained and, where necessary, enhanced until the alternative models of service, with much greater emphasis on community-based services, are established and fully operational.  The programme must also lead to a simplified, integrated and readily understood organisational structure with clear lines of accountability and transparency and the single-tiered public health service must also be an employer of choice, offering all staff the opportunity to utilise their skills and talents in an environment which encourages innovation, autonomy and excellence.<br/><br/>On primary care, a cornerstone of a new health service must be universal eligibility for all health services, beginning with primary care services, provided by directly-employed health professionals.  Staffing should be on the basis of seven-over-seven opening and centred on a team approach.  The public must access the full range of health professionals who can cross-refer from one colleague to another based upon the needs of the person presenting for support or care.  There can be no artificial structural barriers to a fully integrated primary care service.  Such services, available on this seven-over-seven basis, must be provided on the basis that they can offer sufficient diagnostic and other support services so that the majority of persons attending can have their needs met without referral to the hospital or secondary care service.  The shift to primary care will require, in addition to investment, a massive reorientation, not only of health professionals and staff but equally, the public.  In that regard services must be capable, in a seamless fashion without lines of demarcation or limitations to access, of ensuring all health professions are fully utilised; chronic diseases can be managed away from the acute hospital; vulnerable people can access care, advice, support and guidance near their home; and significant investment in managing lifestyles to maintain positive health.  It must be noted and accepted that a public health service must be enabled and resourced to promote the maintenance of good health within the community and not just be left to deal with ill-health and poor lifestyles. <br/><br/><b></b>On acute hospitals, an immediate requirement within our existing public health service is additional acute beds in a number of locations across the country.</p><p> As we indicate in our written submission, the latest OECD bed-to-population ratio confirms that Ireland, at 2.8, is significantly below the international norm of five beds per thousand of population.  In essence, we have currently the perfect storm of too few acute beds to cater for demand, with wholly inadequate primary care services, which might, if they were resourced, provide a viable alternative to hospital care.  In the context of a major investment programme to deliver the required additional acute beds, many of which can be five-day or day beds to reflect changing models of care, we also need to transform the role played by senior clinical decision makers, that is, consultants, who should be employed to work exclusively in our public health service.</p><p> The transformation programme, which should begin immediately, must see consultants on new contracts rostered over an extended day, on a seven-day-week basis.  This will in turn require a significant number of additional consultants in the core specialisms of medicine, surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and emergency medicine.  While moving to this consultant-delivered service with less reliance on non-consultant hospital doctors, there must be a significant reconfiguration of the roles played by other health professionals to optimise their contribution to patient care.  This, as we have said regarding primary care, must involve more autonomous roles, cross-professional referrals and greatly enhanced team working.</p><p> In the context of structures, congress broadly welcomes the establishment of the seven hospital groups and the potential it offers to provide optimum patient pathways, minimise duplication and streamline decision-making.  However, congress also believes, in the context of commencing this transformational programme, no existing acute hospital service can be discontinued unless or until an alternative service which enjoys the confidence of the public is readily accessible and available.</p><p> In the context of this country's demographics, we face two major challenges regarding the provision of services and care to older people arising from the following: it is a fact that the number of senior citizens will steeply increase over the next 25 years.  There has been a 21% increase in the number of persons over 65 since 2010 alone.  Linked to this increase in the number of older persons will be a significant increase, estimated at 4% to 5% per annum, in the number of people presenting with multiple chronic conditions requiring ongoing intervention, care and support.  At this stage, I remind the committee that the number of people attending emergency departments has gone up by 5.3% this year to date.  The vast bulk of those are frail elderly, and this increase will continue unless we provide alternative pathways for those people to present to deal with their changing chronic conditions.  Regardless of how effective we make primary care services, it is a reality that long-term care will be necessary for significant numbers of our senior citizens.  In that regard, congress is absolute in its belief that the State must declare that, over time, it will return to being the main direct provider of long-term residential care for older people.  This will require significant State investment in terms of physical infrastructure in residential surroundings.  All moneys currently spent on direct State provision to private nursing homes, which can be estimated at up to &euro;20 million per week or over &euro;1 billion per annum, should be phased out and redirected into public direct provision.</p><p> Regarding mental health, congress must begin by highlighting its concern that both budgets and services have been severely cut in recent years.  Furthermore, it appears that funding earmarked for mental health has for various reasons been utilised in other areas of our public health system.  As recommended by the WHO, it is imperative, as we transition to a single-tiered service, that funding for mental health be set, at a minimum, at 12% of the total health care budget.  In addition, service provision, as part of the transition, must be integrated within primary care.  It must be accessible by the service user on a seven-over-seven basis, and in major urban areas on a 24-7 basis, through dedicated staff in major emergency departments.  I think we all know the problems mental health is presenting at the moment and the hidden hurt and damage it is causing.  Congress also believes that, in properly resourcing mental health support services, necessary funding must be provided for preventative programmes.  We must also recognise that a wider range of professional staff, including teachers - in schools and colleges - as well as all health professionals, must have training in the identification of early signs of mental health difficulties.</p><p> Congress asks the committee to recognise, acknowledge and accept that funding for disability services in this country has been subject to major cuts over the last seven years.  This has been done in a way which has had a major impact upon the quality of services available and the range of services that can be accessed in different parts of the country.  This negative development has also been exacerbated as many services are provided by a range of entities which, while independent, rely almost exclusively upon State funding - section 39 agencies, for example.  It is the view of congress that all disability services should be provided through direct provision, with directly employed staff and in a manner which ensures that access to necessary supports is available regardless of income or location.  In making this point, we acknowledge the excellent work done by many not-for-profit organisations.  However, in order to ensure equity of access and service provision, congress believes direct provision is the model for the future.  In the context of moving to direct provision, there must also be a continuing process of integration into community-based living and working opportunities for the disabled person as we minimise the need for more traditional residential-type living environments.  This must be provided for in the capital development programme referred to earlier.</p><p> Regarding miscellaneous matters, congress is acutely aware of the need for openness, transparency and accountability from those who manage and deliver services to the citizens of this country.  That is why congress supports strong regulation to govern how all professionals practise.  For the public to have confidence in those providing care, it is essential that clear regulatory standards apply and are seen to apply.  Congress also recognises that any such service must be subject to constant review and examination by a wholly independent inspectorate.</p><p> Congress believes that an absolute cornerstone of a world-class, single-tiered, accessible health service is the employment of highly motivated health professionals and support staff.  This must be within an environment in which innovation is encouraged and staffing levels, as determined by an evidenced-based approach, are maintained and guaranteed.  In that regard, the transformation programme we all seek must recognise that our health service in the future must provide excellent remuneration, reward and recognition systems.  It must also provide continuing development programmes so that staff are fully equipped for the ever-changing environment which will inevitably exist within every health service.</p><p> The establishment of this committee and its report can, in the view of congress, be an absolute watershed moment for this country and its approach to the provision of health services to its citizens.  In that context, congress believes that this committee should clearly state that an overarching goal of this process, in the interests of communities and the economy, is a move to a universal, fully integrated, single-tiered public health service that guarantees access and quality of care regardless of income.  This can only be achieved by guaranteed minimum funding in addition to significant capital investment, which must be removed from the uncertainty of the political, electoral and budgetary cycles.  Congress recognises this is not an easy challenge, but it must be obvious to all of us that declaring a budget for the health service in October for the coming year makes forward planning all but impossible.  The reality of our two-tiered health system, with its illogical and contradictory incentives for key players, makes the journey to a single-tiered system all the more difficult.  That is why congress believes the change process will take at least 15 years and will require significant, sustained and increased investment.  Congress also believes there is no option or alternative to this reality when one takes into account existing contractual arrangements, existing service limitations, growing demand, changing demographics and societal expectation with regard to treatment.  Congress also believes that this journey will require clear, determined and unambiguous leadership across the political system and within the health service itself.  The goal must be that when we reach 2030 the citizens of Ireland will live in a country which promotes the maintenance of good health but which responds to ill health in all its forms with efficiency, effectiveness and professionalism, regardless of socio-economic status or where one lives.  This is a demanding objective but one that can, and must, be realised.</p></speech>

Is it all right with him if we publish both witnesses' opening statements?  They were very comprehensive statements.  I invite members to contribute and ask questions.  I ask the witnesses to bank the questions; we will take members in groups of three.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#C00300"><p>I thank Patricia King and Liam Doran for their statements and for appearing before the committee today to share their thoughts and views.  It is very important that we hear those thoughts and views and listen to what they say because of the positions they hold and the influence they have.</p> <p>  I see they call for a dramatic overhaul of the health system, which is laudable in itself.</p><p>I am playing devil's advocate in that I am asking particular questions so that we can tease out issues for the benefit of the committee.  Reference was made to a 10% of GDP spend on health care, restructuring fatigue and the need for a timeline of greater than ten years in terms of implementation of a plan.  Is the proposed 10% spend workable given the already high tax burden borne by many families over the last number of years?  In regard to the timeline and given changes in technology and medical science, would a further increase in the timeline be required at a future stage?  In regard to the proposed centralised health system, my understanding is that there is no room within that for private health care providers, non-for-profit providers and community-based health initiatives.  There must be some way we can learn from the experiences they have had or to in some way include them in the system.  In other words, there must be some leverage to use their skills and services.  It would be detrimental to leave them completely out of the picture.</p><p> I note the comments regarding senior citizens and I agree that the State should be the main provider of care for them.  This is going to be a problem area into the future.  The issue of people living for longer and the increasing number of frail and elderly people living in our communities is one that this committee will have to address.  I agree also with the witnesses' comments regarding mental health.  It is important the committee would also take note of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#D00200"><p>I thank the delegates for attending this meeting.  Mr. Doran mentioned that we need to ensure that all health professionals are being fully utilised.  That would suggest that currently they are not, with which I agree.  However, perhaps he would elaborate on the untapped expertise and resources currently not being utilised.  I accept there will be challenges in terms of how we can best make use of resources because that requires a certain amount configuration and I imagine there is restructuring and reconfiguration fatigue in the system.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' views in regard to how much value we get from the private sector for the services that are provided, on which issue I am sure the witnesses are aware I have my own views.  For example, we know that &euro;19 million was spent on private ambulance services over four years, &euro;6.3 million of which was spent in one year.  I believe we have people who could and should be providing that service publicly.  There has been much discussion at this committee about the big bang approach versus incrementalism, which is, possibly, more achievable.  How soon could we be ready for the type of massive transformation that we all know is necessary?  In regard to incrementalism, we have discussed whether it is possible to reform the system piece by piece starting with the community system, followed by the hospital system and so on.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' views on how that would work, if it would work or if we should be massively aspirational and do what was done in Britain with the NHS?  In other words, should we put the necessary legislation in place and move ahead or should we take the incremental approach?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#D00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank Ms King and Mr. Doran for their presentations and the more detail submissions made to the committee.  I have a couple of questions which seek to tease out how we move from where we are in terms of developing a strategy to implementation of what we all hope we can achieve at some stage, namely, a universal public health system with access based on clinical requirement.  We have to live in the world.  That type of system will have to be funded by the taxes of the members of ICTU.  We must get to a stage where we have a sustainable health system.  Ms King referred to funding equal to 10% of GDP.  While 10% is an arbitrary percentage figure, when GDP is growing rapidly, as the case may be, hopefully, in the future, or shrinks rapidly, as was the case not so long ago, the result would be a system that is not underpinned on a sound financial basis in terms of longer-term planning.  I would welcome more clarity on whether the proposal for a 10% of GDP spend is an aspiration or whether the spend needs to be more clearly defined.</p> <p>  In regard restructuring fatigue, the HSE was established in 2004.  It then hit the sands in 2008 in terms of the financial melt-down and cutbacks to services.  One could argue that the HSE did not exactly hit the ground running and was quickly in huge difficulty in terms of financial resources.  The nearest we have to a public health system is the HSE, in aspiration at least.  The broader issue that we need to address is the value for money provided by the HSE and what it has up to now delivered.  My questions for the witnesses are primarily around the issue of staffing levels.  Has a comparison been undertaken of staffing levels in other countries in terms of grades and professional competencies?  Very often, I find that when comparing figures I am not comparing apples with apples, but apples with oranges.  People are flexible in their views in terms of what exactly is a comparator.  In terms of the research by ICTU and its effort to come forward with a logical proposal in terms of how we develop a universal health care system, does it have statistics based on comparisons, bearing in mind that some of our public health system is crossed with a private health care system?  In other words, what are the statistics for the public health system when one strips out the private health care system?</p> <p>  Mr. Doran said that in terms of cost of delivery one of the biggest challenges facing us is that of demographic change, life expectancy, co-morbidity, chronic illnesses and diseases, people living longer but also living with chronic diseases and neurological illnesses and so on.  In this regard he said that the public health system should deliver all of the care for elderly people, over a period of time.  Is there any cost to support that or is that an ideological view?  Mr. Doran might elaborate on whether the public health system can deliver health care cheaper and more effectively than the private system, taking account of how this is currently done through the fair deal scheme.  </p> <p>  On hospital capacity, there is no doubt but that there has been a stripping out of beds in our acute hospital setting in particular.  It was stated that we have now arrived at the perfect storm in terms of poor supports in the community in primary care, life expectancy and demographic changes, the flip-side of which is that everybody ends up in our emergency departments on trolleys.  In that context, where would ICTU start if implementing a plan?  Would it start at primary care level by frontloading primary care investment initially, would it favour transformation of the whole system overnight or, in the context of a 15-year timeframe, what would be its priority to alleviate the immediate problems facing our acute hospital system, emergency departments and people on trolleys?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#E00100"><p>Regarding Deputy Madigan's comments on the 10% of GDP and the taxation system, fundamentally, this is down to Government choice.  As we have described in the submissions made to the committee, which we will not repeat, it is about choices.  We are very clear that the private health system should not be subvented by taxpayers' money.  If one wants to build the universal, single-tiered system, one makes choices to do so.  At the moment it seems that 70% of the health service is funded by Government.  According to the figures for 2014, that is about &euro;13 billion.  We are clear, as we said in the submission, that we should not have a system that has perverse incentive to uphold the private system.  Anybody is fully entitled to make a judgment that this is an ideological and aspirational position and so on, but the people in power who make decisions must make the choices.  The choice in the health sector at the moment is that if one has money, one gets cared for quickly, but if one does not have money or if one's income level does not lend itself to care, one waits.  That causes people on lower income scales to die or to spend a longer time being ill than somebody who can buy health care.  That is a perverse system and is down to the decision of the political establishment and policy-makers that that is the kind of health care system they want.  I have no doubt that the politicians who must make those decisions, particularly those in power, must make decisions about all the other leans on the taxation system and on public funding and so on, but that is really what it is down to.  Even if we just take Europe, other European countries have made different decisions, which is why, skipping briefly to Deputy Kelleher's question about whether we have facts or statistics, it would be desperately difficult to get anywhere other than to start comparing apples with oranges when one makes comparisons with the Irish health system because it is unique in the way it treats its citizens in terms of inequality.  There is a much bigger preponderance of equality in the French and UK systems than there is in the Irish system.<br/><br/>I will leave the issues about medical science and so on to my colleagues.  I will deal with an issue Deputy O'Reilly raised.  She mentioned the ambulance service.  There are two aspects to this.  There is either a myth or a belief that some policy-makers have that once they outsource something, it will be cheaper.  If one looks even across the water, very recently many studies have been done on this.  Great Britain is now starting to go back to insourcing.  We are usually about five to six years behind such thinking.<br/><br/>On the question of outsourcing, first, this country does very little monitoring of what happens to its money when it puts it out to the private sector to spend.  Second, Paul Bell, my colleague, and I are very familiar with the national ambulance service.  I am very familiar with the ambulance service provided through the Dublin Fire Brigade in the city of Dublin and the surrounding counties.  Mazars did an in-depth report, in which I was involved because I represented the firefighters for a number of years.  They would say the service, which is provided on a 24-7, 365-day basis and is integrated with the fire service, is beyond doubt and beyond comparison the cheapest.  There has been a plethora of both public servants and luminaries in the private sector who want to get their hands on that service and have it outsourced.  Given that the firefighters provide a service <i>par excellence</i>to the citizens, as does the national ambulance service, very few would be able to replicate the excellence of that service, but there is a push all the time.  When one examines in-depth that segment of the ambulance service, one will see there is no way the private sector, which is in it to make a profit, could replicate the level and standard of service being provided at that price level.  Therefore, over many years, in my positions both in SIPTU and now in Congress, I have advocated insourcing.  This privatisation and outsourcing is certainly not all it is cracked up to be, and the State does very little in the order of following the money and seeing what value taxpayers get in this regard.<br/><br/>Restructuring fatigue, in my judgment, is a very big issue in the HSE in particular.  Throughout the staff, regardless of grade, whether one earns at the very top end or the lower end of income levels, restructuring fatigue leads to the belief that the restructuring will be an ongoing feature.  This is a big challenge that this group will face for any transformational propositions it faces because when one wants a change of staffing in any organisation, one must win hearts and minds.  One has a major mountain to climb when restructuring has taken place about 101 times and has not worked.  The people supposed to be delivering the service will say it has happened before and that they have no faith in it.  Winning the hearts and minds of workers is a big problem for the health sector.  Over decades I have walked into many canteens and many workplaces and had discussions there with workers.  It does not matter how good or wonderful the manager is or what good ideas he or she has because the workers will have heard it all before.<br/><br/>Another point is that to make restructuring work, the people, both those at the policy development level and those charged with implementing it, must have confidence and show confidence that what they are proposing will actually work.  They must believe it will work.  That is not the case at the moment.  They do not believe it will work.  They do not know whether it will work and they shift from one big idea to another.  When one pushes it and asks them whether they think it will work, they do not know because the basic, fundamental principles such as, for instance, the perverse incentive, are usually not changed.  The perverse incentive will usually be in the new plan.  Unless one grasps the major aspects of transformation that must happen and shows willing from the top to the bottom that this will happen, people will just see it as another restructuring.  That is a big challenge for this committee and for us on the ground who work with the people who work in the health service.  The health sector is 95% unionised so, from that perspective, we are in there all the time listening to such concerns.  At that I will hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#E00200"><p>I will try to fill in the gaps Ms King has left.  Regarding the comments about funding, let us have a clear debate about this.  Ireland currently spends 10.1% of its GDP on health, 7% through public and approximately 3% through private, out-of-pocket expenses, which the State subsidises through tax allowances and tax rebates for health insurance.  Therefore, those who can afford to pay get better access to the health service.  That is irrefutable.  It is as straightforward as that.  In the context of working out what we want to spend, Congress says we must tie up the money in direct public provision.  If one wants private health care, one can still have it, but the State will not subsidise it.  There will be fully universal access to health care, whereby everyone is treated equally and no one is asked whether he or she has health insurance or is on a medical card.  The latter would automatically put one in the old dispensary model whereby one goes in one door and the other door.  That is the reality, only we will just dress it up in nice clothes.  That is where we are.</p> <p>  The question of private practice will always be there.  The NHS is lauded.  In the UK, 12% of health care takes place in the private sector, so private practice is there, but people choose to avail of it and fully meet the cost and so on.</p> <p>  Regarding the full utilisation of all health professionals, let me be very blunt with the committee.  Members are right that organisational fatigue has set in, but there has not been reform in the front line over the last ten years.</p><p>The number of hospital weekend discharges has not changed.  We talk about seven-day working of hospitals; it has not changed.  I faced the CEO of the Health Service Executive in 2007, Professor Drumm, who accused our people of elder abuse, because the people I represent were not prepared to carry out first-dose antibiotic IV fluid-balance phlebotomy duties in care of the elderly and so they were being sent back to an acute hospital to have an acute episode of care managed.  That was a grossly unfair charge.  Congress has been sitting waiting for the HSE to engage in that very thing for the past two years and they will not talk to us because of the siloed budget structures that exist in the HSE.  In social care, to keep people in a long-term home while providing first-dose antibiotic, a blood transfusion or an IV transfusion will cost the social care budget money.  It will save the acute hospital budget money, but that is a different budget.  That is the level of myopic structuring we have now.</p><p> On reforming health services in the community, why can a public health nurse, who knows the households in the area, who knows the support structures in families and who identifies Mr. Murphy or Mrs. Murphy as having a deterioration - maybe the chest respiration has gone up, there is pyrexia when the nurse visits the home and so on - not be empowered to prescribe within protocols automatically without having to refer to a GP?  Public health nurses have done a four-year undergraduate programme, a one-year postgraduate higher diploma, have a minimum of two years' experience and will also have done a prescribing programme to get there.  If people are not safe in their hands, they are not safe in anybody's hands.  They are willing and able to take that on board.  I am also talking about community RGNs.  We should also have that kind of protocol in care of the elderly.  That is what we mean by health professionals not being fully utilised.</p><p> An OT should be able to refer to a public health nurse.  A public health nurse should be able to refer to a dietician.  A dietician should be able to refer to a physiotherapist.  All those things should be able to happen within the team environment without, as is current practice, having a GP as a trigger.  GPs are an essential part of the team, but when the condition changes there needs to be a new diagnosis, not when we are dealing within agreed parameters the ebb and flow of managing a chronic condition.  That is what we mean by underutilising.  That also requires a mindset of the public because we have a medical model of care here where, to a certain extent, if I go to the GP and do not get a prescription for a tablet or a referral to a hospital, the GP was no good because he or she did not listen to me.  That also needs to change.  That is what we mean by fully utilising health.</p><p> On the big bang or incrementalism, with the contracts that exist at the moment - people absolutely have a right to have those contracts honoured - I do not think Ireland can do a big bang because we are not starting in the same place as Britain was in 1948 or whatever.  We have to respect people who have contracts.  However, we have to replace all those contracts incrementally with public-only contracts so we shift over that 15-year period.  If existing contract holders want to move into the new model that is brilliant, but they cannot be made to and have to be respected.  A certain court case is being taken over a certain grade of medic.  How much will that cost?  That is a contractual obligation; that is life.  We would love to do a big bang, but we are not starting from that place.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Kelleher on staffing levels.  In this country we are unwilling to accept best practice as determined by evidence already found in other countries, whether we call it nurse-patient ratio, midwife-birth ratio.  Earlier this week we saw a shortage of consultants in the cardiac area and that negative impact.  Our staffing must be evidence-based.  In a public health service, if we want stable consistent care, whether I am in Bloody Foreland in Donegal or Rosslare in Wexford or Skibbereen or Dundalk, we need to have norms of staffing that are consistent and are maintained.  They can be a cousin of the pupil-teacher ratio if one wants to make that comparison.  That is how to guarantee consistent care.  A hospital should not be staffed on the basis of having a Minister in the right place.  They should be staffed by virtue of evidence.  That evidence should be determined annually by the front-line manager and we are working on that.  The good news is that in my little area there is a task force on nurse staffing.  There is a maternity strategy which clearly identifies obstetric and midwifery-to-birth ratios.  We can do that.  The evidence is there internationally.  Part of the transition would be to standardise and normalise.  However, that also requires everyone to clearly understand it is a team game.  The consultants, NCHDs, nurses, midwives, health-care assistants and allied health professionals, all have a role in a standardised structural approach based on evidence.  The best places for outpatient outcomes are the ones with patient ratios.  California, New South Wales and Victoria have the best patient outcomes, but it requires a significant investment.</p><p> On demographics and the cost of the fair deal, I do not believe anyone understands that we are standing on the edge of the precipice when it comes to the demands for elder care.  It is not just a question of them getting older but their co-morbidities will increase, as will their expectation of treatment.  That will only come the way of the health service.  We have to have regard to the pension situation.  Even if we left it as it is, how many of those will be able to afford private health care?  They will all come through the public door, which will need to be widened and prepared for that.  We have suggested 2030 because we do not believe it can be done in a year or two years.  Equally it cannot be limited by the electoral cycle or politics.</p><p> Where do I start on health capacity?  Let me just provide the committee with some short statistics.</p></speech>

In September 2016 that number had risen to 7,551.  That requires immediate attention.  That is not 50 beds for every hospital in the country.  That is a targeted immediate capital investment programme in the nine most challenged hospitals.  That must be an immediate measure, not just because we say it or it is politically expedient, but because patients need it.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their honesty and frankness.  Obviously morale within the system is at an all-time low.  Mr. Doran mentioned that if a nurse has the competence to write a prescription, it should speed things up, so that is covered.  I would note as a red flag issue the 5% increase in the admissions of the elderly, which will continue.  Should this be a massive issue of importance for Government and not just this committee?  If hospitals are clogged up, other patients will be pushed behind.</p> <p>  On mental health and the issues with schoolteachers, how should that be addressed?  Would there be contractual issues with that?  I view this from the point of view of nipping things at the bud.  As Mr. Doran hit on the existing contracts, the big bang theory is squeezed into a kind of small bang theory.</p> <p>  On accountability, leadership and confidence, if there was one thing that we could implement tomorrow, what would that be?</p></speech>

It is the first time I ever said this and I do a lot of committee work but I do not think there was anything I disagreed with.  In this Oireachtas there are two health committees, the normal health committee chaired by Deputy Harty and this committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Shortall.  This is a once in a generation, possibly once in a lifetime, opportunity to finally sort out the health service.  Ultimately it is an ideological debate.</p><p>The report we will produce, on which we have a timeline, will be fairly high level.  It may have some indications with regard to a plan, which I will deal with, but it will be fairly high level.  I hope I am not speaking out of turn but I believe most of us will come to a consensus in terms of what we will decide about a single tier system where services are free at the point of delivery but we will have to deal with the questions, challenges and pressures that will arise in terms of how we will fund that and the consequences of saying what was just said about private health insurance, for instance.  That is an issue on which we will have to bring the public with us, and the witnesses in terms of supporting it, because as I said in the D&aacute;il last week, if we are ever to sort out the health service, morally, we cannot allow what is happening to continue where an elderly woman can go into a public emergency department and wait on a trolley for two or three days to be admitted when 100 yd. down the road an executive of a company can go into a private version of the same hospital on the one campus and be treated immediately.  That is just not equitable in 2016.</p><p> With regard to how we do this, my colleague spoke about the big bang approach.  I agree with Mr. Doran that we cannot take a big bang approach.  We have a mandate for ten years but we should not get too stuck in that.  Over the coming years we will have to phase in the changes with regard to this ideological thought in terms of how we will turn that around, phase out the contracts Mr. Doran spoke about, ensure there is adequate funding and prioritise the different areas.  I can see an avalanche coming towards us with regard to care of the elderly.  Given that soliloquy, my first question is on the process we will go through in producing a report on the future of health care over the next ten or 15 years.  In terms of stopping that ship, turning it around and facing it in the right direction, what areas do the witnesses believe we should prioritise across the health service, given that we will have written a report for which I hope there will be political support on the basis of what I just said.  Which areas do we prioritise, in what order and to what timeline?  It is a difficult question but I would appreciate an answer to it.</p><p> Second, I presume that turning around primary care is an absolute priority given the costs associated with treating elderly people in acute care versus treating them in their homes, etc.  How quickly could we have the capacity, working with the unions' members, to turn that around and create a primary care service across the country that is consistent throughout all its services?  We know what we want but if that was a priority, in what timeframe could we turn that around?</p><p> I have two final questions.  First, we spoke about restructuring fatigue, seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations, etc.  That does not make sense to me.  I had a discussion in Clonmel recently with one of the authors and I told him it did not make sense to me.  There is restructuring fatigue.  How can we bite through that, so to speak?  It is not just about this committee producing a report stating that we need this structure because I am not sure anyone would believe that.  How can we change the discourse on that to ensure we bring people with us on it?  There will be organisational change but it should not be just a top-down approach.</p><p> I would like a brief answer to my final question, which concerns the witnesses' members.  We had a presentation some weeks ago on the use of technology to facilitate the witnesses' members with regard to their work.  How bad is that?  From what I see, it is fairly bad.  With regard to facilitating the work the witnesses' members have to do on the ground, all of us are aware of the issues to do with staffing but we also know that those members are not being facilitated through archaic systems that are in place.</p></speech>

As they are aware, the purpose of this committee is to devise a single tier health service based on need rather than the ability to pay.  I want to cover two areas, namely, privatisation and work practices.  Mention was made earlier to frail elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions being consumers of the health budget.  Nursing homes with a large number of frail elderly patients are not resourced to care for elderly patients who develop a deterioration in their illness.  Consequently, they end up in casualty departments.  In the same way, community services are poorly resourced in terms of home care packages and services, resulting in frail elderly people ending up unnecessarily in casualty departments.  Is the privatisation of elderly care, both residential and community, going in the wrong direction?  That is the way we are going; we are privatising it.  Does that need to be reversed?</p> <p>  With regard to work practices, are there demarcation barriers within the health service unions which are inhibiting change?  Is there room for reform and more flexibility in that regard?</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that Deputy Kelleher had to excuse himself because I want to touch on private sector involvement.  It is not an ideological position.  Much of what is happening with regard to privatisation is reactionary because we could not recruit people in the various skill sets and because there was a head count moratorium.  For instance, the issue of agency staff is reactionary.  This year, over &euro;330 million will be spent by the Health Service Executive on agency staff including nursing professionals, medical professionals and, as mentioned earlier, non-medical personnel.  That is reactionary; it is not value for money.</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to the ambulance service.  An element of the private sector is taking advantage of the chaos the national health service has to respond to in order to provide services while somebody else is keeping an eye on the books and saying we did not have to recruit those people to provide that service.</p> <p>  Deputy Harty asked about demarcation and so forth.  We have people in the community who want to do more.  For instance, he referred to home care packages.  We have people providing home help services.  That is sometimes described in the community as a cottage industry.  It is not.  We have personnel who are described as non-medical people providing key services and supporting their professional colleagues, and our members want to be placed in a position where they can do more.</p> <p>  The other area is health care assistants.  The health care assistant groups and the multi-task attendant groups want to be allowed to do more and develop their role in support of the nursing professionals, doctors and other allied health professional groups.  Those are the key issues we believe we can address.</p> <p>  Deputy Buckley asked about the one action we can take now.  Everyone in this room understands there is a massive issue about the care of the elderly.  It is as if we are drifting from crisis to crisis in that regard.  Obviously, value for money for the taxpayer does not mean the services are surrendered to other groups that say they can provide services, which they cannot provide.  There has to be a clear understanding that the public health service must be the lead care provider.  Following that, if there is ancillary work or additional work, a discussion can take place on where that fits in because at present it is reactionary.</p> <p>  We need to stop the reactionary issues with regard to deployment, recruitment and retention of staff.  That can be done.  In terms of the &euro;330 million bill for agency staff, that can be stopped by immediately adopting a plan to invest in the training of not just professional staff but also the group the Deputy referred to as non-medical staff.</p><p>At present, the HSE is paying for almost 900 whole-time equivalents in the health care assistant grade, which amounts to between &euro;60 million and &euro;65 million.  That is not good value for money or a good investment.  Members of the ambulance service have had to threaten industrial action in recent times for the HSE and the Department of Health to invest in their service.  In other words, investment is required over the incremental period of the next three to five years to bring it to a level where it can respond to the growing needs of communities.</p><p> The focus must be on investment in the care of the elderly and in care in the community, as well as in those services and people who support that.  The general secretary, Ms Patricia King, has made it quite clear that there is no silver bullet for this stuff.  If a ten-year plan is adopted by the Oireachtas it must include the understanding that every cent available from the public purse must be invested in a public health service that can deliver over that period.  Short-term solutions will not work for us.  That has been proven by our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  All the short-term, reactionary responses to long-term issues end up failing, costing more money in terms of value for money and losing staff.  The National Health Service, NHS, in the UK is still short of nursing professionals.  It continues to come to this country to try to recruit nursing and other medical professionals.</p></speech>

The questions are linked to a chain of answers.  I will add a point on one of the questions Deputy Kelleher raised earlier and with regard to what Mr. Liam Doran said about nurse and patient ratios.  We agree with all of that but there is a populist view that our health service is bloated with managers, administrators and the like.  I have the census with me.  If we are discussing staffing levels we should not take the easy default position that it is bloated with managers.  Managers currently account for 1.33% of the entire staff.  That is in line with the NHS model, according to the Minister's research.  The total percentage of administrators, right down to the people who compile charts for doctors and consultants, is approximately 15%.  If we are going to get into a debate about beefing up staff numbers, I wish to make it clear that it is not just a question of us having too many managers and administrators.</p> <p>  However, that leads to a chain of thought about managers.  Deputy Kelly mentioned the nine CHO areas and the seven hospital groups, which does not make sense to many of us.  These managers must manage this.  One talks about restructuring fatigue.  That is at the heart of it because they are being asked to manage something that, quite frankly, many people do not believe in.  They must try to introduce these things on a daily operational basis when there is a complete lack of buy-in from people because they do not know what is coming next.  That leads to Deputy Harty's question about demarcations.  Demarcations are probably imposed by the system.  The cross-referral mentioned by Liam Doran is exactly what I am discussing.  Whether it is in nine CHOs, five community areas or whatever, if we could move to community care where there is cross-referral between highly-qualified professionals, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists or public health nurses, that would remove much of the demarcation.  Our people are up for that challenge.  The difficulty is the lack of a vision presented to them and the lack of ability to manage that, because nobody is clear about what the vision is.  It is causing a slow-down in the system.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Harty, yes we have a very blunt view that what has happened in recent years regarding the care of the older person services is doomed to failure.  The privatisation, the reliance on private nursing homes, the direct subvention to them and so forth will never be able to meet the growing demands that are placed on them.  The sub-text of that is that the staffing levels in those nursing homes are not necessarily the best because one is managing, looking for profit and other issues come into it.  The issue as well is that we must stop everybody being moved to the accident and emergency department the moment they have a temperature, respiration problem or the like.  We must staff the units so they are capable of meeting those challenges, which are predictable challenges in many ways.  They are very acute for the individual enduring them but they are predictable to the health professionals who know the area.  That is the reason congress is calling for a complete reversal in that area to ensure there is a care of the older person service, whether it is in the home, a long-term facility, a transitional care facility or a rehabilitation facility, that is directly subvented and properly staffed, so the person is kept out of the acute hospital if at all possible.  There is also the issue of how we will manage the quantum.  It is anticipated that there will be 1.7 million people over the age of 65 years by 2045 in this country.  Think about that.  There are only 650,000 now.  We have that huge statistic coming towards us.  Privatisation of the older person service will not work in Ireland.  It did not work in other jurisdictions.  We must come back up that road.</p> <p>  Mr. Eamonn Donnelly mentioned work practices.  There is no point in us appearing before this committee and saying that everybody else must change but we need not.  Health professionals must change.  We must have different models of care and we must liberate and complement one other.  We do not, and cannot, survive on a medical model of care for our public health service.  It must be one that is originated by the right person in the right place empowered to do it.  That is the reason we are calling for regulation and independent inspection, so one can cross-check all of those things happening all of the time.  Nobody has a divine right to walk away from public scrutiny when it comes to health.  That is the reason we include regulation and inspection.</p> <p>  What is the one thing we could do now?  Mr. Paul Bell touched on that.  What we must do now is staff our health service properly to meet the demands being placed upon it.  For example, we train 100 public health nurses per year.  In the first six months of this year there were 41 fewer public health nurses in the public health service than there were in the service at the beginning of the year, because we cannot replace them.  We require massive investment in a training programme for 200 public health nurses per year, at a minimum, and we must increase staff.  Mr. Paul Bell is correct about health care assistants and home help personnel.  It is not all about high-level consultants, multi-qualified nurses and so forth.  It is about the whole team situation and one cannot achieve that, with respect, by paying the minimum wage to people providing home care.  In many areas of this country, home care cannot be provided, even though there is the money, because the service cannot get the staff.  The end product is that Mr. or Mrs. Murphy sooner or later ends up back in the emergency department because they could not get the support.  The minimum wage will not cut it.  The one thing we could do is invest in the one thing every health service needs - motivated staff.  We are depleted in that regard at present.</p></speech>

Before putting them, it has been interesting to listen to the witnesses.  I note the points that have been strongly made about elder care.  My first question is about morale.  I am picking up different threads from what has been said.  Mr. Liam Doran mentioned the issue of low pay.  Another issue mentioned by Mr. Eamonn Donnelly is the lack of buy-in when people do not know what is coming next.  Restructuring fatigue and the staffing issue were also mentioned.  Can the witnesses pull that together a little?  The morale issue arises repeatedly among health service workers.  Is it due to staffing levels, pay and confusion about the direction being taken?  What is the balance between them and are there other factors?  Perhaps the witnesses could put the jigsaw together in that regard with their knowledge and expertise.</p> <p>  My second point relates to a couple of interesting statements in the INMO document.</p><p>This relates to an interesting issue that has not been raised here previously.  The document states that integrated care requires a simplified organisational structure which clearly indicates responsibility for service delivery and that this can only be done by devolving responsibility, for the provision of all care, to the front line.  It also refers to a fully integrated service, within a flat management structure, with responsibility, with autonomy, devolved to clinical front line managers who can access all services for the patient-client.  The issue posed here is that of management and control in the day-to-day delivery of the health service.  Some of the points in that submission remind me of what we use to see in documentation in the 1970s about workers' control of services and industry and so on, but leaving the ideological aspect of it to one side, in a practical pragmatic sense, can the witnesses give us a flavour of how they think devolving control and responsibility down to the grassroots, to those at the front line of the health service, would make it better?  Could they give me some examples of that?  I would be interested to hear their comments on that.</p><p> I heard the points that were made about a one-tier health service not being based on an ability to pay.  The big question is how do we get from A to B.  I listened to the points made about where the taxpayers' money goes and where it does not go and good points were made.  I presume, but I would like it clarified, that the witnesses would support the idea of a health service which, effectively, would be free at the point of use, something like the NHS in Britain.  That is not fully spelled out but it is strongly implicit in the document.  I would like the witnesses to clarify that this is the position.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  On the issue of agency work and privatisation of health care in that sense, a considerable level of home care help has been handed out to agency workers.  The HSE pays &euro;33 or &euro;34 per hour for this work but the staff providing that care often get barely over the minimum wage.  There seems to be a serious level of inefficiency there and the public are not getting bang for their buck when we know the amount that is being paid by the HSE and the amount that the workers are being paid.  Is that practice purely a reaction to meeting the demand for the service or is there an ideology in the HSE to drive on privatisation, with work in this area being an example of that?  Tied into that is the issue of monitoring, we are seeing an increasing drive towards decongregation.  Ms Patricia King mentioned that we are five or six years behind what is happening in the UK and I would be interested to read about mental health provision in the UK.  In some cases, they have gone too far in terms of pushing people back into the community and we are seeing situations here where facilities are being run down in places like Kerry and so forth.  The Health Information and Quality Authority monitors what happens in institutions, as does the Mental Health Commission, but there seems to be very little monitoring of what happens in the community.  Many agency staff are good workers but some people have told me that some of the people who have been hired to care for people in their homes are not qualified.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p> <p>  Any change proposed by this committee would require buy-in from the trade unions and from the staff but even sometimes when that happens those in senior management leave it at that and think their job is done.  To bring staff on board with change management and change implementation, how would the witnesses get the staff, who we know are fatigued as are management based on reports we have heard, to once again take another leap of faith and go along the change proposed?  Other countries have a strong collaboration between staff and management and I would welcome the witnesses' comments on that.</p> <p>  We do not want this committee to simply produce another report that will gather dust.  Do the witnesses believe that the report that will emerge from our deliberations should be underpinned with legislation?  We are heading towards another period of instability in terms of future governments, with more coalitions.  If it will take ten to 15 years to implement the report produced by this committee, we need not only a clear plan but to know that it will be implemented.  Do the witnesses support the report that will be produced by this committee being underpinned by legislation?  They would probably want to see what is in the report first but I would like their comments on that.</p> <p>  On a governance ethical model, do the witnesses consider that there should there be an annual assessment of staff and management in terms of capability or their ability to continue doing their job, or in terms of their professional development, as opposed to the current system where the competence of a member of staff or management tends to be only assessed when something goes wrong?</p></speech>

I have spoken to hospital managers and I am aware that they are paying way over the top for agency staff and are not allowed recruit staff.  I do not understand the thinking there.  What am I missing there if the cost to the HSE of taking on agency staff is three times the cost of recruiting staff and why would it not recruit staff?  The witnesses might shed some light on that for me.</p> <p>  I was reading through the documentation last night and since the start of this process I have been trying to grapple with the structure around the seven hospital groups and the nine community health organisations.  Is that a working structure?  One line of the documentation I highlighted states that congress broadly welcomes the recent establishment of the seven hospital groups and it goes on to say that it is something that could work but reservations are expressed in some of the individual presentations, and Mr. Eamonn Donnelly also expressed reservations.  I do not think there is an ideal scenario but should we set up a structure, go with it and modify it to fix it as we go along because we are not going to set up something right in the first place as it is too difficult a task?  I would like hear the witnesses' opinions on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#J00600"><p>I would like to add to that point.  This is an issue with which we as a committee are grappling.  We very much recognise the fact that there is change fatigue across the system and yet an issue that is raised here on a weekly basis is how do we have an integrated system when we have seven hospital groups and nine community health organisations, CHOs, and they are not aligned.  There is not time to discuss that here.  I do not know to what extent congress has considered the organisational structures.  I know Mr. Liam Doran said in his introductory statement that we needed a simplified, integrated and readily understood organisational structure.  We certainly do not have that at the moment.  Have the witnesses given much thought to organisational administrative structures, and, if not, they might come back to us on that point because it is an issue that has come up time and again.  We are very slow to consider recommending yet another change but at the same time we cannot get our heads around the fact of how one could possibly have an integrated system with the level of disintegration between acute hospitals and community organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#J00700"><p>If we start from the back end, our population is only 4.75 million.  The reason congress welcomes the hospital groups in the context of what was there before is that we have some level of cohesion and reduction in duplication.  Prior to that, we had years where we had hospitals all competing for lung and liver transplants and so on.  Therefore, the hospital groups is a step in terms of co-ordination and we will certainly come back on this issue.  Let me be quite clear on this, there is no rhyme or reason to having seven hospital groups, nine CHOs, seven mental health areas and numerous section 39 facilities, all doing excellent work in their own way.  We are not knocking the work but the management of that, as Mr. Eamon Donnelly said, leaves it impossible for people.  On top of all that, we have a centralised HSE.  To link that back to this being about devolving power, how does one run a health service where the local manager of a hospital is not empowered to fill posts that fall vacant within a hospital's stated staffing complement?</p><p>They have to go up through three rungs of a ladder to live within pay and budget control and make a business case to people they never see who are up to 100 miles away.</p><p> I no longer want to hear the phrase "business case" in terms of running a health service.  A manager of a local hospital or health service must make a business case to fill a post that has fallen vacant due to a person retiring, leaving or emigrating and wait six months for the position to be filled.  That is why these posts fall on to the agency spend.  What happens then is they cannot do it through the permanent pay structure yet they determine, as the lead clinician, that they need a staff member because otherwise patient care is compromised.  The easy opt-out clause is to go to King and Doran Agency Limited and get the staff.  A person could be in place for months, while waiting for the business case, at a cost of 5% on the shift premium and 21% VAT on the health service.  That is how one ends up with an explosion in costs.  </p><p> The other reason one ends up with an explosion of this practice is because the pay and conditions are unattractive, particularly with respect to our medical colleagues.  They can choose to work via the agency model knowing that the hospital has to take them because they have no other way of filling the senior clinical decision-making gap.  The medical agency spend has increased significantly in recent years because, in fairness to our medical union colleagues, they would say the pay and conditions are uncompetitive and so on.  When we talk about devolving we are referring to those people who are responsible for the care.  They must be empowered to maintain a staffing profile and be accountable for that expenditure.  Everyone has to be accountable when spending taxpayers' money.  At the moment, one has to be accountable but one has no autonomy to do it right and one is still accountable for the misadventures.</p><p> In terms of single tiered freedom, the health service is free at the point of use and no hidden charges have crept in.  In terms of agency care, mental health and an increased drive towards congregated settings, the Deputy is right that it has become fashionable to talk about decongregated settings and forgetting totally about the needs of the person concerned, whether they have an intellectual or mental disability, to survive in a more normal community setting.  Maybe he or she will blossom, be more productive and involved in the community if he or she has a more protected environment.  It is not that one goes from all residential to all community because there is that blend in the middle.  The current Kerry situation is an example of that.  No-one knows better than the relatives of the person as to how he or she blossoms.  When the system dictates to the family what it thinks is right and the family's view is disregarded then we no longer have a public health service.  </p><p> The final query was about hospital groups and rights.  The only thing I would say, in deference to my colleagues, about what happens to the report is we would have a view that one has a right to a public health service.  When one leaves it to discretion that is not enshrined.  We had this with disability services.  No-one wanted to pass legislation that gave a person a right to a service but one has the right to seek access to a health service.</p><p> In terms of a public health service, free at the point of use, universal and single tiered, yes if that can be brought forward and underpinned by legislation then I believe it would serve the community and the economy.</p></speech>

We also welcome the fact the committee has been set up.  Issues were raised by various Deputies such as Deputies Kelly and Barry, but in terms of the most recent questions, if policymakers can grapple with and identify some of the big ticket issues, like the funding model and how the system works with fluidity, then one will start on the road to building the morale of the people who work on the ground.  They will then see that the big ticket issues, that they know are unworkable and cause all of the dysfunctionality in the system, are from a policy point of view being taken on board and a group of policymakers trying to tackle them.

The only way of underpinning and addressing the issue for groups that were referred to as non-medical is for the service to be regulated.  Those who provide the service should be introduced to a system of registration and meet specified obligations.  The group would include health care assistant groups as well.  In order for them to provide the service be it in a community or institutional setting one would require a certain level of qualifications.  The service provider or individual must also be obliged to continually improve, train and be educated to meet that standard.  The matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, the IMO is the representative body and trade union for the medical profession, representing all categories of doctors, including non-consultant hospital doctors, community health doctors, public health doctors, general practitioners and consultants.  The experiences of the medical profession in Ireland have informed our submission to the committee.  The development of a caring and effective health service is core to the mission of the IMO.<br/><br/>The written submission made by our organisation to the committee provides recommendations on a wide range of health service activities.  However, I would like to focus the opening statement that Dr. McGarry and I are making on central aspects of the future of Irish health care, namely, capacity, staffing and the role of general practice.  These are system-wide issues that, unless appropriately resolved, will inhibit development in other areas of the health service.<br/><br/>The media coverage of Irish health care frequently centres on hospital care, particularly emergency department overcrowding.  As an emergency medicine consultant, I have been witness to the very real impact on patient care that cuts in health service funding have had.  Our ability to provide high-quality care to patients in a timely manner is truly compromised in Ireland, as manifested by admitted patients spending in excess of 12 hours in emergency departments following a decision that admission is necessary and the increasing waiting lists for planned care delivery.<br/><br/>One of the most significant reductions made within the health service was to bed capacity.  The effect of this is evident in every acute hospital in the country on a daily basis.  There are in the region of 12,800 acute beds within the hospital system, 800 fewer than in 2007.  Of these, 10,800 are inpatient beds, 1,300 fewer than in 2007.  Contrast those 10,800 inpatient beds with the 14,700 inpatient beds which, in 2003, the Department of Health said we would need by 2011, or the approximately 14,600 inpatient beds we would have if we adopted the west European average.  To put it bluntly, acute beds currently available within the acute hospital system are too few to provide care to patients in a safe manner.  Unless urgent steps are taken to remedy this shortfall, many will continue to experience significant delays and preventable deaths will continue to happen.<br/><br/>We have heard repeated promises of a bed capacity review but no action appears to have been taken.  Such a review is needed to determine precisely how many and what types of beds should be placed within the acute hospital system to provide adequate capacity on a medium to long-term basis.  In the short-term, however, inpatient beds must be restored to the system at a faster rate than is currently the case.<br/><br/>Deficits in medical staffing restrict patient access to care and the quality of that care.  The 2003 report by the national task force on medical staffing - when applied to our current population - sets out a requirement for 4,400 consultants in the health service.  Today, however, there are just over 2,700, and as a result we have long-waiting lists for outpatients and procedures across virtually all medical specialties.<br/><br/>Comprehensive manpower planning must be undertaken to develop a consultant-delivered health service.  At present, however, we are being forced to cope with a grossly understaffed hospital system where the patient experience of care is not as their doctors would wish.  Consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors, the next generation of consultants, are being pressed into excessive levels of service provision which jeopardises patient care through the generation of unacceptable clinical workloads.  It is little wonder that few doctors see working in Ireland as an attractive choice or one compatible with their professional development.  Accordingly, we have one of the lowest numbers of practising doctors <i>per capita</i>in the EU, at just 2.8 per 1,000 of population, compared to an EU average of 3.4.<br/><br/>As a direct result of a failure to honour consultant and trainee contracts, public sector cuts and the further catastrophic 30% reduction in salary to all new consultants imposed in 2012, there are in excess of 250 unfilled consultant posts in Ireland, with one quarter of advertised consultant posts receiving no applicants.  This does not augur well for the future of hospital care in Ireland.  Irish-trained doctors continue to leave the country in significant numbers.  Figures gathered by the OECD reveal that Ireland has the highest reliance on foreign-trained doctors of any country in the EU.  Our research has found that just 40% of Ireland's medical graduates plan to practise here, while studies by the Medical Council demonstrate that health service understaffing in Ireland is the leading reason why our doctors are leaving to practise abroad.  Unless the issues of adequate acute hospital capacity and medical staffing are satisfactorily resolved, we will struggle to fill medical posts in our health service.<br/><br/>Inadequate resourcing of hospitals in Ireland has compromised patient care and, as a result, patients, and the staff caring for them, are suffering.  There are also significant challenges for our colleagues in general practice, a subject which Dr. McGarry will now address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#M00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for affording us the opportunity to speak to the committee today.</p> <p>  Despite its role at the heart of medical care and its presence in communities throughout Ireland, general practice is often neglected when it comes to health service planning.  I work as a GP in Longford and, from first-hand experience, I can tell the committee that the under-resourcing of general practice in Ireland is one of the fundamental causes of its current inability to adequately meet patient demand.  Population growth, shifts in population age distribution and increasing multi-morbidity in patients places greater pressures on general practice, while an ageing GP workforce and high-levels of GP emigration restrict the ability of general practice to cope with this increased workload.</p> <p>  In ten years' time, Ireland will likely have 60% more patients aged 65 years or older than is the case today - an increase of 20,000 in such patients every year for the next ten years.  However, with 34% of GPs currently over 55 years of age and 17% of our newly qualified GPs working abroad, significant investment will be needed to meet future health care demands in general practice.  The HSE has estimated that by 2025 an additional 1,380 GPs above projected levels may be required to maintain existing service provision, while an additional 2,055 may be required to provide universal care in general practice.</p> <p>  While attaining these increases in medical manpower may appear to be a daunting challenge, it is one that can be met.  The solution can include: the agreement of a new fit-for-purpose contract for GPs that properly resources the work of doctors in communities; investment in evidence-based chronic disease management programmes; allowances for the employment of practice staff; supports that address the specific needs of practices and patients in rural and deprived areas; incentives for GPs to develop their practices; and swift access to diagnostic equipment for patients in general practice.  All of this will result in the retention of newly-qualified and existing GPs, and a return of many who have left to practise overseas.  This will create an environment where GPs want to work in the service.</p> <p>  I also want to briefly address some remarks that have been made in other meetings of the committee about the independent contractor model versus salaried GPs, and the role of other health professionals in general practice.  On the first point, while there may be some merit in examining the role salaried GPs could play in some circumstances, the independent contractor model that currently exists in Ireland and most other developed health care systems broadly remains superior to other models in terms of its patient focus and value-for-money.  GPs invest significantly in their practices and, once established, tend to remain rooted in their communities.  This provides for a strong continuity of care experienced by patients and the lasting doctor-patient relationship, where a patient typically receives care from his or her specific GP, is associated with lower patient mortality and superior patient health outcomes.</p> <p>  This continuity of care may be threatened where GPs are salaried and, therefore, perhaps less rooted in their communities.  The contractor model is to be distinguished from the corporate model, in which private firms invest in community health care for the purpose of extracting profit from the provision of services to patients.  Such commercially-driven enterprises do not support the continuity of care in general practice that benefits patient welfare.</p> <p>  The role of other health professionals in the delivery of care is relevant to all categories of doctors.  It must be borne in mind that different health professionals are educated and trained to perform different tasks.  While there is scope for limited transfer in some areas of the health service, the shifting of significant aspects of doctors' work to the remit of other health professionals carries some negative consequences.  In general practice, for example, non-physician health professionals often spend twice as long on consultations as GPs and use more health resources generally as a result of consultations.</p><p>I point out this research only to demonstrate the reductions in efficiency and cost increases that occur when health professionals move into areas for which they are not trained and thus unsuited.  All health professionals' education and training is highly specialised and tailored to the performance of specific tasks.  We are not interchangeable.  We must focus on ensuring the employment of sufficient numbers of health professionals of all types to guarantee the best patient outcomes.</p><p> As Dr. Gilligan already mentioned, our statement focuses on capacity, staffing and the role of general practice.  This is not to diminish the other aspects of our submission.  For example, proper provision must be put in place for long-term and rehabilitative care.  On "Morning Ireland" earlier, Professor Joseph Harbison highlighted this regarding rehabilitation beds for stroke patients.  A new mental health strategy that puts mental health on a par with physical health and a detailed plan for its implementation must be put in place.  A resourced and organised community health service and public health service must be provided, including expansion of public health capacity through a new fit for purpose contract.  Appropriately developed capacity, staffing, and general practice are the foundations on which all other aspects of the health service are built, which is why we have placed so much importance on improving health care in these central areas.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  Dr. Gilligan, Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd and I will be happy to address any questions they may wish to pose.</p></speech>

In it, they make reference to staffing levels, which have decreased by 12.9% since 2007, and the number of acute hospital beds, which has fallen by 13%.  Hospitals operate at an average of 92.6% capacity, which is well above the 85% capacity rate.  Do the witnesses agree with hospital consultants on the need for more beds in acute hospitals?  The usual response to such a suggestion is that medical science will obviate the need for more hospital beds and community care.  I come from the viewpoint that, to date, no programme we have introduced has reduced the number of bed occupancy rates, and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on this because it would form a very important part of our plan over the next ten years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#N00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  I am very much of the opinion we will have to move to salaried GP contracts.  I read the opening statement and what the witnesses have said on this.  There are a number of reasons for the move.  We have gaps throughout the country.  I have read what the witnesses stated on salaried GPs and independent contractors versus the corporate model.  I am with them with regard to the corporate model so we can leave that aside.  On the difference between salaried GPs and independent contractors - and I get the witnesses' point on investment in the community - will they indicate, in great detail, why they believe an independent contractor model would provide better value for money and why the services would be better than in a situation where GPs would be salaried.  Do the witnesses accept that in some circumstances there will be a mixed model between salaried GPs and independent contractors because, simply put, in some parts of the country we will not have doctors otherwise?  Do they think it is appropriate that we have salaried GPs throughout the country?  How would we distinguish between how they would be paid and their facilities?  Would there be certain conditioning based on the fact that some doctors would have to be put into rural areas where gaps exist?</p><p>The next issue relates to consultants, particularly those working in acute services in our hospitals.  I am of the opinion that we will again be obliged to change our mode of action in this area and to directly employ consultants to work exclusively in the hospitals and exclusively for the public health service.  We will have to grasp this nettle.  We have issues in a range of specialties and I have no doubt - I accept the witnesses' point in this regard - that we do not have enough consultants in many disciplines.  If, however, we are to have a ten-year plan for the health service we will have to pay consultants adequately to fill these gaps.  Taking this for granted, would it be best to phase in, over a period, salaried consultants who would be paid by the taxpayer and who would work exclusively in the public health service?  We will need this to ensure that we have a single-tier health service, which is for what the committee is aiming.</p><p>There is a feeling among many members of the public, and certainly public representatives, that there is not just a two-tier system regarding the health service, there is also such a system with regard to how certain consultants operate <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>public and private patients.I have had much experience of that to which I refer to the point where I think that what is happening is, quite frankly, disgusting and unacceptable.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly dealt with many issues and I will not rehearse what he said.  The submission refers to the appointment of a national independent body to determine mental health catchment areas.  This makes a great deal of sense because there are areas in the country with high rates of mental health issues and, unfortunately, suicide.  Would such a body be neutral - that is, it would not come under the remit of HSE - and would it report on matters in a very frank manner?  Would it work with coroners to get proper details on this issue?  In the context of the many recommendations in the report, what arises time and again is the need to ring-fence funding.  Funding is a major issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peadar Gilligan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016102600002#N00800"><p>As to the first question from Deputy Naughton, absolutely staffing levels are a huge issue for us, and the loss of acute hospital capacity, specifically in-patient beds in the acute capacity, has been a huge issue.  We certainly have seen a worsening of crowding situations and the further prolonging of waiting lists in the context of the loss of capacity.  To me, if one were to think in terms of setting up a study to assess the impact of reducing capacity and staffing in the health service, we have done it and we know that it impacts directly on patient care.  It creates delays in emergency departments for patients requiring hospital beds.  It creates elongation of waiting lists.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Naughton's specific question, we absolutely agree that there is a requirement for an increase in acute hospital bed capacity.  This needs to be informed by a bed review looking at our population demographic and the potential changes in this over the next ten years.  We know that as we are currently we are not able to service the health care needs of our population who require hospitalisation in a timely and safe manner.  We absolutely must address capacity.  I thank the Deputy for the question.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Kelly's questions, I will leave the salaried GP component to Dr. McGarry if I may.  On the issue of consultants and public-only salaries, this was addressed in the 2008 contract.  Sadly, it is that group of consultants who work only in the public hospital system who have been most affected by the cuts under the public sector agreements and by the 30% cut that was imposed.  We are now faced with a situation whereby more than 250 consultant posts have been left vacant.  We have more resignations from consultant positions than ever before in the history of the State.  This is largely because doctors feel they are not being adequately resourced in the delivery of services.  They do not feel they that the necessary staff are being made available to them and surgeons are of the view that they do not have the necessary time in theatre.</p><p>While it was identified within the 2008 contract that there was a role for an entire commitment to the public system, that part has suffered most as a result of public sector cuts.  We must also be cognisant of the fact that there is a 2008 contract for consultants that has never been honoured by the employer.  That has had a dramatic impact on recruitment and retention.  A 30% pay cut to all new consultants had the most devastating effect on our ability to recruit and retain because suddenly we were saying to doctors we wanted them to take on all the responsibilities of being consultants, and they are considerable, to delineate them in the form of a contract but we would not honour that contract when it came to the terms and conditions they could expect, and all new entrants would be paid 30% less.  It makes no sense at all and until it is addressed and fully reversed, we will not be able to recruit and retain consultants within the Irish health system to provide the level of care that we know we can and want to provide.</p><p> In response to the question on the requirement for independence of a commission examining our mental health services, it is very important to have that independence because there are so many things that need to be examined and there is a significant requirement for the resources in that area.  Suicide is a huge problem for our population and has devastating consequences for the families and friends of the individuals who commit suicide.  We need to be in a position to prevent that to the greatest extent possible.  Our current system is under-resourced to allow that happen.</p></speech>

In isolated areas such as the islands, in certain rural areas and areas where it is difficult to attract doctors, a salary model would work, but the independent contractor model has been shown to work much better in all developed health care systems throughout the developed world.  Putting a salaried general practitioner in the midst of a mixed model possibly undermines the whole structure.  If there is a salaried GP whose costs are all taken up by the State and the cost base is very different from that of the surrounding GPs, it undermines the viability of those GPs on the ring.  That ring would have to extend further.  If it could be done in one fell swoop, it possibly would work, but if it starts in isolation it has a ripple effect which could undermine existing practices.  There could be unforeseen consequences.</p></speech>

Over recent weeks we have been discussing a change of work practice because if we are to change our health service, we must change the health model.  I would like the witnesses' views on changing work practices.  The work practices for GPs and hospital medicine have been in place for 40 years and the health service has moved on but the practices remain the same.  There is huge room for changing work practices, and that feeds into integration between primary and secondary care where there is a big gap.  Should that integration be from the top down or the bottom up?  We have heard the Carlow-Kilkenny services talk about how they integrated care and the efficiencies that has brought about.</p> <p>  Recruiting GPs to single-handed practices, urban or rural, will be very difficult in the future and we will have to change the model.  In rural areas it may be a salaried position but in urban areas it will have to be the primary care centre model.  The witnesses might comment on those points.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of talk about primary care and the need to shift in that direction.  We heard evidence from colleagues of the witnesses that it is possible to manage 95% of chronic conditions in the community with the requisite supports and resources in place.  That would reduce the reliance on the acute hospital sector.  What would the witnesses' vision of a fully staffed functioning primary care service look like?</p><p>What would the employment relationship be between an independent contractor and all of the other staff that are necessary?  I understand that as an independent contractor, a GP would employ a practice nurse.  It is easy with a salaried GP because everybody works for the same employer but in a fully staffed proper primary care centre, how do the witnesses envisage the relationship between the Health Service Executive and the primary care centre?  How would it work with an independent contractor?</p><p> My second question is on skill mix.  For my sins, long before I was here, I was a member of the European working time directive implementation group.  We talked at length about skill mix.  Every single group in the room said they wanted to do more and they wanted do things differently.  There is clearly a blockage because that committee sat and met for a long time and we could not get over the skill mix issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views about where that blockage is, because there clearly is one, and how we might get around it and better manage and utilise the skills we have in the health service at the moment. </p></speech>

There are a number of issues.  We talk about primary care and primary care teams.  How much will GPs embrace working together?  Are they reluctant?  Let us be very clear, there was resistance by a lot of GPs to the initial move to roll out primary care teams across the country.  It was one of the factors that delayed the process.  In terms of working together in the primary care setting with a primary care team, is there still resistance from GPs to embracing that broader concept?  If there is, we have a huge difficulty because it will be the backbone of how we deliver primary care in the years ahead.</p> <p>  One challenge is retaining GPs in some areas, particularly those where there are lower socioeconomic groupings or financial deprivation, and in rural areas.  What are the witnesses' views on the issue of salaried GPs in view of the fact we are at times unable to recruit or retain them?  </p></speech>

The issue of consultants has been addressed before.  What comparable pay rate should we be looking at if the issue of remunerative packages is a problem in recruiting consultants?  We compete in the English-speaking world as opposed to the European model in terms of retaining or attracting back consultants.  What sort of pay rates do the witnesses recommend should be looked at to attract the number of consultants we require?</p></speech>

Primary care teams are a very effective way to deal with patients' problems.  The focus to date has been on primary care centres.  A primary care team involves the interaction between various health professionals but it does not have to be within the one building.  It is something that has been going on for years.  We interact with public health nurses and physiotherapists on a daily basis so the concept of interacting and working with primary care teams is nothing new.  It is perhaps more formalised in some way but it has been working very well for a long time.  Primary care meetings means perhaps setting aside two hours to go through the cases of individual patients.  In many cases it was felt that not an awful lot of productivity came out of it.  It was more of a box-ticking exercise than actually caring for the patient.  If I need to deal with a particular patient, I will liaise with the public health nurse, the physiotherapist or the OT and sort it out.  It is usually done through a phone call.  We do not have to be in the same room to do that nor do we have to be in the same building.  I do not think there is a reluctance to deal with primary care teams.  It has been going on for years and I do not see why that would change.</p></speech>

Two hours in a GP's day is an enormous amount of time.  We are snowed under with work.  To give a two-hour time allocation for what may turn out to be two patients is an enormous time resource which we can ill afford.  If we can deal with the issues on a much more efficient, one-to-one basis, which is how it has been done in the past, it should be looked at more and should continue.  I have no issue with dealing with primary care teams in that respect.</p></speech>

One of the leading reasons NCHDs, in particular, are leaving this country is because they feel they are carrying out too many non-core tasks.  That is listed as the third highest reason, after under-staffing and career progression issues.  There is a need for task transfer in certain areas and there is provision in the MacCraith report for that.  My understanding so far is that it is not really known the extent to which the transfer of tasks has actually occurred.  I accept the point there is scope for it to be looked at.  As Dr. McGarry suggested, there is a need for allied health care professionals within the primary care system but they have to be there in sufficient number.  Resources have to be provided in order for a GP to adequately refer to them.  It is only in that context that there can be a properly operating primary care system.</p></speech>

If we look at the Hanly report in 2003, it shows that if we were to have a consultant-delivered health service in this country, based on our current population and the ratio set out in that report, we would need approximately 4,400 consultants.

They feel there are limited career progression opportunities.  There are pay issues both with regard to earning capacity and getting paid for overtime and getting paid regularly.

These reasons are given by respondents who said they were either definitely or probably going to leave.  The percentage of respondents that agreed with those statements is very similar.  The top reason had 82% agreement and the fifth reason had 70% agreement.  There is a large number - one in five doctors - who feel they will either definitely leave or will probably leave.

There should be enough consultant posts within the system in a consultant-delivered health service to adequately address career progression issues within the NCHD cohort.  It requires an undertaking to say that we are committed to the idea of a consultant-delivered health service and are going to put it in place in the interests of patient welfare.  I do not know if Dr. McGarry has any thoughts on that.</p></speech>

It is very appropriate that the committee's emphasis is on primary care and general practice because that is where the vast majority of health care interactions happen in this country on a daily basis.  The issue of salaried GPs has been raised a number of times.  It strikes me that we might not quite realise the asset we have in the current model of general practice.  The independent practitioner is strategically responsible for his or her practice, manages his or her practice with the help of his or her practice manager, provides services, and knows his or her patients incredibly well.  Because GPs know their patients extremely well, they tend to have quite low referral rates to the hospital system.  Before we move away from a model that provides a terrific level of care, we must be conscious of the value that is already there.</p> <p>  Deputy Harty suggested there had not been a change in work practices in hospital medicine in Ireland in 40 years.  While I have not been in hospital practice for quite 40 years, albeit there are days when I feel it has been 80, I assure the Deputy that it has changed hugely.  To give one example, a patient with stroke coming to hospital ten years ago was managed largely in a palliative manner.  Now, within three and a half hours of onset of symptoms, we are in a position to potentially thrombolise and reverse the effects of that stroke.  Heart attack management has hugely changed.  Historically, it was aspirin and oxygen, but we now treat that patient with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction to the cath lab within 90 minutes of arrival at hospital.  We decrease the amount of heart tissue lost as a result of the heart attack.  Those are just two examples across many, many specialties.  As such, there has been absolute change in the hospital system and in the way we deliver care based on the evidence and what is best for patient care.  The frustration for us as hospital doctors is that we know what we can do, but do not have the resources in place to do it.  We do not have the staffing or capacity in place and sometimes we do not actually have the equipment we need to provide the care.</p> <p>  There was a specific question around the Carlow-Kilkenny model.  In essence, the acute medical admission model and an interface with primary care and general practice has a role, but the Carlow-Kilkenny situation is really quite different.  In the hospital where I work, if we had the number of nursing home beds available to us as per the demographic of our population that Kilkenny has, we would not have the problem we do with overcrowding.  At any given time, 20% of our bed base is occupied by patients who would be better cared for, having undergone and completed their acute care, in a nursing home setting.  However, we do not have those available to us.  As such, it is not a model that can be rolled out across the country.  The other thing to be cognisant of with regard to acute medical admission units is that unless they represent a real increase in capacity within the hospital and unless they represent an increase in staffing in the hospital to address the needs of the acutely admitted patient, they tend not to work.  That can be seen nationally where acute medical units are failing because they do not have the resources they need.  They do not have the bed base and do not have the ability to move the patient through the acute medical admission unit onto the ward because there is no ward available.</p> <p>  I was asked by Deputy Browne about allied health professionals and prescribing.  There is a doctor's role and doctors perform it extremely well.  There are also incredibly important roles in nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and the social work departments of our hospitals and it is incredibly important that we identify the importance of those roles and support the people in them.  We do not want and we do not need everyone doing the doctor's job.  In fact, some of the time, what we need is for doctors not to have to do jobs which are not appropriate to that role so that they can get on and do the doctoring role.  That is a model we need to look at but as things stand, we have prescribing rights for groups who go through a particular programme.  For example, we have advanced nurse practitioners with prescribing rights throughout the country.</p> <p>  On the retention of consultants and the pay rate Deputy Kelleher mentioned, the last time we had a negotiated contract in Ireland was 2008.  At that time, a pay structure was put in place, but it has never been honoured as I have identified for the committee.  We have a real problem with regard to that.  Not only has it not been honoured, it has been serially cut and then, dramatically, a further 30% cut was superimposed on the earlier cuts.  We have a situation where hospital doctors do not actually feel their contract will be honoured by the employer side and that must be addressed.  The Deputy is absolute right.  The current pay rate and the concept that someone takes on a consultant role and does the same job as the person beside him or her but gets paid significantly less because of the time of his or her appointment is a huge barrier to recruitment and retention in the system currently.</p></speech>

She rightly said that 95% of chronic disease management could and should take place in general practice.  There are models out there which have been in existence for the last ten or 12 years, notably Heartwatch and the diabetic midland care model, of which I am part myself.  Under those models, the vast majority of cardiac and diabetic patients are monitored on an ongoing basis through preventative care in general practice.  A lot of that work is carried out by the practice nurse overseen by general practitioners.  Certainly, there is a role.  The chronic disease management roll-out needs to be expanded beyond just the diabetes model.  The Heartwatch model has been shown to be hugely beneficial for patients by reducing risk factors by up to 50%.  That has to be expanded into a multi-morbidity model because there is movement away from single-disease models.  We need to look at a multi-morbidity model because the likelihood is that a diabetic patient also has some heart disease and other issues.  Rather than to have a single focus, the care model needs to be broadened out.  We have actually been doing work on that.  We have surveyed our practices to see what workload is involved and we have worked with Professor Brendan McElroy who has experience of the Scottish system's development of such a model.  There will be room in that respect for task transfer.</p></speech>

The problem we have, however, is that there are increasing numbers of areas where GPs are retiring and there is no prospect of getting a replacement.  I dealt with a situation in my home town of Ballyheigue a number of years ago where a GP emigrated and we had an extensive battle to get somebody to take on a very attractive GP practice.  On the Iveragh Peninsula in the Caherciveen-Waterville area, there were seven GPs a decade ago.  At Christmas this year, the GP in Waterville will retire because he is 72 and there will then be two GPs.  I have made requests and tabled parliamentary questions repeatedly and have received the standard reply that the practices are being advertised.  There is a real problem.</p><p>The new contract may solve it but I suspect there is a need for a HSE-led type of contract to facilitate places where an independent contractor just will not go.  I compliment the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on its presentation and 14 recommendations.  It is welcome to see the solution coming from those working in the area.  However, if we need 2,000 extra GPs, the current model, good and all as it may be where it works, will not suffice.  Every time the committee refers to GP's salary or some iteration of it, we do not get any buy-in.</p></speech>

In the specific areas described by Deputy John Brassil, the need for a salaried general practitioner needs to be recognised.  What I am referring to with the individual model is more across the board rather than in isolated problems.  There is significant scope for that type of arrangement and a contract will have to reflect that.</p> <p>  What will have to be taken into account is the significant cost to the State or whoever will be the paymaster for that type of arrangement.  If one takes on a salaried general practitioner, one will have to take on all that goes with it such as premises, employment of staff and IT.  It is not just a question of employing a salaried GP.  It will be necessary to employ other staff to go with that.  That could prove expensive if it was rolled out across the country.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the individual cases referred to where there is a particular problem.  Due cognisance has to be taken, however, as to what that is likely to cost the Exchequer and if it is affordable.  That is for the committee to determine.</p></speech>

Nearly all hospitals will have a patient representative office.  If there are incidents, or perceived incidents, they will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, oftentimes through that office.  An internal report will be developed and, if necessary, the patient and-or family will be met with to discuss the issues arising.</p> <p>  There is much of that work ongoing within the hospital system.  I agree with Professor Tom Keane that there are cases coming before the Medical Council which should not be and could be better dealt with locally, both from patients' perspective and the health care side.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the 40,000 members we represent, I wish to begin by thanking the committee for affording us this opportunity to meet and engage with them on the hugely important work of this committee and the potential it offers - supported by the political system - to reform our inequitable health system.  The INMO wishes to state that the work of this committee must be the first step in a radical, comprehensive, transformational and sustained process of change.  This must lead to a seamless, universal, single-tier health service, with access based solely on health need rather than ability to pay.  In putting forward this view we accept that moving from our current inequitable two-tier system will require, at a minimum, up to 15 years.  This change will also require political consensus stretching far beyond the normal electoral cycle and will necessitate future Governments and Opposition parties accepting the process of change complete with the funding and resource requirements necessary to deliver that change.</p> <p>  The INMO also supports the view that a single-tier service it must be funded to the tune of a minimum of 10% of gross domestic product, GDP and 12% to 14% during the transitional period.  In addition we must have a separate funding system and stream, spanning five to seven years, providing for the necessary capital investment to improve existing health infrastructure and develop new community based health facilities.  In delivering a quality-assured, accountable and responsive service, it will also be necessary that we have a simplified and lean organisational structure.  Funding and real accountability must be devolved to front-line managers - primarily nurses, midwives and health professional managers - who can respond to changing demands, needs and demographics in a much more flexible way than is possible in the context of the current bureaucratic and layered management structure.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the current realities.  Our written submission has detailed the very bleak journey Ireland's public health service has endured in recent years.  More than &euro;4 billion has been cut from health funding, which is an unprecedented contraction of expenditure in any OECD country.  There has been a loss of over 2,000 beds.  Public supports for vulnerable people have been undermined such as the privatisation of services for older persons services, the curtailment of mental health services curtailed, the silent but hugely damaging cuts in disability services and the very severe contraction, despite commitments to primary care, to public health and community nursing, home care, home help and related services.</p> <p>  The injurious, unmanaged and unmeasured contraction in staffing levels has resulted in a loss of more than 5,000 nursing and midwifery posts, 13.5% of the workforce.  The system is still working with some 4,000 less nurses and midwives than it had in 2009, compromising patient care on a daily basis.  We have a loss of 3,500 general support and care staff and a reduction of 1,200 in the number of clerical and administrative staff.  It is acknowledged that during this period there were some increases, including in respect of the number of medical personnel by more than 1,500.  There was also a small increase of 800 in the number of allied health professionals.  The impact of this unmanaged contraction, driven solely by budget considerations regardless of its outcome upon patient care or the ability of the health service to meet demand, has been completely underestimated by the political system and this is evident in record levels of admitted patients on trolleys in overcrowded emergency departments and wards.  Record numbers of patients are on hospital waiting lists and waiting lists for services in the community.</p> <p>  This committee must be acutely aware that this contraction resulted in the forced emigration of young, recently-graduated health professionals in the nursing, midwifery and other allied health fields.  In considering any real transformation for our health service the first challenge will be to attract back these health professionals while we also educate additional numbers and ensure they remain in Ireland upon qualification.  The committee must recognise that the morale among nursing and midwifery staff has never been lower.  They feel totally disrespected by their employer and their professional judgement is, on a daily basis, set aside or ignored by senior management whose continuing focus is solely on budgets and numbers and not on the needs of patients and service users.  It is against this reality that the required transformation must begin with the replacement of lost staff, together with the recruitment of additional staff, which will require sustained investment.  If we do not have nurses and midwives, and other front-line staff, we do not have a health service that is fit-for-purpose.</p> <p>  Consider the transformation and what is required.  In calling for this major organisational transformational programme the INMO recognises that it must be in tandem with how and who delivers care, and where that care or support is provided in the context of devolved funding and accountability arrangements.  The fundamental principle of our new and changed health system must be a guarantee to any service user that they will receive integrated care whether they need it in the home, in a primary care setting, an acute hospital or a long-term care environment.  There can be no silos with regard to budgets or who delivers care.  Such silos are currently real and growing barriers to meeting the needs of patients and service users.</p> <p>  It is against this background that the INMO makes the following points to the committee on organisational reform.  In the context of 11 years of organisational reform, with no improvement, the INMO, as part of this transitional programme, believes that certain measures must be put in place including: simplified organisational structures from the Department of Health; regional health authorities; and individual local units and areas.  There is no cohesion or accountability within current structures, which include the Department of Health, the centralised HSE, seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations, 17 mental health areas and numerous section 38 and section 39 service providers.  This lack of cohesion will always result in a lack of transparency and accountability with front-line staff not having the necessary autonomy, with responsibility to shape service delivery to meet patient or client need.</p> <p>  In the context of transforming models of care, this overhaul must result in nursing and midwifery and medical staff being empowered, with accountability to deliver care at the most effective level.  The INMO would put forward the following framework in this regard.  The single-tier service would see all new appointments to consultant and general practitioner posts involve a public-only contract including an obligation to work rosters on a five as opposed to a seven-day basis.  Existing consultant and general practitioner post-holders who do not wish to change their contracts must be allowed to retain them.  All new appointments should be replaced with public only contracts.  This will require an increase in the number of consultants to our public health service.  This can be partly funded by a reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, posts, reducing our current over-reliance on medical staff undergoing continuing training or education in the clinical area.  There should be very significant expansion of the role of the nurse and midwife in all clinical areas requiring a significant increase in the number of nurses and midwives in the hospital and community who are empowered to prescribe within agreed protocols.  There should also be an expansion of nurse and midwife led services involving advanced nurse and midwife practitioners as follows: the empowerment of nurses and midwives to order diagnostic tests such as X-rays and bloods, whether they work in hospitals or community settings; the mainstreaming of an expanded role with regard to first dose antibiotics; intravenous cannulation for fluid balance; out-of-hours phlebotomy; nurse-led discharge; and other appropriate roles within all care settings.  The role of the health care assistant, including their job descriptions and training pathways, must be standardised, nationalised and become the minimum required for entry to this grade.  This is an essential part of front-line reform which should lead to best practice skill mix ratios such as 80:20 for registered nurses and health care assistants in acute medical and surgical wards and 50:50 for registered nurses and health care assistants in care of the elderly facilities, as confirmed by international research by RN4CAST. </p> <p>  I will now turn to devolved funding.  The INMO is also calling for reform leading to a practice where funding is devolved to units, wards and community level.  Currently, front-line managers have no input into what funding is required and can work the whole year without ever knowing what funding was given to their area or unit, which leaves them in an impossible position.</p><p>In simplifying organisational structures, the INMO is also calling for new accountability rules which would ensure the director of nursing or midwifery is involved, at all stages, in the formulation of the annual budget for that location and area.  Once the budget has been finalised for that area or location, it would then be devolved to the front-line manager, that is, the clinical nurse manager or the head of physiotherapy, who assumes responsibility and accountability for the budget but with complete autonomy as to what services can be delivered safely within that budget.  Directors of nursing and midwifery and senior hospital area managers, as appropriate, would be empowered to seek amended funding levels to reflect changes in service demand, acuity and dependency.  </p><p> The greatest damage done to the health service in recent years has been the totally unmanaged contraction of staff numbers.  This, in turn, is a major reason for the broken spirit and morale of front-line staff, particularly nurses and midwives, at this time.  As we embark on this transformational programme we must introduce an evidence-based approach to staffing our health service at levels which optimise the well-being of patients.  </p><p> This process is already under way through the work of the task force on nurse staffing and skill mix in adult medical and surgical wards.  The further roll-out of this approach to staffing is fundamental to the transformational programme and the next area planned is emergency department nurse staffing.  This work must be accelerated, and we use evidence-based mechanisms, as determined by the front-line manager, that is, the CNM2, to determine appropriate staffing and skill mix requirements.   </p><p> It is self-evident, and very regrettable, that to date the HSE, the Department of Health or the Government have not done enough to address the loss of our best and brightest young professionals.  Therefore, the public service pay commission must be accelerated and FEMPI unwound, together with the early renegotiation of the Lansdowne Road agreement, in order to garner trust within staff to deliver this radical transformation.  In addition, it is the belief of the INMO that the crisis with regard to nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention requires unique measures to be brought forward immediately to reduce current excessive workloads and improve patient care.  No matter what model of health care is used, the reality is that all health systems are labour intensive and must be staffed by committed, dedicated and flexible people.  This must be recognised with the health service being an employer of choice offering excellent pay and conditions. </p><p> As we state in our written submission, the latest OECD figures confirm that in 2013 the Government's allocation to public health spending was 72% of GDP.  The OECD figures also indicate that when this public expenditure is combined with private health expenditure the overall health spend in this country is approximately 10% of GDP.  However, the manner and nature of this expenditure, which clearly reinforces the two-tiered structure, only serves to guarantee faster access to diagnostics and treatment for those who can afford private insurance or direct out-of-pocket expenses.  This is inherently unfair and inequitable. </p><p> Therefore, in calling for a public health spend of no less than 10% of GDP, and 12% to 14% during transitional years, we recognise that this must be done with total transparency so that it secures and maintains the confidence of all citizens and taxpayers.  We also call for the phased abolition of all tax reliefs pertaining to private health insurance, the ending of any contracting for services to provide direct care and the phased ending of subventions to private nursing homes, while recognising this will take an extended period due to existing contracts and bed stocks and the need to develop new publicly-funded direct facilities.  </p><p> In recognising the challenge that meeting future health costs will bring, we draw the attention of the committee to recent papers produced by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, which remind us that by 2046 the number of persons over 65 years of age will have increased from 606,000 to 1.8 million.  In addition, we face the growing epidemics of obesity and alcohol abuse which will also increase demand on our health service.  Against this stark reality, the political system must fully understand the implications of these demographic and lifestyle changes.  All taxpayers must also understand that we cannot reduce general taxation levels and provide the same type and extent of health service the population will need. </p><p> Our call today to the committee is to begin the revolution necessary to deliver a single tiered health system within 15 years, which will serve all the people of this country equally and in a world-class manner.  In calling for this, we also recognise that health service structures and how all health service staff work must also be subject to transformation.  No vested interest should be allowed to halt the pace of progress necessary to prepare for the growing demand that will be made on our health system. </p><p> To deliver this change will require the health service, including its funding and structures, to be removed completely from the traditional electoral cycle and budgetary practices.  We ask members to make these recommendations, safe in the knowledge that all future generations of Irish citizens will live in a more equal society with regard to health care, which is an investment in the future and will realise healthier communities and a stronger economy. </p></speech>

It is fairly comprehensive.</p> <p>  The question of the skill mix has arisen a number of times today, and there is general acceptance that we could do better.  There is clearly a blockage, because people have been talking about this issue for a very long time.  Various groups have a view on where the blockage might be.  Given that we have to tackle the issue, I ask Ms Harkin-Kelly to outline her views on where the blockages are and what could be done to improve the level of skill mix within the health service in the short and long term.  It is not something that can be fixed overnight.</p> <p>  Ms Harkin-Kelly referred to the broken spirit of nurses and midwives, and the general population of health service workers.  What can we do about that?  The purpose of the committee is to devise a plan, but a plan is completely useless unless we can get buy-in.  How can we establish credibility among health care professionals?</p> <p>  We discussed the public-private ratio.  I would be interested to hear views on the value for money we achieve for our spend on private health care versus how the money could be spent on or invested in the public health system.</p></speech>

Midwives do a significant amount of work and save a significant amount of time for consultants on a daily basis.  I have a very strong view on that.  It is awful to hear that morale is so low.  We are delighted that Ms Harkin-Kelly is before the committee today so that we can try to move forward and find some solutions.</p> <p>  I refer to the plan over 15 years, in terms of changes in technology and medical science.  How does Ms Harkin-Kelly envisage the health sector dealing with that?  Would a plan have to be reconsidered after a period of time?  How does the INMO envisage the devolution of funding for health care to work?  Does it see scope for community providers and not-for-profit organisations to participate?  I am interested in hearing the views of Ms Harkin-Kelly on that.</p> <p>  Ms Harkin-Kelly referred to transforming models of care and the very significant expansion of duties for nurses and midwives.  I refer in particular to her comments on empowering nurses and midwives to order diagnostic tests.  The phrasing is interesting.  She did not say that they should diagnose something; rather, that they could order tests.  From an insurance perspective - I am veering into the territory of the role of doctors - I would like her to flesh that out for me.  I have concerns about that from a medical negligence perspective.</p></speech>

I will not refer to morale and so forth, because we are hearing about that repeatedly.  She said people were not being treated with respect within the system.  Is it that toxic?</p> <p>  She also mentioned managers not having access to budgets and so on.</p><p>Surely a person buying a car or building a house knows exactly how much money they have or how much they can play with.  I find it extremely worrying that people have no control over expenditure and ask her to elaborate on the matter.</p><p> Everything else has been touched on.  We all probably have pains in our heads from hearing how bad morale is in the health system.  </p></speech>

Our submission has clearly recognised that the proper delivery of care within the health service must be evidence-based and significant work on that has occurred.  For instance, there has been very significant work done on the acute medical and surgical area.  The task force on staffing has clearly identified that one needs a proper skills mix that looks at the roles played by nurses and midwives, whether they be advanced practice nurses and midwives, specialists or more pertinently, in this context, the staff nurse or midwife and the role of the health care assistant.  That work has been done.  There is some willingness, it would appear, to move that forward but there is not a sufficient willingness to implement an appropriate evidence-based skills mix.  The delivery of care must be evidence-based.  It must be based on an acuity and dependancy assessment that looks at the type of patients being cared for, and the appropriate professionals and other health service staff that should be available.  They should all be appropriately trained including, as we have said in our submission, the minimum training for a health care assistant within the system and obviously then the regulated profession of the staff nurse and midwife grades.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the blockages could be addressed.  There is no willingness to understand and accept, within the system, that reductions in the levels of professionals and the appropriate personnel available to treat patients is causing difficulties such as increased waiting lists and increased emergency department trolley figures.  Very importantly, the registered nurse forecasting study, RN4CAST, shows that mortality rates increase when one does not have the right skills mix within a particular work location.  I have focused on the medical and surgical inpatient areas.  We must also consider the maternity strategy and the requirement for the appropriate number of midwives to birth with a nod to Deputy Madigan's points on the role of midwives, to which we will come back.</p> <p>  The requirement is for an evidence base.  Nobody can spend money on the call of a particular person or profession for anything.  The evidence base has to be the acuity, dependency or birthrate or both, depending on the area one works in, who are the appropriate professionals to meet that and whether the system then will accept that those staffing levels and staffing mix must be based on patient need and not based on the current budget allocation.  We do not have to look too far away to the terrible realities, multiple deaths and significant systemic difficulties that arose in the neighbouring jurisdiction where budgets became the primary driver of what care would be delivered and not the quality of care required.  We must move away from that system and towards a system that recognises the minimum level of professionals and other staff that are necessary. </p></speech>

Every area of the health service should be staffed based on the what the acuity and dependency of the patients demand.  That can result in cost savings or a cost increase but must be evidence-based because we have to deliver care on the basis of what evidence suggests, which can be publicly accounted for, and not on what the INMO or somebody else says.  It is what the evidence tells us is the necessity for that patient.  I wilfully acknowledge that there could be savings but it could also result in a cost increase.</p></speech>

In research we conducted when preparing a health strategy statement for our organisation for the consideration of the public, and in our submissions to the committee and other interested parties, we have looked at the delivery of health care across multiple jurisdictions.  One does not have to look too far.  One can look to the west to the United States that has a predominance of private health care within the delivery of health care that has resulted in a huge increase and a disproportionate actual expenditure on health care versus a very low delivery.<br/><br/>Let us consider the United Kingdom and the commissioning of care in the private sector.  The Care Quality Commission in the United Kingdom has recently sounded significant notes of caution about the ability to regulate and the quality of care being delivered in that jurisdiction arising from expenditure in the private sector.  There is also the research in the United Kingdom that points quite clearly towards the fact it is more expensive to deliver care in the private sector.<br/><br/>Professionals who deliver care in the private sector must be procured from an international labour market so they will not be paid a lower rate.  In the private sector increased sign-on bonuses are now being offered to registered nurses and midwives that draw recruits away from the public service and into the private sector.  The amount paid to the staff will remain the same.<br/><br/>The extracted profit is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for a business delivering a service.  There is no ability, in the same manner, to regulate the delivery of care.  We do not believe that the value for money argument holds water.  If one says one gets greater value for money, we believe that research shows that it costs more.  We believe that the labour market does not support paying people less to deliver the service and, therefore, why should the State be funding an additional layer of expenditure, which is the profit margin involved?  We have no difficulty with profit margins in a general sense but we are here to deliver a health service to the nation, to maintain the health of the nation and to improve the health of the nation.  I believe we are illegitimately spending additional money to do so.  We do not have any reasonable value-for-money analysis that can point to either higher quality or reduced cost and, therefore, the State should deliver it on a direct employment basis.<br/><br/>I shall hand over to my colleagues who will address additional points.  </p></speech>

That is the best possible way to describe morale, and Deputy Buckley may have alluded to the matter as well.</p> <p>  In terms of how the committee can garner credibility, the immediate solution is to attract back the people who have gone to foreign fields.  As many as 7,500 nurses have gone to the UK alone.  We need to incentivise them.  We need better remuneration for nurses here in order to retain them.  It costs money to train nurses here and then we export them abroad.  We must reconsider their terms and conditions and provide ongoing education, training and evaluation.  Last night I attended a meeting and the sense of anomie and helplessness in the room was palpable.  We must beat that drum and reiterate it because the message has fallen on the deaf ears of Government.  Nurses need incentivised packages to encourage them to return home.  It may take the form of providing money for rent, travel expenses, moving or further education over a two-year or four-year span.  Whatever form it takes it desperately needs to be done and it needs to be done now.  </p></speech>

That function now requires an elaborate business case to be made for everything, which delays the delivery of service.  Sometimes one does not get an answer or the process can take months.  Unfortunately, the person who needs the aid will have moved to another place or will be gone altogether before the aid can be delivered.  Direct heads of service are now unable to command their budgets thus delaying and, in many cases, preventing patient care.  The matter must be given great consideration.  We have gone from a fairly direct management reporting structure to a very indirect one.</p><p>Communities have gone from a very accountable system, where local regional health authorities serviced by elected members at least could ask questions about the service being provided, to a situation where nobody can ask any questions.  Managers only answer to managers.  There is a terrible lack of governance and that has led to a situation where the heads of the service have little or no control over whether they can replace the staff or supply what the person needs.  That also happens in hospitals.  There is a pushing back, particularly of nurse leaders, in terms of budgetary control and ability to deliver services.  That is what has happened.</p></speech>

Take the example of a child who goes into hospital for a specific operation and obviously needs a hip spica chair.  Is the witness saying that in 2016 people in hospitals in this country do not have the capacity, leadership, accountability or responsibility to deal with that and, despite the child needing a specific chair before leaving the hospital, they must make a business case and it will take too long?</p></speech>

I have two questions.  Recruitment is a huge, and probably the most pressing, problem in the Irish health service.  Earlier, the witnesses from the IMO identified salary as the fourth in priority of wishes of NCHDs to remain in this country.  Working conditions, length of contracts and career progression and hope for the future were ahead of salary.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on how those could be addressed.  The second item relates to transforming medical care.  The witness suggests that all new consultant and GP contracts should be public-only contracts.  How do they envisage that working?  I can see, perhaps, how public-only consultant contracts can work in a hospital where there are a number of consultants who can take over the care of non-eligible patients.  However, I do not see how it would work in general practice, where only 47% of the population has an entitlement to a medical card.  If one moves to a single-tier service in which everybody is covered it would be possible to allow GPs to have a public-only contract, but that would not be possible in the current situation.  If everybody is eligible, why would there be a contract rather than a salaried position?</p></speech>

They indicated that a move to a new model would have to include a review of our bed capacity, particularly in the hospital setting, to address the severe overcrowding and the numbers.  I put this question to the previous witnesses.  I believe a bed review would have to be conducted independent of the Government and the Department.  It is important that we instill public confidence in this.  What are the witness's views on this?  Do they have a figure?  Mr. Mathews referred to it being evidence based.  Do the witnesses have an approximate figure for it?  What are their views on how the bed review would be conducted?</p></speech>

You said that nurses want to take on new responsibilities and duties.  What is stopping that?  What is your view on the present arrangements, particularly in light of the fact that nurses will be leading on chronic disease management?  Currently, that is proposed to be done by practice nurses.  What is your view on practice nurses being employed by GPs?  Is that the optimal way of providing that service?  With regard to the recruitment and retention of staff, over the last few months the potential for having some type of scholarship scheme has arisen, whereby nurse training would be funded and, in return, nurses would commit to staying in the Irish system for three years or whatever other length of time.  Do you have a view on that type of approach?</p></speech>

Deputy Harty outlined what the IMO said about doctors.  Money is a big issue in the case of nurses and midwives.  The overall remuneration package to attract nurses is simply not good enough to get the people who have left this country to return.  All OECD countries are facing a huge shortage of nurses and health care workers generally in the next two decades.  We are competing in an international market that is offering better terms and we cannot do that.  We are even competing in an Irish market where private providers are making better offers to nurses to move to them.  It is not realistic; the bring them home campaign showed just how unrealistic the efforts are.  Unlike what the IMO said about doctors, money is a major issue in terms of getting those people back to this country and keeping them here.</p> <p>  We have the other issues in common.  On the lack of educational opportunity, the last eight years have seen a big pull back on the educational opportunities for new nurses coming into the system and for existing nurses.  There is a huge appetite among nurses and midwives for continuing education, and we see that in the services we provide.  However, the funding of that has been left to individuals in many cases and has been pulled back.  When we attract somebody back from another country, that is one of the reasons they leave again.  They have lost what they had in England or in whatever other country they were in terms of educational opportunity and career progression.  Those matters are equally important for nurses, but money is much higher than in the list of priorities the Deputy heard from others.</p></speech>

Many of the nurses and midwives carry out ongoing and continuing professional development on their days off.  The only leave they are given at present, and even that is being pushed, is for mandatory training.  That is the reality of the vagaries that exist in the system.</p></speech>

One is a systemic unwillingness to recognise the full contribution that nurses and midwives can make in specialist and advanced practice roles.  The international research is clear regarding the ability of nurses and midwives in specialist and advanced practice roles to manage both complicated and uncomplicated care in a variety of settings, be it primary care, acute care, elderly care or mental health, and the ability to do that, which in turn increases the positivity of patient experience, has been shown to reduce hospital admissions and increase the integrated nature of the care.  That is the big block within the silo system we have at present, which ultimately is leading to people not getting the care required and is leading, in turn, to the incredible pressure in the secondary and tertiary systems.</p></speech>

It must be recognised.  That is one element of it.  The other element is the tortuous process that has grown organically for the development of advanced practice roles.  We must move to the model that has been implemented in other jurisdictions, which is a credentialing framework using the nursing and midwifery register.  This recognises the skills and competencies that are available in the graduate workforce, recognises and supports the ongoing education of people and experiential learning, credentials that, that is, annotates it to their register, and allows them to progress to the advanced practice role.  It must be within the HSE service plan or that of whoever or whatever will manage the health service into the future, in our recommendation the health authorities with the Department of Health having the policy lead, to embed advanced practice roles within the delivery of care across the models of care to ensure that people get the right professional at the right time delivering the right care.  It involves the credentialing framework and the willingness of the system to deliver that.</p> <p>  In tandem with that, I will respond to Deputy Madigan's point which is a concern relating to, perhaps, a medical negligence issue and the advanced practice role.  Quite simply, the issue does not arise.  The standard of care that must be delivered is based on the level at which the practitioner is operating.  When people reach an advanced practice role, international research and all of the safety literature show that those advanced practitioners are competent and capable to deliver and manage care, both complicated and uncomplicated, across a range of headings and to be competent and capable to discharge people and cross refer between services and professionals and between advanced nurses and physicians, to ensure the delivery of the care that is required.</p><p> On chronic disease management and the role of practice nurses, as I said, there is an absolute necessity to have nurses embedded at specialist and advanced practice level to ensure the proper delivery of chronic disease management, which is the issue of our time, particularly in the context of the possible doubling or more of the elderly population and changing demographics as we move forward.  Practice nurses should not be privately employed.  They should be employed by the public health system.  If we are to have an integrated delivery of care, we must have a managed and delivered service within which people are working as part of a team rather than employed by somebody else and siloed off in a separate location.  These people must have access to the supports and systemic advancement opportunities which come within the public health service that we are envisaging, such that a practice nurse working at a particular level automatically progresses to a specialist or advance practice role, be that in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac epilepsy and so on, in respect of which there are good models throughout the service.  Currently, there is no standardisation within the service to allow that type of progression.</p></speech>

Our view is that there would be no reason those practice nurses could not be brought within the public service and allowed the opportunity to benefit from the integrated team approach.  There is a difficulty where a siloed individual is providing care.  It is possible that, with agreement, such a person could be brought within the public service, thus leading to increased availability of the team approach, increased integration and access to the other professionals within the primary care service, including the ability to cross-refer.  These people should be brought within the service to maximise integration within the transitionary phase.  Otherwise, they will remain isolated where they are currently.</p></speech>

There are people applying through the CAO system year-in, year-out, for nurse training.  The retention of nurses following training is the issue.  As mentioned by Deputy Buckley, there is a misnomer with regard to what a nurse is trained to do over the four-year training timeframe.  Such a person is a graduate degree student who progresses to higher diploma, Masters and, in many cases, PhD level.  It is not the four-year training period that is problematic but the immediate period after that four years.</p> <p>  However, I caution against any scholarship scheme in respect of which there would be no stipulation with regard to salaries post training.  As a union we believe that nurses should be paid at the same salary level as all other allied health care professionals because they have the same qualification.  There is no difference in this regard.  I would go as far as to say they are the most holistic individuals who sit within the health service in that their role is physical, psychological, social, spiritual, environmental and economic.  That is what they are trained to do.</p></speech>

There are elements of emigration that have always occurred in terms of health professionals from which we have all benefited.  The difficulty is the net migration figure, which has not resulted in people coming home.  The difficulty with a scholarship scheme is the inherent inequity and unfairness of people being trained and provided with a level of education in respect of a particular occupational group being disadvantaged because the terms and conditions are such that they would not be retained but would be instead indentured into the service.  What we need are the terms and conditions and work environments that people want to work in.</p> <p>  We must become an employer of choice.  An employer of choice in nursing and midwifery has proper terms and conditions of employment and comparable working hours with other health professionals.  One of the greatest barriers for our colleagues is the availability of a reasonable and certain career progression ladder.  They must have opportunities that allow them to move to a specialist or advanced role.  Our graduates will be on Skype interviews with London hospitals offering them immediate specialist placements, immediate education and immediate advancement.  They will also be on Skype interviews with New Zealand and other jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United States, all immediately offering them jobs while here they cannot get a promise that they can even work in a particular department for a particular period, never mind a promise that they will have opportunities for career advancement.  We need to address those issues and become an employer of choice.  We need people who want to work in our system rather than people who are indentured to the service.</p></speech>

There is a scholarship scheme for people training to be nurses in the care delivery area, although the funding in this regard has been reduced.  There is potential in terms of the number of people who could progress successfully under a scholarship in the mature existing health care occupational group area.</p></speech>

Our vision is for a publicly delivered primary acute mental health and social care service.  It is within that context that we have recommended the public-only contract.  We believe that if the goal is to have delivery of an organised and integrated service where everybody is rowing in the same direction under the same policy, we cannot have people who are not within that service.  That is our view.  We do see a transitionary issue arising in terms of eligibility, but we want to move towards universal eligibility within the primary health system.  That is how we would address the issue.</p></speech>

I am not sure there is much between us.  We believe that GPs should be within the system.  In other words, they should be employees within a salaried system.  Perhaps it is a matter of nomenclature rather than particular difference within the system, if the Deputy gets my point.  We would rather a GP be a salaried person within the service.  We recognise that there are currently a cohort of GPs who are in private practice.  The issue is how those people would be brought into the system and how those who do not want to come into would be allowed to continue to have their contractual rights during the transitionary period.  Into the future we would see all deliverers of service, including GPs, delivering service in the same way as consultants do.</p></speech>

Our  belief is that the public must have confidence in the delivery of a service.  We have said very clearly that no single group, no single occupational category or single influencer can act as a vested interest to block either the future advancement of the service or to influence the service unduly in the future.  In that context, we believe there should be the equivalent of a public health inspectorate to monitor delivery of care and ensure value for money, such that in regard to money devolved at unit level there is no free-for-all but an obligation to operate from an evidence base in relation to staffing numbers.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding the independent review, as I said, we have difficulty with a review.  We can look at the OECD average of 2.8 versus 4.8 per thousand of population, the loss of 2,000 beds and the recommendation of a former Minister for Health in the context of previous reductions in bed capacity of a cushion of six co-located hospitals with up to 400 beds each, which never materialised.</p><p>We have no difficulty with or fear of an independent bed review.  We know we must reduce the number of patients who are fit for discharge and should not be in the hospital but it is our belief, and the evidence will show, that pending moving to a more integrated primary service, there is a need for more acute beds.  That is why we are recommending the higher spend in the interim period.  We have no objection whatsoever to an independent study which receives submissions from interested parties and reaches determinations.  The OECD figures point to the necessity for that and, if nothing else, the emergency department figures can leave no one in doubt, as do the waiting list figures, that there is a need for a mixed in-patient bed capacity, both five-day and over seven days.</p></speech>

My niece qualified recently and, thankfully, has got a job as a midwife in Galway.  She is very happy with her permanent job and has no intention of going anywhere.  There are examples of students and people who want to stay in Ireland and are happy to do so.  I do not expect the witnesses to have the figures, but they might follow up the meeting by sending the information so that we could look at something factual rather than anecdotal.</p></speech>

There are two items on the agenda relating to the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  Our first session is a discussion with representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, on this important issue.  The joint committee has identified this as one its priority issues in its 2016 work programme.  We are appreciative of, and would like to recognise, the work of the previous justice committee in addressing the issue.  We are not endeavouring to replicate or replace it; we are hoping to build on it.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Jacinta Brack, public relations and public co-ordinator of ITM, Ms Maria Joyce, co-ordinator of the National Traveller Women's Forum, and Mr. Bernard Joyce, director of ITM.  The format of the meeting is they will all be invited to address the committee and make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by an opportunity for questions and answers.  We have allocated an hour because this session will be followed by an address on the same topic by Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission representatives.</p> <p>  Witnesses should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Joyce to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Bernard Joyce and Ms Jacinta Brack of ITM .<br/><br/>Travellers have a shared history, culture and language with its own customs and traditions which are recognisable and distinct.  There are two essential elements identified in the Act of 1976 and Mandla <i>v</i>. Dowell Lee which constitute an ethnic group - a long shared history of which the group is conscious as distinguishing it from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive; and a cultural tradition of its own, including family and social customsTravellers share both of these characteristics.  We self-identify as an ethnic group and we are seen as a separate group by others.  Our recognition as an ethnic minority in Ireland has been long outstanding.  Despite many years of campaigning the first formal reference by the State to our requests was noted in October 2011 when the former Minister for Justice and Equality said the State would give clear consideration to the matter.  Five years on, we are still waiting.<br/><br/>In April 2014 the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice issued its report and recommendations on recognition of Traveller ethnicity as follows: that either the Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality would make a statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann confirming State recognition, that the Government would then inform relevant international bodies of that decision and that a time-limited dialogue would be undertaken with Traveller representative groups about new legislation, or amendments to existing legislation that were required.  Two and a half years on and still nothing.  To say we are bitterly disappointed at this continued denial of Traveller ethnicity is putting it mildly.</p><p>In July 2015 the position of the State was publicly confirmed for the first time and is, according to the Attorney General's office, that there is no impediment to State recognition under two principle concerns, cost and additional legal implications.  In the meantime, calls from domestic and international human rights bodies, treaties and covenants, to which Ireland is a party, have appealed to the Irish Government to afford Travellers the right to have our unique identity recognised.  These calls have been left unanswered.  Only last week, the director of equality at the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice cited that it may issue proceedings against Irelandfor alleged discrimination against Travellers.  She referred to repeated calls from bodies such as the United Nationsand the Council of Europe for Ireland to recognise Traveller ethnicity, as Travellers satisfy internationally recognised criteria.  She also stated that Travellers are the most marginalised community in Ireland.<br/><br/>In our current position, we are more vulnerable to indirect discrimination in State policy and practice and cannot rely on automatic comprehensive domestic protection.  This was evidenced three weeks ago when the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill was supported and moved on to Committee Stage without reference to Travellers.  Lack of recognition means we do not benefit from automatic inclusion in such proposed Bills.  It also sends out a message on the part of the State to the effect that the institutional and societal racism, discrimination, prejudice and oppression that Travellers experience in every aspect of their daily lives is acceptable.  Traveller women living 11 years less then settled women is not acceptable.  Suicide rates six times higher in the Traveller community then the national average is not acceptable.  Ten people are dead, five of them children, because we do not have adequate provision of high-standard, Traveller-specific accommodation.  Travellers the length and breadth of this country are living in intolerable conditions and this leads us to ask &quot;What is the delay?&quot;.  After all, as Travellers, we satisfy the standard legal and sociological criteria for recognition &ndash; that is undisputed internationally.  Domestic and international human rights bodies have consistently reminded the Irish State of its obligations to Irish Travellers to have our ethnicity recognised as set out in international human rights treaties ratified by the Irish Government.  The British and Northern Irish authorities, Scotland and Wales have recognised Travellers as an ethnic group, separate from non-Traveller Irish people.  The Irish State, as directed by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, has also conceded there is no impediment to our recognition.<br/><br/>Mr. Bernard Joyce will discuss the importance of State recognition to us as a community.  Fundamentally, recognition of our ethnicity would be a step towards real equality for Travellers in Irish society.  In the 30 years and more since the founding of Traveller organisations we have called for acknowledgment of our unique identity and place in Irish society.  We want Travellers to be valued for the people we are and the contribution we make to Irish society and to be elevated by the State and in the mindset of all its people.  This could bring about a significant positive step on the journey of re-righting the ill-effects of marginalisation, exclusion and oppression and create an opportunity to shape a better future for Travellers.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation to us to come here today.  This is our second time in two years to appear before a committee of the Houses.<br/><br/>Ms Maria Joyce outlined how the issue of our ethnicity is undisputed and that we belong to an ethnic group.  I was born a Traveller.  This is my identity; it belongs to me.  I cannot become an non-Traveller.  I belong to a community who share a history that is owned by us, culture that belongs to us and values and beliefs that we share together as a community.  We are a unique people on this island.  We share a historical experience dating back hundreds of years and, unfortunately, we experience discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion on this island, which has created<b></b>huge gaps in our social, health and life outcomes.<br/><br/>Ethnicity is not the same as race, nationality or place of birth.  Recognising Traveller ethnicity will not make us less Irish.  It will, however, acknowledge our dual identity of being both Irish and Traveller, similar to Irish Americans and African Americans.  Having my identity recognised, defined and included would enhance my pride of place in Irish society my sense of being part of rather than separate from it.  <br/><br/>What we seek from the Irish State is an acknowledgment that our view of ourselves as a community is valid, and should be recognised as such.  Fundamentally, it is about respect and inclusion of our identity that has been denied since the foundation of the Irish State.  Now is the time to do right by us.  Now is the time to make this decision.<br/><br/>One particular advantage to ethnicity recognition is the opportunity to enhance community esteem and address internalised oppression.  Internalised oppression, which supports the notion that the majority population is right and somehow superior to us, leads to poor self-image, low self-esteem, a lack of pride in one&rsquo;s culture and identity, stress, depression and even suicide among our community.  The low expectations that we both have of ourselves and of our community sadly is not unique to us.  Minority groups across the globe share its impact on the well-being of their communities.  However, despite the difficulties facing our community, the crisis relating to our mental and social well-being and the vulnerabilities threatening our young people, as a community, we are a resilient, proud and honourable people.  Recognising our minority ethnic status would mean that we would be automatically included, as Ms Maria Joyce said, in future anti-racism and integration policies and initiatives.<br/><br/>Our desire is to be valued for the people we are and to be elevated by the Irish State, bringing about a positive step on the journey of re-righting the ill-effects of past policies.  The 1963 Report of the Commission on Itinerancy on Travellers further marginalised our community.  Recognising Traveller ethnicity would also create the opportunity for further collaboration and an improvement in trust between the State and Travellers.  I must state that recognition, however, is not a gift to be bestowed by the State or by others, our ethnicity without question is our unique identity.  Our recognition is part of a process of healing and reconciliation between Travellers and their relationship with the State.  The historical context of our position and of our right as individuals and as a group to self-identify as being Traveller and the recognising of our ethnicity has both symbolic and practical benefits.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  It has been two years since we were last here.  In those two years, we have seen the Minister responsible previously make an announcement that ethnicity would be recognised within six months.  A year has passed and we are still here.  Our community has been very much let down.  I hope this is part of a process where there will be an opportunity to progress Traveller ethnicity and Travellers' rightful place within our society. </p></speech>

They are very welcome.</p> <p>  The report from April 2014 was compiled by the previous committee.</p><p>This committee will stand by that report.  I can understand the witnesses' frustration that it has not been implemented, specifically the recommendations contained in it.</p><p> On the general issue of Travellers, in my assessment there are five sets of statistics that are simply unacceptable from this State's point of view, namely, statistics in respect of infant mortality, education, unemployment, suicide and life expectancy in the Traveller community.  To what extent do the witnesses believe that those serious problems in the Traveller community will be alleviated if recognition is granted, as previously recommended by the report?</p></speech>

The vast majority of Travellers do not choose to be socially excluded but are excluded regardless.  We have seen this even more with our young people.  I believe there is a strong connection between mental health, well-being and social inclusion.  I also believe that there is a strong connection between one's identity and feeling a sense of pride in one's identity and a sense of belonging.  Belonging and that sense of identity have not been accepted, acknowledged or complimented in Irish society in a way that it should be.  We see this even more in parts of Ireland where Travellers are dispersed.  We have seen young Travellers feel a sense of shame about who they are and their identity, and that is more to do with how society judges the Traveller community.  We want to move to a situation where Travellers feel they can belong and feel strong about who they are as people, but also where society acknowledges that.  There is so much more that needs to be done in that regard.</p> <p>  As we saw recently, the statistics on education have got even worse because of a lack of resources.  When one considers the cuts to the Traveller sector, one sees that no other community has endured the level of cuts that have taken place to education, accommodation and services.  We have seen something like an 80% cut in education services.  Such cuts are unprecedented compared to other communities and we must ask why is that the case.  What we have not touched on in terms of statistics is a strong, underlying aspect that Travellers state that they experience discrimination not once, but a multitude of times in one day.  It is not that they go out and experience discrimination once or three times in a lifetime; a young Traveller can experience discrimination three times within an hour of walking out his or her front door.  They can experience discrimination in trying to enter a shop, among their peers or in schools.  This has an impact on a day-to-day basis.  I have referred to the internalised pressure and to the fact more and more Travellers avoid services close to where they live, such as schools, and are  moving eight to nine miles to access services outside their towns.</p> <p>  The difference between the unemployment rate for Travellers and that for the general population is almost incomparable.  The national figure is 11%, but the figure for Travellers is something like up to 82%.  It is absolutely incredible.  There is a lack of resources and supports.  In terms of employment opportunities, it is absolutely an indictment of the State and the failure of every single Department to deliver adequate resources and address the gap in terms of division, exclusion and marginalisation.  Travellers are almost being blamed and held responsible for their unemployment, their treatment and the lack of accommodation, and that is not acceptable.</p> <p>  I do not know whether my colleague would like to add anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#C00400"><p>We welcome Deputy O'Callaghan's comment that these statistics are unacceptable because they are.  Traveller infant mortality at three times the national average is absolutely unacceptable.  Mr. Joyce has spoken about the unemployment rate for Travellers being in excess of 84%.  During the recession when the national unemployment rate was at 14% and 15%, it was a crisis.  Traveller unemployment is not considered a crisis even at absolutely astronomical levels.  The suicide rate for Travellers is six times higher than the national average.  These are not just statistics; these are people; this is a community.  When one considers some of these figures, for example, suicide rates, it is clear we have a crisis and an epidemic, but there is no co-ordinated policy response, or any response, from the State for a significant community within its borders, and it is not addressing it in any comprehensive way.</p> <p>  We would welcome recognition tomorrow morning.  We do not see it as the panacea to solving all the issues and problems but we see it as the first step in the right direction in that regard.  Mr. Joyce talked about what recognition means as a Traveller, but basic fundamentals, such as respect, dignity and inclusion, and the impact they will have on every aspect of Travellers' lives, cannot be measured.  Recognition will also mean that where Travellers have been excluded from policies developed by the State, in some instances intentionally, if they were recognised as an ethnic minority, they would not be excluded from those policy documents.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacinta Brack" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#C00800"><p>Initially, the State was reluctant to recognise ethnicity on the basis of cost and potential legal implications.  Those are certainly the arguments that have been put forward, say, in the past five years.  Prior to that, as Mr. Joyce mentioned earlier, the State did not acknowledge Travellers' wish and desire to be recognised.  The first admission of this came under a universal periodic review, UPR, process, under which Ireland was examined, and at which the then Minister, Alan Shatter, was the first Minister to say that he recognised Travellers' wish and desire and that he would give clear consideration to the matter.  The Attorney General's office has now confirmed that there is no such impediment.</p></speech>

What other potential legal expansion could be caused by this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacinta Brack" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#C01000"><p>I am not a legal expert, but part of the problem is that Travellers cannot rely on the Equal Status Act, despite the fact that it takes into account the race directive, which is the transposing law.  This is directly because Travellers are not identified and named specifically as an ethnic group.  That would have been evident, as Mr. Joyce said earlier, in the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill bring brought before the D&aacute;il.  Ironically, when the current legislation, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, was going through the Houses, it did not include Travellers either, and national Traveller organisations had to lobby for inclusion.  The same goes for the Press Council.</p> <p>  To go back to Deputy O'Callaghan's first point, we consider the matter on the basis of the legal benefits, the practical benefits and the symbolic benefits of the wish and desire of Travellers.  However, regarding education, Travellers are not currently covered by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, for instance.  Therefore, if Travellers were to rely on the Equal Status Act to seek redress for indirect discrimination, they would not be able to rely on the current domestic legislation.  We saw this directly in the case we supported, which was taken to the Supreme Court, of a young boy in Tipperary who could not access a place in a secondary school because he could not comply with the father-son rule.</p><p>That is a difficulty for Travellers also.  There are a number of legal implications but it would mean that Travellers would be automatically included in Bills, which would be a huge benefit in the future.</p></speech>

Politicians probably tend to disappoint in the way we represent people but it is obvious from listening to the witnesses that we, and those who came before us, have not done enough for them.  It is good to hear their side of the story.  I have heard it many times and I accept that we have not done enough from our end.</p><p>To follow up on Deputy O'Callaghan's question on the reason the State has taken its position for so long, and Travellers have been marginalised for a very long time, aside from the question of costs, which is always a stumbling block for Governments, what do the witnesses believe is the reason this has gone on for so long?  How should we challenge the <i>status quo</i>to change the way issues are perceived?</p></speech>

There is a lack of political leadership in terms of getting behind the issue of ethnic recognition.  We are starting to see that we have allies, but it has long been the case that there was no political leadership or courage in terms of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority.  That is at the core of the reason we have not seen political leadership on this issue.  I do not know whether that is as a result of pressure being put on at local level or whatever, but this issue should be beyond local politics.  Political leadership should be shown on it.  Statements are made.  We come in and make submissions to the committee but a long time passes before anything happens.  We need those political champions, and we need political leadership from our politicians.  Unfortunately, we do not see a representative of the Traveller community in the Houses of the Oireachtas but there are measures that can be taken to address that.  That does not have to be a complicated process.  We have seen a catch-up as a result of quotas around women in terms of the inequality in the numbers of men and women in the D&aacute;il.  Initiatives could be put in place that would allow for visibility of Travellers in the Houses of the Oireachtas but, primarily, the problem is the lack of political leadership.</p></speech>

We have seen it through the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, and other instruments to which Ireland has signed up.  It has consistently come back and raised the issue of lack of recognition by the Irish State of Traveller ethnic status.  No later than last week it was looking to see why the State has not recognised Travellers as an ethnic group.  Those organisations have been strong allies, particularly in the past decade or so, because they have consistently asked the State why it has not recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.</p></speech>

The previous committee, which did good work, outlined that it would be better if there was no legislative change for recognition but rather it would be something the Taoiseach of the day would acknowledge in the House.  That ties into the idea that Travellers <i>de facto</i>are an ethnic group and therefore that is not a gift to be bestowed but something that the State should acknowledge.<br/><br/>However, in its absence, and as Deputy Wallace said, there is an underlying problem as to the reason that has not happened until now.  Unfortunately, and I am sure most Traveller leaders would agree, that has directly accrued from State policy around Travellers, and possibly a hostility in that relationship.  If we reflect on that, that takes account of all of the social indicators Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out with regard to infant mortality and all those other issues.  However, the State has to reflect on itself and it is possible that in acknowledging Traveller ethnicity it will rewrite the wrongs of the past.<br/><br/>In terms of other jurisdictions, a state apology was made in Australia.  In Taiwan, a group was given an apology by the state but was recognised as having a distinct 2% ethnic group within its majority population.  That has happened in other places, including for the Sami people in Sweden.  It is not unprecedented in the European context but it is long overdue here.  I hope that makes the position more clear.</p></speech>

Ireland is a very new state in terms of independence but it is also a state that has been colonised for hundreds of years, and Travellers have lived as a nomadic group on the island of Ireland.  When we look at the treatment of Travellers, we also have to look at the attitudes and the prejudices that prevail.  Ireland recently introduced equality legislation but the race directive had been in place in Europe for a significant length of time.  I live in the midlands, and it will take me an hour to bring myself and my five children to Newry.  It is ironic that in terms of the country that I was born in, and that my father and his father was born in, Meath is our home town yet we find that the status of our ethnicity as an indigenous people is not recognised.  We can go to another jurisdiction and find that there is a recognition of our ethnicity.  There is something fundamentally wrong with that.  We all have pride in who we are but have pride in who we are under extreme pressure.  We know that some people within the community have given up, and they struggle.  One can see the effects of that in terms of further isolation.</p> <p>  Representatives of the European Commission were in Ireland recently.  I have met them, as have members present.  They are also asking the Irish State, as are others, why this issue has taken so long.</p><p>There is an underlying institutionalised prejudice and racism and you cannot take one without the other.  The State has a long way to go.  I do not see this recognition as the silver bullet that will address all of the other issues.  I see it as part of a process whereby when we engage with the State, we engage on an equal footing with members - even Deputies - and that they are not looking at Travellers as somehow being failed Irish settled people, because we are not.  I grew up in a time of segregation when schools were separated.  I was put into special classes and was given different times.  I struggle with that, even today, because that type of treatment was unacceptable.  Why did that treatment happen and why were we growing up on the roadside without facilities and without access to supports?  I do not claim to be a leader but what brought me in to this is that I do claim to be a person who wants to address the wrongs of Ireland.  I feel very proud of being Irish but I feel very strongly that part of this is being an Irish Traveller.  It is who I am and is in my DNA.  It is important that this is a political decision not for one Member or one party, it is a decision that has to be made, as Ms Maria Joyce has said, by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I would take great confidence and sense of pride in being Irish if that decision was made.  It is not about how long is a piece of string, it is about when that decision would be made.  That is fundamentally why we are here.  We would like to see a timeline put onto this process.</p></speech>

I am not missing out Senator Kelleher but I have to try to accommodate the committee members first in deference to their specific interest and work on this matter.  I have noted the names of those who have shown their hands to speak.  They are Deputies Jack Chambers and Jonathan O'Brien, followed by Senator Colette Kelleher, who is most welcome to the committee, and Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.

They have presented raw facts which are truly shocking and show how the core pillars of the State in education, health care and housing have really undermined and forgotten a community and group in Irish society.  As my colleague Deputy O'Callaghan has said, when one looks at infant mortality rates, educational outcomes and pretty much every metric we use to look at any group or pocket of any community, the statistics are off the Richter scale.  To me this is shocking in the year we are in.  It is something that we have to positively address.  The report has made its recommendations and I know members have asked questions already but I would like to know about the international context.  From doing some background work I know that the Sami people received recognition in the 1970s and there also has been recognition in the North, Scotland and Wales.  As part of the type of process referred to by Mr. Joyce, where possible changes to some of the core political and policy issues could actually result in positive changes in outcomes for the Traveller community, can the witnesses outline or give some perspective on the comparative experience and what changes have occurred in the metrics of the communities in other places and how recognition has helped elsewhere?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Joyce" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#E00400"><p>One of the key benefits of recognition, as raised particularly by the Sami people, was to self-esteem and to the value of their culture, ethnicity and way of life within the country they were part of.  That self-esteem, particularly for the younger generations, was one of the core fundamentals that they felt as a benefit of recognition.  As has been said, everything will not be corrected tomorrow but recognition would mean the inclusion of the Traveller community in anti-racism and inter-cultural initiatives.  For example, Travellers were excluded from the integration policies that were developed by the State.  Recognition would mean inclusion of the Traveller community in wider human rights legislation, domestic and international, which will start bringing about change.  In response to a question that was asked earlier, the mindset in Ireland has to change.  We are coming from the policies and mindsets of the 1960s such as the Commission on Itinerancy, which saw the Traveller community as a problem and saw Travellers as needing to be assimilated and corrected.  It is not just mindsets because we have seen it reflected in policy after policy of the State with regard to Travellers being in some way at fault for the inequalities and oppression they experience within the Irish State.  Recognition would bring changes to the esteem within the community.  I am incredibly proud to be a Traveller but younger Travellers in particular are bombarded with negativity from all angles, pretty much most of the time, be it through the media, policing, the Judiciary or through political statements.  A combination of the measures will start to move things in a way that they need to be moved.  There are some positive policies that have been developed in partnership with the State in trying to address some of those inequalities but one of the key areas in which we fall down is the lack of implementation.  When considering the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, the State should be held more to account when there is no implementation of policies that are in place for Travellers to address some of that inequality.  A combination of a number of factors are needed to start to address those figures.  We see, very strongly, that recognition of Traveller ethnicity is one of those starting points.</p></speech>

I now invite Deputy Jonathan O'Brien to contribute.</p></speech>

At the outset, I reiterate Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's comments about the previous committee having done a lot of work on this issue.  The work this committee is doing is not to replace that committee's work but will complement it and keep the issue on the political agenda.  I also acknowledge the efforts by the Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, to keep this on the agenda.  There is no doubt that the State's treatment of the Traveller community is absolutely disgraceful.  I would fully support any Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality of the day who would come into the D&aacute;il Chamber to acknowledge Traveller ethnicity.  Any Taoiseach or Minister for Justice and Equality who did that would find strong support across the political spectrum.  The question is, why has it not happened to date?  There are probably a number of reasons, but the glaringly obvious reason is that we have a permanent government within the State which is unaccountable, has not been elected, and which has dictated policy for decades.</p><p>There is institutional prejudice against Travellers at that level in the State.  This is one of the reasons in my opinion.  Not only should a Taoiseach or Minister come in and acknowledge Traveller ethnicity, he or she should apologise for the State's treatment of the Traveller community over decades, going back to the commission on itinerancy right up to the present day, even 12 months ago and the appalling aftermath and treatment of the Carrickmines tragedy, which was absolutely disgraceful.</p><p> There absolutely needs to be political will, but I cannot get my head around what is stopping any Taoiseach or Minister from coming in and acknowledging Traveller ethnicity.  It is not something that will be opposed in the Chamber.  It is not something that any political party will seize on as an opportunity to score a political point.  There is cross-party support for this and it needs to happen.  There is no excuse for it and no rationale as to why it cannot happen.  Even if it was an issue of cost, how is cost measured?  We have financial costs but we also have human costs.  While these excuses may have been reasons down through the years, they do not stack up, and they particularly do not stack up with the Attorney General's statement that there is no impediment when it comes to cost.  This is about a political choice by the Taoiseach or the Minister of the day coming in, not, as has been said, bestowing a gift on the Traveller community but acknowledging it; and not only acknowledging it, but acknowledging that the State has played a huge role in decades of institutional societal racism, prejudice, discrimination and the need to recognise this.  The recognition of Traveller ethnicity would be a start, and an apology would go an awfully long way in the community.  This is what needs to happen.  I do not believe anyone on the committee would be opposed to this, and if there is, that person should not be on a committee entitled the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses comment on this?  If possible, I ask for just one person to comment because I want to give everyone the opportunity to participate.

I thank the witnesses for their wonderful presentation and kind words.  I went to the Traveller Counselling Service conference in Dublin Castle last week, which was really well attended and included two Ministers.  I was struck by the positivity of the conference even in the face of adversity.  There were people there who in recent weeks had lost young men to suicide, but they were there wanting to work.  The name of the conference was Bridging the Gap through Partnership, and the resilience that has been described was clear, as was the link between recognition of ethnicity and people's sense of well-being and self-esteem.  There are many legal and political implications, but people's sense of themselves and the wish to live was really clearly made.  Two European bodies have made judgments against the Government regarding violations of Traveller rights, including the recognition matter.  Will the witnesses briefly update the committee on these judgments?  Do they recommend that the committee considers the findings of the judgments and advises the Government on their implications?</p></speech>

This bears a context here because the committee did not find this on the basis of discrimination, although ethnicity might be something which would have supported the argument.  It found Ireland to be in violation on five grounds.  The other recent finding was from the European Commission, which found that Ireland will possibly face infringement because of its lack of recognition of Traveller ethnicity and with regard to the inadequate provision of Traveller accommodation.  The Committee of Ministers recently endorsed the findings of the collective complaint under the charter, on October 5, and the finding of the European Commission was just a week ago.</p></speech>

I have a number of points to make and a question to ask.  I will not hit the witnesses with a load of platitudes regarding statistics.  While I appreciate the statistics, I do not need to tell the witnesses how awful they are because they know better than anyone around the table the very negative impact on the Traveller community.  I am a new member of the committee and I appreciate the Chairman maintaining engagement on this issue because it allows us new members to become better informed as we do work on the issue in the time ahead.</p> <p>  The issue of an apology was mentioned and I want to touch on this because I thought some of the points raised by Deputy O'Brien were pertinent.  In the North we engage with the Government all the time to campaign and lobby the British Government, EU colleagues and others on the issue of apologies and recognition of hurt, pain and loss inflicted on communities in the North.  It tells us it is doing this, and it is an absolute stain on it and a shame that it would have the audacity to ask other people for apologies, as right as it is in doing this and as justifiable and as much as they are needed, without affording the apology to our Traveller citizens for the hurt, pain and institutionalised prejudice, sometimes brutality inflicted on them.</p> <p>  My question is on the issue of recognition, and recognition in the North has been touched on.  Many of our Traveller communities in the North still face the same issues outlined by the witnesses, even with recognition.  For the benefit of those of us who are new and those of us coming to this issue, and some of this has been touched on, will the witnesses expand slightly on what it will look like?  What will it mean in a practical legislative tangible way for the Traveller community?  I appreciate the issue of recognition of itself is important culturally, psychologically and for the community, but in terms of some of the issues touched on by Ms Joyce, for example, the lack of Traveller representation in the Houses, do they call for quotas?  Would it allow for this?  Perhaps it is too much.  Perhaps the witnesses can provide us with information, and if this is the case I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

Fundamentally it will mean that where these kinds of policies are being developed by central Government or within the various Departments Travellers will automatically be included.  We hope that in practical terms it will mean greater or real partnership in terms of engagement with Travellers by the State.  There are spaces where we engage in consultation and unfortunately we have been in those spaces for many years.  If one even takes the accommodation sector as an example, there have been 18 years of consultation yet the numbers of Travellers on the roadside, sharing accommodation, or in crisis accommodation is increasing.  It is not indicative of something that is working.  We want real partnership in which we are part of the decision-making processes in a real way.  <br/><br/>Deputy O'Brien spoke about Carrickmines, which should have been considered a heartbreaking and devastating event in the history of the State.  While there was certain goodwill, we saw very quickly that when it came to accommodating the grieving families of the people who had died, not even space for accommodation could be created.  Some of the statements that came out politically at the time said it was right that the settled majority should be consulted if a Traveller is living beside them.  In the aftermath of ten people dying, they could not even find accommodation to create a safe space for the grieving families.  We need real partnership in terms of the practicalities and the positive policies that are not being implemented.  One would like to think there will be mechanisms of accountability where if policies are not being implemented, the buck stops somewhere but that is not the case if one looks at statistics in education, inequality of access, participation and outcomes for Traveller children and in terms of health, both physical and mental, across the whole community.<font color="#FF0080"> </font>One would hope that one of the practical benefits will be direct partnership between the State and Travellers and Traveller organisations.</p></speech>

Society and Ireland has moved on.  We are a very diverse society and we welcome different communities.  Our make-up and DNA is very different but we are all human.  I feel strongly and passionately about that but I also feel a certain hurt and pain that people have within the community.  Carrickmines was a tragedy but it also brought out a sense of the attitudes that exist within Irish society.  We do not want another Carrickmines.  We want to see a community that can be supported, enabled and take pride in who it is.  The question in terms of recognition is only one part of the process going forward.  If one looks at Northern Ireland and the process that has taken place there, we are starting from a very different footing in terms of the political activation and lobbying.  We are asking for recognition of a more symbolic nature.</p> <p>  The second part is in terms of the State addressing the ills of past policies.  The 1963 itinerancy report refers to issues such as simulation not integration.  It referred to removing the culture within the Traveller community and absorbing it into the wider community.  We are concerned about the new generation, that when they go into schools, they do not feel a sense of shame about who they are.  When a lot of young people go into schools, teachers ask whether they should use the word "Traveller".  This is because there is no leadership at a national level.  That is something that needs to be driven from today and needs to be progressed.  Given that the State has been independent for almost 100 years, the timing is right for the decision to be made on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity before the end of the year.  If that was something the committee could recommend, it would be significant from a Traveller perspective.</p></speech>

I represent the constituency in Cork where Spring Lane is located.  Mr. Joyce will be well aware of Spring Lane.  It is a Carrickmines that is going to happen.  The reason it will happen is because of the underlying discrimination and prejudice against the families living on that site.   That is led at community and local level.  It is being fostered because at institutional and State level it has been almost made acceptable to discriminate against Travellers.</p></speech>

Throughout the country, the potential for that in Traveller-specific accommodation is frightening.  Only one short year on from that tragedy, things have gotten worse and there has not been a serious knuckling down to address the issues that need to be addressed in terms of Traveller accommodation.</p></speech>

It is important to record that the last committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy David Stanton, did very sound work on this issue.  This committee recognises it is important to inject fresh new impetus.  We have a new configuration in terms of politics represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is critically important, as some of those who have spoken have indicated, that there has been a big influx of new voices and they are having their chance to be a part of this for the report.  We hope it will make the critical difference.  The intent is that it will encourage and embolden those who can bring this issue across the line.  For me, and I would imagine for all my colleagues on the Joint Committee for Justice and Equality, this past 12 months has been a period during which I have experienced a repeated sense of shame as a citizen - shame over the tragedy of Carrickmines and the fact, as has just been recorded, that it could happen again; shame at the repeated evictions in Dundalk; shame at the closed school doors; and shame at the media which continues to label.  There is much to be done and the bringing of Traveller ethnicity into formal recognition would help to address all of that, hopefully in the very near future.</p> <p>  I thank Bernard Joyce, Maria Joyce and Jacinta Brack for their contributions today.  They were most illuminating and very helpful.  I thank my colleagues on the committee.  I invite the witnesses to join us for a photograph which we will append to the report which will go to the Minister, who will see who has come before us and the quality of their contributions.</p><p>We will suspend for five minutes and resume with our second session, which will be with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Emily Logan, Chief Commissioner, and Mr. David Joyce, a member of the commission, to the meeting.  On behalf of the committee, I thank them both for their attendance.  The joint committee has identified the issue of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity as one of the priority issues in its 2016 work programme.  We are very cognisant of the value of the previous committee's addressing of this particular subject.  Our efforts are intended to complement and build on that work not to replicate it or in any way set it aside.  It is a process.  We hope this exercise, not only today but in our subsequent engagements over the next couple of weeks, will make a valued contribution to the issue.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that the commission's representatives will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question-and-answer engagement with members.  Before we begin, I draw the attention of the witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.  Witnesses should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Chief Commissioner to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#H00400"><p>Mr. David Joyce and I are here to represent the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to do that.  As Ireland's national human rights institution and national equality body, the commission not only has a statutory remit to protect and promote human rights and equality in Ireland but also a remit to promote a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding.  A core part of our three-year strategy statement is the promotion of pluralism and the acceptance of difference and we are committed to encouraging a culture of respect for freedom, dignity and understanding of human rights and equality in the State.</p> <p>  Along with its predecessor bodies, the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, the commission has consistently raised concerns about the human rights and equality protections afforded to the Traveller community in Ireland.  We will continue to raise these matters at every opportunity domestically and internationally.  The recognition of Travellers as a distinct ethnic group is not in doubt, yet for the purpose of international agreements and before the United Nations and other international bodies, overt recognition has continued to be denied by successive Governments.  This is a serious and ongoing concern and the commission strongly considers that the time has come for the State finally to move on the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority.</p><p>The State is bound by the international consensus that self-determination forms the basis of a person identifying as belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group.  International bodies have historically and continue to recognise the Traveller community as an ethnic minority and have consistently recommended the Irish State does likewise.  We already see <i>de facto</i>recognition of Traveller ethnicity in our equality legislation.  The definition of &quot;Travellers&quot; adopted by the Oireachtas for the purpose of the Equal Status Acts states: &quot;&quot;Traveller community&quot; means the community of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.&quot;<br/><br/>We also see implicit recognition in other contexts, such as the inclusion of Travellers as a specific group for the purposes of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for Protection of National Minorities, as well as the State's reports to the United Nations at the time of its examinations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and under the International Covenant for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, the logic of the State's ongoing refusal to recognise Traveller ethnicity must be questioned.  As recommended by the predecessor to this committee in its 2014 report on the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, &quot;It is no longer tenable for this State to deny Traveller ethnicity&quot;.<br/><br/>Protections under the UN International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Ireland has been bound since ratification in 2000, are largely linked to ethnicity.  Importantly, continued inaction by the State on Traveller ethnicity diminishes the State's international credibility with the UN.  Ireland will be examined with regard to its obligations on the elimination of racial discrimination in 2017 through a written submission, followed by an oral examination before a committee in 2018.  The commission believes the matter of Traveller ethnicity requires resolution well in advance of this important examination of our record on racial discrimination before the United Nations.<br/><br/>There is no legal impediment to the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  This important change to recognise our indigenous Traveller community does not require a referendum nor does it require primary legislation.  The Government committed in front of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2011 to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  What is required is not even a ministerial order but a statement in the D&aacute;il.  It, therefore, begs the question as to why this has not already happened.<br/><br/>The negative impact of non-recognition on the engagement between the Traveller community and State is unnecessary.  With the unequivocal recognition of a distinct culture and identity, we can better anticipate and respond to the needs of the Traveller community.  In late 2015, following the Carrickmines tragedy, we heard in political debates how several local authorities had not even drawn down moneys allocated for Traveller accommodation.  It is perhaps more useful now to think about how recognition will be the catalyst for a rethink of how we spend public money on policies affecting Travellers and how priorities should be considered in a new light.<br/><br/>We can build on a strong foundation of equality of standing in the context of the relationship between the Traveller and settled communities.  From that starting point, the issues which are important to our society can begin to be discussed in a more meaningful and mutually respectful context.  With that, we can continue the work of understanding what needs to change in law and policy to support members of the Traveller community, for example, in accessing education, culturally appropriate and safe accommodation and health care, among other priority areas.<br/><br/>Respect for Traveller cultural identity must be reflected in Government policy decisions.  How can this happen in the absence of recognition of Traveller ethnicity?  It is the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's position that it cannot.  There continues to be a strong political argument in favour of recognition.  We recognise the political leadership shown by this committee and its predecessor.  There needs to be a significant and symbolic step in a longer conversation, however.  The recognition of Traveller ethnicity must be placed in the broader international context of discussion of others, outsiders and division.  This is an opportunity for us to show our national political leadership, setting ourselves as a standard bearer against those who would seek to hold back progress towards equality and human rights provision.  We must show through our political actions, our Irish fortitude against international voices of intolerance and mark our determination to act positively.<br/><br/>The achievement of equality and respect for human rights must involve access to recognition, status and standing in society and to relationships of respect.  The recognition of Traveller ethnicity is central to any equality of status or standing for the Traveller community.</p></speech>

Deputy Jonathan O'Brien indicated earlier on that there may be dark reasons as to why.  Maybe it is more a benign reason in that there is a concern among officials in the Department of Justice and Equality that recognition will give rise to new causes of action which may result in litigation.</p></speech>

A significant number of rights already exist under the Constitution, while the international conventions to which we have signed up also confer rights.  They have not resulted in any extra litigation or a flood of cases before the courts.  The argument that ethnicity will create extra litigation does not follow.</p> <p>  Breaches which exist and give rise to causes of action relate to accommodation and provision.  Many of those causes of action already exist in our domestic legislation where there is a failure by a local authority to fulfil its statutory obligations.  International conventions to which we have signed up are not directly applicable before our courts.  We cannot realign them as tools in legal argument.  The only rights which can be relied on probably exist in our domestic legislation.</p> <p>  I cannot see how the recognition of ethnicity confers extra political and legal rights specifically on Travellers.  It may have an impact on a broader notion of equality in the State.  There is nothing in recognising Traveller ethnicity, however, that will put them above and beyond any other citizen in respect of a cause of action.  That is the commission's understanding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#J00400"><p>The notion of self-determination has been misunderstood.  Not only has there been a protracted denial of Traveller ethnicity but somehow the idea that consensus between the community itself must be reached before Traveller ethnicity can be recognised misunderstands the principle of self-determination.  It is up to individuals to self-identify as a member of an ethnic group.</p> <p>  As someone working in human rights for many years, I know there has been hostility towards economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland.  Ireland is not unique in that regard.  We are talking about people who have particular needs and require additional assistance from the State.  There are many other groups who require additional assistance from the State.  The State already devotes considerable resources to supporting Travellers.  Taking the example of housing, many local authorities did not draw down moneys for Traveller accommodation.  That is where the deeper and more uncomfortable questions begin.</p> <p>  After the Carrickmines tragedy, we saw the political discomfort with the public response to providing accommodation for the bereaved families.  We cannot pretend or hide the fact it creates discomfort.  As a non-Traveller, I do many interviews in which I am not asked any questions about members of my community.  Traveller leaders are constantly asked about feuding or questions which are discriminatory or prejudiced in nature.  I do not expect that nor am I asked those kinds of questions.  Our starting position should not be one of prejudice.  The lens through which we should look at this is one of respect.  Of course members and leaders of the Traveller community are willing to talk about the uncomfortable, as well as the more positive, matters.</p><p>We, as a community, must start from a position of respect in order to engage in that discourse.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Joyce" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#K00300"><p>I am certainly not aware of any, let us say, indigenous Irish groups.  The reality is that groups in Ireland, and particularly new communities, are, by definition, ethnic groups in any event under our current law.  Irrespective of whether ethnicity is based on nationality or based on religions and other factors, they are effectively ethnic groups under the law that exists.  The concept of ethnicity is defined in the Equal Status Act - there are objective criteria which those groups meet.  So there are numerous ethnic groups in Irish society.  The distinction here is that we are talking about an indigenous community in Ireland which, in my personal belief and in any objective belief, fulfil the objective criteria to define an ethnic group.  The public statements of the State effectively deny that.</p> <p>  One could ask what other ethnic groups we are talking about.  We could talk about language groups.  Could the people living in Gaeltacht areas suddenly say that, based on a language, they are an ethnic group?  Possibly, but that is not a call.  The point is that there are ethnic groups under the current legislation and certainly under objective criteria.  However, Travellers being an indigenous Irish group seem to be the only group that seems to be denied that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#K00400"><p>The question everyone is asking is why we have not acknowledged Traveller ethnicity.  In the context of the work done by the previous committee, of the work of this committee and of the work done outside the Oireachtas, nobody has ever come up with a valid reason.  Deputy O'Callaghan touched on my own belief, which I will repeat.  I am of the view that there is an institutional prejudice against Travellers within the permanent government.  Governments come and go; permanent civil servants stay.  It is not beyond reasoning that there is that high-level opposition to recognising Traveller ethnicity.  I have not been able to come up with any other rationale or reasoning for it.  It is very frustrating.</p> <p>  As Mr. David Joyce said, we do not even need a new legislation.  We simply need a Minister for Justice and Equality or the Taoiseach to come in and make a statement.  It is a statement that could be made at any time and would probably get the support of the vast majority of Oireachtas Members.  One would have to question why that statement has not been made.  I just do not understand it.</p> <p>  In response to the question of whether it would give rise to an increase in legal cases, Mr. David Joyce's answer was that, in his opinion, it would not.  It is just another reason that has been knocked off the list of possible reasons for it to be denied.  For years it was supposed to have been down to cost; it is no longer an issue of cost.  It is no longer an issue of increased legal cases.  The only reason I can come up with is that there is an institutional racism against Travellers at the highest level in the State.  There is even a possibility that in some people's minds if they give that recognition to Traveller ethnicity, then it is almost like an admission of guilt that for the past 40 or 50 years, the State has been engaged in institutional racism against an indigenous section of people.  That is the only rational I can come up with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#K00500"><p>After the Carrickmines tragedy we met officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council who have great power to make decisions that affect Travellers.  We know that accommodation is one of the determinants of health, so it is fundamental.  From that meeting it was clear that there was a lack of understanding of culturally appropriate decision making.  That is not to suggest that the people held prejudicial views.  My observation was that these people had no training whatsoever and had not been given any guidance on how to make a culturally appropriate decision.  These officials were responding to a public demand to not accommodate the bereaved families in Carrickmines.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned institutional racism.  I think it pervades our society, sadly.  Some politicians have shown great leadership, but we need people to have that courage and take that step.  Given that we are gradually deleting things off that list of what were perceived obstacles to recognition of Traveller ethnicity, what is left?  What is left is what the Deputy described as institutional thinking and political leadership.  In the spirit of the legislation to which we operate, which uses the word "encourage", which may sound soft, our job is to try to encourage political leadership.</p> <p>  We are seeing it across Europe, which is a concern.  More migrants will be coming to Ireland.  If we cannot get it right for our own indigenous people, what does that say for our future?  This is a first step to Ireland growing up and facing up to its history.  While it is uncomfortable, it requires both institutional and political leadership.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#K00600"><p>My point is that while we can never excuse people's prejudice or racism against the Travelling community at a local level, why is it allowed to continue?  Following an incident such as what happened in Carrickmines, is it any wonder that members of the settled community feel comfortable, wrong as it is, with standing up and saying they want no Travellers in their back yard when they see the example of the State treating members of that community as second-class citizens?  It is about political leadership and political will, which has to come from the top down but also has to come from the bottom up.  One can call them dark forces or whatever, but there is an institutional racism against Travellers in this State.  In some people's minds, acknowledging their ethnicity would be admitting that we treated them wrong for the past 40 years and are not willing to admit that yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Joyce" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#K00700"><p>There needs to be an understanding of institutional racism and some of the actions and outcomes of an institution's action and the impact on a particular group where it has not allowed for the possibility that the group will come out worse because the policies of a particular institution.  The State obviously is an institution and the D&aacute;il is an institution within that.  Once one can identify that and the outcome of actions of an institution, one could say that within that institution there is certainly a blindness to the needs of minorities.  If that is based on racism, one can describe it as that and call it for what it is as institutional racism.  It does not mean that individuals within the institution are inherently racist or that they hold racist opinions - I refer to the workings of a group.</p> <p>  Parliaments - and not just the Irish Parliament - are classic at doing this.</p><p>Parliaments across Europe are sometimes blinded by not equality-proofing legislation to ensure that groups with cultural, ethnic or racial backgrounds in their societies are treated equally and by not assessing the impact of the legislation.  That can be put down to institutional racism.  What happens in national parliaments reflects society because the members of the parliament are elected by the people.  A majority view of the Traveller community was reflected in public comment following Carrickmines.  It is only logical that this will be reflected in parliament.  Some of the legislation passed by the Irish Parliament had the ingredients of an institution that was blind and did not proof itself, and reflected a negative and racist attitude towards members of the Traveller Community.  Organisations such as the commission are established by parliaments to ensure that does not continue.  Our role is to comment on legislation and sometimes to focus the thoughts of Parliament on equality and human rights in legislation.  That does not remove the responsibility of Parliament to behave in a proper way but we can ensure that legislation should not have the same impact on minorities, particularly the Traveller Community.   </p></speech>

Has the commission had any direct engagement with the Ministers or Department officials about this?  This seems to be a problem.

We had also engaged with him as chair of the predecessor committee.  He has very publicly expressed his support as a politician.  I do not think there is any individual issue but it is difficult to know quite what the impediment is if there are no legal impediments.  We have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton and to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I do not on an individual basis get a sense that either of them would oppose the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p></speech>

The real challenge is not so much that organisations like this commission or Traveller organisations have come before this committee to try to get an answer.  The challenge is to the State, including the Government and Parliament, to explain why it is not happening.  International committees that have studied this and that we have obligations to report to as a State, are basing their assessments on objective criteria which they believe Travellers will fill.  The commission's position is coming from the objective criteria to define ethnicity.  Those who refuse to acknowledge or accept the reality of Traveller ethnicity perhaps need to explain why.  It is not for us to be able to explain to the committee why it is not happening.  I would like the objections explained much more clearly.  Perfectly valid arguments have been put forward in the past, such as does it cost more?  Do Travellers constitute an ethnic group by objective criteria?  What does it mean?  Will it be an extra cost to the State?  These are reasonable and legitimate concerns.  They have been addressed consistently over recent years.  The previous committee considered that.  I believe there is advice from the Attorney General as well which states that there are no legal or extra-legal implications.  The challenge is for those who continually prevaricate on the question to explain why they prevaricate.  It is not for me, the commission or the Traveller organisations to say the State should recognise Traveller ethnicity.  It is for those who are denying it to explain that denial.  If there are other valid reasons they can be addressed but the real valid reasons have been addressed in recent years and the challenge is back to those who are denying it.</p></speech>

I do not doubt the resolve of those who made that statement and undertook to see the matter delivered.  The passage of time since then has most certainly affected the confidence of the Traveller community and wider society who are eager and anxious for this measure to be delivered.  We hope that, whatever has contributed to the dilatoriness since, our having addressed this issue and the publication of our report hopefully before the end of next month will reinforce that earlier demand and help us get across the line.</p> <p>  In Ms Logan's opening remarks she referred to the fact that we will be coming under greater international scrutiny in respect of the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.  She indicated that the written response required from this State in 2017 which is just around the corner is to be followed by an oral engagement with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, in 2018.  Could she elaborate on this in the wider context of addressing racial discrimination?  The State's failure, if it is the case at that time, to formally recognise Traveller ethnicity would have to be a component part of the written submission and the acknowledgement of this State's failures.</p></speech>

The convention is inextricably linked to ethnicity, therefore most of its provisions relate to ethnicity or look to provide services for the Traveller community on the basis of its ethnicity.  There is a bit of confusion.  We are being judged by the international community, which accepts our indigenous Traveller community as ethnic.</p><p> The second is the European Commission, in regard to the EU race directive.  It has already been to Ireland for meetings.  Mr. Joyce may have mentioned this at the last session.  It has expressed concern about the ongoing mistreatment of the Traveller community.  I was contacted by a third person yesterday, Mr. Nils Mui&zcaron;nieks.  I do not know if committee members know him.  He is the Human Rights Commissioner on the Council of Europe, which is the regional human rights institution.  It is related to the European Court of Human Rights and includes 47 member states.  He specifically wants to do a country visit.  He has heard concerns about the treatment of Travellers and Roma in Ireland.  His wanting to visit Ireland is an unusual and extraordinary move.  International momentum and concern will develop over the next few months.  We want to keep that momentum going, as the Chairman said earlier.</p><p> Any time we sit before the UN there are ten treaty monitoring bodies.  We independently report on Ireland's progress on human rights in front of these UN experts.  They always start with a preamble about the wonderful work that happens in Ireland in terms of overseas development, our humanitarian work and our international reputation for human rights.  We are asked why we are so talented overseas or internationally, but cannot come to terms with our demonstrably poor past in terms of how we have treated the Traveller community and our respect and dignity for that community as we head into a new phase.

It will prove to be the case that members will recognise and accept that the recognition of Traveller ethnicity is a new beginning in the relationships between indigenous communities on the island.  There has been, at times, a fraught relationship between some in the settled community and the Traveller community.  The matter has to be addressed.</p> <p>  What role can education play, in terms of the work of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, in impacting on political consciousness?  I would see it as a new starting point.  There is much to be done in confronting the forces that imbue discriminatory thoughts and ideas that perpetuate the most unacceptable disposition of, sadly, so many, as has been demonstrated over the years in our society towards our Traveller brothers and sisters.</p> <p>  Education is central in addressing those faultlines in our societal make-up.  From the point of view of the Commission, does Ms Logan, in her engagement with the Government and Department, insist on the development of programmes within all levels of education that would properly contribute to combatting those faultlines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016102600002#M00300"><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a role to play in raising awareness and promoting a culture of respect for human rights and equality.  Training and education is a key part of that.  We have collaborated with the IPA to run a professional diploma course in human rights and equality for people working in public and civil administration.  The course was launched the week before last, and was oversubscribed.  There are 50 people working from within the public sector on the course, including people from the court system, garda&iacute;, hospitals and health care professionals.  We were pleased with the uptake of the course.  It is a beginning.</p> <p>  One of the new provisions in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act introduced on 1 November 2014 is what is called a positive duty.  Traditionally, human rights were articulated as a negative obligation to prohibit discrimination, but section 42 places a positive obligation on the State and all public bodies to do three things.  The first is to eliminate discrimination, the second is to promote equality of treatment and opportunity, and the third is to have regard for human rights. </p> <p>  We are already working with some key organisations to try to pilot the training and education scheme.  We have had conversations with the LGMA, the local authorities' representative body.  It is a key sector, in particular given today's discussion on Traveller accommodation as a fundamental part of security and as a determinant of health for Travellers.  We are starting with local authorities and housing.</p> <p>  We are also working with the Ombudsman and regulators who investigate thousands of cases a year and hear from thousands of complainants.  If they start making recommendations and embedding that thinking in the recommendations we will, over time, get a response from public bodies.  We are also working with some community development organisations.  </p> <p>  The fourth strand is higher education.  We have a pilot project with University College Cork on the public sector duty to encourage academic institutions, as educators and influences of education regionally, to get on board.  We are at the early stages of development. </p> <p>  The Chairman is absolutely correct.  Education is key, and as a human rights and equality commission we will put our shoulder to the wheel and play a part.  It is a small part of what is required.  We are here for the long haul.  This kind of work takes a long time but we are absolutely committed to the process.</p></speech>

Higher education is very important in addressing discrimination.  It needs to start at the earliest stage of the formation of thoughts, ideas and interpersonal relationships.  I look forward to seeing more on that in the future.</p> <p>  I am reminded of a phrase my grandmother taught me many years ago, "There are good goods in small parcels."  I am sorry that all members were not able to attend the second session, but I thank those who have for contributions they made.  I also thank the commissioner, Ms Logan, and Mr. Joyce, whom I have heard speak before on this issue and for whom I have great respect.  It is wonderful to have the opportunity to have him come before the committee today.  I also thank his colleague, Mr. Brian Dawson, from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission who is in the Gallery.

During these deliberations we will examine all aspects of rural communities in modern Ireland including employment, emergency services, local services, quality of life, education and transport.  Today's meeting will look at stream 1, employment, which in many ways is the most important element in sustaining local rural areas.  It includes investment, development and employment in rural areas, doing business and locating workers in rural areas, incentives for rural enterprise, resource-based industries and creative and media industries.

I am Niall O'Donnellan, head of strategy and regions within Enterprise Ireland and I am accompanied here by Mr. Garrett Murray, our head of policy and strategy.  We have prepared an opening statement which has been circulated to committee members.  I will highlight three aspects for the conversation and then we will be open to questions and comments afterwards.</p> <p>  First I will address the impact of our clients.  We work with 5,000 clients throughout Ireland who employ some 192,000 people directly and in excess of 300,000 throughout the State.  In 2014 to 2015 those jobs increased by 10,000.  Half of the jobs are in counties outside of the big cities and half the increase was also outside the big cities.  Some &euro;24 billion is spent in actual purchasing of services and goods from others within the Irish economy as well.  That is the major impact of these 5,000 companies that are in every town, village and county throughout the State.  We call them hidden champions and they have a similar impact to that of multinational clients and are central to the growth in the Irish economy.  One in six people employed in the Irish economy are employed directly or indirectly in these companies.  Roughly half of those jobs are in counties outside of major cities.</p> <p>  The second element I wish to highlight is Enterprise Ireland's focus on regional and rural development.  The focus is in three areas, the first of which is to grow the established companies where they are.  Many of the companies are where the founder and his or her family have lived for many years.  Our focus is on helping those companies to grow internationally through our overseas offices, capability programmes, leadership programmes and providing funding to those companies.  I refer, for example, to companies such as VistaMed, which has expanded with 200 jobs announced this year in Leitrim, Grant Thornton in Longford with 50 jobs and LotusWorks Engineering in Sligo.  The second area of focus is around encouraging start-ups, both those which are selling globally and those which are working with the local enterprise office network.  In that context, it is interesting to note that the competition for young entrepreneurs, Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur, has had over 2,000 applicants in the latest round, which is a significant signal that a lot of people are interested in starting new businesses.  The third focus is on the regional action plan, which focuses on things in each region such as skills, innovation, broadband and infrastructure that can help businesses and employment in those areas.</p> <p>  The third issue I wish to highlight is the issue of Brexit.  One third of our clients export more than 50% of their exports to the UK.  Brexit is obviously a major challenge.  Enterprise Ireland sees Brexit as a structural, long-term, fundamental change that is going to change everything for our companies and the whole economy.  The immediate impact is the currency exchange, but there are lots of other issues that are about to unfold.  This is a major issue, particularly in sectors such as food and engineering, that have relatively low margins and have particular exposure to the UK market and to UK competition.  It is also perhaps a wake-up call to all companies to actually focus on innovation and competitiveness as key aspects of sustaining and growing jobs throughout the economy and throughout the State.</p></speech>

I am going to ask Mr. Neil McDonnell, the chief executive of ISME, to make his presentation and we will then take questions to both organisations.  We take the presentations from the two other organisations after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#C01100"><p>I thank the Chairman and I apologise to the committee for the absence of ISME chairman, Mr. James Coghlan, who was unavoidably detained on business this morning.  I do not propose to read our pre-circulated statement into the record.  I will, as my colleague has done, highlight the really important points from ISME's perspective on maintaining a rural community.  There are no surprises on the key issues.  Firstly, the availability of high-speed broadband is really a non-negotiable requirement.  It is as much part of the utility requirement for most small businesses as are electricity and clean water.  We simply have to have it and we will not have a dispersion of small businesses into rural areas unless we have the ubiquitous availability of high-speed, high-quality, low-cost broadband services.</p><p> We are conscious that the local enterprise offices structure changed in the past number of years when the old county enterprise boards were replaced.  We ask the committee to suggest a review of that system because, while the old relationship of those entities reporting directly to the Department still exists, we now have the introduction of the county manager as part of that structure.  This presents a difficulty for certain small businesses that might be, for instance, seeking funding to expand while, at the same time, they have a planning application before a local county council.  There may be a need to address the sensitivities that might exist there.</p><p> We are acutely conscious that rural transport has been under budgetary pressure for a number of years, but it is still worthwhile investing in it.  This is especially the case for those who are unable, unwilling or cannot afford to drive and have to access medical and commercial services.  We ask that the National Integrated Rural Transport Committee would examine the holistic provision of public transport in less densely populated parts of the west of Ireland.  We use French and Austrian alpine resorts as a comparator because free public transport that delivers for local people operates at almost a Luas level of service there throughout the day or at key hours.</p><p> Lastly, we have emphasised the ability of the Office of Government Procurement to spread wealth, enterprise and funding into regional areas through the provision of State services via eTenders so that services associated with construction and all forms of commercial and technical activity can be provided by small businesses in towns and villages in rural Ireland.  We believe that to be a far more beneficial social contribution to the fabric of rural areas than, say, social provision through the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I will do it in five minutes.</p><p>My understanding is that Enterprise Ireland currently owns no sites and that any sites owned in rural Ireland are actually owned by IDA Ireland.  As planning requirements get more difficult, should IDA Ireland's sites be transferred to Enterprise Ireland and should there be a policy of having serviced sites - not buildings - available for enterprise as well as the community enterprise centres?  Should there be serviced sites in towns so that if an entrepreneur is starting out he or she does not have to start out <i>ab initio</i>with a planning application?  </p><p>I think this question is best directed at the Western Development Commission.  There is need for what might be called long-term technical venture funding.  If there is a 20 or 30-year payback, it might not be called technical venture funding.  Is there need for some system of long-term funding to be made available in share capital by the State to start-up companies to ensure they have plenty of working capital?</p><p>How much is a lack of basic infrastructure such as roads and mobile and broadband coverage as well as perhaps electricity and water supply an inhibitor of industry and business in rural areas?</p><p>Would it be possible to have a map prepared that would show us where Enterprise Ireland industries are located throughout the country?  Could it be colour coded between food industries, technology industries and so on as well as by size?  There is a myth that the only industries in rural Ireland are micro-industries that relate to natural resources such as food, but my knowledge tells me the situation is not quite so simple.  We need to get the facts: where are they placed, what size are they and how should they be categorised.  Is it possible to get that information?</p><p>Are the State tendering turnover requirements inhibiting smaller local companies from tendering for State jobs, even quite modestly sized jobs?  Should all the major tenders have a clause to ensure that where big multinational companies win tenders they would have to employ local labour?  I think such a clause is used in the North of Ireland. </p></speech>

My first questions are for Enterprise Ireland.  A good chunk of indigenous Irish businesses is more exposed on the effects of Brexit, having more exports to Britain.  Those businesses are also more regionally distributed than foreign direct investment is typically.  Has Enterprise Ireland been asked to define exactly what it wants from a Brexit negotiation?  Is there a specific unit in Enterprise Ireland to deal with Brexit?  If so, how many staff are in it and what kind of budget does it have?  What is Enterprise Ireland's budget to deal with Brexit?  What discussions has Enterprise Ireland had with the Department on spatial strategy?  What kind of input has it had?  Could Mr. McDonnell answer that question too?  Has ISME had any negotiations or discussions with the Department on that issue?</p> <p>  Can the figures on jobs be broken down into rural areas?  Typically a rural area is considered to be an area outside a large to medium-sized town.  Are there specific figures for those areas?  While the distribution of Enterprise Ireland jobs is much better than that of IDA Ireland jobs, they are still not distributed evenly throughout the State.  There are pockets that do not have the same level of Enterprise Ireland jobs.  For example, the figures for County Kildare, which is a successful county in terms of Enterprise Ireland jobs, dwarf those of other comparable counties in terms of distance from Dublin and population.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?</p> <p>  What percentage of ISME member firms export to Britain?  What are its rural members' needs in terms of exports to Britain?</p> <p>  What do both organisations think of specific enterprise zones that are designed to give those who locate there a specific advantage?  At the moment there is a debate on Border development zones for certain areas along the Border given that the Border itself is a limiting element on enterprise and perhaps will be more so with a Brexit.  Have the witnesses given any thought to what a Border development zone would like and what it should comprise?  Sin iad mo cheisteanna.</p></speech>

I have just a few questions.</p><p>I intend to be a little parochial.  I represent Cork South-West, which is employment-starved.  While the situation in Cork city has been turned around a little, in terms of the green-shoots that are now appearing there, unfortunately, the three rural peninsulas I represent have lost a lot of young people and I have not yet seen anything that would help address the situation in any of those communities.  Perhaps the witnesses could map their activities for the committee, focusing in particular on their activities around job creation in rural areas and how we can work with them in that regard.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody.  It is incumbent on us all to work towards turning around the unemployment situation.  I do not want to see people having to leave west Cork to find employment either abroad or in Cork city or Dublin.  I believe we can create employment in the regions.  However, broadband service provision in rural areas is not improving.  In some cases, the situation is worsening, which is detrimental to rural areas.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on those issues.</p></speech>

In regard to venture capital for start-ups, particularly in small market towns in rural Ireland, has the idea of credit union involvement been explored?  If it has, I am not aware of it.  The credit unions are entities within all towns throughout the country that have an inherent interest in local job creation and in seeing their towns flourish and grow.  Has the possibility of combining their funding expertise with the expertise in innovation and marketing and so on of Enterprise Ireland been explored?  I believe that would be a potent combination.  Has that idea ever been discussed or explored?</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred earlier to the turnover limits for some of the larger State contracts tendered for in this country.  I know of an innovative company in Athenry that is constantly being turned away from significant investment opportunities because of the turnover limit.  This company has huge expertise and incredible affirmation of the quality of its product internationally but when it comes to securing contracts nationally it finds it exceptionally difficult to do so because of what I would argue is an outdated and silly turnover limit provision.</p> <p>  I live in an area located about 20 minutes from Galway city, which is booming in terms of job creation with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  What type of collaboration takes place between the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to determine what local supply chain opportunities occur for local companies when a large multinational locates in Galway, Wexford, Cork and so on?  Is there significant ongoing communication between the two entities to determine what the potential supply chain opportunities might be and, if so, how are indigenous companies made aware of these opportunities?  Also, what opportunities are presented in terms of the creation of new local indigenous companies?</p></speech>

Perhaps a member of ISME would elaborate on the French and Austrian Alpine solution and the free bus.  The issue of procurement has been raised.  I, too, would welcome some elaboration on that issue.</p> <p>  As stated by my colleague, Deputy Cannon, Galway city is booming on one level but there has always been an imbalance in Galway in terms of the volume of industry located on the east side of the city and the huge traffic congestion arising as a result.  I am aware that during my time as a councillor a lot of land was zoned as industrial on the west side of Galway city.  Does Enterprise Ireland have a strategy to try to rectify the imbalance in Galway and thus address not only the shortage of industry on one side of the city but the traffic congestion issues?  I would also like some information on the overlap between Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, including the type of interaction between both organisations and the dividing line in terms of operations.  </p> <p>  Mr. Neil McDonnell might also elaborate on the point he made in regard to the local enterprise offices and the county manager. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Donnellan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#E00400"><p>I will respond to the questions in the order they were asked, if that is okay.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about site ownership.  Enterprise Ireland does not own any sites.  When the two agencies were separated in 1998, it was decided that the IDA would run the landbank and that has continued.  On behalf of our clients we engage on a regular basis with the IDA about opportunities and the need for space, such that that in itself is not an issue.  In terms of serviced sites, there are some parts of the country where we have expanding companies that are under pressure in terms of acquiring available sites.  The private sector supply is as yet unable to meet the scale, in terms of size, or the nature of the units required, in particular units for expanding food companies.  This is an issue on which we are focused.  We are working with the local authorities to develop a response, particularly in some of the key areas affected.  That is part of our ongoing work at regional level.</p> <p>  The community enterprise centres continue to be an important part of our response and that of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to local communities.  I agree with the Deputy that while the question of serviced sites is a related issue in some cases, it is a separate issue.  The second question was in regard to funding for start-ups.  There has been a considerable amount of investment to seed funds.  This has worked, particularly for the technology start-up companies.  Outside of that sector, there is a need for some further different type of mechanisms, particularly for manufacturing and food start-ups.  We are particularly focused at the moment on finding other ways of supporting start-ups.  The Deputy is correct that the best option may not be venture funds but private equity or other types of funding instruments or groups such as business angels and so on.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.323" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Donnellan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#E00600"><p>They are groups of high net worth individuals who come together to invest as individuals in companies.  They are not an established fund but are a group of individuals.  For example, there is already a group started in the food industry, which comprises people with a background in food who are interested in investing in food start-ups.  In the United States, this kind of investment by high net worth individuals is the main support for start-ups.  The seed venture industry in the United State is well established and focuses in particular on the technology industry, particularly on the west coast but most start-ups in the US are funded directly by individuals or a collection of individuals.  Hence the importance of the employment incentive fund scheme, which is particularly focused on those individuals.  There is a gap in this area but it is one on which we, with our parent Department and the Department of Finance, are focusing on over the medium term.</p> <p>  Reference was made to road infrastructure and mobile broadband and access being an inhibitor, in particular outside of the main centres.  Broadband provision in approximately one third of populated areas of the country remains a challenge, which is a real problem.  As already stated broadband, from a business perspective, is like water.  In other words, it is not an option not to have broadband in terms of a modern business.  If a small town does not have proper access to broadband the capacity for back-office operations and start-ups is more limited.  It certainly is an inhibitor and so on.</p><p>Other aspects are possibly challenging in particular areas but as a general point it is not as challenging.  Broadband would be the one we would particularly focus on as a general aspect.  There are other areas such as access to roads and motorways, like in the north west, but broadband is our particular focus.</p><p> We can provide a map showing the distribution of our clients.  Half of our clients are in counties without major cities.  Employment with those clients ranges across different sized companies.  It is not all microenterprises.  For example, there is Univet in Tullyvin, north Cavan, a small rural area, which employs between 30 and 40 people.  These are the kind of businesses right across the country.  We are happy to provide the map with the categories suggested.</p><p> On State tendering procurement procedures, we have a unit which focuses on public purchasing.  One of the strategic conversations we are having is with the Office of Government Procurement.  There is that whole process of trying to balance the needs of public procurement with access to business, particularly innovative businesses.  That can be quite challenging at times and one on which it is important to focus.  We have developed the strategic business innovation initiative which is around trying to persuade various providers of public services to take on some innovative companies as part of their public purchasing approach.  That is part of the solution.  It is not the only one and I am sure my colleague in the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, will comment further on that.</p><p> We set up a Brexit unit and our entire organisation is now focused on the issue.  Since 25 June, the senior management team met daily for four to five weeks focusing on what our companies were telling us about Brexit.  Within the first three weeks, we identified the companies particularly exposed to the UK market.  We surveyed and got data on all the companies we work with intensely.  One question we asked them was which markets they were selling into.  From that, we were able to identify each company with over 50% of exports or sales into the UK market.  We had a conversation with the bulk of those companies over the following weeks and got feedback.  There is a considerable amount of sectorial variation.  For example, with engineering and food companies, one got sharp concern around margins and exchange rates.  In other areas, such as software, they were not as concerned in the short term but were concerned about longer term issues around the slowdown in the UK economy, if it occurs because of Brexit.  The ultimate question for all our companies is what exactly will be the nature of Brexit.  Will it be a hard or soft Brexit?  If it is a hard Brexit, will it involve tariffs, border controls and issues around transporting through the UK?  Many of our companies which export to the Continent transport their goods through the UK.  Accordingly, there is a range of questions and concerns.</p><p> Our response has been to emphasise five points.  First, there needs to be awareness of the issue from a company's perspective.  Has it looked at the risks involved?  The second point is currency.  Are companies exposed to currency fluctuations and have they hedged for this?  Some have and some have not.  The third point is market diversification.  We are telling some companies they need to focus more on the UK.  For example, in concrete products, it is unlikely those companies will be able to sell to other countries because of the nature of their product.  Accordingly, they will need to intensify and get more sales in the UK.  Our team is gearing to help them with that.  The fourth point is diversification.  There are companies which can diversify and balance their UK sales with sales in other countries.  Finally, the fifth point is innovation and competitiveness.  Interestingly, we have noted those companies which have managed to get price increases are those with innovative products.</p><p> Our overall organisation is focused on Brexit.  We have a Brexit co-ordination team in place, comprising two people, which is bringing together the whole effort of the organisation.  For example, yesterday, I, along with two regional directors and several local enterprise offices, LEOs, in the Border counties, had a conversation about what was involved for Border counties in Brexit.  Our chief executive officer is regularly involved with the Minister's liaison meeting on Brexit.</p></speech>

Our regions had a conversation yesterday about Brexit with the LEOs as to what our companies are saying in the Border region and our response to that.  In this case, we are likely to hold a workshop targeting those particular groups of companies.  We reckon there are 60 companies in the Enterprise Ireland portfolio which are particularly exposed to the UK.  The LEOs have another 100 companies.  We will have a workshop either this side of Christmas or in January focusing on those companies to make them aware of and to prepare for changes as a result of Brexit.  The whole organisation is focused on it and the Brexit co-ordination unit supports the organisation.</p> <p>  In the Budget Statement, the Minister focused on extra resources for the organisation, particularly in competitiveness and innovation which will focus on helping our companies to respond to Brexit.  This will be coupled with an increased number of staff overseas to help companies diversify into other markets.</p></speech>

In the longer run, almost all our companies will have to face a Brexit question.  Whatever that will be, we do not know.  Brexit is a transformation with a whole series of decisions about to be made at national and international level which will ultimately affect all our companies.  The ones we are particularly focused on now are those dealing with the UK market.</p> <p>  We are involved in the regional Action Plan for Jobs and discussions around that and the spatial strategy.

There is no fundamental difference between the two, apart from twisty roads and broadband.</p> <p>  It will be interesting because it seems to be an idea that one can only get a factory in a town.  Will Enterprise Ireland show us as it is and the way people actually did it, as opposed to the way the gurus want us to do it?

Enterprise Ireland would be pleased to take part in any discussions on the matter should it matter.  Synergies are created when companies are located together, particularly if they are operating in similar sectors as this creates opportunities for working together and so on.  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's comment, this can occur in a small community enterprise centre in Kiltimagh as much as in other places.  Enterprise Ireland will be pleased to engage in a conversation on the issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins referred to rural development and also asked a question concerning a map.  We will be happy to provide the analysis he seeks.  Broadband is critical, as has been noted. </p> <p>  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon raised the issue of venture capital.  We had a conversation with the credit unions in 2008-09, which was during the crisis.  We were trying to work out what were the options.  As we are all aware, this was a serious time for all our companies.  We tried to work out if the credit unions could help smaller companies in particular.  Obviously, credit unions are focused on other areas.  While we had a good conversation with them, there was a great deal happening on both sides of the conversation, if one likes.  In addition, some issues arose because the Financial Regulator had concerns about the types of investment that could be considered in this context.  While we did not pursue the conversation at that point, it is one to which we could return.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Connolly will be familiar with a credit union in Galway that has taken a highly proactive role in enterprise and enterprise support.  This is an interesting model and while it need not necessarily be copied exactly, it certainly offers lessons to be learned.  Enterprise Ireland will be happy to work jointly with the local enterprise offices and credit unions, which we view as an important part of local development in rural and urban areas. </p> <p>  On the Office of Government Procurement, as I indicated, issues arise in the procurement area and we are engaged in a conversation through our public procurement team.  </p> <p>  On collaboration with multinational companies, we have extensive conversations with IDA Ireland, particularly to try to understand whether companies intending to locate here would be interested in some of the companies with which Enterprise Ireland works.  There are, therefore, specific conversations taking place in this area.  We have a team known as global sourcing which works directly with IDA Ireland on companies locating in Ireland which are engaged in certain types of activities.  In each of the past two years, we have had an Irish markets week during which we introduce multinational companies based in Ireland to potential suppliers.  This has worked out particularly well and the multinational companies have shown a strong interest, as have our clients and IDA Ireland. </p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Catherine Connolly, while I am a native of Galway city, Enterprise Ireland has not focused specifically on the issue she raises.  We will examine the matter to identify what are the issues.  We have invested in Galway city in a number of different ways, both in terms of the companies located in the city and the start-up scene.  We were involved in PorterShed and a number of other areas and we are also involved in the National University of Ireland Galway.  The regional director and team in place in Galway will be willing to examine the issue to gain a better understanding of it.</p> <p>  B&iacute;mid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta go rialta.  I am on the investment committee of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a member of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is on one of Enterprise Ireland's investment committees.  We work closely together and have a good interaction with the organisation.</p></speech>

It is one on which I note the European Union is changing its policy at a snail's policy.  Does Enterprise Ireland define high-speed broadband as 1 Gbit, 100 Mbps or 30 Mbps?  What do large companies need to operate?</p></speech>

I will revert to the committee on the issue, although the speed required varies by company.  For example, a design software company will need the highest specification, whereas a food company will need a good quality broadband connection with a lower specification.  From listening to our companies and the Enterprise Ireland teams working with them, they generally need the basics, that is, a good broadband connection but not massive high speed broadband.  However, web design and sophisticated engineering design companies which are using interesting design in making products will require a much higher level of broadband.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a question on share capital and Deputy Cannon asked a question on the availability of credit in general.  All forms of finance are an issue for small businesses, which have a different approach to finance than businesses with which Enterprise Ireland usually deals.  I explain it to people very simply.  Small companies do not have a treasury function and most of them do not have an accountant.  This means they simply run out of money, which gives rise to a "hair on fire" discussion, so to speak, because the company needs money immediately.</p> <p>  On Monday, I spoke to a highly distressed woman from the west who runs a garden services business.  Her company traded through &euro;300,000 of bad debt in the bank crash and lost stock worth &euro;500,000 in the big freeze of 2010-11.  The company continues to trade and employs eight staff.  The owner told me that three of her staff have mortgages and are waiting for their wages to be paid.  She cannot obtain &euro;30,000 for a truck.  The conversation arose because she was sending me a rather aggressive letter that she intended to send to a finance house.  We talked through the issue and I understood the emotion expressed in her letter.</p> <p>  The consistent message that comes through is that as a result of the banks having to repair their balance sheets, one of the good things lost has been the bank manager who could read a cashflow, profit and loss statement and balance sheet and understand whether a company was good.  He or she used to be able to approve or reject a credit application, as appropriate, but they are no longer in place in the towns.  Companies must then deal with a system or an IT connection and there is no longer an ability to provide the working capital, which is a serious problem.  Whether this comes from an initial squirt of State capital, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland or another source, it must be provided.  There are, however, specialists entering this space.  Wearing my previous hat, which was in the transport business, I note that some UK providers are very comfortable assessing the risk of distribution operations.  These providers are making headway, although they are charging a premium of 2% or 3% on the cost of capital over what was previously available.</p><p>People are paying more money for access to credit now and it is across the board.<br/><br/>I was asked about basic services such as electricity and water.  Again, there is a difference among our relative clients.  A big business coming to Enterprise Ireland will have a check sheet, and if an area does not pass muster on the availability of services and the services are not there in the first place then a discussion will not take place.  Some of our members are indigenous to an area and just muddle through with what they have so they are different, but the consistent message from them is the cost of the provision of these services relative to what their peers pay elsewhere is too high.  The cost of electricity and water is too high.  The cost to a small caf&eacute; or restaurant of a boil water notice is too high.  This has to be fixed.  Very politely, the message to all the Deputies and Senators in the Houses is they must sort out the water issue yesterday, because one crowd that will not pick up the tab for a failure to sort out water charges is small businesses.  Back in the day they paid rates.  Now, many local authorities are renegotiating rates with these small businesses.  They must also pay for their utilities.  Loud and clear I hear from them that the State should not come back asking more for water just because it cannot be got from someone who refuses to pay for water.  We all have to pay for water.  The only thing the politicians must decide is how we will pay for water and how much we will pay.  It is simple.<br/><br/>Deputy Cannon asked about the turnover requirements for tenders.  The simple answer is the turnover requirements are inappropriately high in some cases.  I know of a business that tendered for a significant State tender.  The value of the tender was &euro;25 million and the turnover requirement was &euro;40 million.  There is no justification for doing this.  I understand the State, particularly after the crash, decided to address this by having entities with a big turnover, but small businesses take the view that if the tender is for something in a rural area such as a road sweeping, hedge cutting or a road repair service, just because a Spanish or British company has a huge turnover it does not mean it will be able to replicate the service at a value for money price in the west of Ireland, and because it does not have network there it will probably end up buying the service from an SME locally.  If we had a more holistic approach as to how the business is tendered in the first place it would cut out the middle man, cut out a piece of margin to a multinational and small businesses would be dealt with directly.  We understand the State wants the comfort of dealing with a larger business.  What the small businesses state is they can put consortia together but they need time to do so.  I have already had conversations with the Office of Government Procurement on this and it is amenable to this discussion but it needs leadership from the State in doing so.<br/><br/>We would hate to see Brexit becoming a catchall clich&eacute;, with politicians having a go at each other and it is all great fun for them, but for businesses it will be a real issue.  Last night we all saw aired the real right now issue for mushroom farmers who just happen to be very sectorally exposed.  Going back to finance, they have a right now hair on fire working capital issue, which must be bridged.  This is in the short term.  In the medium term, perhaps sterling will settle at the level it is at and perhaps the mushroom farmers will be able to trade through it and trim their cost base, but they have a very tight cost base as it is.  Otherwise they will have to reorganise their business or we will no longer grow mushrooms here.<br/><br/>Our concern is that in many businesses people do not realise they are doing business with the UK and do not realise they are doing sterling business.  An example is hospitality, and we are not just talking about the west coast hospitality but Temple Bar.  Many of the people on stag weekends come from the UK.  Perhaps some people will be just as happy if they do not come over, but their pricing decision has changed in recent weeks.  We just became 15% more expensive for them.<br/><br/>I was at a meeting this morning with a Coillte director who manufactures prefabricated construction equipment.  Most timber in Ireland is now privately sourced.  Many farmers who grow timber think their customer is Coillte, and their first customer in Coillte, but the end customer is a builder in the UK.  There are businesses whose level of exposure we do not know, and how badly they will be affected will only come out in the coming months.<br/><br/>I believe I have answered the question on credit unions.  Small businesses do not really care where the money comes from.  There are regulatory issues involved but they need money.<br/><br/>Deputy Connolly asked about Alpine resorts where tourists in the ski season are moved around by a bus that looks just like a school bus with big wide doors.  One gets on and there is no conversation or exchange of money with the driver.  The locals also use this service.  Of course there is a cost to doing this.  Either the local commune in Italy will pay for it or the lift company in France will do so.  There is a local agreement that just providing this on a regular round-robin basis provides a local service and they are willing to absorb it as the local overhead.  To an extent, this already happens with the rural transport initiative, if we think about the school bus service.  There is an element of State subsidy in this.  We are not necessarily saying that something would go around the place on the hour, but if we think about extended rural areas in the west where people want to go to pubs there is also a road safety argument for it.  There are clever ways of thinking about this where we could provide a level of service that would be a return to the local community.<br/><br/>The county manager issue has not clarified itself as yet but I will give some examples where there might be a sensitivity.  In the old system, the reporting line was effectively through the county enterprise board to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or its predecessors.  Now the concern is, and we will only see this over time but we are alerting the committee to the sensitivity of it, that we have a county manager who deals with local authority members, and what was previously a purely commercial viability discussion is now potentially involved with something that might have a planning permission attached to it or a change of use for land.  There is a concern that where local authority members are involved there may be things that get in the way of the discussions, sensitivities or something that someone does not wish to disclose, simply because the reporting line has changed and there is a local political element to it.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on what a good connection looks like, there is no simple answer to this.  For instance, a local engineering, architecture or design firm that shares drawings or computer aided design will be very data hungry.  On the other hand, for someone simply in a small town or village or rural area whose accountant is in one place and whose solicitor is somewhere else and who wants to use a cloud-based service, it will not work on a phone line.  While it does not necessarily need to be a 30 GB or a 1 TB service it needs to be there, it must be reliable and it cannot be affected by weather.  This is the issue.  There have been local press reports.  According to a recent study in the <i>Irish Independent</i>Cavan has 5,250 businesses without broadband, Donegal has 8,410, Leitrim has 2,500, Louth has 2,800, Monaghan has 5,200, Sligo has 3,800 and Meath has 6,300.  Proximity to Dublin does not necessarily address the issue.  It is the dispersal of the population in the area.<br/><br/>We survey our members in our quarterly trends survey, which we publish and which is available to committee members to search.</p><p>Of our respondents, 31% highlight quality and availability of broadband as a business issue.</p></speech>

The research and development of the media industry in Gaeltacht areas supported by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for the past 20 years has proved to be an innovative step in introducing compatible new-age industries to rural areas.  Similar strategies need to be replicated so as to ensure that rural areas can keep in step with similar developments, albeit on a smaller scale, in urban areas.  New sectors, which are now ripe for development, are being explored at present and include tourism, new forms of aquaculture, nutraceuticals and biopharma products, to name but a few.</p><p> Sin &eacute; mo thuairim.

As needs must, the opening statement has already been circulated to the members, so I will try to keep it brief to allow time for questions.<br/><br/>The Western Development Commission is an organisation that delivers a unique and effective response to the development challenges of a predominantly rural region in the west of Ireland.  We do this through implementation, insight, identity and investment.  We initiate programmes with partners that deliver real value on the ground in a largely rural region.  Examples of this include our work in the creative economy, renewable energy and things such as the regional tourism marketing, which allowed international visitors access our rural region.  That programme garnered &euro;3 million for an upfront investment of &euro;1 million by the State.  We do this through our insight and development of a robust information base on regional issues which provides an acknowledged valuable input to national policy making in areas such as energy, infrastructure and broadband.  A past example where this really helped was the expansion of the availability of town gas to a wider network within our region.<br/><br/>Critically, although we are talking predominantly here about stream 1 and employment, we also talk about our identity as a region.  In the WDC we have helped to do this through enabling and promotion of a globally recognised rural region through programmes such as Look West and others which currently have over 20,000 social media friends and have reached out to over 1 million people, addressing the needs, opportunities and strengths of our region to a global audience.<br/><br/>The last way in which we do it is through investment.  We operate the western investment fund, a unique source of risk capital for entrepreneurs in the western region.  I am very proud to say we have been doing this for over a decade and it is, in effect an evergreen self-sustaining fund, which shows how public sector investment can reap rewards in terms of self-sustainment in the circular economy.<br/><br/>The impact of this has been quite significant.  Since 2010 the WDC has sourced and directed over &euro;13 million in total funding towards regional enterprise and employment development.  Our regional policy and analysis capability has brought large-scale change in critical areas of our rural region.  As mentioned previously, our Creative West report has garnered support in the development of hundreds if not thousands of creative businesses in our region.  We look forward to that eventually resulting in significant job growth, all of which will be indigenous and we hope immutable in terms of their link to the land.<br/><br/>We look also at how we have delivered on a regional capability for the region and ourselves to access critical EU funding programmes through the region.  This is not just done through INTERREG funds but it is also looking at facilities that have enabled biomass district heating planning and technical assistance funding for local authorities in the region of 200,000, which again is the seed for hopefully moving on to public private partnerships which will allow hundreds of jobs which will be there for quite some time given the nature of the fuel supply for biomass.  In total we are talking about &euro;11 million worth of European programmes in our region.  Not all of that comes directly into our region but it forms the basis of risk capital for a lot of enterprise development at a very local level.<br/><br/>We previously talked about our investment capability.  We referred to this as a regional access to finance capability and I believe some of the members and attendees have already discussed this.  We have run the VC funding in response to market failure that was identified over a decade in our rural region in the west of Ireland.  At that time only 3% of the national deals were done in this critical access-to-finance avenue.  We are proud to say that after a decade of addressing this through the WIF, it now represents between 7% and 10% of the VC deals.  This is quite a transformative change brought by the WDC to the region.  This means that we have over &euro;48 million invested in 135 businesses, predominantly SMEs and over 2,500 jobs created directly from a programme which is now effectively an evergreen facility and capability for the region.<br/><br/>I return to the regional identity, which is well served by allowing employment and enterprise to grow and also through our Look West programme giving a voice and a brand that helps the region feel good about itself and communicate its needs, opportunities and strengths to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Although the nature of today's discussion is predominantly to inform the members, we believe the following recommendations merit consideration.  I point members towards what the OECD and international community really believes rural and regional development to be.  The OECD states that regional development should include: &quot;a development strategy that covers a wide range of direct and indirect factors that affect the performance of local firms; a focus on regional specific assets, and less on top-down investments and transfers; [and] an emphasis on opportunity rather than on disadvantage or need for support&quot;.<br/><br/>In short, the OECD recommends that we should always focus on the competitiveness of our rural regions.  We believe wholly in this.  If we focus on that under this stream of employment, it will serve our needs best.  We have some thoughts on what that means, which I will summarise.  There is a clear need for infrastructural investment as all parties heretofore have agreed.  There is an overwhelming need for an appropriately sized and resourced regional development capability.  At the moment the <i>modus operandi</i>is one of dispersed intervention in terms of national bodies taking a slice of regional intervention.<br/><br/>If one looks at the OECD and proof of concept that we and indeed some of the other parties here today have provided, nothing develops a region or a rural area better than the people within that region or rural area.  This is not just because of their ties and their passion, but also because of their market intelligence and drive, which the State needs to bear in mind.  That will enhance and improve not just the regional competitiveness and total net worth and gain, but also the State's coffers which is something we need to consider in the modern economy.<br/><br/>We believe there is room for upskilling, specifically of a tailored means.  Given some of the things in our opening statement, undoubtedly in the rural regions we believe alignment of measures for the self-employed and the creation of an entrepreneurial culture is critical.  We are seeing an overwhelming drive of people towards self-help in terms of self-employment.  We believe that has to be accommodated in any future steps we take to make this change.</p></speech>

Chonaic m&eacute; an m&eacute;id at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l ag Ros na R&uacute;n agus Telegael.  Is cuimhin liom c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin nuair a tharla an infheist&iacute;ocht sin go nd&uacute;irt a l&aacute;n daoine sna me&aacute;in cumars&aacute;ide gur airgead curtha am&uacute; a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na teanga de.  Hollywood beag at&aacute; ann anois leis an m&eacute;id sin ruda&iacute; ag teacht as an &aacute;it agus an m&eacute;id daoine at&aacute; ann.</p><p>Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin go dtagann tairbhe as an infheist&iacute;ocht sin freisin.  Caithfimid a r&aacute; freisin go bhfuil d&uacute;shl&aacute;n uaf&aacute;sach ag an nGaeltacht mar gheall ar an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n eacnama&iacute;ochta agus d&uacute;shl&aacute;n na teanga at&aacute; ann.

Dar leo, n&iacute;l ach deich mbliain f&aacute;gtha ag an nGaeilge mar theanga phobal sa Ghaeltacht as seo amach.  Cuireann s&eacute; sin scanradh orainn freisin.</p><p> T&aacute; achrann ann san Oireachtas faoi bhuis&eacute;ad &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Cad &eacute; an titim at&aacute; tagtha ar an mbuis&eacute;ad reatha agus ar an mbuis&eacute;ad caipitil &oacute; bh&iacute; 2008 ann?  Cad &eacute; an t-airgead ioml&aacute;n at&aacute; ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s i mbliana agus a bh&iacute; ann an bhliain seo caite?  T&aacute; dream amh&aacute;in ag r&aacute; go bhfuil titim ann agus dream eile ag r&aacute; go bhfuil f&aacute;s ann sa bhuis&eacute;ad.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir an d&aacute; rud a bheith f&iacute;or.</p><p> C&eacute;n r&oacute;l at&aacute; ag an Rialtas n&oacute; ag an St&aacute;t sa language shift at&aacute; ann sa Ghaeltacht?  Chuala m&eacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute; go raibh an Rialtas ag f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh leis an riachtanas go mbeadh Gaeilge ag daoine at&aacute; ag obair i leabharlanna thart timpeall na t&iacute;re agus sa Ghaeltacht freisin.  Cad a chialla&iacute;onn an m&eacute;id B&eacute;arla at&aacute; &aacute; labhairt sna scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht?  N&iacute;l an polasa&iacute; faoi Gaeilge sna scoileanna Gaeltachta foilsithe f&oacute;s.  Cad &eacute; meon an &uacute;dar&aacute;is faoi sin?  Cad at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s &oacute; thaobh Brexit de?  C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad daoine at&aacute; ag obair air sin chun cabhr&uacute; leis na comhlachta&iacute;?  Cad is f&eacute;idir leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis sin?</p><p> Tosn&oacute;idh muid leis na ceisteanna ar fad.  Mar sin, cuirfidh m&eacute; ceisteanna anois ar ionadaithe an Western Development Commission freisin.</p><p> The Western Development Commission does fantastic work.  It is a great model and it is surprising that it is not replicated in other parts of the country.  We have spoken to representatives of organisations at different levels, be they Leader programmes etc., and they have said they work very well and that they do not overlap with the commission's function in that space.  Sometimes certain infrastructure has a very long-term repayment to the State.  If there is not an organisation such as the Western Development Commission, it is hard to anchor the investment for that type of structure.</p><p> One of the most interesting figures I have found recently is that in Britain, solar power created more electricity in the past six months than coal.  It shows the development of renewable energy in Britain and can be compared with here.  In truth, the solar sector has not started here.  Biomass was mentioned.  Could the representatives put more meat on the bones with regard to observations on those two sectors?  What developments could they play in the Western Development Commission's area with regard to jobs and attracting business?</p><p> What kind of budgetary challenges is the Western Development Commission facing?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has had its budgets fairly well sliced and diced over recent years.  What kind of budgets has the commission experienced?  Is there money outstanding to the commission in any fashion at the moment with regard to the building of its own particular infrastructure and capital projects?</p><p> I understand that the way the commission's interaction happens currently is that its engagement with Europe, for example, goes through the translation service of the Departments here.  Would it be more beneficial for the commission if it could have more independence and freedom to negotiate with the European Union without having to go through that translation service?</p><p> Will the commission tell us what engagement it has had with State services or Departments with regard to spatial planning?  The commission mentioned that assets would be necessary for the development of the regions.  I hold this view strongly as well.  Investment in infrastructure without a spatial plan is directionless, headless chicken investment in infrastructure.  It is only when we know where our chief cities, towns and industries and specific sectors will be located that the decisions on investment in infrastructure will be logical.  What of the need for disruptive infrastructure?  Given population trends in the State, with which we do not agree, currently we are chasing our tail on infrastructure investment.  How do we disrupt those trends?</p><p> T&oacute;gfaimid na ceisteanna go l&eacute;ir ar dt&uacute;s mar a rinneamar cheana.  Is f&eacute;idir leis na finn&eacute;ithe teacht isteach ansan.</p></speech>

Demand first, provision second, or <i>vice versa</i>?  We have the most classic case of infrastructure first and a person with a vision and a wide view of the world, which was &quot;do it now and the other will follow&quot;.  How big has been the impact of Knock airport on the mid-north west in terms of sticking the thing in and saying, if we have that flagship piece of infrastructure, it will make the area more saleable?  What is the commission's view on it?  Do we wait to have the development first and get the motorway second?  Alternatively, do we say we need a motorway to the north west or otherwise what is there and what could be there will not reach its full potential?</p><p>I think I was told the technical term for funds that would not give what a venture capitalist might want but would give the kind of return with which the pension reserve fund, for instance, would be satisfied.  They used to call it the pension reserve fund but I think it is now called the national investment fund.  If given access to that money - be it &euro;20 million, &euro;40 million, &euro;60 million, &euro;80 million or &euro;100 million - under two conditions, one being long-term rates of return, which is what a pension fund wants, and the second being the kind of return a pension fund would expect as opposed to what a venture capitalist might expect, could the commission use the money over a period in useful investment in companies where it would win more than it would lose, allowing that some will lose and some will win, and get a reasonable return for its money on the total package?  What kind of funding could it use out of that fund of a few billion euros?  Would it make a significant difference?  Does lack of working capital inhibit the development of companies?</p><p> This is my final point.  We are always talking about problems in rural Ireland, and I do not like seeing it that way.  I always say that the problem in rural Ireland is unexploited potential.  There is more potential than we could dream of and people with creativity and the ability to develop.  However, what are the three or four biggest factors that hold them back?  Are they finance, education, infrastructure?  What would unlock this absolutely incredible potential in rural Ireland?  What would be the three or four things that would unlock it and allow it flourish?  The potential and the resources are there in so many sectors.  We need to just turn the key and unlock it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#M00200"><p>My first question is for both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission.  I live in a little village approximately 25 minutes drive from the periphery of Galway city.  My perception is that Galway city is the primary driver of economic growth in that whole western region.  I am sure most of us here share that opinion.</p> <p>  The &uacute;dar&aacute;s has been exceptionally successful.  If we move beyond what might be described as the economic footprint of the city, past Athenry, Loughrea, Na Forbacha and An Spid&eacute;al and into the sparsely populated parts of our county, both west and east, companies have been convinced that a sparsely populated area is a perfectly adequate and acceptable place to locate.  How has the &uacute;dar&aacute;s done this?  I believe its experience of doing that in Connemara could be replicated in parts of east Galway that have yet to see any sort of economic recovery taking place.</p> <p>  My next question is also for both entities.  This has the potential to be significantly politically sensitive, but I will discuss it anyway.  There is now a proposal on the table to merge our two local authorities in Galway.  In my opinion, this artificial construct that separates the city from the rest of the county is an inhibitor to the economic growth that can occur across the whole of the county, driven primarily by the presence of the city but artificially suppressed at this point in time because of the presence of two different local authorities.  What is the delegates' opinion on the proposed merger?</p> <p>  A recently published report recommends the merging of the two local authorities.  It does so predominantly for that reason, namely, there could be significant collaboration and sharing of expertise and resources across a whole county rather than the artificial construct that exists.  For example, there is a huge amount of job creation happening in the city, but Parkmore is predominantly in County Galway.  How do we get the exceptionally successful economic engine that is a city the size of Galway to drive economic regrowth in farther flung locations of our county?  Is there an international model we could replicate?</p> <p>  I have a further question, perhaps two, for Mr. Brannigan.  He makes a point about education that I find fascinating.  He stated that the OECD has shown that investing and upskilling lower-skilled workers in rural regions has a greater impact on economic development than investing in increasing the number of highly-skilled workers in the region.  Could he expand on that statement?  What is meant by investing in increasing the number of highly-skilled workers if not investing in upskilling?  Does this refer to bringing in workers from other locations?  What is the distinction?  </p> <p>  In the subsequent paragraph in his written submission, which is a fascinating paragraph, Mr. Brannigan states, "Numbers of self-employed grew ... strongly in the Western Region (31.1%) [between 2012 and 2016 in comparison with 7.2%] in the [whole] rest of the state".  He goes on to state that 22.9% of all working people in the region are self-employed compared with just 15.2% in the rest of the State.  That is fascinating.  He expands on the statement by suggesting it is probably because there are relatively limited job options in rural areas that people have to create their own jobs.  I think what we are doing here is tapping into the innate creativity of our people.  They are showing that, given the right resources and supports, they can create not alone jobs for themselves but jobs for their neighbours and members of their local communities.</p> <p>  What does the western region possess that results in this statistical anomaly?  Is it that necessity is the mother of invention?  Perhaps it is.  What can we do to further enhance this kind of job creation potential?  Something unique is being tapped into there.  Is there anything we can do?  I know broadband is a huge issue.  What Telegael and others have done with the creative industries out in the depths of Connemara with the right resources and infrastructure is fascinating.  In terms of the creative industries across the whole of the rural western region, what is the potential and how do we support it?  Are there any lessons to be learned from other locations in the world that are doing something similar?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  The whole presentation has been very helpful to me.  In a sense, it is a pity that ISME and Enterprise Ireland are not here because it is all interrelated.  There was an extraordinary sentence from ISME in its saying that it is limited only by its imagination in terms of employment.  The witnesses present are saying something similar.  It is a pity that ISME is not here.  The Western Development Commission representatives might comment on where it is on the issue of the western railway project.</p></speech>

I am returning to the issue of upscaling.  What sort of engagement does it have with the education and training boards, ETBs, across the region in determining what skills shortages there are and how they can be addressed?  What potential job creation opportunities are available across our rural regions?  How can the ETBs become deeply involved in maximising that potential?</p></speech>

I am particularly interested in the presentation of the Western Development Commission, given it is headquartered in Ballaghaderreen.  There are two areas on which I want to follow up.  Mr. Brannigan pointed out challenges within rural communities in terms of being understood.  I understand that for all agencies - Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, local enterprise offices, the Western Development Commission and all of those - we need a proper needs analysis of each town and village and of the connections between those towns and villages with the hinterlands.  I do not believe we have that in-depth specific analysis at the moment.  I certainly believe the Western Development Commission would be in a strong place to assist with that work to provide us with the evidence for support from our employment agencies.  We effectively need our employment agencies working to ensure areas with the greatest need receive opportunities and support.  That is the challenge at the moment.  I say that with a specific example in mind of my engagement with Enterprise Ireland and a community initiative which was not funded.  It seemed to have been an area that had the greatest need.  I ask the Western Development Commission to expand further on the excellent work it does in providing that evidence as we move towards a more evidence-based model.</p><p>Mr. Brannigan<b></b>stated that the western investment fund and the micro loan programme has supported 135 projects, invested &euro;48 million and is leveraging &euro;210 million in supporting the creation of more than 2,500 jobs.  Will he expand a little on the demand and whether there is greater potential for support?  We know that the western region is supported by small to medium-sized enterprises.  Obviously, the micro loan programme would be very important.  Will Mr. Brannigan give us a bit more information on that and on its further potential?</p></speech>

Mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta Cannon, t&aacute; comhlachta&iacute; ann ar an gc&oacute;sta thiar.  Caithfimid an stuif a chur amach ar an mb&oacute;thar mar nach bhfuil aon bhealach eile amach.  Caithfidh bealach a bheith ann, cuarbh&oacute;thar, thart ar chathair na Gaillimhe.  T&aacute;imid ag tac&uacute; le sin, mar a bh&iacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; &oacute;n t&uacute;s.  Cuireann muid aighneachta&iacute; isteach go dt&iacute; na comhairl&iacute; contae maidir le na ceantair Gaeltachta ar n&oacute;s Chorca Dhuibhne, D&uacute;n na nGall agus Gaillimh thiar an t-am ar fad.</p><p> Luaigh m&eacute; an buis&eacute;ad.  Deputy Cannon asked about driving employment in the western region.  As I mentioned earlier, we were fortunate in that we had very good promoters of companies.  We also have big companies recently, but they were very small when they started.  They grew organically.  They were not planted there and we did not actually bring them in from overseas.  I would say that nearly 90% of them started very small, were taken over or expanded and over a period became the fairly large and substantial SMEs we have today.  How do we attract these types of industries?  In many cases, we proactively develop the sectors ourselves, such as the creative sectors.  We still support one, two or three-person operations in the craft art field, as we have been doing since 1980.  Before that, our predecessor Gaeltarra &Eacute;ireann supported very traditional crafts and arts all throughout the Gaeltacht, be it Donegal linen crafts or something else.  In the media sector, we set up a training programme 25 years ago.  Many of the people who went through those programmes initially, such as Ms Lelia Doolin and people like that, are proficient and experts in their field.  The people working as producers in Telegael or "Ros na R&uacute;n" today probably came through that process.  We did the same with the agriculture sector in the 1980s.  We have trials, failures and successes, but it is coming together now.  Sometimes, we took those initiatives ourselves.</p><p> We have made a submission on the merging of the two authorities in Galway.  We see both points of views.  We work very closely with Galway City Council and Galway County Council.  We find them both quite good.  We work more so with the county council than the city council because we are county-based.  We would not like to see anything jeopardise the relationship that the county council enjoys with the hinterland.  We feel it is quite good, that the local representation is good and that it is aware of what the needs are.  If they were to amalgamate and most of the income was to come from one major city, there could be a question down the road of where the services would be directed.  That would be our fear.</p></speech>

We are in seven counties.  If one looks at ceantar na n-oile&aacute;n agus Conamara, bheadh s&eacute; ard - up to 20%.  I gceantair cois farraige, where we are based, it is on par with the national figures.  It varies a lot.  There is a very quick migration of people out of rural areas when there is no employment.  What one finds is a diluting of the areas more so than a huge amount of people walking around unemployed.  They actually move out of the area.  We have a programme and as we develop our plans in the future, we have to engage with the diaspora to entice these people back.  We have to do that using modern media.</p></speech>

Ms Helen McHenry and I will answer between us as required.  I thank the committee for the kind comments at the beginning.  They were very helpful.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked for a little bit more detail on solar energy and biomass energy.  It is easier to start with solar.  Solar is very much nascent in our rural regional economy.  We see it as a real opportunity.  The point of the work now is really getting proof of concept, connections into the grid and solar farm proof of concept facilities.  We are working with some energy co-ops to try to kick-start this and get it moving.<br/><br/>It is easier to speak about biomass energy as we have obviously been working on that for a lot longer.  It is fair to say that we cut our teeth with some really good research working with the Departments, Coillte, etc., in the late 2000s when we wanted to see a step-change in the whole biomass industry in the west of Ireland, given that 40% of the assets, the wood, is in the region, but 40% of the supply chain and factors was not.  It is hard to say whether we have achieved all of that, but at this point we are definitely well advanced.  We have achieved quite a lot of micro-business growth.  A good example would be the Donegal woodland co-op.  This is a disparate group of farmers and foresters.  We have used some of the money we have had there in programmes to move them from selling logs to garages to providing heat on a larger scale.  They buy boilers and get ten-year contracts.  They build, design and operate.  We have used our money to make that sort of business change which gives them a greater security of supply, etc.<br/><br/>That is where we gained our expertise and cut our teeth.  What I am proud to say now is that it is a scaled process.  To step back, while we claim that we have been directly involved in around 2,700 jobs and directly and indirectly involved in about 5,000, we really need to be much better.  We are looking at creating 19,000 or 20,000 jobs or more by 2020 to make a discernible difference in the region, bring the gross value added, GVA, up, etc.  Every aspect of what we do needs to scale.  That will come across in answering some of the Cathaoirleach's questions.  Specifically around biomass, I did mention earlier that we have answered the questions of several local authorities about biomass being a viable fuel source.  We have answered the question of whether it is hugely helpful for local enterprise - and I do mean local enterprise, because that is the supply chain to this.  What we are now trying to do is to design the business solutions, without using too much jargon, that get the money in there to create the demand.  <br/><br/>The big problem in the supply chain is demand.  Broadly speaking, we need clients to use the heat.  We have a couple of district heating schemes that have either advanced a little bit or are at the early stages and looking for money.  As I said, through Deutsche Bank and the European energy efficiency fund, we received approval for &euro;184,000 for a technical assistance fund along with one of the county councils in the region to bring forward the whole idea of a district heating level of around 2 MW to 3 MW.  That would secure long-term fuel supplies for local providers of fuel.<br/><br/>That is the position we are in now.  When I come back to answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions and others around funding, one of the requirements for funding for us is to be able to fund these things directly rather than have to go to Europe.  It is a very long, drawn-out process; it refers to patient investor principles<b>.</b>Energy contracts usually take a decade or more to pay back, but they are hugely job-rich and locally job-rich.  It is not like a hydrocarbon project, which in plain speak is oil or gas, that transfers the money out of the State in the main and away from taxes and the Exchequer.  This transfer the money in the main to the local economy where people can spend it and there is that lovely multiplier effect.  That is where we are on biomass.<br/><br/>In terms of budgetary challenges, we represent around 828,000 people across the seven counties.  We are a tiny organisation.  Our direct budget, non-pay and pay, is roughly &euro;1.5 million.  I realise I am under privilege and I can be more exact than that if required.  Essentially, the problem for us is that our non-pay has not changed since 2009.  I realise that is reflected in other organisations as well.  Our non-pay is around half a million euro.  Take out what it costs to light and heat the places in which we work, and we are talking about a couple of hundred thousand euro to do everything we do.  It is simply not enough.  That is why one of the statements we made at the beginning was that since 2010, we have sourced &euro;13 million of our own money from Europe, from contributions from local authorities and from devolved funds within the western investment fund to get out there and make a change.  We could not have carried out the job creation we have carried out by relying on what we received through the Exchequer funding.  Respectfully, we are putting a lot of positive pressure on to increase that.  We have more people but we need more resources, or else a diminishing marginal returns issue arises.  Without the resources, one cannot do anything.  One can keep talking but cannot actually effect change.<br/><br/>The other budgetary challenge, as pointed out, is probably around the capital plan allocation of last year.  We have had movement on that recently.  That is a million euro per annum and we believe that it will be forthcoming to us.  It will help us greatly to carry out several of the pilots that we were wishing to carry out in order to accelerate our job growth and employment work.<br/><br/>The Chairman asked a question about the benefit of working directly with the EU.</p><p>I will tie this into a question I was not asked, if I may with respect, and that is Brexit.  The committee will see that we are using European capital more and more as risk capital in the regions because that is what we have to do.  Brexit affords us an incredible opportunity.  We are already seeing it.  We are inundated with requests to partner from European groups and are working on this with local authorities and other collaborators in the region.  What we need to do now is accelerate this capacity rapidly through the end of the current EU programme and position ourselves for the next seven-year cycle.  That will allow us to really advance our cause in this field.  There is a great deal of funding there which can really help to kickstart a great deal of employment and socioeconomic progress.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, there is demand and we are taking the initial steps to look at a western regions office built around deal making not information over in Brussels.  It is something we are working with all parties on, including the Department, in terms of how we do this because we believe it will garner huge responses monetarily and information-wise for the region.</p><p> On the next question on the spatial strategy, I will pass to my colleague.</p></speech>

We have had quite a lot of connection with them.  We co-sponsored a conference with the team in September to look at spatial strategies and planning for the future.  We have a great many connections with the national planning framework team in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but we are also next door neighbours of the Northern &amp;amp; Western Regional Assembly which is charged with preparing the regional spatial and economic strategies which are the regional tier of the national planning framework.  We met with the assembly last month to discuss how we can work together to share data and analysis.  We are ready and waiting for more opportunities to have an input.  We are prepared and have made all the connections on the spatial strategy.</p></speech>

There was a very interesting question around infrastructure in general and Knock Airport specifically.  There is an overwhelming opinion - I have to call it as I see it - that if one builds it, they will come.  The attitude is that building an airport in the north west of Ireland has, fortuitously, served us really well.  It is just on the cusp of what some of our analysis shows is commuting distance for an international airport.  Knock has served the north west reasonably well over the years.  I speak not for its balance sheet or operational effectiveness although I believe the former is very healthy now or at least is getting a lot more healthy.  Passenger numbers are growing.  From our own case, it is an incredibly positive thing to speak of a region with an international airport within it.  It is very difficult to put an absolute value on that if one is looking for inward investment.  If the IDA was here, I am sure it would say that this gives the region cachet.  The net effect for us is that it is an incredibly positive development and asset for the region.  On the general question of infrastructure, it proves the point in some ways that there is an attitude of balanced risk management in deciding to undertake some of these infrastructural investments.  I point respectfully also to the motorway to Galway.  The anecdotal response was to look to the tourism boom that was engendered without ever seeing it simply by building that infrastructure link from Dublin to Galway.  That is the sort of thing that motorways, airports and ports engender in a modern economy.  We are always surprised after the fact, which is something we should learn from.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about funds.  There is a demand and a need for a scaled fund that looks at patient-investor principles, which is to say longer-term returns, and a wider socioeconomic return.  It is a fact that there are challenges for a lot of ideas that are job rich and projects that are probably shovel-ready in that they would find it very hard to meet the criteria for commercial returns that are currently in the market, that is, shorter times and higher return rates.  I am not even certain that, actuarially, a pension fund would be capable of doing that but there is absolute demand there in tourism, energy projects and a multitude of cultural events and projects to provide long term returns to the State far in excess of any investment.  To answer the Deputy's question, consideration should given to the creation of a regional socioeconomic fund.  We have run a venture capital fund for some time now and that market is well served.  We have already talked about the transformational growth there.  What we are talking about is something that is not looking at early stage seed capital but rather at more returns to a wider region, including rural areas, which is starved of the actual funds to get things off the ground.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the three or four biggest things with potential in the rural region.  We are absolutely talking about potential.  If the point was not made before, the GVA roughly of our region exceeds that of Northern Ireland and Wales.  While it has to catch up on the rest of the country in the country's benefit, it actually has very good potential.  We are ignoring something by not going after it.  As such, the question is what are we going to do.  We see infrastructure as key.  That is a big question.  We have mentioned skills and will come back to that.  Access to finance is a major issue, without a doubt.  We have addressed it through VC funds over the years and I will come back to microloans, which are something we have also looked at.  However, the working capital is not there in many businesses, especially self-employed SMEs.  A more mature, flexible model must be developed in that regard.  Again, I come back to the point that this must be a place-based model.  It is hard to run risk assessments from an office two and a half hours away where one does not understand the dynamics of a business and cannot make the calls on risk mitigation there.  I put that into the mix, respectfully.</p> <p>  The next question was from Deputy Cannon and centred around the merging of local authorities.  With respect, I will take a pass on that if I may.  There was a good answer on it and I will leave it at that.  Of course, we could give an opinion, but there are models where it has worked and there are probably models where it could be better.  All I would say on anything like that is "Deal with the real issues".  When we look at recent mergers, I note that one-stop shops are great but one has to ensure that they increase capability rather than diminish it.  I have no point to make on the specifics.</p> <p>  On the OECD question, I hand over to my colleague.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen McHenry" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#Q00400"><p>This was about upskilling lower-skilled workers in respect of which the comment was very interesting.  We have more people with lower skills in our region.  While we send a lot of people to higher education, very often they do not return.  A significant number of those in employment or looking for work have lower skills.  The advantage of upskilling them is partly that it is more appropriate to the sectors we have in our region, which tend to be less high technology or knowledge based.  Upskilling them in the areas in which they are likely to find work allows benefits.  It also brings benefits to those companies because they are people who can improve productivity and be more innovative.  Partly, it is a numbers thing and also it is what contribution they make to the type of industry and enterprise we have in the region.  Obviously, higher skills are important and this is not a suggestion that we ignore them completely.  It is just in terms of what we are doing in the region and the people who are living there and who are very often more anchored in the region.  People going for higher skills or going out for education tend to be younger and more mobile, whereas focusing on the people one has and who are strongly attached to the region brings significant benefits.  We have done a great deal of work previously on how enterprise, employment and education in terms of training and skills are all tied together and should be looked at as part of a whole so that it is possible to provide the training or entrepreneurial emphasis one needs by working across all three together.</p></speech>

That is why the creative economy and renewable energy are big.  That is why we are looking at these rather than knowledge intensive service industries <i>per se</i>that will suit Galway and some of the other things.  We are looking for high value in many cases.  The gross value added, GVA, for the creative economy is quite low because a lot of people work seasonally, part-time or it is a lifestyle choice.  We think that is great.  One should not ignore it because it does not generate huge GVA.  It keeps people in the sector and helps them to supplement their income so that they can stay in the region.<br/><br/>In the area of completeness, I shall come to Deputy Connolly with a response to her question on the western track.

Enterprise Ireland is best placed to carry out the analysis as we have an excellent track record in terms of econometric analysis and otherwise.  We should consider doing it as it would help inform other State agencies.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked for details about micro loans.  We have carried out a pilot programme and invested in 17 micro loans that amounts to &euro;313,000 in micro loans.  I will have to get back to her with information on jobs.  N&aacute;dh&uacute;ra Design in Galway has said there would be 60 jobs created but I do not have the number for the jobs related to micro loans.  The micro loans were a response to a demand from the creative economy that said we cannot get money to do anything.  The micro loans are very small and amount to up to &euro;25,000.  This is the type of tailored response that one will get from a regional or locational based solution.  The conversation I would love us to have in the future is that I would like more engagement with the larger State bodies on a model of whether we can slice and dice it from the centre or should go directly to where the need is and work it from that end.  At the moment, we slice and dice it from the centre in terms of inward investment and enterprise development; that has worked for a long time in this State.  It has had good results.  The OECD and other modern countries are very thoughtful about new approaches and tend to seek information from where the issues are in order to best realise the potential.  I will leave my comments at that.   </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.414" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#R00800"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for their invitation to address the committee today.  I am joined by my two colleagues, Mr. Thomas Cooney, chairman of the IFA environment and rural affairs committee and Mr. Thomas Ryan, a member of the IFA environment and rural affairs executive.</p> <p>  For those of us who live and work in rural Ireland, it is a place we love to live in.  We enjoy living and working in rural Ireland.  As President of the IFA I am proud to say that farming is the backbone of economic activity across the countryside.  Farming is Ireland's largest indigenous productive sector.  The sector exported food and drink worth almost &euro;11 billion last year and provides employment to more than 300,000 people directly and indirectly.  Farming has been one of the key drivers in Ireland's economic recovery.  The IFA believes that the recovery has not been felt evenly in all areas and definitely not by people who reside in rural Ireland. </p> <p>  The vote by the UK to leave the EU earlier this year has already had a disproportionate impact on the rural economy.  The depreciation of sterling has had an immediate and negative price impact on agrifood exports and exports from Irish owned SMEs for whom the UK is the destination for over 40% of our products.  The strategic response by the Government to the UK's Brexit decision will have a defining impact on the Irish rural economy.  We feel strongly that the Government must use its strong relationships with the UK and EU to influence as positive an outcome to the negotiations as possible.  We want the positive trading relationship with the UK maintained, we want a strong CAP budget retained and the free movement of people must be maintained.  These are three key priorities. </p> <p>  The Government has recognised the importance of a vibrant countryside, not just for farmers, but for the wider rural community.  That view was reflected in the recent budget and provided the following: increased funding support for farm schemes, the amendment of the income averaging system to deal with income volatility and cashflow pressures; and the provision of a lower cost interest rate on borrowings for farmers.  Also, the reversal of the cuts to the farm assist scheme is hugely positive.  It provides a vital support to low income farmers and allows them to remain farming and living in rural Ireland. </p> <p>  Broader support for the rural economy has been provided through measures such as the increased allocation for Leader and CL&Aacute;R funding, an increased number of places for the rural social scheme and increased funding for the national broadband scheme.  The reduced rate that applies to the capital gains tax entrepreneur relief will also make a difference.  There are a great many small business success stories in rural Ireland, many of which are unheralded enterprises that provide vital employment and income in rural areas. </p> <p>  The IFA has, over many years, developed clear proposals to sustain rural communities.  It has published two key policy papers in this area and I have copies of them with me.  The proposals have contributed to the significant work undertaken by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  I hope it will also feature strongly in the Government's proposed action plan for rural Ireland but action is now required.  The CEDRA report has recognised that rural areas outside of the State's five main cities have been particularly affected by the post-2008 economic downturn with an increase in unemployment of 192%.  The action to be taken must be a total Government response.   The national consultation meetings on the development of an action plan have concluded and it is essential that further progress is made.</p> <p>  The CEDRA report and its 34 recommendations cannot just be remembered as good ideas.  Actions, responsibilities and delivery timelines are required if the Programme for Government's commitment to deliver 135,000 jobs outside of Dublin by 2020 is to be delivered.  To support this initiative the IFA has identified a number priorities that we believe will sustain viable rural communities.  They are as follows - A high quality rural fibre broadband network across the countryside to support farm business, job creation, investment and rural development; a three-year exemption from local authority rates for new business start-ups to support local enterprise development in rural areas; measures such as tax credits to encourage employers to take on apprentices and create long-term employment; tax incentives for businesses to locate in villages and town centres that were decimated during the recession; increased and measurable targets for policing hours and the presence of mobile units in rural areas by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reduce crime and create a greater sense of security in the countryside; an increased and ring-fenced annual rural roads budget from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport each year allocated to local authorities as part of a planned repair and maintenance programme; the re-establishment of a separate local improvement scheme fund in each local authority; an increase in the number of voluntary rural walk schemes to support economic development and tourism in rural areas; a package of measures to facilitate the development of proposed Greenway projects that works in co-operation with landowners impacted and protects their rights; a review of the hedgecutting dates to reduce the closed period in line with the nesting season; and increased fines and greater enforcement by local authorities to tackle the scourge of littering by passing motorists and users of the countryside.</p><p> On the issue of broadband, the case is well made, but the need for action is long overdue.  The plan needs to be announced and rolled out as quickly as possible and the following elements must underpin it.  First, it must be fibre-based, and to the home.  Second, it must be as cost competitive for the homeowners living in Dingle to receive it as it is for their Dublin cousins and third, clear and equivalent download and upload criteria must be set out in the tenders.</p><p> Our apprenticeship proposal is based on the Canadian model, whereby the employer receives an annual tax credit equal to 10% of the apprentice&rsquo;s salary, up to a maximum of $2,000 per year.  With regard to rural security, the additional Garda resources announced are welcomed.  However the basic question remains: what will this mean for rural Ireland?  Objective and measurable hours of policing carried out in rural Ireland must be published by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to know that the additional resources are delivering.</p><p> Littering is a blight on the countryside.  In 2014, the IFA conducted a survey which found that almost two-thirds of members are concerned about the issue of rural littering, and 95% of those surveyed support the introduction of stronger penalties being imposed on anyone who dumps litter out of cars and along roadside verges.  I speak from experience because I have land along a main road and I see bags that have been thrown on to it every week.  The IFA would welcome the support of the committee on this issue and also to address the anomaly in the existing littering legislation, which currently holds landowners legally responsible for the rubbish dumped on their lands by third parties who use the countryside as a dumping ground.</p><p> We are happy to expand on the points I have mentioned.  I again thank the Chairman and the committee for the taking the time to consider what it takes to sustain a rural economy and I hope the presentation has given them the IFA's perspectives.  Between the three of us, we will our best to answer questions.</p></speech>

I fully agree with Mr. Healy's view that proper investment in services in rural areas is needed for people to be able to live in them.  No matter where you are, the living environment you experience is one of the key elements for you locating there.  Garda stations, post offices, functioning banks, schools, etc., need to be anchors in those areas for them to be sustainable.</p> <p>  I agree that littering is shocking.  Sometimes when hedges are cut back, one notices how much litter has been cast into them over the summer.  Fly tipping is also a problem along with people throwing rubbish out their car windows because the wildlife picks up the rubbish and disperses it over an even wider area.</p> <p>  We often discuss Brexit as a Border issue due to the high dependence on agriculture in Border counties.  It is, however, a 32-county issue.  What interactions has the IFA had with the State for the State to ascertain and analyse its experience?  What engagements has the State had with its members to alleviate the issues they are experiencing?  Could Mr. Healy point to material interactions and materials engagements the State has had with his members to begin the process of alleviating the damage Brexit is causing and will continue to cause?</p> <p>  Has the association engaged with any State organisation looking for inputs, presentations or perspectives on a spatial strategy?  What is the IFA's view on the fire station of the west?  Biomass presents a major opportunity, as we heard from our contributors earlier, but there are worries in rural areas that if we go down the route of fire stations in too dense a fashion, it will force people to leave farms and add to the depopulation of areas.  What is the association's perspective on that?</p> <p>  The flagship greenway is the Westport to Achill route and other greenways have been established since it opened.  Could the IFA have a role in accelerating these projects, given that many of the farms the greenways could potentially pass through are on its members' land?  For example, we are trying to establish a greenway in County Meath running from the source of the River Boyne to the estuary, which would pass through many internationally recognised heritage sites such as Trim Castle, the Hill of Tara, Newgrange, Slane, the Battle of the Boyne site, etc.  Could the IFA have a role if project administrators went to the association for help to contact all the farmers on the route?</p> <p>  One of the major threats to farming in rural areas is market concentration.  In other words, the demand that is fed is concentrated in a few hands, which exert enormous pressure on prices and the terms and conditions of supply whether it be the factories that farmers supply or the supermarkets that purchase agriculture products.  There must be a strong attitude towards preventing that over-concentration of buyer power in the market.  Has much effort been made by the IFA and farmers to develop a new wave of co-operatives?  A contributor to the committee recently pointed out how a co-operative was set up in the north west in respect of the supply of biomass.  It went from an inconsistent supply of timber into service stations to the production, sale and installation of boilers and a more secure and direct supply.</p></speech>

I must declare an interest, as I am a paid-up member and I am a former chairman of my local branch in Schull, west Cork.  I am also a paid-up member of the ICSA and I am proud to be a member of both.  The Schull branch members got rid of me in the end.  I was a thorn in their side because I always stood up on behalf of the small farmer.  I have had lengthy discussions with them.  Even prior to the budget, I had many discussions with Cornie Buckley, the excellent IFA chairman in west Cork.  He put his points across and, thankfully, it was a fair budget in respect of farming, especially at a difficult time because suckler cow, dairy and grain farmers are struggling severely.  The IFA officials will be well aware of this as they deal with them on a day-to-day basis the same as I do.  I called locally in west Cork recently for the co-operatives to be more lenient.  Some of them were angered by that.  I did not read the reply in the local newspaper from the co-operative chairperson who was angry about my plea to the co-operatives, the banks and the Department of Social Protection to give some ease to farmers who were in severe difficulty.  I called on the Taoiseach to do the same during Leaders' Questions.</p> <p>  It is hugely important that we have a Taoiseach who will work with the IFA and the other farming organisations to ensure the co-operatives, the banks and the Department of Social Protection work together because many farmers are in serious difficulty.  During the negotiations on the programme for Government, I had many angry discussions with the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, about the fact that some farmers are in receipt of &euro;150,000 under the single payment scheme but, sadly, most of the farmers in Cork South West, which I represent, earn less than &euro;10,000 per annum.</p><p>This situation needs to be addressed.  There are only a small number of people affected but the amount involved is huge to a farmer on a low income.  I am a small farmer.  If I did not have my income as a political representative I would be in serious trouble.  I could not survive on the income I get from the farm.  My single farm payment amounts to approximately &euro;3,000 per annum, which is a pittance.  There is no way out of that web once one gets caught in it.  While I am not personally caught up in that way many of the farmers I represent are and they believe that the current situation is unfair.</p><p> I would urge the IFA to take a look at the situation with a view to ensuring a fairer system.  I understand that bigger farmers have higher costs but &euro;150,000 is a huge amount of money.  This issue needs to be examined.  I had many serious and heated discussions on this issue with the Minister in the context of the programme for Government, as did other Deputies from rural communities.  This cannot continue and it must be changed.</p><p> Looking at the budget from a positive perspective, the additional 500 places on the rural social scheme is welcome.  This is one of the issues I have discussed regularly with Mr. Cornie Buckley of west Cork IFA.  Under this scheme low income farmers can get a small top-payment while working in their communities.  In fairness to the Minister for Social Protection, he has increased the number of places on that scheme by 500, which, hopefully, will come about quickly.  </p><p> The walks scheme was also mentioned, which, in the main, emanated from west Cork, including the Sheeps Head Way and the Beara Way but development of these walks has come to a standstill.  There are many areas of the country that want to see the development of walkways in their area and funding in this regard needs to be directed to them.  The co-operation of farmers in terms of development of these walkways is brilliant, particularly in west Cork.  There are a great success story in terms of tourism.  Verge cutting, another issue related to farming, although at a low level, is a huge issue in rural Ireland.  The withdrawal of responsibility for verge cutting from the local authorities was a disastrous move.  They are now pointing to responsibility in that regard being with the landowners.  Everybody is pointing the finger at the landowner but if a landowner when cutting a verge cuts away part of a ditch he or she is taken to task for doing so.</p><p> Responsibility in this regard should rest with the local authorities.  People in rural Ireland are paying enough in taxes to enable the local authorities to undertake verge cutting.  The IFA needs to be stronger than it has been to date on securing a reversal of that decision which was taken a number of years ago.  We are encouraging tourists to come here to see our beautiful country.  Many cars used by tourists to travel around the country are being damaged by overhanging bushes and briars and as a result they are not getting their deposits back on cars hired when they return them.  That is not good enough.  This is an issue for the local authorities and the IFA needs to be stronger in terms of its stance in this regard.  Obviously, over-growth of bushes and briars on the inside of a verge is a landowner issue but over-growth on the roadside should be a local authority issue. </p><p> On planning, I come from a peninsula.  I am involved in the board of management of a local school in my area.  While the school is well staffed and has an excellent principal enrolment at the school is decreasing, which is indicative to me of where things are heading.  There are few employment opportunities in the area.  The current planning laws are deterring people coming to live in rural communities.  I had a meeting the other day with a person who was refused planning permission because of the seven year clause.  We need to start using our heads.  The position of Government in terms of whether it wants to see people living in rural Ireland is questionable.  Rural communities will not survive if the planning laws are not relaxed a little.  I accept that the IFA has been strong on this issue down through the years.</p><p> Reference was made to the CEDRA report.  Many rural post offices and Garda stations have been closed.  The two banks on the peninsula where I live have closed.  We no longer have a bank in the area which means people have to travel up to 25 miles to  Goleen, Skibbereen and Bantry to do their banking, which is incredible.  As I said, many rural post offices and Garda stations have been closed and while I do not anticipate any reversal of the decision in that regard I ask that the IFA strongly support us in trying to bring it about.  I am sure that members of the IFA are aware of the new proposals regarding post offices, including that they be 15 km apart.  The idea of travelling post offices has also been proposed.  These types of proposals will worsen the situation for rural communities rather than help them.  The CEDRA report has not been acted on.  The Leader programme has been destroyed in most areas because it is no longer community-led.  These are all serious issues.  There is no point in people telling me that things are improving because there is no evidence of that in the constituency I represent.</p><p> Many farm families are dependent on off-farm income, including, for example, income earned from home help provision.  I would urge the IFA to try to secure more funding for the home help service in rural communities.  In my own area we are finding it very difficult to secure an additional hour or day of help for people under the home help scheme.  People often ask me why it is they are eligible for help from Monday to Friday but are deemed able to help themselves on Saturday and Sunday.  People's circumstances do not miraculously change at the weekend.  It is important issues like that are addressed.</p><p> I acknowledge the work of the IFA in regard to the fair deal scheme and I urge it to continue its work in that regard into the future on behalf of the many people who are experiencing serious financial hardship in respect of loved ones in nursing homes.  While I could speak for another hour the above are the main issues arising for me.  As I said earlier, I am a farmer from a rural community.  There is need for a clear understanding of the huge differences in farming from area to area.  Farmers are being fined because they have scrub on their lands but what can they do?  They cannot remove the hills.  There is no clear understanding or common sense being applied in relation to farming as a result of which people are suffering.  It is my job to represent the views of these people.  I am pleading with the IFA to continue to work with us into the future.  I look forward to working with it.</p></speech>

It was very helpful.  We all know that farming has been through a difficult few years in terms of commodity prices and weather conditions.  In terms of Brexit, the IFA president, Mr. Healy, has pointed to the importance of a positive trading relationship with the UK and the retention of a strong CAP budget as essential if we are to ensure that we have a vibrant agricultural sector.  During last week's meeting of the committee we heard that over 90% of farmers in Roscommon have been paid their basic payment, in respect of which over &euro;25 million was paid out.  Seventy per cent of basic payment scheme payments were paid out last week.  This is important in the sense that it allows farmers to pay their bills, which in turns feeds into ensuring the vibrancy of communities.  The introduction of preliminary checks in respect of the basic payment scheme is positive.  The objective of this measure is to ensure farmers are not continuously penalised, which is important.  The move to online application has also helped.  However, this feeds into our conversation around broadband.  In my own county of Roscommon the IFA has been very influential in assisting farmers in gaining access to educational programmes to ensure they become more online savvy, which is very important.  In this regard, the IFA has been working closely with Teagasc and the Roscommon Leader Partnership.  These educational programmes are important in the context of the move to online trading, which is necessary these days.</p><p> I wish to raise a number of issues.  The budget was positive, in the sense that there was an amendment to the income averaging system to assist with cashflow pressures.  The interest rate of 3% for low-cost borrowing is very important.  My conversations with the IFA centred on access to finance, which was a major issue.  It is positive that we are beginning to see practical measures to assist farmers.</p><p> Obviously, we face significant challenges.  As a member of Macra na Feirme, I know there are challenges in encouraging young farmers to take on the occupation of farming.  Measures have been introduced, but a lot more needs to be done to encourage young farmers into the sector.  Access to finance has been an issue.  Alongside that, the discussions we have had on off-farm income are important.  We need to try to create better job opportunities in rural areas to supplement farm incomes.</p><p> The issue of hedge cutting is due to be debated in the Seanad over the next two weeks or so.  I am aware the IFA wants to ensure we bring forward the hedge cutting date by one month.  It would seem to be a very practical measure, in terms of contributing to better hedgerow management and trying to address safety concerns as it is confined to periods where daylight hours have been reduced.  I take on board what was presented on the concerns around hedge cutting.</p><p> Bigger challenges have been mentioned, namely, broadband infrastructure, modernisation and ensuring that services are in place to support communities.  As a young person living in a rural area and coming from a farming background, I know there are major positives.  Rural Ireland offers a very good quality of life and its potential is untapped.  We need to be constructive, but also practical and positive about the positive elements of rural life.</p><p> Litter is a bugbear of mine.  While I agree with the penalties, until there is mobile CCTV we will not deal with the issue.  It needs to hit people where it hurts, which is in the pocket.  I am involved with the Tidy Towns committee in my local area and it is extremely frustrating.  We need to move to a situation where mobile CCTV targets blackspot areas and penalties are imposed on those who do not abide by the law.</p><p> I am very supportive of greenway projects, which have assisted in the development of tourism.  There has been a large amount of co-operation from landowners, which has been positive.  We know there are some challenges with certain greenway projects but where they have worked, they have been very positive in attracting people to areas and increasing footfall in communities.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their contributions and look forward to continuing to work with the IFA.  It has a significant amount to offer, not just within the agricultural sector but also in terms of its input in the wider picture.  </p><p> Reference was made to the CEDRA report.  An action plan for rural Ireland is currently being developed.  It is very important that the IFA plays an active role in the development of that action plan. By their nature, farmers and farming are very much embedded within the greater community.</p></speech>

It set out stark facts in terms of how the farming sector is critical now and in the future to sustaining rural communities across the country.  Most of us who live in rural Ireland are either directly involved in farming or are, at most, one generation away from it.  When farming thrives, rural Ireland thrives.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>I have some questions.  Reference was made to an apprenticeship scheme, something of which I am not aware.  I ask the delegation to expand on that because it sounds interesting and a little more than fascinating.</p><p>I refer to artisan food producers, that is, people who add value to their food product before it leaves the farm gate.  The president of the IFA will be very familiar with the work of Ronan Byrne in the poultry sector in Athenry, Justin Flannery who is involved in the beef sector and Declan Droney who is doing extraordinary work with smoked salmon in Kinvara, all of whom are Galway-based farmers who have been exceptionally innovative in adding value to their products before they leave the farm gate. </p><p>Does the IFA see them as outliers or does it believe that there is significantly more potential for farmers to develop food products within the farm gate?  What sort of activity is taking place in this area?  Is there ongoing liaison or engagement with Teagasc on the significant potential of the sector?  I may be mistaken in having the view that there is significant potential but when I see what local farmers are doing, I wonder whether the IFA sees that sector as a major opportunity for growth in the rural economy in the future.</p><p>I refer to micro-energy generation in terms of wind and perhaps photovoltaic cells.  I cycled in rural France during August and lost count of the number of farmyards I came across where farm sheds were covered in photovoltaic cells.  Any large roof spaces were covered.  I spoke to one or two farmers who told me they easily covered their on-farm energy requirements and fed the excess back into the grid.  Is that something that the IFA sees as having major potential for Irish farmers in the future?</p><p>I am more than familiar with greenways.  I congratulate the IFA on the very proactive and supportive approach it has taken to the development of a national network of greenways.  These routes offer significant potential to create tourism opportunities in parts of Ireland that have never seen tourism.  East Galway is not exactly overrun with tourists and Mr. Joe Healy will agree with me on that.  I congratulate the IFA on how supportive it has been.  My assessment of the challenge that remains in delivering the greenway from Athlone to Galway is that the first attempt to find a route was exceptionally badly mismanaged by the NRA.  There was little or no engagement with the farming community.  In fact, the only engagement was to present the community with a route once it had been designed - in essence, it was a <i>fait accompli. </i>How can we overcome this problem?  There was significant use of State-owned lands from Dublin to Athlone, yet west of Athlone such lands were not used.  Instead, productive agricultural land was used.  What is the solution?  It is something I want to see happen, I hope in my lifetime.  The potential is untapped and the IFA has a major role to play.  It has been very proactive in the area.  How do we get over the initial obstacles we encountered and make it happen?</p></speech>

I had a family event today I could not avoid.  I am glad to be here to welcome the delegation.  We need to work together because the farming community is at a crossroads.</p><p>The biggest issue we must face, fight or get around is Brexit.  If farmers make a bit of money, they are the best community to spend money.  If the farming community is not doing well, the country does not do well.  It is time the people up here in Dublin and in urban areas begin to realise this because if the farmers do not do well, the rest of the country will not do well either.  When I say farmers put back everything, I mean they put back every bob they make into the farm when they have a few pounds to spend.  A few years ago, a farmer won the lotto and when he was asked what he would do with his winnings, he said he would stay farming.  Where the farmer said that can be traced back because it is the truth.  Whatever they have they spend on their land.  They are criticised at times for breaking environmental rules by these environmentalists, but some of those fellows do not know what they are talking about.  They can spread slurry fine these days as the land is dry and it can be done, but a few weeks ago they could not do it because places were saturated.  They are beginning to dry slowly now.  The farmers know and will always treat their land well because it was handed down to them or they had to pay a high cost to buy it.</p><p> Prices for produce is the biggest issue.  There is very little mention of beef farmers but they are under severe pressure.  When they receive only &euro;3.60 per kilo in the factories for beef how will they survive?  It costs them more to produce than they get for the produce when they sell it.  What needs to be dealt with is the monopoly of the factories.  I make no bones about it.  There is a rule that people are fined &euro;70 or &euro;90 for going over four movements when the animal is hanging up.  I ask each and every person here what difference does it make, and how will someone know how many times a carcass has moved by looking at it or cutting it up?  It is a penal law imposed by the factories.  I ask that we all work together to ensure this ridiculous law is removed.  Last week, I took ten heifers to the mart but did not sell them.  I would not sell them for what I was getting for them and I brought them home.  This is classed as a movement.  It is totally unfair and must be addressed.  There will have to be an almighty attack launched on the factories to get rid of this rule.</p><p> Milk farmers are under serious threat and I make no bones about it.  The previous Government advised farmers there was a market for milk and to increase production.  They went at it hell for leather and spent &euro;200,000, &euro;300,000, &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million on set-ups and are now on the rails.  What can we do to help them?  Something will have to be done.</p></speech>

We were promised local improvement schemes, which were suspended in 2011, but there was no mention of them in the budget as much as I, other Members and local authority members throughout the country have fought.  The people in rural Ireland are entitled to a good road to their door.  The last half mile to their door is as important as the road to the door of the people in Dublin 4 and we do not begrudge anyone anything.  This came from the Department of Finance.  It tried to bring about this change to stop the taxpayer for paying for what it calls private roads.  In many instances they are public roads going to many houses.  These people are entitled to them.  They pay car tax and every kind of tax, including property tax, but they see very little for it.</p> <p>  It is the same with regard to the emergency hardship scheme.  In the case of an old farmer or his wife, the doctors or home help cannot get up or down the road.  We used to have a good scheme which was the emergency hardship scheme.  There is no funding for it now.  Everyone here knows there is no maintenance money for draining county roads and there is no money for surfacing county roads.  These people pay their tax as well as anyone else.  It is galling to think work never stops on motorways but no work is carried out on the local roads because there is no funding for it.</p> <p>  Hedges were mentioned.  I have been raising this issue for as long as I was a member of Kerry County Council.  They tried to take my seat off me the first year I mentioned it because they said I was trying to get the local authority to cut the hedges so that I would get the job myself.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  School buses cannot go up or down roads.  A load of hay cannot go up to any farmer's yard now because the roads are closed in.  Something has to be done to open up the roads and let the people travel.</p> <p>  The rivers are all clogged.  Something must be done.  I put the whole blame on Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI.  It will not let a farmer go near a river or waterway.  The trees are crossing the rivers and there are big mounds of silt and gravel where the farmers always knew where to take it out without doing any harm to the river.  The IFI threatens the farmers or whoever that if they do not get out of its way it will get the garda&iacute; to remove them and they will have to bring back all the stuff.  It is ridiculous.  We must let the water flow.  Roads are blocked, houses are flooded and in one instance in Glenflesk the whole place gets flooded.  The emergency services cannot get up or down the national primary road there.  There are 22 houses in the community and they are all flooded.  We have nothing to bring in this year because the IFI is holding up the entire thing.  I call for the IFI to be brought to task somehow by a Minister to make it realise this.  The sad thing about it-----</p></speech>

They hold up some farmers' payments for a whole year or maybe more, and those farmers cannot put bread on the table when this is going on.  They are entitled to receive some of the payment but not to it all.  However, the whole lot is held up and this needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Under the fair deal scheme the farm is taken into account when the old person has to go into a nursing home.  The person must pay 7.5% of the cost of the farm and this is a serious issue.  As far as I can see it has not been addressed in the budget.  We need to address this issue and work together on it.</p> <p>  With regard to diesel there was a lot of talk that the VAT and excise duty would be increased in the budget.  They were not increased in the budget and they were not mentioned.  At the same time, the price has increased at every pump throughout the country and there is no excuse for this because the barrel of oil is still very cheap.</p><p>Why is that happening?  When there is any small increase it goes up at the pumps the following day.</p></speech>

While I admire their views and we love to see people thinking in the same way as we do, we need to recognise that the members are the people who have been elected and are in power.  We need to lobby them to get done many of the things they have raised.  We are dependent on them, as our politicians, to get them over the line.  We will divide up the questions between us so that members will not get too bored of any voice going on for too long.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about Brexit.  At times we might be forgiven for wondering if there is any other story in town.  From a farming point of view it is the big story and the major concern.  It is by far in a way the greatest threat to farmers and agriculture.  We have seen its impact already with the volatility and movement in currency.  On the day of the Brexit referendum, 23 June, the exchange rate was 76p or 77p to &euro;1 and that has now gone to 89p or 90p to &euro;1, which is an incredible movement over a short space of time.</p> <p>  I just came from a Bord Bia board meeting where it dominated the agenda in respect of how best to spend the extra allocation given to Bord Bia and whether some of it should be spent in the UK, which is our largest market for beef.  There is not even a close second; it takes over 50% of our beef.  It takes 42% or 43% of our total agrifood exports with a total value of &euro;4.8 billion going to the UK.  The board members were asking themselves whether money should be spent there to try to enhance the market we have there and to try to create such an awareness that in the event of a worst-case scenario of the UK doing its own trade deals, our beef products would be so prominent in consumers' minds that they would decide to stay with it but at a price, or whether it should be spent elsewhere in other markets.</p> <p>  We are very involved with Brexit.  Even before the referendum, we organised a number of events to create awareness of the issues, and highlight the worst-case scenarios and the importance of the UK as a market.</p></speech>

There were two main issues.  First, we had the cost competitiveness issues on which we were lobbying for the budget, including diesel and low-cost financing.  Brexit was the other one.  We proposed the need for adequate funding to be given to source markets elsewhere, which is related to what I mentioned earlier about Bord Bia.  We also discussed adequate resources in the Department, especially on the veterinary side, so that if markets are secured in other places, they will not be held up by a delay in veterinary certification etc.</p> <p>  We have been involved at Oireachtas events.  Rowena Dwyer, our chief economist, attended one of them last week as I was out of the country.  We have also had a number of meetings with personnel from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

Have officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine met such farmers to provide marketing support tools and point out the markets elsewhere they need to go to?  While I understand there have been high-level meetings and some budgets have been located in good areas, what kind of hand-holding has there been?</p></speech>

If the Chairman were to ask them, they would say they had been in contact with the IFA.  Only yesterday we called on the Department to help the mushroom sector, which is very exposed with 90% of our mushrooms going to the UK.  Four mushroom companies have folded since the Brexit referendum.  Yesterday we called on the Department to look to the EU.  There should be and there are schemes regarding state aid.  I know there is a provision - I forget the article number - that allows for aid for sectors that suffer excessively owing to decisions taken outside their control.  We will need to continue to push for that especially for the mushroom sector.  Today the managing director of Kepak suggested that something similar needed to be done for beef.  That is our work with the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Brexit.</p> <p>  On market concentration and the food chain, only last night in Portlaoise we had a meeting to discuss liquid milk.  In 1995 a total of 3,334 registered milk suppliers were supplying fresh milk for the winter trade and the milk-drinking trade.  Twenty years later, only 1,982 remain.  There was a drop-off of 40%, which shows farmers voting with their feet.  The same is true of almost any sector in agriculture.  We often say that what the consumer is paying is adequate to ensure a margin for the processor, the retailer and the farmer, but unfortunately it is not getting back to the farmer.</p> <p>  Teagasc quotes a break-even figure of &euro;4 per kilogram in the production of beef.  Currently we are at a base price of &euro;3.60 to &euro;3.65 per kilogram, losing 40 cent per kilogram, which is a loss of &euro;160 on a 400-kilogram carcass; it is quite easy to do the maths on it.  Teagasc also quotes a figure of 26 cent a litre to produce milk in a normal year.  This year, 2016, was not a normal year weather-wise and farmers were selling at a base price for most of the year of 22 cent or 23 cent a litre - it went down as low as 21 cent.</p> <p>  I am chairman of the COPA food chain group.  Christine Tacon, the UK groceries code adjudicator, spoke at our last meeting.  She will attend a meeting we have organised at a venue close to Dublin Airport on 30 November.  When the question was put to her, she was very clear on the need for mandatory legislation at national and EU level.  Unlike what we have here, it needs to include a ban on below-cost selling.  We also need an ombudsman to enforce the rules and laws on it.  We need to ensure that the farmers and the producers of the raw material in each sector are getting a fair return from the marketplace.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins is a member of two organisations in west County Cork.  I know Cornie Buckley very well.  I will be heading to Bantry tonight to attend an event tomorrow to commemorate the farmers who left Bantry in 1966 to walk to Dublin.  That was where they started out from first.  I am looking forward to meeting them tomorrow.</p> <p>  I am not sure if I took the Deputy up right on this.  He mentioned co-operatives and the banks.  Senator Hopkins also referred to it.  Rather than calling it low-cost finance, what we have is lower-cost finance compared with where we were.  A rate of 2.95% is great and we very much welcome it.  An IFA delegation went to Belgium to meet farmers there about two months ago.</p><p>We met one particular farmer who had borrowed &euro;650,000 using three loans with a fixed term of between five and seven years at interest rates of 1.4% to 1.7%.  European farmers are our counterparts in Europe but they are also our competitors, which is a handicap.  We very much welcome the 2.95% interest rate.  It is a huge improvement on where we were but we like to think that there is room for further improvement. </p><p> We welcome the announcement of 500 extra positions on the rural social scheme and the reversal of the cuts made to the farm assist scheme in terms of the income and child disregards.</p><p> The areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments were not mentioned in the budget even though we lobbied hard for it to be included.  When I attend meetings, farmers tell me that the ANC payments, or the disadvantaged area based payments, are from the one scheme where everything goes to the farmer unlike GLAS where one must pay a planner and vets for certificates.  A sum of &euro;25 million has been allocated and is due to be announced in budget 2018 even though we wanted it to be brought forward to budget 2017.</p><p> Next year's ANC review is something that we, as a lobby organisation, will need strong political will behind because very often, reviews are simply used as a means to reduce the number of participants.  We hope the review will be like the agritaxation review that was carried out a few years ago where the Government accepted the issues that were put forward and there were no losses in that regard.  The ANC review is critical for rural areas as the funding reaches the areas most in need.  I have flagged the scheme to notify the committee that the IFA will seek its support to drive on this agenda.  </p><p> Senator Maura Hopkins mentioned that 90% of basic payment scheme payments have been paid, which is great.  Without a doubt, preliminary checks have been positive but 10% of such payments remain unpaid.  It would make no difference if 90% were not paid because the payment is so important for each person who is part of the remaining 10%.  That is where we need political support.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has mentioned this also and we have lobbied for same.  As much as 70% was paid out in the first tranche and 30% in the second.  There were few or no penalties - one can count them on one hand - over 30%.  The majority of penalties are below 10%.  We feel strongly that the first tranche should be paid out to 100% of farmers and if there are penalties or anomalies the second tranche should be held back.  This is the time of year when merchants must be paid and there is a tax bill.  This is also an expensive time of year because children have returned to school and college fees must be paid.  Regardless of how small is the basic payment, a 70% advance is crucial.  We have fought for, lobbied for and continued to push for the 70% advance to be paid out across the board.  </p><p> Access to low-cost finance has been mentioned.  We need to ensure that the &euro;150 million is drawn down and, if and when it is drawn down, that another amount is put in place to satisfy demand.  Moreover, by next January the Department and the Minister should have worked with the banks in order that they are ready to roll and that the banks will not have the power to put obstacles in the way.</p><p> Senator Hopkins mentioned broadband.  People used to call vice grip pliers a farmer's toolbox but broadband is now a farmer's toolbox.  No matter where one goes in the country one must apply for a virtual private service, VPS.  It is terrible that by the year after next, applications for important and crucial agricultural schemes for the countryside must be submitted online and yet there are large tracts of the country that have no broadband.</p><p> I will tell a story about poor broadband coverage that I am sure Senator Hopkins has heard previously.  When I was on the campaign trail I visited a house and asked the woman who answered the door where her husband was.  She told me that he was down the yard, so I walked down the yard and called after him.  I thought he was in a particular shed because his voice came from that direction.  I went into the shed and realised that he was in fact standing outside of the shed.  I walked to the corner of his shed and saw that he was standing there holding his jacket over his laptop because that was the only place on his farm where he could get broadband coverage.  He told me "I shall not shake your hand as I am afraid to move.  You will get my vote but don't stir me."  He stood in that position because he was trying to register his calves online.  In this day and age, having poor broadband coverage is not on.  Broadband must be rolled out.</p><p> It has been mentioned that the problem of litter cannot be tackled unless there are satellite cameras everywhere.  There is an anomaly in the existing legislation because a landowner is held legally responsible for what someone passing outside of the wall throws out the window of his or her vehicle.  That is wrong and needs to be tackled.</p><p> Deputy Cannon mentioned artisan food producers.  I know every one of the artisan producers he mentioned, including his own neighbour who farms in Athenry.  I am fairly confident that there is scope for further improvement in the sector and it would add value inside the farm gate.  The sector is a niche market and has a long way to go before it is anything other than a niche market.  We need to ensure that bureaucracy is minimised and the IFA organisation can lobby for that.  People who are willing to set up their own business with a potential to create employment should be encouraged rather than discouraged.  The level of bureaucracy certainly discourages many people from setting up a business.</p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned bringing his heifers to the mart.  He should look on the bright side because he was able to bring them home.  I know many farmers who could not afford to bring them home but the Deputy's point is correct.  </p><p> The movement of cattle to a mart is not a movement.  If one brings cattle to a mart and then brings them home it is not a movement.  </p></speech>

Marts have a special exemption in that one can bring one's animals to a mart and bring them home again.  The Deputy is right that having only four movements is wrong.  Let us say Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is a quality assured farmer who has signed up to the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme, satisfies all of the criteria and his first cousin is Joe Healy, minus the surname of Rae, and he, too, is a quality assured farmer.  If I sell my cattle to the Deputy and all they do is move in a trailer from my farm to his farm then that should not be classed as a movement.  Even worse than that, let us say Deputy Danny Healy-Rae rents a shed from the farmer next door, operates a bed and breakfast and does all of the feeding of the cattle over the winter.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae must move those cattle from his herd number into that man's herd number even though he has never seen them and the Deputy looks after the cattle.  When the Deputy moves them back into his own herd number it will be deemed two movements and, as a result, one is halfway to losing bonus payments.  The IFA has constantly lobbied about the matter but there has been little progress.  It all comes back to the power of the processor and retailer in the food chain.</p> <p>  I have dealt with the query about the basic payment scheme, BPS.  </p> <p>  The IFA lobbied hard for the fair deal scheme to be included in the budget.  Unfortunately, it was not delivered.  It has been mentioned that a 50% rate might be introduced.  Ms Rowena Dwyer, the IFA's chief economist, compiled figures on the fair deal scheme and discovered that a 50% rate would add nothing.  A farm is to a farmer what a hammer is to a carpenter.  A farm is only a tool to generate an income to keep a family or individuals off social welfare and in employment.  The IFA makes no apologies for being against anything that puts a farm at risk.  In terms of the fair deal scheme, a farm is only a productive asset that we want removed from the calculations.  It is fair enough to include a house or private residence but not the tool that is used to generate an income.</p><p>The final issue I will address is excise duty on agricultural diesel, an issue on which we lobbied hard.  While I accept that prices at the pumps are increasing, at least we avoided an increase in excise and common sense prevailed.  Agricultural diesel is the fuel that keeps rural Ireland alive.  </p></speech>

This causes difficulties and generates significant policing costs.  An argument has been made for having one type of diesel and allowing farmers to apply for rebates, perhaps on a bimonthly basis.  Under the proposed scheme, farmers would continue to pay the same costs for diesel as they did for diesel for agricultural purposes.  At the same time, the scope for criminal activity would be eliminated and the &euro;600 million annual cost of policing the issue would no longer arise.  I accept, however, that it would give rise to cashflow challenges for farmers as they would have to wait for a rebate.  What is the IFA's view on the matter?</p></speech>

A farm family may have a number of cars and some family members could be employed elsewhere, which means the exemption could be abused.  The marker in diesel has been improved and we are informed that the use of laundered diesel has declined as a result.  The proposed scheme would create a cashflow problem initially and farmers are already experiencing problems accessing finance.  The scheme would impose a serious burden on agricultural contractors who cut silage in June and this burden would fall back on the farmer, creating an additional cashflow problem.  We are in favour of waiting to see if the improved marker works.  The issue may have to be reviewed in future but we are not keen on the proposal at the moment because of the cashflow problems it would create.</p> <p>  We were asked a question about planning.  I attended the national planning framework consultation, which was held in the Ashling Hotel in Dublin in May or June 2016.  The IFA will make a submission when the time comes.  Our position is that the current housing guidelines are ten years old and must be redrafted and placed on a statutory footing.  We would require local authorities to grant planning permission to families who wish to work and live in their local communities.  While we clearly do not want a house to be built in every field, we must strike a balance that allows people who are indigenous to an area and who wish to live and work in it the opportunity to build a house there.  </p></speech>

Aspects of this strategy are preventing family members of farmers from accessing national secondary roads in County Kerry.  My county has more miles of national secondary road than any other county.  Family members are being prevented from securing planning permission.  In some cases, Kerry County Council has granted planning permission and the road engineers have found no problems with road access but Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has then appealed the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which has subsequently overruled the planning approval on the basis of a clause inserted in the spatial strategy in 2012.  Are the witnesses seeking a review of the relevant provision because it is hurting many people?</p></speech>

How can we find a balance?  I could not get the message through to the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in order that he could gain a clear understanding of farmers who are in a difficult position because they have very low incomes.  I would appreciate the witnesses' comments on that.</p></speech>

Some EU member states are much more interested than is Ireland in maintaining the higher payments.  The common consensus in Ireland is that people would prefer the ceiling to be much lower.  We hope changes will be made as part of the review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2020.  It is impossible to defend payments that are only capped at &euro;150,000.  The ceiling could be reduced to one third of that figure.  We can try to have the position changed but it will be difficult to do so.</p></speech>

We want all farmers' fears to be addressed.  While we support greenways, provided they are done in agreement with landowners, we will not allow them to be railroaded through farms.  An adequate compensation package must be provided for farmers.  We are informed the greenways will be opened up for public consultation in the coming months.  That is our position.</p> <p>  On hedge cutting, our priority is to get the Bill to which Senator Hopkins referred through the Seanad.  We will ask all Deputies to support the legislation when it is introduced in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill provides that hedge cutting would be permitted in August and controlled burning would be allowed in March.  I accept the point on funding for hedge cutting.  Our current priority is to have the roads fixed, potholes repaired, etc.</p> <p>  Farmers are passionate about the local improvement scheme.  All county councillors and farmers will agree with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's comments on this issue.  Apart from access for family members, farms must also be accessible to milk, cattle and meal lorries.  The local improvement scheme is vital in this regard.  Members should keep up the good work in seeking to have funding for the scheme increased.  We understand the scheme is part of the programme to be announced in 2018.  A scheme was included in the programme for Government of the previous Government but it was not good enough.  It is no good taking money from a depleted roads budget, as was done under the measure introduced by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  We want a separate source of funding for the scheme.</p> <p>  We welcome Senator Hopkins's suggestions regarding closed circuit television cameras to monitor littering.  The environment committee of the IFA is in the process of drawing up a submission to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, on legislative changes to address the issue of fly-tipping.  We do not want to facilitate dumping but we need to get the balance right on the issue.  We will make some suggestions to the Minister as regards legislative changes to remove the responsibility for fly-tipping from the landowner.  At the same time, we do not want to introduce a measure that could be abused.</p> <p>  The environment committee has also done surveys on the diesel price and highlighted price differences of as much as 8 cent to 10 cent between counties.  County Kerry was found to be the dearest county in one survey.  It is important that farmers shop around or use group purchase schemes and similar approaches. </p> <p>  While progress is being made on delays in payments, as the president noted, that is of no benefit to those who are experiencing delays.  We will continue to lobby on this issue.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-26a.455" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Thomas Ryan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016102600002#Y00800"><p>I will briefly address four areas.  I note Deputy Cannon, who raised the apprenticeship scheme, has left the meeting.  The scheme is based on a model introduced by the Canadian Government known as the apprenticeship job creation tax credit.</p><p>Essentially, this is a non-refundable tax credit equal to 10% of the employee's salary each year, up to a maximum of &euro;2,000 per year.  It has been in place for ten years, since May 2006.  It is seen as something that encourages the normalisation of work when these people are taken on.  While there can be a black economy issue the apprenticeship scheme also stimulates activity in the rural economy for the micro-enterprises such as the one or two person artisan food producer or the local mechanic.  Something like this can make a difference with regard to taking on that extra person, and every job counts in rural Ireland.</p><p> The Chairman made reference to forestry.  Whether it is from an environment brief or for the diversification of farm income, forestry has a role to play.  Forestry however is not just for the west of Ireland.  Sometimes there is a perception that forestry is for the west.  It can play a role throughout the country and in perhaps policy can better support the role of agri-forestry whereby, rather than looking at planting the entire farm that rural development programmes and rural schemes generally would facilitate and encourage payments for planting a number of acres of a holding.  This is the agri-forestry concept where forestry can live better in harmony with mainstream agriculture.</p><p> With regard to the area of micro-energy - as raised by some speakers - there are two principal issues around that.  The first issue is the lack of policy certainty right now.  Solar energy was mentioned and at this point in time there are 20,000 acres of land under some form of a solar contract in Ireland.  We have not one solar farm yet but a number have gone through planning and have received planning.  There is in excess of 20,000 acres of farmland that is under some form of the solar contract.  This is in anticipation of a tariff coming from Government that was due at least 12 months ago.  This lack of clarity on the issue from the Government has an unintended consequence of leading to a high level of speculative activity by developers.  The second issue relates to renewable energy.  Deputy Cannon referred to the rooftop solar panels he saw when he was on his cycling trip across Europe.  In many European states the concept of smart metering is standard but is not even introduced in Ireland.  Smart metering is where a person has a solar panel or micro turbine on the farm and they can discount the energy produced by the turbine or solar panel from their overall energy use and reduce the cost of their electricity.  The enabling of smart metering would be a driving force towards the uptake of renewables.</p><p> I will now turn to the matter of the tariff that may be announced by Government around renewable electricity, specifically solar.  We are lobbying for favourable discrimination towards community participation.  Where development companies offer a proportion of the project for community ownership they would get a tariff premium of an increase in cents per kilowatt hour for facilitating community participation and community ownership.  It is seeking to move the narrative on so that these renewable projects can live more hand-in-hand with the local communities within which they are often imposed.  My colleague, Thomas Cooney has addressed the issue of greenways.  I would say to the committee that there is a vacuum in this respect because there is a lack of a national framework in the development of greenways in the State.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae knows well the scenario in south Kerry and we have members from Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim, to name a few counties.  That is before we even talk about the 180 km from Dublin going across to Galway.  The development of greenways, one of which is in Meath, was referred to as haphazard.  Some are led by the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, some are led by local authorities, some are led by partnership companies and, quite frankly, there is not that certainty in place.  We do not know if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross intends to hold consultation but we are seeking dialogue on it.  Greenways have a role to play but there must be a framework which recognises that one cannot just carve up a farmer's farmholding for the purpose of putting a cycle track through the middle of it.  There is a balance to be struck. </p></speech>

No bird is so stupid as to make a nest outside the ditch anywhere along the side of the road.  I totally agree about the greenway routes.  I am very disappointed with the route taken by our local authority in the way it has gone about it - there should have been agreement with all the landowners.  That could have been achieved.  Agreement with the landowners is the way to go and agreement can be reached.</p> <p>  There is no grant for forestry for marginal land.  A person has to have 80% of green ground before they will get a grant to plant.  In any land holding in Kerry it is the other way around - 20% of green ground versus 80% of marginal ground - so there is no planting going on there now because it is not attractive for farmers to do so.  That needs to be addressed.  It was changed a number of years ago and there has been no planting since on marginal ground.  I have been asked a lot about when farmers got the grants for planting forestry and they were told it was going to be tax-free.  Now the USC charges are being applied to it.  That issue also needs to be addressed because if you make a deal with a man you must stand to your word and that is not what has happened in this case.  The Government has broken its word.</p></speech>

She said: "No Joe - it is the fear of the known".  They know they are going to get flooded this year.  There was disappointment and frustration.  I fully acknowledge the work, the ambition and the desire of the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney and Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran to do something about it, but unfortunately there are so many different sections and so many interested groups - about 17 entirely - that it might be hyperbole to think that we will ever get to a situation where there would be one agency with responsibility for it.  We need to reduce the numbers of agencies involved and we definitely need to reduce the power that some of those have to stop very real work that could save people's houses and people's livelihood from flooding.</p></speech>
