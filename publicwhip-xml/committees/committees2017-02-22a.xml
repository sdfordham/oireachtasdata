    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#B00200"><p>I call the meeting to order.  Apologies have been received from Senators Freeman and Clifford-Lee.</p><p>I welcome everyone to the meeting, which will take place over two sessions.  In the first, we will hear from the ISPCC on the issue of cybersecurity for children and young adults.  In the second, we will hear from Mr. Fred McBride, CEO of Tusla, and some of his colleagues.  We will then move back into private session to deal with housekeeping matters.  The plan is to break at 10.30 a.m. and get out for 12 noon.</p><p>I apologise to our witnesses for the delay in starting the meeting.  From the ISPCC, I welcome Ms Grainia Long, CEO, Ms Caroline O'Sullivan, director of services, and Ms Cliona O'Neill, director of policy and communications, and thank them for appearing before the committee and giving of their time.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matters of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as mobile phones interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  I wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>I understand that the witnesses will make a short presentation, to be followed by questions from members.  I invite Ms Long to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grainia Long" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for its interest in this issue, which it can imagine is a priority for the ISPCC, and in hearing our perspective on cybersafety and online safety for children and young people.</p> <p>  We have been working on this issue for many years and members will not be surprised to find that children have informed how we frame the problem and the solutions.  Years before the issue of cybersecurity was called that, it had been described to us by children through Childline.  It has emerged and evolved over time.  Without question, it is the child protection issue of our time.  This is a dramatic statement to make, but we do not make it without the evidence to support it.</p> <p>  We separate the issue of technology from access to the Internet and social media.  Access to technology is important for children and young people.  It is an educational and networking tool and can help to keep them safe.  For example, Childline is a form of technology that helps to keep children safe.  Our view is not that technology is a bad thing, but we need to distinguish between technology and access to technology from access to the Internet and social media.  Regulated and well-managed access to the Internet and social media can also be a useful tool so long as we understand the nature and impact of same and ensure that it is applied in an age appropriate way.</p> <p>  A number of issues have emerged and will probably be discussed often during this meeting.  For example, as technology has developed and become more complicated, so have the issues coming to us from children.  This is not a simple matter and the problems are not easy to describe, as is often the case with children.  My colleague, Ms O'Sullivan, who is the expert in our services area, will take the committee through the case studies and some work that we have been doing to understand the issues for children and young people.  The solutions are complex.</p> <p>  Sometimes, I worry that cybersafety and online safety are seen as being so much of an all-encompassing issue that we are in danger of putting it into the "Too Difficult" box.  It is not too difficult.  If we and policy makers begin thinking of it as too difficult, we will fail our children and young people.  We must find solutions and ways in which to keep children safe.  It is possible.</p> <p>  We will talk the committee through some of the work that we have done, including an important case review and an internal analysis of our case studies, so that it can understand the emerging themes and trends.  We have made some recommendations on legal and policy changes and education.</p> <p>  A distinction needs to be made between technology and use of the Internet and social media, but we also need to make a distinction between what is or should be illegal behaviour online and what is harmful behaviour.  Illegal behaviour is simpler to understand and define.  For example, the Law Reform Commission has stated that online stalking needs to be prescribed as an offence in law.  That would make it easier to detect and prosecute.  We agree with that recommendation.  Online harassment also needs to be a prosecutable offence.</p> <p>  Cyberbullying is a form of harmful behaviour.  Severe and malicious bullying that becomes harassment then becomes a form of illegal behaviour, but we need to understand the two separately.  If we do not, we are at risk of criminalising children and young people who often undertake actions online without understanding the consequences.  This is one of the issues that will arise at this meeting.</p> <p>  The ISPCC is the national child protection charity.  We are probably best known for our Childline service, which is the national listening service.  We receive more than 400,000 contacts from children and young people annually, or approximately 1,200 per day.  In recent years, children have increasingly chosen online forms of communication to contact us.  At a particular age, children are increasingly comfortable disclosing some personal and sensitive issues online through our web chat service.  The fact that we have this technology available to us enables us to support and help children.  Our one-to-one child and family services, therapeutic services and many other services work with children who have been victims of crime or harmful behaviour towards them online.  Often, we work with these children, who have been traumatised in some shape or form and need help, for many months.</p> <p>  We undertook a piece of work last year in which we examined our caseload over a period to understand the emerging issues and the experiences of children and young people online.  This is outlined in section 3 of the report.  I will hand over to Ms O'Sullivan to talk the committee through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#B00400"><p>I will provide a small bit of background.  The ISPCC has been around for a long time.  In the past ten to 15 years, we have noticed an increasing issue in case discussions when supervising our staff.</p><p>There always seem to have been some level of online risk or cybersafety issues occurring.  Children within our children's advisory committees would have been coming to us stating that there were a lot of issues for young people at present because they are getting involved in Snapchat and chat groups and they had serious concerns about the ability of young people to cope with what they were seeing in these social media sites.  It was all anecdotal in many ways but we had a gut feeling that there was something serious happening here that we needed to look at.  Childline was receiving thousands of contacts from children distressed because they had done or said something online or had taken photographs or whatever, and did not know what to do with this information.</p><p> Rather than merely going along with piecemeal information, a team of managers, staff, volunteers and members of the children's advisory committee decided to conduct a complete review of our case work over the 18 months up to June 2016.  The results from that are clear.  In over one third of the cases we worked with over that period, including calls to Childline, online contacts to Childline, the text services in Childline and our face-to-face therapeutic professional services that are delivered all over the country, there was some form of online risk to the children involved.   This is neither an urban issue nor a rural issue.  It is an issue for every child in every part of the country.</p><p> There were a number of themes that came out strongly within this case review.  The first one, not surprisingly, is cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying is as commonplace as bullying has ever been, but the way that it is being done has changed.  As I said, one third of our cases involved cyberbullying to some extent.  That would not have been the reason the child was referred to our service in the first place.  The child could have been referred for anxiety issues - not sleeping at night, not being able to cope with issues, difficulties in maintaining friendships and in some cases children who were self-harming or who had suicidal ideation.  These might have been the reasons we were getting the referrals but when one dug deep into those cases and looked at the rationale of why the children were experiencing this, online safety, cybersafety and the risks around being involved in the cyberworld form part of a third of the cases.  When one considers the number of children we are talking about here, that is significant.</p><p> Excessive time spent online was the second.  As I said, we looked at our cases.  We also looked at our support line, which is for parents.  The amount of time that children are spending online is hugely concerning, with young people spending up to five hours a day online.  When one considers a child's day, he or she gets up in the morning and goes to school, and some children will have after-school, and by the time they get home, it could be 6 p.m.  Yet they are spending five hours on average online.  What else are these children doing?  Where is their social interaction with the family?  Where is their ability to switch off?  It is a constant barrage of messages about how they look, how they should look, what they should be saying, who they should be going out with, what they should be doing and whether they are frigid or sluts - because it is one or the other.  Children are finding it difficult to establish their own sense of identity and what is good for them and to make decisions and choices that are best for them.</p><p> Parents are very concerned as well that children are up in their rooms.  They think their children are safe.  They have their phone, iPad or whatever technology, and they think they are safe.  In one of the cases within the document here, one parent came across a situation where she recognised that her child was being groomed by a paedophile ring and found that out through checking out and looking at the history and looking at whatever else.  Imagine the fright any parent would get when he or she sees or comes across something in regard to that and the impact that it has on the child.</p><p> Parents have talked to us about the level of time spent online.  Anybody here who is a parent of teenagers will know they will want to take their phone into the bedroom at night.  I have teenagers and they do not do have their phones in their bedrooms at night.  If one left that phone on, it is constant notifications throughout the night - at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.  Children are not getting sleep.  If children are not getting sleep, they will not be able to cope with what comes at them the next day.  We all know that sleep is a huge factor in terms of mental health.  One has to get enough sleep in order to be able to cope with whatever one's challenges.  Children are being woken up consistently during the night.  Parents are telling us that they wake up to the sound in their homes and their children are having full-scale voice conversations on some app at 3 a.m. and have been on for an hour.</p><p> There is this constant pressure on young people to be on all the time.  There is no time for just sitting on the couch and chatting anymore.  It is to be constantly on the social apps, constantly engaging and constantly trying to put across this image that they are better than they perceive themselves to be.  The big issue about this aspect is the fact that they do not think they are good enough, they do not think they are as good as everybody else and the constant streaming of information is adding to that level of anxiety.  These are children as young as nine, ten and 11.  One can imagine that level of pressure on a nine year old.</p><p> Children are getting technology a lot younger.  Even seven or eight years ago, it was children who had just done their confirmation, and they would use their confirmation money to buy phones.  Now it is communion money.  These are smart phones where children have access 24 hours a day to whatever content is available.  This was another big theme that showed up, the whole area of inappropriate content being accessed by young people.  Children are coming across this accidentally, they are seeing it by older friends in the same housing estate and then they themselves are seeking out that information.</p><p> Parents have told us that they apply parental controls.  That is great as it protects a child within the home.  However, it does not protect the child when he or she is accessing Wi-Fi out on the street, in another house, in a shopping centre or wherever else.  Those kind of controls in many ways give a false sense of security to parents because they think their children are safe and they do not have to be concerned.</p><p> Parents are completely unaware of how to keep their children safe.  There is a complete lack of knowledge and information, from their viewpoint.  They have this attitude in many ways that their children know it better than they do and there is absolutely no point in them becoming involved in this aspect.  There is a huge need for education around that for parents and children alike.</p><p> Sexting is a huge issue.  The biggest development that we have noticed in Childline and in all of our services is that this has become the norm rather than the exception.  The expectation is that if one is in any kind of relationship or one wants to have a relationship then one needs to take photographs of oneself and send them on to the partner, if one does not then there is something wrong with you, whereas if one does one can be so-called "slut shamed".  It is either end again - there is no pleasing anybody in terms of the actions that young people are taking.  Children are feeling pressurised to share self-generated images.  When we talk to children about this, they say, "This is safe sex".  Their attitudes have changed completely.  They describe this as a safe way of exploring their sexuality and safer than having sex.</p><p> It moves on then, from taking pictures to one of the other themes that we would have come across, that is, the area of sextortion or blackmailing of children.  One of our cases deals with a child of nine years of age who would have sent nude pictures of herself to the boys in her class.  It is not normal developmental behaviour for any nine year old child to do so but for her, on this particular occasion, that was what she thought would have been expected, and she would have been quite surprised at the reaction to it.  Children will take a picture.  They will send that to somebody they feel they can trust because they feel they have to do it.  Then they will be put under pressure to provide more content, be that more photographs, more explicit photographs or more videos.  Children in their teens are getting involved in this activity and the aftermath of that is horrific.  These photographs are being shared and put on Snapchat groups.  Children are being invited on to these groups so that they can be bullied while they are online in regard to it.  Other children are being excluded from all chat forums because they do not want them involved anymore.  It is extremely difficult for children to be able to cope with what is going on around them.  They have absolutely no control over it.  They feel they have no control.  They have no knowledge or capability to deal with the aftermath of what has occurred.  For them, initially, it was just sending a photograph, thinking, "What is the harm?"  It is because they are children.</p><p> Online grooming is another area we are very concerned about.  Grooming in the past was very much around face-to-face grooming.  A person who wanted to cause harm would get involved and get acquainted with the child's family and the parents were being groomed in the same way as the child.  The person built up that trusting relationship.  Adding on the cyberworld to that, it makes it a lot easier for predators to seek out children and groom a lot quicker.  We held a cyber-conference recently at which the Garda presented where it said it can be as quick as three-to-four interactions with a child when the grooming takes place.  In many ways, we have to be scared of that.</p><p> We have to be scared that children are at risk here.  Children do not have the cognitive development or the critical thinking at younger ages to be able to work through this.  That is why we need policies to change.  We need legislation to change so that we can protect children and on the other hand, have a whole education piece for children, parents, schools, community groups and every professional who is working with children.</p><p>As regards online grooming cases, I already mentioned the child who had been groomed by a paedophile ring, but luckily the parent found out about that and was able to report it, act on it and the child was saved from it.  </p><p> As regards sextortion, we came across a case where two teenage girls met somebody online.  They did not know this "boy", as they thought, online and they sent some photographs of themselves in their underwear over the net.  Afterwards they were put under pressure because this material was going to be shared in public with their school friends and all the rest of it.  There was obvious distress involved in this.  When we were teenagers ourselves it was all about fitting in, being with one's peers, and having friends.  Teenagers get to a point where their parents become irrelevant and their whole focus is about what their peers think.  Much as we parents do not like to think we become irrelevant, we do.  What their peers say about them is hugely important.  Therefore, if a teenager has taken a picture and their peers turn against them, they will be facing difficulties immediately. </p><p> The other key area we came across was identity and well-being, which follows on from the point I was just making.  We validate ourselves as teenagers through our contact with our immediate family, relations and extended family.  They need good adults within their lives.  Cyber identity is forming a huge part in terms of children's development of their own identity, their view of self and the value they place on that.  Basically, therefore, we have added a whole new dimension to children's development.  We have to accept that children are living in an online world that is not always negative, as my colleague, Ms Long, has already pointed out.  We must be sure, however, that when children are online they are safe.  </p><p> As regards children's self esteem and self worth, in my 20 years with the ISPCC I have never seen as many cases where children's view of themselves is at rock bottom.  It is as if children cannot see one good characteristic about themselves because there are about 40 different messages that argue against them.  That is scary.  One will only be resilient enough to cope with difficulties if one believes that one is special, unique, worthwhile and has some people in life who will be there for support no matter what.  A person will not have any coping ability, however, if they do not believe they are worth something and have somebody they can trust to talk to.</p><p> That is why 24-hour services are so important.  In this country, the only 24-service for children is Childline, which is fantastic.  We are delighted to be able to provide it, but that is not good enough.  What if there is an immediate risk to a child who is in a situation where they need an immediate rescue?  At the moment such a case goes to the Garda.  The Garda has been amazing and we have a positive working relationship with it, yet Tusla has to have a responsibility in this area.  </p><p> Earlier I mentioned the lack of knowledge and skills, which applies to children as well as parents and professionals who work in this area.  The first step for all of us is to recognise that this is happening and that it is not a small percentage of children.  We all like to think that our own children are not involved in anything, that they are perfect and wonderful, but the reality is that every parent needs to open the lines of communication because every child is involved in social media in some shape, form or capacity, either with or without their parents' knowledge.  In the view of the ISPCC this is the child protection issue of our time.  Unless we act now we will have to deal with massive unsurmountable issues in future, whereas they could be surmounted now.</p></speech>

Our overarching recommendation to the committee is that we need a national cybersafety strategy for children.  Many members of this committee were able to attend our conference before Christmas where this strategy was outlined by experts, including academics, garda&iacute; and young people.  That was the clear outcome from all the consultation work we have been doing.  There is work to be done here by various Departments and it needs to be brought together in a coherent fashion by actions and measurements.</p> <p>  Ireland has a cybersafety strategy which is registered with the relevant European Commission agency, but it does not mention children because it is about fraud and keeping business online.  Therefore this aspect of it has not been considered across Departments, although it is urgent to do so.  That is our key message.</p></speech>

This is solvable but there is a policy choice to be made about how we solve it.  It is not too difficult or complex to fix.</p></speech>

I attended the ISPCC conference and it was most enlightening.  One could nearly make a road-show of it.  I was there not only in my role as my party's children's rights spokesperson but also as a parent, and I found it very informative as the guest speakers were outstanding.</p> <p>  The ISPCC representatives are right in saying that teachers and garda&iacute; have a major role to play in this matter.  Being a mother of three, I suppose I am up to speed on everything that has been said.  I am approaching this from the parents' angle in seeking to find how we can overcome these challenges.</p> <p>  Just after Christmas, the PSNI published 100 abbreviations they were experiencing in Northern Ireland.  Has the ISPCC had any engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do something similar?  I have telephoned the Garda but has the ISPCC also made a request in this regard?  While the PSNI is doing this in the North, parents in the South would like to see what are the top 100 three-letter analogues it is using.</p> <p>  What is the ISPCC's view on the use of mobile phones in schools?  Do the witnesses believe in time-out during the school day?  One Minister has said that he understands the need for such phones in the classroom so that students can check things, but I thought that was the role of the white board.  However, I would like to hear the ISPCC's view on the role of mobile phones in school.</p> <p>  On the question of the providers, such as Vodaphone, Eir, Samsung or iPhone, last summer I wanted to put a time-limit on the phone so that a child could only use it for an hour.  I wanted to set that limit on the phone's hard-drive.  That could be done on older version of mobile phones, but not on the newer models.  Has the ISPCC been in contact with any phone providers about this?  I compliment the Vodaphone network because one can change a password remotely, but parents are unaware that they can do so.  I can do it when I am up here or at home when my children have access to the phone from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.  That facility should be common knowledge, however, and be easily accessible to all.  Parents need help and support with such matters.</p> <p>  Ms O'Sullivan was right to say that pressure is coming from peers, while the parent is seen as an oddball who has not got a clue.  In fact, however, parents need to hold on to that control.  If they have the controls to do so, we will be moving in the right direction but phone providers need to help parents also.</p></speech>

I keep on top of this topic and raise it in the Seanad a lot.  I wonder if initiatives run by CyberSafeIreland could be State funded, or if some level of cybersafety education in schools would be a better approach.  Which of those two options would the ISPCC favour?</p> <p>  What can be done to encourage parents to supervise their children?  It sounds like a basic question but do we need to have such supervision?  There is a lot of awareness now and it is covered in the media more, but are parents really engaging with it?  They are busy themselves and children are ahead of adults generally on this topic.  How do we alert parents to the gravity of the situation?  Do we need to link in some sort of national information campaign?</p> <p>  I have done some work on how advertising targets children concerning obesity and alcohol consumption.</p><p>It seems that many companies use social media and the available software to target children.  Should we impose a restriction to prevent that practice in our legislation?  Should we insist that the software is used instead to avoid targeting children?  Can we make companies do so? </p><p> Tusla has been in the eye of the storm for the past while.  Is Tusla capable of managing this matter?  Do we need a one-stop-shop on cybersafety to protect children?  We do not need more agencies.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on this matter, without being too hard on Tusla.</p></speech>

The ISPCC has recommended the establishment of the office of a digital safety commissioner and a policy and regulatory framework in its documentation.  The three witnesses have painted a worrying picture but they said there are solutions.  What should we do?  One measure is to educate children and  parents.  We need to provide solidarity for parents because children will say, "Mary is allowed to do this.  Why don't you let me?  Mary takes her phone to bed.  Why can't I?"  We must convey the message that it is right for parents to advise their child that he or she needs a night's sleep and not to take a phone to his or her bedroom.  The hard aspect is discerning what is illegal, what is damaging but is not illegal and identifying them.  We need to reach that point.  We have begun to identify elements.  I attended a conference on the subject.  The ISPCC has highlighted the issue, which is important.  The next step is to decide what to do and deal with the problem.  The ISPCC has suggested a digital safety commissioner.  Perhaps that is the way to go.  A dedicated office would provide a place for children, parents and everybody else to go and a commissioner would ensure something is done.</p> <p>  Technology keeps evolving.  How does one control cybersecurity?  How does one legally deal with the issues?  It was noted in the presentation that apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp, etc., can be manipulated.  I mean one child can change something that another child has typed in earlier in the chat.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations.  They painted a scary picture.</p> <p>  The delegation mentioned a strategy and it was touched on by Senator Noone.  Who does the ISPCC believe should roll out the strategy?  Is it Tusla?  There is a question mark over whether people would have the confidence in Tusla to do such work.  Does the ISPCC want a digital safety commissioner to roll out the strategy?  There is no point having a strategy if there is no-one to implement it and roll it out.</p> <p>  What is the view of the ISPCC on parental responsibility?  Parents needs support.  Sometimes parents forgot their responsibilities in this modern age.  I do not see how anyone would think it acceptable for a communion age child to have a smartphone.  In reality many children of that age will have one but it is ridiculous.  Does the ISPCC favour a stronger legal remedy if one's child is found to have bullied a child online or using WhatsApp or whatever?  Would the ISPCC recommend imposing a penalty for such behaviour?  Parents would sit up and listen fairly fast if there was the risk of a penalty.  Education is needed but parents need to tell their child that he or she will not get a phone or use one for a certain period.  Parents tend to give into their children's demands too easily nowadays.</p></speech>

There are three key parts to our view of what a strategy would look like, which will probably cover all of the questions.</p> <p>  I cannot stress enough the importance of formal and informal education in solving this problem.  All of the members have mentioned in their comments that education is required for children, young people and parents.  I will start with children and young people.  To be blunt, our education curriculum does not prepare people for the outside world.  We are frankly naive as a society if we think that what we teach children about sex and sexual behaviour is enough to equip them.  The sooner we recognise that and it is reflected in our curriculum the better for children and child safety.  The national strategy needs to be owned by Government and rolled out by four key Departments.  The Department of Education and Skills would play a key role.  </p> <p>  In terms of educating children, the curriculum needs to reflect reality.  The technology aspect is best suited for a debate on a separate day.  There are whole groups of people who will argue the case for more children and particularly girls to study technology.  We also need, as part of our curriculum, to recognise the importance of educating young people about sex, sexual behaviour, and online behaviour.  The curriculum needs to do this work formally.  Other countries do this work as a matter of course.  This aspect does not form a sufficient part of our curriculum and we need to fix the situation.</p> <p>  As Ms O'Sullivan has said, a lot more can be done to build resilience.  There are national programmes available that will help to supplement and build resilience in children and young people.  I do not have a strong view one way or the other whether it is formal education in schools or programmes like CyberSafeIreland are used.  I would prefer the matter formalised within the education system.  Every time we move it out to other organisations it becomes disparate, whether the schools can afford same and whether the school considers it to be a priority.  It is left to either the principal or the board of governors to make it a priority.  We need to make cybersafety a national priority and consistently available to children.  My feeling is the more formal this is the better.</p> <p>  We have seen good examples of third level educators making training available on consent, for example, and notions of consent for third level students.  It means first year girls and boys or young men and women attend consent classes, which is excellent, but it is 12 years too late.  If we do not start talking to boys and girls about consent in an age appropriate way, one does not train and teach young people in the same way one does 18 or 19 year olds.  We need to talk about these issues earlier in schools.  We must help and enable parents to talk about these issues.  We undertook a piece of internal research last year on the perceptions of Childline among children, young people and their parents.  I was amazed to find that parents will say they are delighted when their children call Childline because sometimes they feel embarrassed to talk to their children about sex.  If that view pervades culturally within Ireland then we have a long way to go.  We need a formalised system of education that is not at the discretion of boards of governors, principals or patrons.  We need a formal system of sex education and education on how to use technology safety.  Only then can we say we have equipped our children and young children.  </p> <p>  I accept that cybersafety is extremely difficult for parents.  Parents have often said to us through our support line that they feel ill equipped because they do not feel they are tech savvy.  Our experience is that cybersafety is down to parenting and the standard of communication one has with one's child.  We see our children and young can fluently use tablets and technology.  People confuse that ability to be tech savvy with the ability to make the right decision online.  The decisions that young people make online have nothing to do with their technological ability or that of their parents.  Let us take two 14-year olds who are online and they are faced with a decision about whether to send a photo of themselves to somebody who they think they know.  More than likely one girl will say "Yes" while the other girl will say "No".  The more we understand their environment, psychological make-up and how they have been parented the better.</p><p>It is down to issues like that and which nothing to do with technology that affects how the young person makes that decision.</p><p> Education for parents needs to start and end with the level of communication and resilience they have built in their children over time.  We have ideas about how to do that, including support for teachers.  I imagine that too often people come before the committee and say our teachers need to be trained to do that.  We do not say that on top of everything else teachers have to be responsible for the safety of children and young people online but this needs to be formalised within the curriculum and resourced properly.</p><p> I was asked about the law and the office of the digital safety commissioner, ODSC.  We spent a great deal of time examining the LRC report and I urge members to read it.  It is an exceptional piece work, which gives a substantial overview of digital safety law, where the gaps are and how they can be filled.  We strongly agree with the creation of new offences that reflect our online world.  Harassment online is a different from offline harassment.  It works differently and it is more pervasive.  As Ms O'Sullivan said earlier, it is extremely difficult to get away from.  In this job, I am rarely shocked but I have been shocked over the past year by the emergence of stalking by young people of other young people.  We need to be grown up and recognise that and not assume that only adults stalk others.  There are ways to recognise this behaviour and it should be made an offence.</p><p> However, the LRC has said that in creating new offences, children should be criminalised in that way.  The offences should be created to detect and prosecute adults but we should behave responsibly in taking prosecutions against a child.  That would only be done in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the DPP.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, we are learning all the time that children and young people feel ill-equipped to make the right decisions online.  They often do not understand the consequences of their decisions and it is worrying that we detect a sense of remoteness in children when they have been online for a long period as they lose a sense of empathy.  Sometimes when we work with them, it is clear they do not understand the impact of their actions.  It is very sad and worrying and Ms O'Sullivan will refer to this again.</p><p> The real change can happen is the ODSC.  I am not necessarily a fan of the creation of new offices for the sake of it but this will be different because the office should have a co-ordination role.  The LRC suggested the office should have three functions.  First, it should co-ordinate all the education work that is in place.  There has been a proliferation of organisations doing work in this area, including ours.  That is great but a co-ordinating organisation is needed.  We also need to make sure there are standards for educating parents and young people in this area.  Many good organisations are doing this work but we are less convinced some of them should be going into classrooms educating young people.  Second, the office should set standards for industry.  We need to be clear that industry needs to play a role.  Companies need to step up to the plate to make technology available to children and young people.  The office should put a set of guiding principles in place that industry would have to follow.  It could then take action.  Individuals could contact the commissioner if they wanted information deleted online.  The right to have information removed would be placed with the office.  If the industry body, ISP, telecommunications provider and so on did not follow the request, action could be taken.  It would be a useful office.  Third, the office should have an important role in investigating individual cases,  That would formalise much of the law in this area and regulate a regulatory policy.</p><p> I was asked whether Tusla is the right organisation for that.  Several organisations need to be involved.  Tusla has an important education function and, therefore, it needs to play a role in this regard but the right organisation needs to be the ODSC because technical experts are needed as well as people who understand the regulation of industries well and who can investigate online safety cases.  My preference is that this office does this but we have always felt that Tusla also needs to have a role because it has an education function.  That body needs to contribute.  Many of the referrals we receive in these cases come to us through Tusla and, therefore, it must be part of the debate.</p><p> On the apps question, we spend a great deal of time looking at Facebook, Google and Twitter.  Those companies get the scale of the risk to children and young children and they are putting serious resources into this area.  Alongside them, there is a long trail of much smaller companies that set out to make money and commercially exploit children and young people.  Not all apps do that but app providers and developers need to be regulated.  We need to focus on that as much as we focus on the large companies.  A great deal of emphasis is placed on these large companies.  We were particularly worried by an app called Yellow late last year, which in our view was a dating app targeted at children and young people.  It was difficult to find out how well regulated it was and what were the terms and conditions before it went live.  Our understanding was it was focused on teenagers and even though the company may well have a different view, the look, feel and language used to market the app were aimed at children and young people.  As a result, when we set up an account to examine this, it was obvious to us the terms and conditions were not available in an accessible way to children and young people.  If they tried to join the app, it was easy to do so.  It should not have been that readily available to children and young people.</p></speech>

Any company providing a service should be able to do that.  Essentially, it is down to the technology being used.  Apps can be integrated with other apps and, therefore, data can be pushed from one app to another.  If a company enables that to happen, then it needs to take responsibility for what happens once data is shared across apps and platforms.  This area needs much more attention.  Ironically, as Ms O'Sullivan said, the national cybersafety strategy considers the digital economy and enabling businesses to prevent fraud, which is incredibly important, but so are our children and, therefore, there needs to be a national understanding that we need to go much further.</p></speech>

During the latter stages of its passage, a change was made to enable all EU member states to set age barriers at their discretion.  Some states wanted the minimum age set at 13 whereas others wanted it at 14, 15 or 16.  We have found it difficult to answer at what age a barrier should be created.  The ISPCC throughout its history has shied away from setting age barriers because one 13 year old is very different from another 13 year old or from a 16 year old.  We need to be less focused in this regard on arbitrary age barriers and more focused on giving the ODSC the ability and power to set guidelines.</p><p>The answer to this will be how the app developer operates and markets to the target audience, rather than making a decision that the app is appropriate for those aged 13 years and upwards because the latter would be difficult to enforce.</p></speech>

I agree with her.  One of the interesting aspects of the report is that it effectively states that the law alone cannot fix this issue and that education will be key.  The Law Reform Commission does not often make such an admission, which makes this a remarkable piece of work in terms of adopting education measures.  We need to listen to its views on this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that many of the legislative recommendations will be implemented, which is great, but her Department is not responsible for implementing the educational aspects of the report.</p> <p>  A question was asked on the proposal to establish an office of digital safety commissioner.  The Law Reform Commission examined the role of the office of Internet safety and one of the issues it identified was with the office's location in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The ISPCC has a role in this area through the advisory committee and we understand it is planned to move the office of Internet safety to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In our view, the proposed office of digital safety commissioner would be better placed in either the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  A question was also asked on the Garda.  The ISPCC regularly interacts with the Garda and we hope to do more work with the force later this year.</p> <p>  On support for parents, as many members will be aware from our conference, the ISPCC has a partnership with Vodafone based on a shared vision of keeping children safe by keeping them connected.  As part of this, we have developed some guidelines and support for parents and we will roll out more later in the year through a magazine that will be available nationwide.  We hope this will contribute to support for parents but many other organisations are doing good work in this area.  Resources were launched for parents as part of Internet safety day last week.  The issue is one of disseminating these resources and ensuring parents are aware of them.</p></speech>

I often reflect that, even five or six years ago, I would have considered myself lucky to have got through the gap.  I consider myself even luckier now in the that sense.  I say this only half-jokingly because change has become even more rapid since my younger brothers were teenagers.  We now have another generation for whom everything is changing every one or two years.  It is very difficult for parents, in particular, to try to keep up with this change, which, while impressive, can also be overwhelming.</p> <p>  Bullying has always been an issue in schools but I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for children who are unable to escape the problem because it follows them home.  That they cannot shelter or get away from bullying must be extremely difficult to deal with for the children involved and their parents.  </p> <p>  I strongly support the idea of establishing a digital safety commission.  This issue has been raised a number of times.  Children must be able to make a significant contribution to any such office because they are the experts in many ways.  Something along the lines of a children's advisory committee should be established as part of the new office.</p> <p>  I was not aware of the existence of an office of Internet safety.  I ask the witnesses to explain briefly what a digital safety commissioner would do that the office of Internet safety does not already do and what gaps would be filled by the new commissioner. </p> <p>  The witnesses touched on the issue of digital stalking.  While I acknowledge that this is not only a matter for legislation, what are the other major legislative gaps in this area?</p> <p>  I am conscious of the witnesses' concern not to criminalise children.  Nonetheless, the Garda will have a role in this area.  How well equipped is the Garda in terms of know-how, staff and resources to deal with these issues?  Must this area be addressed?</p> <p>  What proportion of the calls made to the Childline service relate to complaints or allegations made against other children or actions taken by other children?  Is this issue significantly gendered, in other words, is there a significant disparity between the number of complaints made by girls and boys?</p> <p>  I expect there would be some degree of industry push-back against these proposals.  While certain elements of the industry are progressive and sensible, does the ISPCC anticipate such a reaction or has it already experienced it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#G01000"><p>The witnesses spoke of children and teenagers not feeling good enough, the pressures they face, including the barrage of images and the use of various filters and so forth.  This very much mirrors what happens in the adult world where this problem is also prevalent.  Much of the behaviour described could be learned from adults.  There is a bigger and wider debate involved in this issue to the extent that if something is happening in the adult world, it will definitely happen in the world of children.  I fully agree that education will be key but it must be provided across the board, for adults and children.  If this is happening in the adult world, we must target it because it influences children.</p> <p>  Have studies been done on learned behaviour, namely, the way in which adult behaviour affects children?  Cyberbullying is widespread among adults.  For example, people can say anything they like on Twitter.  How many tweets have been sent about certain people?  This behaviour has come to be socially acceptable and no one bats an eyelid about it.  Have studies been done on the damaging effects of such behaviour?</p> <p>  Smartphone use exploded in 2010-11, which means someone who was 14 or 15 years old at the time will be 19 or 20 years old now.  If action is to be taken in this area, people of that age should be involved in any groups or think tanks that are established or any research that is done because young adults will be able to reflect on their experience and offer us something that people of my age could not offer because we did not grow up with this technology, even if we use it.</p> <p>  We have fallen far behind the 8 ball, as it were, because digital technology has moved with such speed since 2007-08 when we went mobile.  A front-loaded approach is needed, which means hitting this issue hard to ensure the action we take becomes part of culture, the done thing and the norm so that in five or ten years, it will be understood and no longer described as education.  This may be a project that we will have to hit in the next five or six years in order that everyone gets up to speed with it.  Once we have the basics of digital technology, we have the tools to find everything else we need to solve our problems.  This will also be key.  I ask the witnesses to respond to my question on whether studies have been done to identify a correlation between adult behaviour and children's behaviour.</p></speech>

I agree that we should seriously consider establishing an office for digital safety.  The rate of automation will increase in the decades ahead.  As everything goes digital, we will need someone to be in a position to offer advice and guidance and develop regulation and policy for this area.</p> <p>  Given Tusla's current difficulties with governance, I could not support it being given the lead role in this matter, although I accept that it needs to be involved.</p><p>It is the leading child agency in the country.</p><p> We must be firm in telling parents to use their heads and stop giving in to the relentless nagging of their children.  We have all done it.  We have all said, "Wait a minute" or "Just take it now" in response to the constant demand.  Our children are programmed to do that but this is the biggest risk to children of our time and we need to tell parents what to do in that regard and give them the guidelines.  In that way parents will have the back-up of the State.  That may sound as if I am advocating for a nanny state but they will have the back-up of the State in terms of policy and with regard to cultural norms.  That is the way we can move forward.  It should be appropriate for a parent to say to their child that they cannot have something or that they are restricting the use of something.  They should be able to tell a seven year old child that there is no way they are getting a phone.  We cannot be fascist and say a child cannot ever do something but we are protecting children and we should tell parents to be parents and do what they are meant to be doing.  That is my firm view.</p><p> Have the witnesses any notion of the success of Facebook Free Friday and other such campaigns, which challenge children to become involved?  They get excited about those campaigns.  It is not an issue that is imposed upon them but rather something interesting to them that is trending on Twitter or wherever.  They can then choose to get involved in Facebook Free Friday or whatever.  That is something we can generate excitement about and get a buy-in, so to speak, regarding that.</p><p> I am interested in the role of the Garda.  It is difficult for garda&iacute; as well but at present the Garda is the only organisation that seems to be capable of addressing this.  We know that as a result of environmental factors or whatever they face in the home environment or outside the home, a certain cohort of children access pornography at an earlier age.  We know how difficult it is for an organisation like the ISPCC when it makes a choice to report it.  What are its guidelines on that?  It is a difficult problem that will become more prevalent the more we allow children access to freeflow of information.</p><p> I thank the witnesses and I am pleased to hear the problem is not too complex to fix.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of information in the public domain, and some we do not even know about.</p></speech>

It is the Harmful Communications and Digital Safety Bill, which I hope will progress through the D&aacute;il.</p><p>I believe education is the key.  I studied the Finnish model and I am sure the Chairman, as a former member of the education committee, would undertake an examination of various international models.  Are there any international models the witnesses could envisage being implemented here?  Online bullying starts at a very young age in primary school and the difference between the Scandinavian model and what we have implemented in recent years is that the model was put on a statutory footing in Scandinavia.  Many of the initiatives we have implemented in this State have been on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  It is up to individual schools to implement their own policies.  I published legislation about two years ago to try to make that a statutory provision but, unfortunately, it was voted down.  Do the witnesses have any opinions on whether legislation to deal with bullying in schools, and international best practices, should be put on a statutory footing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#H00300"><p>It is a seismic change in society that the greatest threat to our children is the mobile phone.  God be with the days when we were all afraid of the bogeyman around the corner who we believed would do whatever to us but the biggest threat to children now is carried in our pockets.</p> <p>  In terms of this committee, an over-arching body of work is needed to get a whole-of-Government strategy and legislation to catch up with this area.  The difficulty is that the Internet is ever-changing and therefore the threats are ever-changing, with new ones emerging all the time.  It is difficult to keep up legislatively in terms of getting the curriculum changed and having all the bodies dealing with this area talking to each other.  I do not believe this Government will last the length of time needed to try to achieve the establishment of a commissioner's office and so on.</p> <p>  In terms of this committee trying to focus on one aspect and having listened to all the contributors, and in terms of our own bias, many of us are parents and we have a particular concern.  We understand the issues very well but there is fear in dealing with this issue.  The words "Instagram", "Snapchat" and others terrify parents.  We hear terms such as "All you have to do is fix the router" or references to the modem but all those terms create a blank wall for people of a certain generation, including my own.  In light of this what would be the view of the witnesses on a committee such as this one compiling a user guide for parents that would offer simple suggestions, such as children not having their phones with them in school.  Parents feel that if every other child in the school has their phone with them they should allow their child to have it.  Another suggestion would be to tell parents to take the phone out of the child's bedroom at night.  If we suggest that a child or teenager should not be on their phone after 9 p.m., I believe parents would react positively to that because they probably feel they are the only ones not allowing that.  I discovered by chance about six months ago that I could fix the modem at home and turn off the Internet for a number of hours every day.</p></speech>

I do not want to take from what they have said but it is about being more real in that sense.</p> <p>  Has the Ombudsman for Children played much of a role in this area?  What relevance has his office here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grainia Long" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#H00600"><p>If I could leave the committee with a thought it would be that while there is a real fear that technology and phones are a risk to children, I would think of it in a different way.  It is the people who have always tried to access children for exploitative or abusive reasons who are using technology as a tool.  That is the way they are doing it today.  When I spoke earlier I told the members to think differently and separate the illegal behaviour from the harmful behaviour.  Unfortunately, there are predators who will try to access children for exploitative or criminal means and they will use technology to do that.  It is our job to make it very difficult for them to do it.  That is where the law and a strong regulatory approach comes in.  It will be a complex task and it will take time, but we must do it because ten years from now we will wonder how we did not see that children would be more exposed.  The behaviour of predators is changing.  They are using technology as a faster way to access children.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, the Garda has given some frightening examples of conversations between children and young people who, within three to four minutes of the person saying "hello" to a child, sex was being mentioned; in some cases it was far sooner than that.</p> <p>  In terms of what can be done, the Garda has a very important role.  We have had some very good conversations with garda&iacute; about the potential of running a national campaign.  It is their view, and ours, that the garda&iacute; are recognised by children and young people as the law enforcement organisation and something we, or Childline, could do is go into schools to talk to children and young people so that they understand the dangers.  As Ms O'Sullivan said, many young people are too scared or ashamed to talk about this issue.</p> <p>  There are practical things parents can do, and we said this in January.</p><p>Parents buy phones and tablets before Christmas.  We tell them that Christmas is a busy time and that, when life has slowed down in January, they should return to their providers and ask them to help set controls on devices.  We should get that message out in as simple a way as possible.  One set of controls is handled through an Internet service provider, whereby access to the web at home is controlled, and another set of controls is on the handset itself.  We tell parents that they should take a breath in the new year, set those controls and educate themselves.  If they do not understand how to do that, they should ask their providers to do so.  Many of the providers with whom we have spoken have told us that they are more than happy to help set up controls for customers who bought devices from them.</p><p> As was alluded to, children and young people themselves have told us that they want to be safe.  Why would any child not want to be safe?  Parents should sit down with the young person.  Older siblings are helpful in this regard.  For example, 16, 17 or 18 year olds can set controls for children.</p><p> It is right to say that practical and immediate actions are necessary, but I would love to see a national campaign.  We need to start opening parents' consciousness without scaring them, because if people get scared, they stop making the right decisions.  We should tell them that they have more choices and ability than they realise.  They can ask their providers for help and speak to their older children or older children in the neighbourhood, young people and students who are attending university.  That might help to open up the situation.</p><p> We were asked what the office of a digital safety commissioner would do and what the legislative gaps would be.  As the LRC stated, that office should have a strong relationship with the Children's Ombudsman, who would have a role to play in this matter.  The digital safety commissioner's office would have an educational role.  It could run national campaigns regularly in the same way as the Road Safety Authority, which does a fantastic job at running safety campaigns at various points in the year.  It is running one this week because it is the mid-term break and children are off school, so people should drive carefully in highly developed residential areas.  The "Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner" is a very technical term, so it could be called something else and be made an open and educational office.  I like the idea of having children and young people involved.  They would have to be because that is the only way it can be done.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliodhna O'Neill" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#J00300"><p>The LRC goes into the matter in more detail.  A digital safety commissioner's office would have additional powers and specific interactions with providers in terms of take-down procedures.  The Office for Internet Safety has more of an advisory role whereas the digital safety commissioner would have more power.  I can follow up directly with the Deputy and set out the differences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grainia Long" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#J00400"><p>First and foremost, it would have the power to set standards that industry providers would have to meet.  This is the point that we have all reached, and everyone working and making money in this space needs to be meeting national standards.  If something has been said online about a parent or young person and he or she would like that removed, he or she should be able to approach telecom companies or Internet providers under the auspices of those standards and demand that it be taken down.  If the provider does not take it down or decides not to, the office would step in and investigate.  This is an important point and has been the process in other jurisdictions.  It would give the commissioner considerable power.  The Office for Internet Safety does not have the ability to investigate and regulate, given that it is an advisory body.  A digital safety commissioner's office would formalise the regulatory ability.</p> <p>  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection, mentioned in his last report the right to be forgotten.  This issue has arisen.  We agree with his view that people should have the right to be forgotten in terms of actions that they take as children.  When people apply for their first job or a particular course years later, someone might Google them and find out about something that they did six or eight years ago.  Dr. Shannon has recommended that the law be changed to enable the right to be forgotten.  It is a good idea.</p> <p>  Regarding parents, I have mentioned the need for a national campaign.  The Taoiseach is on record as saying that we need to have a national conversation about pornography.  We welcomed that statement, but the conversation cannot be discretionary.  Too many schools can choose what they teach children when it comes to sex education and safety.  We are failing children by not having a national vision of what should be explained to children at the right age.  Many experts could do this well.  We are starting to see the impact of not having done this ten years ago, in that children are making the wrong decisions online or are unaware of what decisions they are taking.</p> <p>  I will revert to the question of the two 14 year old girls, one of whom made the right decision and the other who made the wrong decision.  Who are we failing and why is one person not making the right decision?</p> <p>  I apologise, as I cannot remember who asked about research, but it is an emerging area.  Interestingly, Irish universities are leading the way in the field of cyberpsychology, that is, understanding online behaviour and how it affects our psychology.  Dublin City University has a good department, so it may be worth inviting those involved to tell the committee about cyberpsychology.  The Institute of Art, Design and Technology in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a department of cyberpsychology.  There is a growing field of experts and academics.  I am sure that there are others, but those are the two that come to mind.  There have been good studies.</p> <p>  Someone asked about push-back from industry.  On Monday, I was in London chatting with the NSPCC about this matter and Brexit.  Ironically, the two issues are starting to come together.  Predators do not recognise borders and will use technology to work around them to get to children.  It is important that Ireland not lag behind other countries.  While the industry will have its own views and elements of it will be sceptical or progressive, it will need to come to the party because this is happening.  The UK has made good strides in terms of changing the law.  The Digital Economy Bill, which is going through the House of Commons, will begin regulating the industry in new ways.  The communications committee of the House of Lords is about to complete an inquiry into children and the Internet.  This is happening in other jurisdictions.  The same bodies will work in London and Dublin.  Unfortunately, so will people who want to access children.</p> <p>  Ireland can show leadership.  Many tech and telecom companies base themselves in Dublin and other cities.  I am happy to chat with committee members at any point about our concerns over the UK's exit, but we are really concerned that Brexit will undermine some of our ability to detect and prosecute child sex abuse and exploitation.  That discussion may be for another day.</p></speech>

On average, 400,000 children and young people contact the Childline service every year via phone, text and one-to-one web chats.  Of telephone calls, 75% come from boys.  Nearly the same percentage of online contacts are from girls.  It is interesting that boys choose the phone while girls choose the online and text services.  Ten years ago, very few boys contacted the service.  We differ from every other helpline across Europe, in that they are trying to engage more boys.  We have made strides in our ability to engage boys.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#J00800"><p>We have a different approach.  For those boys who might be listening, I do not mean to make a generalisation, but when they contact us because something is happening, they can sometimes be quite aggressive.  The international way of dealing with that is by telling them that a service will not talk to them if they speak like that, but we tell them to take their time because we know that they are angry and ask them to tell us why they are angry.  We accept a level of that behaviour in order to engage boys, but it has been successful and we have maintained the 75% figure.  The online services see more girls.  We believe that this is because girls are a bit more advanced in terms of using helping services.  Boys are now at the phone level and will most likely move on to the online level, which is what we are seeing generally.</p><p>On complaints by children about other children in regard to cyberbulling, sextortion and those areas, it is their peers they are talking about, their school friends or friends of friends.  However, in other areas, such as grooming, it is strangers and individuals they do not know but have been friends with, have been following or have been followed by for a long period of time.  When we work with children, one of the things we ask them is to tell us about their friends.  They will say they have 500 friends on Facebook or 300 likes on Snapchat.  The numbers are enormous.  However, if we ask children who they would actually talk to if they had a real worry, they find it very difficult to name one person.  That is very significant in the context of where children can go in terms of help seeking behaviour and that is why they come to Childline and those types of services.  The majority of complaints are about peers but there are occasions when it is the adult predator who is actually seeking out a child through social media.</p></speech>

You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  They interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect televised coverage and web streaming.</p><p>I would also like to remind members of the provisions of D&aacute;il Standing Order 59(3) which states: &quot;a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the D&aacute;il to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal&quot; and Seanad Standing Order 47(3) which states: &quot;a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Seanad to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal&quot;.</p><p>I also advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I understand that the witnesses will make a short presentation, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  I invite Mr. McBride to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues and members for the opportunity to address the committee.  I will preface my opening statement by saying that as of yesterday we have received formal notification from the tribunal of inquiry team that we will engage with, which has asked for a range of information.  We are now in formal engagement with the inquiry team.  While I and my colleagues will do everything we possibly can to be helpful to this committee, I am sure members will understand that I will need to exercise some caution in not going into matters that will be covered by the terms of the inquiry.</p> <p>  Many members will know that in January 2014 Tusla - Child and Family Agency, became a separate legal entity to the HSE.  It was established on the back of some 29 inquiries and over 550 recommendations on how child abuse and child protection services should be managed in Ireland.  These multiple inquiries generated much debate and engagement as to how best protect the children of the country.  They recommended that a new approach was required.  A dedicated State agency was created to try to embark on a major reform and transformation programme to improve the lives of children and families who engage with child protection services.</p> <p>  It was a difficult start and the agency was set up carrying an &euro;18 million deficit.  At the time, my predecessor, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, submitted a three-year business case to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, perhaps aptly named, From Survival to Sustainability.  In 2016, some additional investment was made to help the agency move towards a sustainable footing.  While we did not receive all of what we asked for in the business case, the additional investment was very welcome and we have put it to good use.</p> <p>  However, as anyone who has embarked on a transformation and change programme of this scale will know, it takes longer than three years to fully complete and embed into practice.  Nevertheless, we can report that the first three years of improvement has taken place.  For example, in January 2014 there were close to 9,000 unallocated cases, that is, children awaiting allocation to a social worker.  By the end of December last year, the figure had reduced to slightly under 5,500, a reduction of almost 40%.  Within that, the reduction for cases that were deemed to be of a higher priority was closer to 80%.  We are not at all complacent about that.  Far too many children are awaiting allocation to a social worker and we will continue to invest in front-line services until this figure reaches zero and every child who requires a social worker has one.  </p> <p>  The committee will know that working in the field of child abuse and neglect is extremely challenging and complex.  Unfortunately, children are abused or at risk of abuse or neglect every day in Ireland and elsewhere.  Our staff deal with very complex human relations, which often involves unpredictable and sometimes violent behaviour.  In the vast majority of cases where we have to intervene in private family life, we deal with that intervention appropriately, proportionately, professionally and sensitively in an effort to try to maintain people's confidentiality, respect and dignity.  The over 4,000 Tusla staff around the country who work in very difficult circumstances get the intervention right on most occasions.  </p> <p>  One particularly challenging area of work that has emerged for us over the past few years is what we call historical allegations.  These cases involve adults coming forward to disclose information on abuse when they were children, usually around sexual abuse.  It is especially challenging because the legal framework around this area is not specific enough.  We have been, and will continue to be, in discussion with the Department of Children and Youth affairs as part of what will be a fundamental review and overhaul of the Child Care Act 1991.  We will work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that overhaul produces legislation that is fit for purpose.</p> <p>  In the meantime, we are operating on the basis of inferred legislation as a result of case law.  There are currently two cases in the court process which are challenging Tusla's role in allegations of abuse.  We await developments in that case law.</p> <p>  In the current circumstances, we are required to try to ensure that an alleged victim is supported while at the same time ensuring fair and due process for the alleged perpetrator, in addition to assessing whether any children may be at current risk of harm.  This is an extremely difficult balance to strike.  Traditionally, child protection social workers have been focused, through their training, on the protection of children and have not been skilled in dealing with or trained to deal with forensic-type interviews of alleged perpetrators.  We are beginning to develop that skill set, but it is very specialised.  We have created some posts and teams to try to develop that expertise.</p> <p>  It is in this very challenging context that we are dealing with cases which are understandably the focus of much debate and concern on the part of the public and in these Houses.  At this juncture, I would like to clearly reiterate our apology to people affected by our mistakes and for the distress and upset they have endured.  I accept that public confidence in the system may well have been undermined because of that, but what has happened is not reflective of the high standards that staff hold themselves to or that I as chief executive hold them to, in particular in regard to the handling of sensitive information.</p> <p>  It is important to point out that I have no knowledge or evidence that Tusla staff acted with any malice of intent.</p><p>I also make clear that if I did receive such evidence or information, I would intervene personally, immediately and publicly.  As we know, mistakes were made and we very much look forward to working with the tribunal of inquiry in addressing this matter in its totality.  As far as I am concerned, the inquiry cannot come soon enough in order that all the facts are known and responsibility and accountability can be properly and fairly attributed. </p><p> I note also that Tusla is subject to a very high level of regulation and oversight.  We are one of the most regulated services or agencies in the country.  This scrutiny is done internally by area reviews and audits, sub-committees of the board, the board proper and the quality assurance directorate.  Externally, this regulation is carried out by, for example, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the national review panel, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the body that regulates and registers qualified social workers, known as CORU, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Moreover, HIQA recently completed a two-year governance overview in which all 17 of Tusla's operational areas received a child protection inspection and which visited our headquarters to carry out a review of our corporate governance arrangements.  We have seen and are commenting on the first draft of this report, which notes some significant improvement in services and staff morale.</p><p> To give members an idea of the volume of business Tusla deals with, we received approximately 120,000 referrals in the first three years of our existence.  More than 51,000 of these referrals relate to abuse and neglect.  It is, therefore, extremely important that we remain focused on the much needed transformation and reform of child protection services.  We owe it to the children who are the subject of the referrals and their families to provide appropriate, proportionate and timely responses to any concerns raised.</p><p> As we know, almost every inquiry into serious cases of child abuse in this country and elsewhere, including cases where children have died, has highlighted the lack of information sharing across key agencies as a key contributing factor to things going wrong.  Appropriate and responsible information sharing is the cornerstone of all child protection systems everywhere in the world.  It ensures children receive the specific intervention and response required.  I reassure the families with whom we work, members of the public and politicians that Tusla always endeavour to use this information responsibly and with the best intentions in the interests of protecting children.</p><p> Child protection is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.  One State agency on its own cannot achieve the best outcomes for children.  We rely on families, communities, politicians, government and the media to support us in this task.  I urge anyone who has a concern about a child to report it as responsibly and accurately as possible.</p><p> While Tusla must learn from mistakes and make continuous improvement, through the dedication of staff, which I see as I travel around the country, and by working in partnership with key stakeholders and wider civic society, I believe we will be successful in completing our ambitious transformation programme to reform child protection services and improve outcomes for the most vulnerable children in our country.  The evidence available to me thus far is that children are safer today than they were before the Child and Family Agency was created.</p></speech>

I believe the invitation was issued late on a Friday evening and was accepted first thing on the following Monday morning.  I thank Mr. McBride for that without hesitation.  As everyone will understand, the reason we invited him to appear before us was that the confidence of members of the joint committee, as individuals and parents, in Tusla was shaken to its foundations by a high profile revelation in the media.  In the meantime, a tribunal of inquiry has been established to investigate the matter.  As Chairman, I am conscious that it is my responsibility to ensure the committee does not cross over into the work of the tribunal of inquiry as it investigates the high profile case reported in the media in recent weeks.  I advise members that this is my responsibility under Standing Orders and precedent.  For this reason, I will not allow specific questions to be asked on the case reported in the media because we cannot prejudice the work of the tribunal of inquiry as it seeks to get to the bottom of that matter.  Notwithstanding those remarks, the joint committee is concerned to find out about the practices in place in Tusla.  All members have a shared concern for the welfare of children.  We would appreciate, therefore, if Mr. McBride would be as helpful as possible and answer questions to the fullest extent possible.  I do not wish to stifle discussion, other than to ensure we do not stray into the high profile case of recent weeks.  I ask Deputy Rabbitte to lead the way in a responsible manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#M00300"><p>I, too, welcome Mr. McBride and his opening statement.  The Chairman has presented the background to the joint committee's decision to invite him to appear before us.  I acknowledge the speed with which he responded and welcome his open and honest statement in which he identified various issues that have been in the public domain in recent days.</p> <p>  I will steer my questions in two directions, namely, the issues of confidence and retrospective or historical cases, both of which Mr. McBride covered.  I propose to ask some pointed questions on the issue of confidence.  Is Tusla satisfied with its internal information technology system?  Mr. McBride will be accustomed to being asked that question as I have been asking it for a long time.  Is Tusla satisfied with the framework in place for sharing information?  If, for example, a child leaves Galway and moves to Dublin, how is this dealt with by counsellors?  I have some doubts about whether such connectivity is in place.  Does Mr. McBride have confidence in this regard?</p> <p>  Is Tusla satisfied with multi-party involvement?  By this I mean if a sufficiently good sieving mechanism is in place for sharing information among responsible persons.  When an allegation is made does Tusla have a sufficient number of qualified staff to investigate it?  Mr. McBride's statement that there are 4,000 Tusla staff is news to me because the Minister was unable to answer when I asked her a question on staff numbers in the past two weeks.  Does Tusla have enough staff to do its job?  In 2015, it was allocated an additional &euro;6 million to recruit more staff.  Have staff been hired to deal with the large number of retrospective cases identified in the detailed report completed in 2015?</p> <p>  Does Tusla have proper checks and balances in place to deal with people coming forward with allegations?  I assume the figure of 150,000 allegations, of which 50,000 related to allegations of sexual abuse, has since declined.  Are proper checks and balances in place to check and verify allegations?</p> <p>  On the issue of historical or "bottom drawer" cases, as I like to call them, does Tusla have a sufficient number of staff working on these?  Mr. McBride indicated the number of such cases had fallen dramatically in the past 12 months.  When I asked a question on adult disclosure cases on 5 July 2016 I was informed that a large proportion of the 8,865 such cases that were live in 2015 were still in high priority listing in 2016.  How many of these cases are still identified as high priority cases?</p> <p>  Are cases involving historical disclosures prioritised immediately as either high, medium or low risk?  I ask this question because an abuser could potentially be at large until a case is fully investigated.</p><p>How does Tusla categorise the original allegation that comes forward?  Is it in a high, medium or low risk capacity?  My understanding is that when retrospective cases come forward they are deemed to be low risk whereas I thought they would be high risk until they are investigated fully.  Does Tusla have the manpower to deliver on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#N00200"><p>I thank Mr. McBride for attending in such an expeditious manner before the committee and for his apology, which I believe is sincere but which I would have to say is cold comfort to the affected family in the case we are all aware of but on which we cannot go into the specifics.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. McBride referred to the level of regulation and oversight in Tusla, both internal and external, but in terms of what happened recently, and other people have spoken about confidence in the organisation, it speaks to another situation.  Everybody here, and the public at large, needs reassurance from Mr. McBride on the procedures that have been set up even in the interim.  Whatever about the tribunal, there are ongoing cases of a very serious nature in the interim.  I am sure that every person involved in a case being dealt with by Tusla would be concerned to know it is being dealt with in the appropriate manner.</p> <p>  To err is human.  My background is in medical negligence and it is the only area I can think of to compare this to because a doctor can do something, with the best intent, to take care of a patient but the end result can be that somebody is seriously affected or even die.  In those cases, the doctors have the full rigours of the law to face, and often there are huge financial payouts etc.</p> <p>  The mind boggles as to this error and how it could have occurred.  We cannot go into specifics but I would make the comment that regardless of whether it was a copy and paste error, all of us find it very difficult to believe.</p></speech>

That is the most obvious question.  It is imperative that the reputation of Tusla does not become permanently tainted.  What steps are being taken to ensure damage control?</p> <p>  Under section 5 of the Protections for Persons in Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, it is an offence to make a false allegation of child abuse.  In incidents where false accusations are made, what actions are taken against individuals?  In cases of alleged child abuse that were deemed to be unfounded, how many times has Tusla investigated the motives of the accusers for making such allegations?  What responses has Tusla received from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to its lobbying with regard to the historical allegations and statutory instruments to tackle such cases?  What assurances can be given to families on whom Tusla may have sensitive information that their data is protected and has not been breached?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#N00900"><p>I thank the Tusla representatives for coming in.  I will preface my remarks by saying that comments have been made about the Garda in recent weeks and months but regarding Tusla, it is also important to say that despite all the controversies with regard to Tusla it is worth recognising the very hard work, commitment and professionalism of the vast majority of its staff in what is very challenging work.  Notwithstanding that, confidence in Tusla has been shaken by recent events and many people are very concerned about that.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions.  Section 7.2 of the Children First guidelines states that it is essential that the Health Service Executive, which I presume in this area is now Tusla, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na designate personnel at assessment, investigation and management level who will remain involved with the case until the assessment and investigation is completed.  In that regard, are forms relating to those processes completed upon receipt of every allegation and in every case?  On that basis, can we assume that it would be relatively easy to identify the designated persons in each individual case, ensuring accountability and oversight of files held?</p> <p>  In the event that it was alleged that a file had been created maliciously, would Tusla be capable of disproving that?  Is it Mr. McBride's understanding that an administrative error of any nature regarding such a file should be reported as a data breach to the Data Protection Commissioner?  Does Mr. McBride believe there is systemic data protection weaknesses in his organisation?  Is it correct that the Data Protection Commissioner is carrying out an investigation into Tusla due to its failure to report administrative errors?</p> <p>  I want to underline the comments made by Deputy Rabbitte and Senator Noone on historical cases.  I, too, query whether those cases might be treated as lower risk cases and whether that might be contrary to the Children First guidelines.  With regard to historical cases, are there processes in place to ensure a review and that the cases are returned to rather than simply left lying on a shelf?  Are they investigated at least in some manner, and what does such a process involve?  Does the form template for allegations of abuse require that allegations of abuse are deleted from the form before being saved again as a template?</p> <p>  How many times since the establishment of Tusla have clerical errors led to files being held which falsely alleged abuse, and in what circumstances could that happen?  In the event of allegations of abuse being found to be without basis, at what stage are files generally deleted by Tusla?  Similarly, how long are files relating to allegations held in the event that no evidence is found to support an allegation and a case is not progressed by the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP?  Is there a time limit, and is there a file retention policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017022200002#N01000"><p>I would like to join in the comments made by the previous speakers, which I will not repeat.  My questions follow on from the question of the retention of files raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, particularly where there is no evidence to support an allegation.  Are those files retained or left open?  What happens to them?  Are they stored somewhere?  Can Mr. McBride give us an update on that?</p> <p>  If I recall correctly, Mr. McBride mentioned 122,000 referrals, 51,000 of which related to abuse or neglect.  What would be the general trend with regard to the other 70,000?  Given the fact that there is a good deal of data and information involved in that amount of material, has Mr. McBride identified any trends regarding the figures with a view to pushing that back to us, as political representatives, to formulate something around prevention, in particular, and the mental health area that might integrate with it?  We are always looking for research and we have databanks of information but identifying the trends from that seems to be an issue.  If Mr. McBride has identified anything in that, I would be grateful if he could share it with us.</p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte asked if we had confidence in our IT system.  I am afraid the answer to that question is "Not yet".  We have inherited 17 areas as part of the HSE.  A number of those areas had different systems.  Some had paper systems.  We are now attempting to roll out what we call our national child care information system, which will be our client information system.  It will be national and will produce management information.  We are making some progress in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017 and into 2018.</p><p>Suffice it to say, the investment in ICT infrastructure has been insufficient for many years.  Some investment is now available to us to take our national child care information system forward.  That project has been a big priority for us over the past couple of years.  Our board identified one of our top organisational risks as not having a national information system.  In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question, we are not satisfied with the national system at the moment but we are working very hard to roll it out.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about multi-agency information and a sifting mechanism.  In terms of allegations of abuse by adults, as I said in my opening statement, child protection social workers would have ordinarily, through their training and education, been focused on how we protect the child.  The determination of the veracity of an allegation against a perpetrator is a much more specialist skill.  We must now develop specialist posts and teams to undertake that skill.  Traditionally, child protection social workers are not trained in the skill.  We must upskill ourselves and training is beginning to be put in place in most areas.</p><p> The Deputy asked if Tusla had enough staff.  We are still trying to recruit staff.  In 2016 we filled 514 posts of which 320 were front-line social work grades.  There are another 119 posts, of which 83 were social workers who accepted posts.  They are due to land in the first quarter of this year.  Recruitment is a big challenge for us.  Only 250 social work students graduate from Irish institutions every year.  To recruit we had to go to Northern Ireland and I, personally, went to the University of Ulster.  We are trying to recruit in the UK in order to fulfil our recruitment targets.  We are very much in recruitment mode.  We have managed to recruit some additional staff and reduced the number of unallocated cases.  There is still much more to be done in that regard.</p><p> The Deputy specifically asked if we had enough people to work on historic cases.  We are beginning to train more people in specific interviewing skills.</p><p> The Deputy asked if historic allegations were given high priority.  Did I misunderstand her question? </p></speech>

All of our inspections that have been undertaken by HIQA have recognised that where we identified that a child or children were at immediate risk then immediate action was taken.  I must be honest with the Deputy about what happens if an allegation is made by an adult about something that happened to him or her 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  Sometimes the allegation will be unclear due to the passing of time.  It may not at all be clear what the circumstances are or whether the perpetrator is still around and can be located.  If we are asked or challenged to prioritise that kind of case over a child who may be at immediate risk of harm we will prioritise the latter.<br/><br/>Senator Noone mentioned regulatory oversight.  Tusla is one of the most heavily regulated agencies in the country.  In terms of corrective action, we have done a number of things.  We have actively tried to engage with the Data Commissioner.  Before the current episode emerged we had previously engaged an external body to conduct a high level assessment of data protection practices and procedures.  The body has made some findings and stated it was impressed by saying:</p><blockquote>Tusla management had demonstrated an impressive appreciation for the confidentiality and care with which personal records and sensitive personal data should be managed across a wide range of services.</blockquote> <p>The body has made some recommendations and findings that we will act upon. <br/><br/>We have engaged with the Data Commissioner since recent events unfolded.  We have issued instructions to all of our areas to be particularly vigilant around data handling issues.  In the past couple of days I have invited them to contact me directly if they are aware of any particular issues of a similar nature.  The chief operations officer has also set in place the system to allow the areas to identify similar types of cases or issues that we need to be aware of at a senior level.  I have outlined some of the things that has been done since.<br/><br/>Senator Noone asked what happens when false allegations are made.  If someone within Tusla is found to have made a false allegation I am clear it would result in a very serious process.  If false allegations are made by people outside of Tusla then we must find that out first before we do anything.  We would then report the false allegation to the Garda.  Were there other aspects to the Senator's questions?  </p></speech>

I understand there is to be a fairly fundamental review of the 1991 legislation.  Tusla has already engaged with and made our views on this matter known to the Department.  We think the current section of the legislation that deals with allegations of abuse is inadequate.  We hope to influence how the revised legislation is shaped into the future.</p></speech>

Initially, we would open what we call an intake record or a record of the referral that has been made to us.  Not all of our referrals turn into ongoing cases.  Therefore, they are not turned into a file like the one I have here in my hand.  We have to keep a record of all information that is passed to us.  Where appropriate, if it is possible that a criminal offence has been committed, we share that information with the Garda.  A template notification form is passed back and forth between ourselves and the Garda to acknowledge the information.</p> <p>  In terms of designated persons in each individual case, we now have dedicated intake functions.  I am sorry if the term intake functions sounds a bit technical but it does what it suggests.  It deals with the initial referrals as they come in.  Normally that means referrals that were not previously known to us.</p><p>We generate that record.  The team leader of the dedicated intake team would take responsibility for the overview of referrals to the intake process and the decision on which of them needed to be allocated.  The majority are screened, that is, someone examines them initially and tries to make an initial determination of the level of risk contained within that information, and then we make a decision to move towards an initial assessment - the next stage of assessment, which is of a higher level - that would normally require the referral to be allocated to a social worker.  As we have already acknowledged, some referrals that are not immediately allocated are kept on a non-allocated list.  In most areas, the leader of the intake team would review the cases on the waiting list on a regular basis.  I have visited to see what the team leaders do.  Leaders may make visits to family homes to ensure that everything is okay.  They may phone schools to see whether they have any information.  They will clock any new information that might push the child up the priority list.</p><p> Importantly, it is not the case that children who are awaiting allocation are being ignored.  Their needs and priorities are regularly reviewed.  That is not ideal.  If we have decided that an initial assessment is required, the case needs to be allocated to a social worker, but there is not nothing happening - sorry for the double negative - with these cases.  They are largely being monitored.  In this instance, the designated person about whom the Deputy asked is the leader of the intake team, who is overseen by a principal social worker.</p></speech>

For example, I worked in the service at different levels - social worker, team leader, principal social worker, child care manager and area manager.  Some areas had five points of referral and six people trying to pick up work going back ten or 15 years.  Mr. McBride has outlined the service delivery framework, under which it is clear that we have dedicated, specialist teams to receive, review and make professional decisions on matters that are referred to our agency.</p> <p>  There is an interesting number.  We are known within communities and counties and everything is referred to us.  Some 60% of our referrals are about families in crisis or in need of help.  Deputy Neville mentioned prevention and early intervention.  We deal with those cases and have developed good processes and service interventions across Ireland that are available to such families.  We are connected in the communities.  As an agency, we take a lead in the children and young people's services committees, CYPSCs, which include city and county child care committees.  We are engaged in collaborative work and have produced good material on prevention, partnership and family support, which assists 60% of those families that are referred to Tusla to get an intervention in a timely and proportionate way.</p> <p>  The methodology attached to the relationship between the child protection service and the family support service has been worked up well.  In one area, for example, there were 300 plus referrals from the child protection intake team to the prevention and family support team.  Of those referrals that went out to families that required a family support service, only 7% were returned to the child protection system.  That is a good indicator that the professionals were getting it right in their initial screenings and assessments.  With good standard operating procedures between those two services, we ensure that such welfare-type family support cases are handled.  This creates more time and space for the intake assessment team to examine more serious child protection cases and take corrective action.</p> <p>  We have a robust and good child protection notification system.  Case conferences on child protection issues are held throughout the country.  Some welfare issues do not arise out of wilful neglect by parents, but because parents have mental health problems, issues with drugs, etc.  Our staff are trained to work with those parents through a difficult process so that there can be changes within their families and children can remain in their families and communities.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that these are the things that we have achieved since our establishment.  We have set up specialist teams across the country and are continuing with that innovation.</p></speech>

The balance of the 122,000 referrals are what we call general welfare concerns, which are usually lower level concerns than specific allegations of abuse.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised data protection questions.</p></speech>

If information came to us from the outside, we would normally take it as it stood.  We would speak to families and, in following due process, alleged perpetrators.  Trying to determine the veracity of the allegation is a part of our job.  If someone deliberately created malicious information and sent it to us, discovering it immediately could be difficult.  Even if we reviewed the intake records in the process that I described, we would have to accept the information that was given until we could get into the detail of the referral and had reason to doubt it.</p></speech>

We would normally report any data breach to the Data Protection Commissioner.  I believe that the question of whether a specific breach occurred in the case in question will form part of the inquiry, so I will leave the matter at that.  We have engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner.  That office has written to us to confirm that it will conduct an investigation into our data protection systems and processes.</p><p>We very much welcome that.  I do not think there was a specific suggestion that data protection problems were systemic.  It wrote to us saying that it wanted to clarify whether there were any systemic problems, so we very much welcome the engagement of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p> As I said earlier, we carried out a high-level assessment and there were findings and issues that we need to deal with.  Hitherto, as regards data protection and freedom of information functions, we have been reliant on the HSE through a memorandum of understanding when Tusla was set up as a separate body.  I am now determined that we need to invest in our own management capacity around data protection, freedom of information and the like in order that we are completely self-sufficient in these matters and not relying on another State agency.  That is where we are up to with that.  I do not know whether my colleague would like to say any more than that concerning data protection.</p></speech>

This is really part of the challenge.  Perhaps the chief operations officer can comment on this.  We have no specific power to compel.  For example, we cannot compel a person against whom an allegation is being made or any third party to talk to us about these allegations.  Sometimes what we have is an allegation that relates to a period of time 20 or 30 years ago.  On occasion, we have no means of following up with the alleged perpetrator and, therefore, these situations are left in a quite inconclusive manner unless further information comes to light.  This is part of the challenge we have in trying to balance fair and due process for a person against whom an allegation is made on the one hand and looking at the level of risk that may be contained in an allegation.  It is part of that balance and it depends on the quality and nature of the information we receive.</p> <p>  In terms of the template form for allegations of abuse, does it require that allegations of abuse are deleted from the form before being saved as a template again?  We correct any information that comes to light that is found to be incorrect.  We would take it down from any kind of electronic system.  Therefore, it would be corrected, but not necessarily destroyed because there are data protection issues around that.</p> <p>  How many times since the establishment of Tusla have clerical errors led to files being held which falsely alleged sexual abuse?  I am sorry but I do not have a number on that.  We would need to come back to the Deputy on that.  I would not have a number in my head.</p> <p>  In the event of allegations of abuse being found to be without basis, at what stage are files generally deleted by Tusla?  Similarly, how long are files relating to allegations held in the event that no evidence is found to support an allegation and no case is progressed by the garda&iacute; or the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Deputy Neville also asked if there is a time limit or file retention policy.  As I said, we do not hold false information on people.  The information is corrected but there are data protection issues about that information being completely destroyed.  That is something we will have to discuss with the Data Protection Commissioner's representatives when they come to visit us.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Quinlan remind me about the file retention policy?</p></speech>

Mr. Quinlan said that Tusla initially creates a file.  There is a vetting process and it moves to the next stage.  When Tusla is vetting those files at the initial stage, obviously it is vetting them in regard to risk or immediate risk to a child, which I totally get.  Are there any control mechanisms in place to assess the risk of false allegations, or are these files just allowed to sit?</p></speech>

Sometimes parents or their partners make allegations in respect of how the parent who has custody of the child or children is looking after them.  We face that on a fairly regular basis within our service and would make definitive decisions about those cases.  Many of those cases are also before the family law court.  Under section 20 we would provide reports to the court in respect of that.</p></speech>

Do I get the sense from the presentation today that there is Tusla of the early years and Tusla of the modern years?  Is there a legacy issue pertaining to some of the issues which have arisen and which have broken down people's confidence in the organisation?  Is there a historical legacy issue from the transfer from the HSE and the setting up of Tusla?  Has it emerged that there are a number of discrepancies and issues arising that no longer pertain to the agency?  Is that what Mr. McBride is saying?  He might clarify that for me.</p> <p>  Could there be a file on me in Tusla of which I would not be aware?  At what stage would Tusla make me aware of a file that existed with my name on it and an allegation, be it true or false?  How long could that file potentially exist in Tusla, with my name on and containing an allegation, and of which I would not be aware?  Mr. McBride might address those matters. </p></speech>

The crucial issue is about the delicate balance between the constitutional right of the child to be protected and the right of the alleged perpetrator to their good name.  I want to follow up on the series of questions that others have asked and focus, in particular, on the right of the alleged perpetrator.  I note with some concern that Mr. McBride said Tusla's social workers are well trained in dealing with the child.  I understand that because Tusla's primary purpose is the protection of children.  However, I am somewhat concerned because he said that he is developing specialist posts and upskilling staff to deal with alleged perpetrators.</p><p>To follow up on the Chairman's question, if an allegation is made against an individual, serious concerns arise over his or her right to have correct follow-up procedures in order to protect his or her good name.  I wish to ask some specific questions about that.</p><p> In response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, the witnesses said it is first a matter of an intake referral and that, if there is a possible criminal offence, the information is shared with the Garda.  In the witnesses' presentation, they referred to appropriate information sharing.  Obviously, there is appropriate information sharing and the referrals that come to the agency will come from a variety of sources.  They are all channelled into Tusla.  I understand the constraints based on Tusla being newly established and that there is a shortage of staff.  At what point does Tusla share information with the Garda?  If an accusation is made and there is a judgment that there may be an alleged criminal offence, at what point does Tusla share the information with the Garda?  Is it at the stage of the making of the judgment?  How does Tusla update that information?  The witnesses have given us some detailed responses on how they keep and update their own files and how they make corrections where there is wrong information in a file.  How does Tusla update the people with whom it shares information, specifically the Garda?</p><p> There is a concern over the protection of one's good name.  Who speaks to the alleged perpetrator when information is shared?  Is it Tusla or the Garda?  How is a person notified that a complaint has been made against him or her about activity that may be of a criminal nature?  What are the agency's procedures in that regard?</p><p> We cannot talk about the specific case but I would like to refer, however, to a very general quotation in some of the correspondence on that case: "Given the demands on the service at the time [It is a particular point in time], the case remained on a waiting list to be assigned to a social worker".  We all know there is a large number of cases that have not been assigned to social workers because of shortages, etc., and that targets were not met by the end of 2016.  Where a social worker was involved previously in respect of a case, why would that case be put on a list of cases awaiting the assignation of a social worker?  In other words, if there has been a social worker involved in some stage-----</p></speech>

Could there be cases on a waiting list for assignation to a social worker that might already have been referred to the Garda?</p><p>In the written presentation, the agency stated it would co-operate fully with the HIQA investigation announced by the Minister.  The presentation states:</p><blockquote>HIQA has recently concluded a two-year review of Tusla's child protection and welfare services, including child protection inspections in all 17 operational areas, and the governance arrangements in place to ensure an effective, timely and safe service.  Tusla is currently liaising with HIQA in relation to its report on this review and while there are findings and recommendations which require a response from Tusla, the overall feedback is very positive...</blockquote> <p>I presume that report will feed into the other but I am not very clear on the difference between the two investigations by HIQA.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss governance issues following the recent high-profile case, which we will not go into.  I have several questions.  If I am jumping from one topic to another, I ask forgiveness.</p> <p>  What is the time taken between Tusla's being informed of an allegation of child sex abuse and the passing on of the information to the Garda, taking into account any correction that needs to be made?  Is the timeframe between nine months and 12 months?  Could the witnesses confirm that?  Does Tusla have or is it in need of a comprehensive and robust legal framework that could assist with and prescribe its legal limits and obligations?  Is this not absolutely necessary at this point?</p> <p>  Tusla has swiftly apologised for what has happened.  The public will thank it for that.  This contrasts with the other scandal of our time, that of the Catholic Church, which demonstrated an inability to apologise immediately.  There has been a decline in people's trust and confidence in the Catholic Church since the old days.  The implication is that Tusla's credibility has been shot to pieces.  I rate it at 10%, if that.  Perhaps that is being generous.  Public and staff confidence has declined.  The staff to be employed and those waiting to be posted will need much more reassurance from the agency.  The agency has given an outright apology but the witnesses should be aware that this matter could be ongoing until it is resolved.  I do not know what the resolution will be but the agency's credibility is certainly at stake.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses assure the committee categorically that there is no undue, nefarious influence on any of Tusla's staff to skew or act with malice in any of the cases that have been presented to them?</p></speech>

As public representatives, we receive telephone calls from constituents who have been reported to Tusla by various individuals, such as partners or neighbours.  They plead, "They have got it wrong, they have got it wrong, they have got it wrong".  Most of us at the other end of the telephone, whether councillors or public representatives, say, "Well, we do not think they have got it wrong.  I do think you have got it wrong".  </p> <p>  How can allegations of child sexual abuse be investigated when the agency lacks a proper framework?  What is the practice for informing alleged perpetrators who are being investigated?  Is there such a practice given that Tusla has now acknowledged that social workers need extra training?  I acknowledge this has been touched on.  Is there a timeline and structure for informing the alleged perpetrator?</p> <p>  Is it the witnesses' understanding, in line with Children First, that if a health professional or member of the HSE becomes aware of abuse allegations, he or she should contact Tusla before any other agencies?  I do not know if this is endemic.  In certain circumstances, it does not seem to have occurred.</p> <p>  Clerical and human errors do occur, of course, by nature.  We have been asked to believe fantasy in recent days, however.</p></speech>

In this regard, I include myself.  I will concentrate on my last question, or perhaps my last observation.  Tusla's priority is rightly to focus on children currently at risk.  It is, however, swamped with historical allegations.</p><p>Could the witnesses give me some idea of the percentage of staff who are involved in the investigation which needs to be put on the back burner or in abeyance for a time when children at risk is the priority?  Does Tusla need another sub-section or agency to deal with these historical allegations which, we hope, in time will peter out?</p></speech>

It is important to make the point that it is a big step for such parents to contact social workers and there is a major stigma and taboo around the social worker and what that carries with it.  What has happened in recent times has shaken those parents' confidence in the organisation.  Tusla should not underestimate the task it has to restore their confidence.  There are people with allegations.  Obviously, they will not work with Tusla.  However, there are many parents who are trying to do right by their children and they know that involves putting them into care, as difficult as that is.  It is important to remember them in everything that is going on.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that in itself is a considerable piece of work.</p> <p>  I understand there is no policy or strategy from Tusla on how to deal with adult disclosure cases, the so-called section 3 referrals.

We have inherited, as I alluded to earlier, a number of different systems and processes in 17 areas which have led to difficulties.  We have endeavoured to put together a standardised - Mr. Gibson referred to it - service delivery framework with dedicated intact points, which picks up Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question.  There would have been multiple intake points previously.  We have also endeavoured to put together a system for moving information from initial screening to initial assessment where that is necessary to ongoing allocation.</p> <p>  We are not yet fully confident to say that none of these issues pertains any longer.  We are three years into a transformation programme.  We think we have made significant progress but we also believe there is still some progress to make.</p> <p>  The issue of letting people against whom an allegation may have been made know that this information has been given to us is very much part of fair and due process.  We should be letting them know as quickly as possible.  That does not always happen when we are dealing with unallocated cases.</p> <p>  On another question about timescale, there is no specific timeframe.  We should be trying to deal with these pieces of information as quickly as we possibly can and letting people know that we have information about them.  That should be the ideal standard.</p></speech>

One would hope that one would fit with the other.  I would anticipate that such would be the case.</p> <p>  I absolutely accept the issues of public confidence and trust that have been raised by a number of committee members.  We will be working extremely hard to communicate with children in care and their families that we work with to absolutely reassure them that we have their best interests at heart.  We will share the work that is done with the Data Commissioner.  We will feed our own findings from an internal review into the public inquiry and it will be made public in that way.  People will be able to see what we have done.  They will be able to see the mistakes we have made.  They will be able to see what we have tried to do about it.  They will be to see these in the context of the significant change and transformation that we have been trying to undertake.</p> <p>  In regard to the issue of malicious intent, I have already made it public and have said already today that I have no information or evidence that anyone in Tusla acted out of malice.  That is a matter of public record.  If I find that information or that comes to my attention, I will deal with that personally, openly and publicly.</p> <p>  A point I would make before I bring in others relates to the contact points.  We have now got dedicated contact points, as I stated already, with a team leader who has overview of all the referrals that come into that area.  That would not always have been the case.  There would have been a number of different contact points dealing with these issues and that was a legacy issue that we have tried to resolve.</p></speech>

If we are going take action and talk to any third part in respect of a historical allegation, we have a policy set down which Deputy Rabbitte referred to and which embodies good procedures to observe constitutional rights to fair procedure.  It is very applicable to historical allegations and even our language today is a moving, sort of progressive way in which we should work.  We should not use the words "alleged perpetrator" because then that sometimes becomes "alleged offender".  When someone is subject to an allegation of historical abuse, that is the language we use and how we think, which ensures fair procedure for any individual who is referred by another about an abusive or an alleged abusive incident in the past.  To be very clear, we write to the person who makes the allegation because sometimes these people present in a distraught state to our service.</p></speech>

My question was not about the person who makes the allegation, it was about how Tusla continues to share information with the Garda to make sure that whatever information it has goes to the Garda and the person who is the alleged perpetrator, because that it the only language that I know to use, is actually informed of what is on the record.</p></speech>

That is set down in our policies and procedure.

We report any suspected abuse to the Garda.  Once we believe we have suspected abuse, we report that matter to the Garda as we are obliged to do so under Children First.  That can happen at different points in the assessment process but once we suspect abuse we inform the Garda.  The Garda investigates that matter separately to us because it is looking at the criminal elements whereas we are looking at the protection of children, but there is ongoing liaison between us in each individual case.</p></speech>

I reassure members that happens on an ongoing basis.  We have a responding to allegations of abuse policy and there are very set procedures laid down in that policy.  We start by interviewing the person who is alleging that he or she has been abused and we go through a respectful, open process with the person to try to gather as much information as we can on the alleged abuse.  Then the alleged perpetrator is afforded his fair procedures.  We write to him outlining all the detail of the information that is alleged against him to provide him full opportunity to respond to those matters and we take into account any other information that either party might bring to our attention.  At the end of that process, we determine a provisional conclusion and we share that with the alleged abuser and with the person who is allegedly being abused.  There is another opportunity at that point to provide additional information to further consider that point until we reach a final conclusion.  Individuals are also afforded the opportunity to appeal at the end of that.  There is an independent appeal process.  It is quite a robust procedure to ensure we protect children and we afford individuals fair procedures in that regard.</p></speech>

The Public Water Forum stated that equity must apply to both those who paid the charges and those who did not pay, though it states that it has not had the opportunity to look at the issue in detail yet.  It is an issue we need to address under equity and fairness and my view is that people who have paid should be repaid if there is no intention of pursuing those who have not paid.  Do the witnesses from the Public Water Forum have any comments on that?</p> <p>  The document of the Public Water Forum refers to an adequate allowance for personal use and suggests a differential charge would apply for all users above the mean.  It states that the forum finds it difficult to conceptualise ways in which this could be applied where all households are not metered.  This is the crux of the issue for us and the question of metering as against not metering comes into the equity and fairness topic too.  If there is to be a charge for excessive use, how is that calculated?  Yesterday, the Right2Water group said it was in favour of charging for excessive use.  Many of us are now in favour of charging for excessive use.  Do the witnesses have any further views on how that can be done?  We will have to deal with this as a committee. </p> <p>  The Public Water Forum also suggested the use of water bonds for funding water provision.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment on that.</p></speech>

However, we have not found a way to conceptualise penalising, charging, sanctioning or giving an incentive for conservation in the absence of measuring the amount of usage at household level.  There may be a way to do it.  In Australia they imposed a swimming pool tax through the planning regulations, though not necessarily by metering, but I do not know of any way we could do it.</p><p>However, there may well be a way.</p><p> In response to the two other very quick questions that were asked by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, water bonds are used in the United States a lot.  Ms O'Brien has some experience of them and will be able to address the question in more detail.  They are also used by Welsh Water.  We have a general point to make as a forum.  The last day we met I made the point that this is a forum which does not have any designated research or technical expertise.  There are many areas where we have expertise among the members but one area where we lack expertise is in the area of finance.  The reinvestment requirement of Irish Water is such that the technicalities of the financial instruments that will be used are outside of our scope of expertise.  Our main suggestion is that the joint Oireachtas committee might be a place that could examine the feasibility of the model and how it might be applied to Ireland, in the case of Welsh Water in particular.  The water system in Wales is a public system like ours.</p><p> As a forum we did not yet have an opportunity to discuss how to apply the principle of equity and fairness, which as we say in our document we consider to be indivisible.  One can ask what that means when it comes to people who have paid and those who have not paid.  The forum has not discussed it but we put it on our agenda for our next meeting on 8 March.  I did say we would make a written submission to the joint Oireachtas committee arising from the discussion on the question.</p></speech>

Those are very feasible here and would provide a steady income for people who do not want a lot of risk in their investment.  That is something that could be done.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, or the Department of Finance might be able to give some assistance.  I am not an expert in finance.</p> <p>  There was reference to excessive use and how to measure it.  The main thing is to define what is excessive use.  The median is in the region of 150 litres a day per person.  It might have been said yesterday that three times that amount is considered excessive use but I think that is far too much.  If one rates it that high it will become the norm.  It needs to be above the average or median use unless there are outliers.  It is important to take care of the people who need it but not to make the exception the rule.  The definition is the key point.</p></speech>

In any system that would have an excessive use charge, one would be looking at other ways for the non-metered people to identify excessive usage within that cohort.  There is obviously quite rich data around consumption and consumption patterns from the metered use.  There is the overlay that it can go with district meter areas to look at areas that have high volumes of usage that might suggest there seems to be excessive use in that, but it is more generalised than at a household level.  It depends on whether one is looking at cost-effective metering in the longer term and increasing the pool of people who are metered for that purpose or new builds that are metered.  It depends on a number of approaches that one might take that might increase the information in that regard.  This is something that sometimes can be resolved through the regulatory process.  Following consultation with people, while it might not be perfect, one can come to some arrangement that people feel are a close proxy.</p></speech>

I do not know whether one can measure individual water flows if one does not have a meter but any information in that regard would be useful to us as we come closer to conclusions.</p></speech>

I was simply saying that in a district metered area one would know, given the nature of the households and the expected consumption patterns by virtue of a comparison to the metered usage, if it appears there is excessive usage, in which case one might target particular areas to look at the water flow or individual households in the same way as was done prior to meters.  It is not a perfect alignment.  Apartment blocks can have bulk meters.  It may be something one could ask Irish Water to find out what the technical options might be in that regard.</p></speech>

The expert commission under Mr. Duffy reported that the necessary measures should be put in place to give effect to the commitment that those who have paid their water bills to date will be treated no less favourably than those who have not.  I firmly believe that a huge portion of our deliberations will be based on the issue so we must have specific figures in order for us to arrive at some sort of decision or consensus.  My question is for Ms Graham.  What is the estimated cost of refunding Irish Water payments?  We will have to have figures in order to thrash this out because equity and fairness plays a huge part in our role.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  If a decision is taken later that Irish Water payments would be refunded, should it take the form of a tax credit or direct payment?  My third question is whether the water conservation grant payment of &euro;100 per household last year be subtracted from the figure.</p></speech>

A range of policy issues have been raised by Deputy Butler that the committee must consider.  I will deal with some of the technical and financial issues around that.  As I mentioned earlier, the amount of funds collected was &euro;165 million.  There would clearly be some costs involved, transactionally, in refunding that.  Deputy Butler mentioned two options.  A tax credit would involve work for the Revenue Commissioners and a refund of bills would involve work for Irish Water in terms of raising cheques and contacting people.  Some funding would be required in either scenario.  In terms of making the refunds, obviously with the passage of time one has to contact customers, as people will have moved house and, sadly, others may have passed on.  There will be a range of issues involved in giving the money back.</p> <p>  In terms of tax credits, obviously there is not a link between Irish Water payments and the Revenue Commissioners at the moment so it would depend on whether that was a matter for individuals to show their bills and get a rebate through that system, because there is no linkage and there is no sharing of information.  The PPS numbers were destroyed.</p> <p>  The third issue that was raised related to the water conservation grant.  That was an entirely separate system that was run by the Department of Social Protection on our behalf.  We did get information transferred on people who were registered with Irish Water, namely, customers of Irish Water and non-customers of Irish Water, namely, people on group water schemes and with wells.  That customer information was transferred but there was no link between whether people had paid bills or not because the system did not recognise who the water supplier was.  That is a point of which the must be aware in terms of making refunds against the water conservation grant.</p><p>A proportion of the water conservation grant was paid to people who were not Irish Water customers in the first instance.  We do not have visibility on the people who received the grant, who were Irish Water customers, and whether they paid the bill or not. </p></speech>

For example, people aged 65 years or older do not pay tax and so a refund via tax credits would not work for them.</p></speech>

I would like to focus on the questions already posed in relation to refunds which fall to Ms Graham as the Department official although I would value the opinion of the other witnesses.  We know the cost of the collection of payments and set up of the system and so on.  If we were analysing ten years of receipts we would be having a different conversation, but we are only analysing receipts for one year or less.  The question that arises is what would be the cost of making refunds versus the amount collected, taking on board the pivotal and important need for equity and fairness.  If has been said that it will cost &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million to refund &euro;165 million.  I presume there would always be legacy issues.  There are also a lot of people who do not want the money back, I imagine.  I am one of those people.</p></speech>

I will be unique and I will be happy enough with that.  If refunding the money that was collected is going to cost us a huge amount surely we should be exploring every avenue.  One such avenue is credits on utilities as opposed to tax credits, which, again, would be a massive administrative task.  Given Ervia' s involvement in Irish Water and in other institutions that are in the business of providing services to householders across the country could it, in tandem with Revenue, be used as a vehicle for the delivery of credits through utility accounts and-or, as a last resort, a cash refund from Irish Water?  I would welcome the witnesses' view on that proposal.  I do not believe any one solution will work and so I think we need to broaden the view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017022200002#D01500"><p>It is reasonable for the committee to be engaged in examination of what would be the most cost-effective method of making refunds.  The data around the entire billing system, which is four bills per annum, indicates that take-in was &euro;20 million per annum.  I do not have the precise figure for the cost of issuing a single cheque in terms of refund but one would expect that to be considerably less of a transaction cost.  That is a matter that could perhaps be followed up with Irish Water.</p> <p>  As mentioned by Deputy Butler, not everybody is covered within the taxation system.  There may be a number of difficulties from a legal perspective in terms of transfers between the different utilities.  Ervia is a gas network company and not everybody has gas coverage and among the other utilities there is a broadly competitive environment.  I do not see the proposal in regard to Ervia as an option owing to its coverage of the population.  The data I have given to the committee, which we received from Irish Water, relates to amounts that people have paid.  Some people have paid all of their bills in full and others have paid smaller amounts such that a refund or credit could not be set at a particular amount.</p></speech>

I will be suggesting to the forum that it examine a menu of options that could be offered to each consumer, with the consumer opting in to their preferred option in terms of recovery.  In light of the conversation we have just had on this issue I realise it will be necessary for the forum to have an off-line conversation with the Department around what is feasible.  On the assumption that what I am saying is feasible, my preference would be that each person who has paid would be provided with a range of options in terms of refund, to include direct refund, credit against a future tax bill or credit towards a water saving initiative.  For instance, if the committee recommends the introduction of incentives for retro-fitting houses with water saving devices, etc., then households in respect of which water payments were made would immediately qualify for a grant plus what they had already paid for water charges.  There may be ways of doing that.</p> <p>  Given the level of contestation in this area over the past number of years, the ideal position must be that the individual householder who has paid be given a range of options and allowed to make the final call in terms of which option he or she prefers to avail of.</p></speech>

In terms of the blunt instrument that it is proposed to use in respect of those not subject to district metering and-or other measures, perhaps the committee needs to delve further into what is conservation and how we, as members of the Oireachtas, promote conservation.  There is a body of evidence that shows that conservation and a reduction in water usage occurs where water meters are installed.  I am sure the same would apply in respect of district metering.  I am not expert in that regard but I am sure somebody here will have a view on it.  The conservation method depends somewhat on the acceptable level of usage.</p><p>Therefore, achieving the happy medium or median level is very important.  I appreciate Professor Collins mentioning that.</p><p> We could talk about retrofitting, financial incentives from Irish Water and water audits, as the Department did in previous submissions, but I envisage a very significant change in building regulations, particularly as we ramp up housing delivery.  I refer not just to a paltry consideration of our national standards but to really dramatic changes.  All new houses have low-flow loos but the flow is not low enough.  I know many people who put bricks in their cisterns, which is totally appropriate.  We should consider this.  I would like the witnesses' view on it.</p><p> With regard to the Department's and witnesses' views on that type of change, to building regulations, for instance-----</p></speech>

It relates directly to fairness and equity for all consumers.  How broadly or finely does the rate have to be set in terms of overall domestic usage and national consumption rates as a result of the installation of meters?</p></speech>

We are better informed than we have been.  What is currently proposed seems to be fair and equitable.  Whether what is proposed should stay as it is for all its life is another question.  The metering process will continue so we will be better informed statistically.  We will have better equipment and better specifications in houses.  I do not regard this as a revenue-generating idea but as a water-conservation idea.  That is a key point.  People are overly focused on the economics, which I acknowledge is very important, but the engagement of local communities is also very important.  Education is equally important.</p> <p>  A complaint I hear from Irish Water is that there is fragmented infrastructure with 900 schemes and that the average number elsewhere is much lower.  The 900 schemes, however, present a great opportunity to talk to local communities.  Where I was born and reared, I know the lake from which the water comes, where it is treated and where it ends up.  It is a matter of getting the whole community engaged.</p> <p>  For the present, we have a figure.  I have not had an opportunity for research but, on the face of it, this matter should never be seen as a matter of revenue but as a matter of conservation.  That should be reviewed later in light of experience with grants.</p></speech>

It has to be retrospective, ascertaining the median use last year.  We now know what the median is.  My sense is that one might then add on a decile or two in percentage terms.  Obviously, there will be some variations.  Then there will be specific cases, such as those associated with medical need, and they will have to be addressed.  In the submission, I mentioned that the forum would happily get involved in that kind of process.  There would need to be an appeals procedure.  I have not figured out how one moves from individual consumption to household consumption.  I suspect there would need to be some form of self-declaration such that one could say that, as an individual, one was allocated a certain number of litres per day.  Of course, we are charged per household so one would have to identify one's household and the number of individuals therein.  That is an administrative complexity and I am not sure how we could fully get over it.</p></speech>

It works very well in other regimes.  There are just two points I would make on this.  Based on my recollection of previous engagements and what we have heard from the Commission, the test of compliance around an excess charge ought to be reasonable.  Therefore, it is a question of making a judgment on setting a threshold that could be considered reasonable in terms of a charge for excess consumption.  A point was made on how that might change over time and on whether it would be reviewed in time.  Water usage is dependent on water-saving devices and what the norms are.  The norms now may be entirely different than they were ten or 20 years ago.  The questions of reasonableness and changes over time might be considered as part of a test.</p></speech>

Professor Collins referred to tax credits.  There is a whole basket of sources of tax credits.  I brainstormed and came up with a mechanism, although I do not know whether it would work.  If one decided to have water bonds, people could get a water bond and be an owner of Irish Water.  They would get a portion commensurate with the amount of money they put it.  If they wanted to buy more, that would be great.</p></speech>

Somebody obviously had the same thoughts as Ms O'Brien.</p> <p>  I have a question on Professor Collins's point on vulnerable households and excess use, particularly for medical needs.  It also concerns the financial side.  If we had an excessive usage charge in place and if there were a vulnerable household that was not necessarily recognised as such, would there be a danger that what is being proposed might lead to an element of water poverty?  Right across the spectrum of users, can Mr. Wright see such a scenario arising?  There would have to be fairly robust self-declaration systems in place.  Problems can arise.  We could go down a road with our eyes wide open but come upon a problem, such as water poverty, after a period.</p></speech>

I have spoken to the Disability Federation of Ireland in this regard.  As long as there is a robust system of appeal and, in particular, registration and as long as decisions are made on a medical basis, one will pick up on a lot of the potential poverty issues.  At this point, not having seen the appeals process and robustness, I remain optimistic.</p></speech>

Irish Water has a list of priority customers and people identified as having critical dependency on water.  It is not just a matter of the charge but also a matter of a breakage in supply.  People who require kidney dialysis, for example, use huge volumes of water.  It is very easy to see the reason for their consumption as they are on health lists.  It is not as easy for those with other conditions.</p><p>If people were given notice that they were about to get an excessive charge it is likely to be due to a leak, a medical condition, their household size, or using too much water.  They should be given an opportunity to see what the reasons were and deal with them.</p></speech>

I am interested in the excessive use of water.  Scottish Water told us that they do not encounter excessive use or, specifically, wilful excessive use.  I wonder how one can charge for unintentional or unconscious excessive use.  If there are still so many leaks in the system much of the excessive use could be down to those leaks until they are identified.  One would not be able to identify excessive use in apartment complexes, which means that one would end up penalising one part of the population.  Some statistics in the commission's report showed that water usage per head in Ireland is quite low by international standards, which is an important point.  Excessive use, meanwhile, is tiny at 6%.  Yet we are focusing on all these measures.  </p> <p>  I think the Public Water Forum is out of touch.  I am glad that Professor Collins's last point was about trying to reach into the community to see what issues individuals face.  The obvious ones are medical and the use of swimming pools, which are easy to identify.  One just has to knock on doors.  One of the points that arose for me concerning household charges, was that thousands of grandparents now provide full-time preschool care for their grandchildren.  In the middle of the furore, older people asked me if they would still be able to look after their grandchildren due to household charges.  There are so many variables in this matter. </p> <p>  The original proposal contained an allowance for children but no allowance for over-18s.  We are getting into a complicated area given the number of over-18s, and even over-25s, living at home with their parents.  God knows how long it would take to analyse the extent of this, but I would like the witnesses to comment on that.</p> <p>  What is the estimated cost of pursuing non-payment and has that bill been considered?  What information is available on the per household subsidisation of water supplies for group water schemes?</p></speech>

I have therefore been looking at a lot of incentives which are in place, including getting grants for better washing machines and other water-saving measures in the house.  People will not invest in those, however.  One cannot just get a carrot, although possibly a carrot and a stick.  This is me speaking personally.  I am not saying that one is being charged for everything, but if one is not being charged for excessive use there is no incentive for people to fix leaks.</p></speech>

The Public Water Forum believes that every citizen should have a free entitlement to a water allowance.  That includes teenagers as well as younger children.  We believe every citizen has that entitlement, but we also believe that comes with a civic responsibility, especially for a resource like water.  As Mr. Wright has pointed out, we do not see the excessive use charge as a revenue-generating one.  We see it as an incentive to conserve.  We also see it as an incentive for the individual citizen to take responsibility for what happens between the water meter and their house.  If there is not an incentive for the householder to walk their land and assess whether there is a leakage problem, the likelihood is that it will not happen.</p> <p>  The Public Water Forum considered this recommendation of the commission and found it was in support of it purely on the conservation argument.  It was also based on building citizen responsibility, recognising that there are citizen rights, but with those rights go duties.  Part of the duty is that this is a scarce and vulnerable resource and so there is a duty on the individual householder to protect it.  If there was a run on a privately-owned resource in a house, which the householder was not supervising - such as their credit card, for example - we would expect them to supervise, measure and manage it, and act accordingly.  The same expectation applies here.  That is how the Public Water Forum has considered the issue and arrived at a view on it.  </p> <p>  I recognise that there are big transactional charges and cost recovery charges in all of this.  Ultimately, the revenue and conservation questions almost become two separate discussions.  The decision on whether to finish the metering process strikes me as a big one.  There is a big recommendation confronting this committee in that regard.  If one had never started out on the metering project, one might say that the returns on this do not necessarily add up.  Having started on it, however, there is another question, which is: "Do you render as void all of the investment we've made to date, if we don't complete it?"  Those are the kinds of choices the committee is faced with, but they are not easy calls.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-22a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017022200002#F01200"><p>There are a couple of questions I wish to address without commenting on the policy issues which the committee is examining.  Deputy Lahart talked about the experience of Scotland versus Ireland.  One of the things that people have commented on is the rich information we have obtained from consumption data to understand what our level of usage is.  One of those factors is that a very small proportion of people are using a huge amount of water.  Whatever way one tackles that it is an issue in the long run for a system in terms of operational costs and capital investment.  That is because one would be seeking in some way to try to eliminate that, whatever mechanism is used.  It is important to understand that it is not a normal bell curve.  In combination with other measures, there are huge outliers to be addressed in terms of leakage.</p><p>Specifically, the question was about collection charges.  The collection of outstanding bills is something that was originally built into the operational costs in Irish Water's business plan so I do not have a disaggregated figure, and in the event of a return to a charging regime I am not sure whether there would be any additional costs arising, but that is something that might more appropriately be asked of Irish Water.  My understanding is that in the normal course the regulator would look at Irish Water's operational costs, which would include collection of charges.</p><p> In the group water sector, as members are aware, there are two types of group water schemes.  There are those who get their water from a public source and those who get it from a private source.  The subsidy system recognises that.  There are two levels of subsidy.  The base subsidy is currently &euro;70 per household for a connection using a public source and &euro;140 for a connection using a private source.  Additionally, a number of those on private sources have design, build, operate, DBO, contracts which are more expensive and they get a top-up of up to &euro;220 per household.  Those levels were in place before domestic water charges were introduced.  They were reduced when the water charges came in and they have been restored.</p><p> In dealing with the group water sector, we have been very conscious to set out principles around fair treatment, but recognising that there is an inherent difference in structure.  They have their own particular cost structures.  For example, that is why we were giving them extra money for DBOs.  We were also conscious of the need to have a very simple arrangement for them because one is talking about a multiplicity of group water schemes, organised very much on a co-operative basis so they would want to have low administrative costs.  Because they are co-operatives, they do not want to gather a lot of personal information about their members so they tend to deal with things at a household level.  Those kinds of issues would have been factored in to the way we approached them.  In terms of equity and fairness, sometimes it is around the outcomes not necessarily doing the same for all people.  That is why we set out principles to achieve the same outcomes for the group water sector.  The sector obviously gets capital grants as well and that reduces the costs.  That includes not only things to improve quality but also metering, which reduces costs, water conservation and source protection and a range of other things to assist the sector.</p></speech>

The capital programme is approximately &euro;17 million.  That just reflects where we are at.  It is a multi-annual programme.  In the past it has been as high as &euro;100 million.  We spent close to &euro;1 billion on rural water programmes since the early 2000s.  There was a huge quality deficit and that is when the big DBO schemes came in.  Most of them are in place and it is a case of more targeted intervention at this stage.</p></speech>

There seems to be an ideology at play within the committee that one can only appreciate something if one pays for it.  That is the crux of the problem.  Merrion Square is a lovely park.  I appreciate it, but one could ask whether we should pay to go into it.  That is the logical conclusion of what we are saying, namely, that one cannot appreciate it unless we are paying for it.</p> <p>  If there is a leak in a house the risk of it undermining the foundations should be enough of an incentive for people to fix it, if it is identified and they are notified there is a problem.  In terms of equity and fairness in the excessive use charge, it is accepted that there is practically no wilful misuse of water so therefore it is about identifying leaks.  The question is whether we want to identify revenue that we can get through excessive use charges or if we want to identify the leaks and have them repaired and reduce water consumption that way.  On that basis, could the Public Water Forum also consider the provisions under section 56 of the 2007 Act, which make it an offence to waste water?  The fact that one could be taken to court and fined for the wilful waste of water is probably enough of an incentive to stop the wasting of water.  That is where the focus should be in terms of water conservation.  We already have the provisions under the 2007 Act.  From the discussions today it appears we are considering creating a significant bureaucratic system to identify excessive use and then monitoring it and changing it.  The one useful thing meters which have already been installed is that each one has a wastewater alarm on it and if a leak is detected section 56 could kick in as the person wasting the water would be identified.</p> <p>  It does not make sense to consider how we can fairly charge 880,000 houses for excessive use and not charge 630,000 houses.  We must knock that on the head.  In terms of the repayment of people who have paid already, we have no choice in that regard.  We have to do that.  If one goes down the road of excessive use then one has to go through all of those people and see who among the ones who have paid was excessive in his or her use.  It does not make any sense.  I have not asked any questions but I will come to them now.</p></speech>

I am not talking about previous speakers, unfortunately, I am talking about the witnesses and their ideology.</p> <p>  Under the 2007 Act the system allows for people who are wilfully wasting water to be identified and targeted.  We can use the meters that are already in place for that purpose.  Through district metering, individual households that are wasting water can be identified as well.  We must examine whether that would achieve the conservation measures in the way an excessive use charge would work.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the group water schemes and subsidies.  The subsidy figures outlined by Ms Graham do not include the contribution members of group water schemes are already paying to the scheme.  In terms of fairness and equity, that would have to be taken into account as well.  Would a system whereby each scheme would have to engage with CER in terms of agreeing a pricing policy and for that to be then repaid through general taxation, be workable?</p></speech>

Whether people have gone to court or not is not the issue.  Perhaps the implementation of the section needs to be streamlined and adjusted to ensure it is effective.</p></speech>

There must be some sort of nudge to get people to do it.  In the case of a running toilet or if one's cistern is not working that does not affect one's foundation but it involves a constant stream of water going down the drain.  I can see that measure working.  It could be put in place instead of money for conservation.  I would like to see how that would work in terms of the cost of cases involving solicitors and barristers and the courts system.  I do not know whether that would clog up the courts.  I am not sure how it would function but a streamlined version of it might be an effective way to encourage people to fix the leak or a running toilet.</p></speech>

If we are talking about a conservation charge the amount could be very little.  The tax on plastic bags is a great example of how behaviour was impacted by a very small charge because it made people aware of what they were doing and they responded to it.</p><p>The conservation charge should not be approached as a volumetric charge.  As has been pointed out it is a conservation charge rather than a revenue generator.  It is quite possible that information to the householder or user might do it instead of a charge, provided they have a way of knowing how much water he or she has used and how much is used normally.  I see that kind of information as fundamental to making decisions about a key resource.  I am aware that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is developing models of mapping for farmers on nitrate load in their soil at the moment so that each farmer can look at a map of their farm and establish what the levels of nitrates are on their holding.  This kind of information is fundamental to management.  </p><p> Whether there is a cost or not is almost a secondary issue.  There is a conservation demand and a revenue generation demand.  I have no idea how the revenue generation requirement for the investment costs of Irish Water are going to be met.  I do not have the expertise to comment on it and I do not know where it is going to come from.  I certainly see a value in the excessive usage charge, even if it is nothing other than a wake up call to householders.  It could be minimal.  I do not know how I can work or make decisions in the absence of information. </p></speech>

If I thought people complied with laws and regulations and were not being taken to court we would have the best drivers in Europe driving on our roads and behaving themselves.  In reality that has to be there, because it will have zero impact on a certain number of people no matter what one says or how often it is said.  That process is there.  The vast majority of people respond when they understand what is coming in, what average use is and understand their role.  I want to go a step further and help them understand the source of that water and what is happening on the lands around the water, and to understand that we are taking treated water and putting it into a sewerage system to be treated again, and that that costs more than the original production.  There is a huge educational task to undertake.  I am very clear that there must be an incentive.  The thrust should be on engagement, involvement at a community level and the education that goes with it.  The meter does help that education process.  I know that Ms Linnane has things to say about water protection as well.</p></speech>

We have to look at protection of waterways as well, because it is a holistic approach.  There is no point in conserving our water if we are not protecting it in the first place.  In terms of education that is where we should start.  We are going from source right to tap at any given time.  I have been involved in a large number of projects that have looked at community engagement from the outset and it is really effective.  When there is real scientific data behind that and communities are brought along with that, the behavioural change can really make a difference.</p> <p>  If we had real time mobile apps where people can actually see their water usage at any given time and know what they should be using, that might be a simple technology accessible to everybody.  There are a lot of ways we can look at it, but it has to be source to tap and very much holistic, and always engaging the community as we go.  </p></speech>

He is correct - charges are set by each individual group water scheme.  The charges people face or the degree to which the subsidy covers the domestic may vary from scheme to scheme because of the different types of usage, particularly farm usage and other usage in the rural environment.  The subsidies that were agreed back in 1997 with the group water sector, against the background of there being no domestic charges, were the level of subsidies they were satisfied with, and we agreed the principles.  From looking at previous meetings I think that perhaps the federation have undertaken to give some information beyond what the charges are.  They are quite varied.  There would be a huge issue around the regulation of that sector.  The figures I gave include that in 2015 some 700 individual schemes looked for subsidies.  Somewhere around 350 of those are schemes covered by drinking water, meaning that there are 50 or more people involved.  Some of these group schemes are very small and some are large, and they all face very different cost structures which they have been happy to deal with in an independent way to date.  We have had no requests from the sector to change that overall regulatory process.</p></speech>

Ms Linnane spoke about a mobile app to gauge usage and that it would be accessible to everyone.  I am not so sure that it would be, because having a smart phone is a privilege at the moment and not many people can afford to have that.</p> <p>  The medical need issue was brought up and we spoke about a robust appeals process, but people who are in the situation where they have a medical need and who are fighting the system to try to get medical cards and other supports do not need to engage in another process to get something as vital as water supplied to them.  I would have particular concerns about that.  </p> <p>  To echo some comments made by my colleague, Deputy Lahart, in relation to grandparents providing child care, that is something that I encounter quite a bit on the doors and pensioners were terrified that they would have to start turning away two, three or four grandchildren that they are looking after on a daily basis to help their struggling sons and daughters out.

A comprehensive education campaign could go right through the school system.  It could be curriculum based, and in that context there could be some very interesting conversations with the primary and second level school system in syllabuses like geography and science, for instance.  It always strikes me as bizarre, coming from the world of education, that children study geography with almost no reference to local rivers or local streams or local waterways.</p><p>There is a wide public education dimension to it outside the school system, but there is also a personal information element.  I am not suggesting that people are not hugely animated by and concerned about this issue, but decision-making can be enabled with good quality information at a personal level.  The points that were made about grandparents and child-rearing is new information for me.  It is so interesting.  This kind of information needs to be captured and put into the public domain. </p><p> The education question is related to the consultation question.  At the moment, river basin management plans are being published and there is enormous stakeholder interest in what that will mean for the agriculture, farming and ICT industries.  Therefore this debate is much wider than just the domestic side of the equation.</p><p> The Public Water Forum has representation from sectors such as tourism, which is a huge user of water, but is also reliant on a pristine water system.  We also have rural groups on the forum, including the food industry which is equally reliant and becoming increasingly more conscious of water as a critical input in that industry.  Therefore this is a national debate.  The education and information process needs to work with all these multiple sectors in different ways so that there can be a national process of reflection.  </p><p> If the issue of water charges had been addressed after the issue of a public debate on water, it might not have been as contentious as it proved to be.</p></speech>

We are trying to focus on public engagement in terms of river basin management plans, including reaching out to communities by examining things from a catchment perspective rather than simply at the tap.  One of the things that has been established is a local authority water and communities office with a view to having specialist support officers and community water officers to deal with this broader water issue, as well as working with the Public Water Forum and other bodies to establish a stakeholder forum which would be more national.  It would look not only at Irish Water issues and rural water issues but also wider river basin issues.</p> <p>  The point was made that this is all about protecting water as a resource from beginning to end in that cycle.  There is quite a lot to be rolled out in the near term in that engagement process and the forum has been integral to moving that agenda on.</p></speech>

While it was a great start, there are only three co-ordinators and 12 people working on the ground.  Significant resources are needed to deliver effective community engagement and education packages, particularly if one wants to sustain it over the long term.  We need to be aware of that and have it built into any programme.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their answers so far.  I have three questions.  First, I wish to follow up on the Senator's question about the cost of pursual versus the cost of refunds.  Clearly, that would not have been included in the original Irish Water business plan because nobody would have expected us to end up where we are.  Has the Department started establishing costs?  Are there discussions between the Department and Irish Water to establish those costs?  Clearly, if a committee such as ours was neutral on the substantive issues and was trying to decide on refunds versus pursuals, that kind of financial information would be pretty important to us in at least determining which was more cost-effective.</p> <p>  I have asked the second question before but I am still none the clearer.  Group water schemes receive an annual subsidy but that does not cover the full annual cost of accessing the water supply.  Therefore if the expert group's recommendations that ordinary household use for those people connected to the water supply who are currently customers of Irish Water do not pay an annual charge for accessing that supply, equity would mean that the State would cover the full annual cost of group water scheme users accessing that water supply.  That would be obvious.  I have asked via parliamentary questions if we know what that cost would be.  We know the annual subvention cost is around &euro;24 million, but does the Department have figures for the total cost of those group water schemes?  I know they can vary from scheme to scheme.  What is the distribution concerning the three different grant levels of &euro;90, &euro;140 and &euro;220?  It would be useful to have that information when we are in private session next week making some of these deliberations. </p> <p>  My last question is related to equity but it is not in the expert group's recommendations.  It concerns the issue of water poverty.  We heard from Welsh Water that they have significant levels of water poverty.  Officials figures show that 15% of households live in fuel poverty across the State, but in counties with a higher percentage of older people it goes up to about 19%, for example, in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  We are not at the top end of EU fuel poverty but we are above average.  </p> <p>  What is disturbing about our fuel poverty figures is that we have one of the highest levels of what they unfortunately call "excess winter deaths".  About 2,800 predominantly old people are affected and research shows that there is a clear link between both.  In all this conversation about charging, given how poorly the State has responded to the issue of fuel poverty and the fact that we know it costs lives, does the Public Water Forum have any confidence in the State's ability to deal with water poverty when the Government's own figures clearly tell us that they are not doing a good job in dealing with fuel poverty?</p></speech>

Fuel poverty has been squeezed between the starting and closing dates, the allowance and qualifications, but nobody took it away.  It just grew.  One is dealing with something exceptional here.  We are saying that there is a citizens' entitlement which is for everybody.  It is relatively well defined and the leaks side of it has a significant impact on that.</p> <p>  I would be the first to join in any nervousness because I am not happy with how the fuel poverty scheme is operating or how poverty is being managed generally, including for the low-waged in Ireland.  I am not standing on that soap-box today, however.</p> <p>  Because we are looking at it as a citizens' entitlement and because we have some statistical data, from the forum's viewpoint - unless my members tell me otherwise - I have relative confidence in what is being proposed here.  That is really all I can say.</p></speech>

We have some information on groups which receive capital grants.  We do not have an overall perspective on these costs for the sector.  We did some work on a survey with the federation when we were looking at reducing the charges.  It surveyed a number of its sector members.  Based on that pre-January 2014 survey, the average charge for people on the public source group water schemes was &euro;38.79.  I give this figure with caution because I do not know whether farm or other usage was included.  The private source was &euro;60.50 and the average cost of all schemes based on an average household size of 2.7 was &euro;52.88.  This was in the context of reducing the subsidy.  When we reduced the subsidy it brought the average to &euro;92.29, which was broadly where the average charge from Irish Water would be because these are water only charges.  This is why we were trying to get to an equitable position.</p> <p>  I recognise the Deputy has asked a number of parliamentary questions on this issue.  In any of the discussions the only figure we can give is with regard to the subsidy from this perspective.  The point I made earlier was we have had a relationship for a period of time with the group water sector with regard to funding it.  This has included times where there were charges and no charges.  This is the regime it has been happy and satisfied with.  When there were no domestic charges this was the subsidy regime.  Clearly, the subsidies must be kept under review in light of the costs being faced, but we have not had a demand for a significant revision in the subsidy.  In fact, most of the demand has been on the multiannual capital programme, and the inclusion of issues such as source protection, water conservation and such issues, the rationalisation of schemes to give them a better cost structure, the appointment of quality officers and a number of softer measures with regard to involving professionals.  These are the areas of funding they have tended to examine.  I suggest it needs to be examined in the round.</p></speech>

Clearly this is not a hard fact.  It would be very useful if it were possible to have an indicative figure for our private deliberations next week.  What is the ballpark figure for a 100% subsidy?  While there has not been a demand for group water schemes until now, part of this is because group water schemes have seen the introduction of water charges.  If water charges for the vast majority of public water service users are abolished and the expert group's recommendations are accepted in the round and it becomes Government policy it will mean the vast majority of households will not pay a metered domestic charge on an annual basis.  We then need to know if we were to translate this situation to members of group water schemes what would it cost.  On the basis of Ms Graham's figures it would come in at approximately &euro;4.9 million, but this is as speculative as the averages.</p></speech>

Several interesting points arose in the work.  There was not a cohort of people potentially facing water poverty who were the same as an existing cohort of people in the social protection system.  For instance, the fuel allowance people would not be the same as people who potentially would face water poverty.  Water poverty tends to be looked at as water charges being more than 3% to 5% of income.  The outcome of the work done by an interdepartmental group which included the Department and the Department of Social Protection was in the context of developing a free allowance, in the sense that if a universal free allowance was set at a percentage it would ensure people were not brought into this category.  The charges as they are, compared to average industrial income, are less than 1%.  These tests have been done.</p></speech>

I was involved in a debate in the Seanad.  I also apologise if some of my questions have already been answered.  I ask the Chairman to direct me on this and I will read the transcript later.</p> <p>  With regard to the expert commission's report to the committee for consideration, there must be equity between group water scheme members and rural dwellers versus public water users, and we must deal fairly with those who complied with the law and paid their water bills in the past so they are treated no less favourably than those who did not.  These are the two key points on which the committee must focus.  With this in mind, and following on from what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said on group schemes, I contended it has never been fair because they have always paid.  They have always contributed to the supply of water through individual group schemes or through private wells and sewage treatment plants.  We have been given a bigger task because we are being asked to ensure whatever we recommend is fair to those and to public users.  Following what Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, this brings a heightened expectation from those on group schemes as they will expect equal subsidy and support as those on public water supplies.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on what it costs group water schemes, to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin has referred.  We will need this information if they are to be treated equitably with those on public water supplies.</p> <p>  Something that has been lost in our debate is the environmental aspect of the sustainability of water supplies.  The EPA referred to it briefly in its contribution when it appeared before the committee.  In its submission to us on 30 January, the EPA discussed equity and fairness.  It stated the quality of drinking water in public supplies is consistently better than has been found in private supplies.  This is a fact quoted by the EPA and taken from its annual drinking water report.  Automatically, there is now an expectation that we need to recommend a system that is equitable to private and group schemes because they have a legitimate expectation their quality should be the same as those on public schemes.</p> <p>  Committee members will know from parliamentary questions that grants to support and subsidise group water schemes are subject to availability in the Estimates.  They have often been far less than what was applied for.  If we are being realistic about being equitable and fair we need to hear from the Department that grants applied for will now be fully funded and that there cannot be shortages.</p><p>Am I right in that assertion?  If so, what type of capital provision are we talking about in our Estimates?  Otherwise, it is not realistic and I believe it is unfair to expect equity and to raise expectation as is the case currently.</p><p> To refer to what Deputy's Pringle said earlier about appreciation, I think we all appreciate public infrastructure.  However, the fundamental issue here is that somebody must pay for that infrastructure, whether it is a public park, a roadway, a light or water provision.  It is either the taxpayer or the user or a combination of both.  Somebody has to pay for it and I think we all appreciate that.</p><p> My second point relates to the issue of fairness and people who have either paid their existing water bills and complied with the law in the past versus those who have not.  I know that views have been expressed and I have missed some of the discussion.  However, if we are going to have equality and fairness, it is one or the other.  Either we pursue payment from those who have not paid or we reimburse those who have paid.  In the view of the Public Water Forum, how best should we achieve this fairness?  Should we do one or the other?  Obviously, we have to do one or other.  I would like to hear the view of the Public Water Forum on that.</p><p> It is generally accepted now, from listening to various contributors over previous meetings, that there should be a charge for excessive use.  Even Right2Water accepted that yesterday and is on the record as having done so.  How can this be fairly achieved unless we install meters?  How can we fairly implement a charge for excessive use unless we have meters?  Is it possible at all?  Unless there is a fundamental acceptance that meters are necessary to measure where excessive use comes in, I believe that it might not be possible.  I would like to hear the views of the Public Water Forum on that.  I hope I have not been too convoluted.  I have mentioned two areas: group schemes and the people who have paid their existing bills.  How do we treat both of those and manage the expectation that is out there in the public domain, given the task that this committee has?</p></speech>

I will say two things about the group schemes.  At a personal level, I am a member of a group scheme and I also chaired the national rural water monitoring committee for ten years.  I believe it is important to think about the group scheme sector as an entity that is different in itself.  It is owned by the members.  It is a co-op.  One might argue that as a co-op, it is placed in slightly existentially different position than those who take their supply from the public scheme.  As a member of a group scheme myself, if I was selling my house in the countryside in the morning, there would be additional charges for supplying water to the countryside.  There are distance issues and isolation issues.  Usually, the State covers those charges, such as with the postal system.  Just because I am further away from the GPO than those in Dublin does not mean I pay more for my stamps.  One could argue therefore that I should not pay more for my water just because I am in the countryside.</p></speech>

One might argue that fairness means that if one's supply costs more, maybe there should be some reflection of that in the cost to the user.  In my connections and in my involvement with the group scheme sector - I say this making very clear that I am not speaking for the sector - within the forum, we have had very little pressure of any sort come to bear to change the existing situation as it impacts on the group scheme.  However, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has pointed out, if water charges will be free for everybody and are not free for a sizeable minority - the last figure I saw was that there are 500,000 members of group schemes - it is going to be very difficult to explain on the grounds of fairness, even if there are additional charges and the group schemes are that bit different.  As a member of a group scheme, I have a sense that I own it.  I can impact on its decision-making and attend meetings, but I do not own it in the sense that I do not have private shares that I can sell.  I still think it is a model that I am a very strong advocate for in terms of environmental management, in terms of people literally taking ownership for what is happening in their immediate environment and in terms of people having a very strong vested interest in how their scheme is managed.  Was there one other question raised by the Senator that I have missed?</p></speech>

In terms of the issue of capital that Senator Coffey raised, all capital is always subject to the amount received which is prioritised.  The investment in the rural water programme initially came from an adverse ruling of the European Court of Justice on drinking water compliance.  We had a programme of over 700, schemes which Dr. Collins mentioned he was involved in bringing up to scratch through various methods.  In our capital programmes, that is where the priority was for a number of years.  The funding was put in place and those schemes have by and large all been done at this stage.</p> <p>  We then moved into a multi-annual rural water programme approach.  With the Chairman's forbearance, I will state what the components of that funding are.  The first measure is about public health compliance in the group water sector.  We see it as really critical for the group water sector to sustain the water quality improvements we have made and really to deal with the deficits there.  Particularly within that, we have developed a remedial action list similar to the approach of the EPA to Irish Water in identifying those schemes that are risks and providing funding for them.  This will also include group water schemes that are on the list of a pilot infringement on trihalamethanes in the water.  That is the first measure and that is where most of the money goes.</p> <p>  The second measure is about enhancing existing schemes and making them more efficient in their operation.  I mentioned this before.  It involves water conservation, network upgrades and source protection.  That is around protecting the investment of close to &euro;1 billion that we have already put in.  The next measure is rural development, which is about supporting social and economic development in rural towns and villages by providing new group schemes where private wells are not an option.  That is probably the area that has been constrained.  It may be one of the areas in which the Senator and his colleagues have been anxious to see schemes advancing, though they have not seen it as quality has been higher up the agenda.  The fourth measure is about the transition of schemes to the public water and waste water sector.  Either because the scheme members want it or because of public health issues, this is where the best option in the long term is for the scheme to move under the remit of Irish Water.  Usually, investment is required to do that.</p> <p>  The fifth measure is around innovation and research.  That is particularly looking at efficient and innovative measures to improve the rural water area.  In the past, that has included things like integrated wetlands and solutions that may be more suitable for the rural environment.</p><p>The final measure is individual wells and we give grants for on-site wells and septic tanks.  In our change to the multi-annual programme, one of our initiatives was to bring in an expert panel of three people who review the bids from local authorities to ensure that they are done in an evidenced-based way and that they meet those priorities.</p><p> While extra funding can go in, it is important that we have a clear mechanism for deciding it and these are the measures that have been agreed with the federation.  We have been sustaining the funding at around &euro;17 million for the moment but it would have peaked at perhaps &euro;130 million - &euro;100 million anyway - when we would have had large design, build, operate, DBO, projects.  Obviously, we would be anxious to ensure that the investment continues in that respect.</p></speech>

To quote the expert commission report, whose recommendations we are now considering:</p><blockquote>The Expert Commission recommends that this be reviewed [that is, the public versus the group schemes] when the allowances for consumers on public supplies are determined [and I presume they will be at some stage by us as a committee] and that equity for group schemes and private wells be maintained through additional subsidy or other means.</blockquote> <p>What Ms Graham has outlined to us is what existing subsidies and estimates have provided for.  She outlined some of it in her answer, but my question is whether she foresees an enhanced grant scheme, for example, for private wells and sewerage schemes as a result of the recommendation from the expert commission and possibly as a result of what this committee may recommend.  Is the Department working towards this in its Estimates preparation?  Ms Graham has already outlined that &euro;17 million is what is normally provided for.  This will obviously create a much greater demand and expectation.  We need to hear if that type of preparation is being implemented in the Department.  We are due to report in a few weeks and I think it is very likely to have an impact.</p></speech>

While there is an overall allocation, this is worked on a per household grant basis.  There is a household limit to the different types of funding.  The number of these were increased and a number of new forms of support were brought in last year.  We are examining the grant for private wells in the context of the confidence and supply agreement, which suggests that we should revise the grant levels there as well.  This is under way and we will take account of it.</p></speech>

I would like to run through a couple of direct issues and get some confirmation on them.  My understanding is that there is no real risk of water poverty being created if we move to a generous allowance-based system of payment for water.  This is because there would be an allowance, which would be paid for, that would cover everyone's water requirements.  Such a system would create a zero rate possibility of water poverty.</p> <p>  I appreciate that the witness gave an answer on this matter, but my understanding is that the 2014 system, because of the safeguards in it, effectively ensured that there was no real risk of water poverty.  Will the witness confirm that to be the case?</p> <p>  I appreciate what Senator Coffey said in terms of group water schemes, but I am particularly interested in one aspect.  Professor Collins alluded to being a member of one himself.  In this perhaps political one-upmanship when it comes to group water schemes, there is a real risk that we - God forgive me for using the expression - throw the baby out with the bath water and that we lose an inherent value of group water schemes, which is the way they work within a community and provide a service.  My understanding from the conversations I have had with some of their members is that they would be very adverse to the notion of what would amount to a State takeover and a loss of the ethos, control and way in which a group water scheme works within a community.  We should be cognisant of that when addressing the group water scheme issue.</p> <p>  I want to go back to one key aspect on the conservation issue and I appreciate that the question was probably answered.  I do not know what type of utopian world some people live in, but in the real world, which most of us inhabit, all the conservation notices, educational programmes and carrots, as I think they were referred to earlier on, in the world will not alter behaviour to the same extent that a very good and effective stick will.  I would ask those who believe in the virtue of Merrion Square to think about it.  If there was a sign around the no parking zones in Merrion Square that asked us to please give up the spot in two hours and let someone else use it because parking spots are scarce, how many people do we think would voluntarily pull their car out after two hours and head off?  As one of those who remembers living in this city prior to clamping, I can assure the committee that those spots would be gone at 8 a.m. and that they would not be back.  I would very much share the view which was outlined that it would be insanity not to have some enforcement.</p> <p>  On the notion that we could end up using the 2007 Act to fine people as an efficient means of trying to persuade them to conserve water, we are all aware of the absolutely calamitous situation we have with issuing fines in this country and trying to get people to pay them.  Given the cost involved and the ability to appeal a fine for excessive water usage, possibly to the Supreme Court, to me this would be an insane system for this committee to consider.  I hope that we would be guided by some of the advice provided in that regard.  </p> <p>  At the heart of it, the witness seems to be siding very much with the commission's report in terms of its recommendation for the usage in this area.  Will the witness confirm that to be so?  I heard him say he would take it on board, so I reassure Dr. Collins that the biggest thing the grandparents of Ireland who are minding children have complained to me about over the past five or six years is the fact that someone destroyed the economy of our country, that they are delighted to have the children in the house and minding them and that their own children are out working.</p></speech>

I was giving averages in terms of the average charge as compared to average income.  On the work that was undertaken and in terms of targeting the group, I was indicating that a universal pre-allowance for households, if it was at a sufficient level, was likely to mean that water poverty would not be an issue.  If there is an excess charge, some of the other components which would have been considered included the presumption that something would be done for those who had a high medical usage.  That would be factored in so that it is addressed.</p></speech>

It is probably useful to remind the committee that the concept of the subsidy to the group scheme was introduced in the 1990s and coincided with the abolition of water charges at that time.  Its introduction was triggered by the fact that households that had paid water charges prior to then were no longer paying them.  It is therefore reasonable to expect that the group sector will have a view should the final determination of the matter be that their members will pay and others will not.  I suspect that will be a difficult argument to hold.</p> <p>  As I stated, the ethos of self-management around a key resource is an important ethos to protect.  I would also say that it is key to conservation.  It is self-management and self-regulation and this probably could be applied in some other areas around conservation.</p><p>Information on conservation is the first step.  It is a necessary condition for conservation, though it might not be sufficient.  Unlike a parking meter, people believe that if water is leaking on their property it is not depriving another user of water.  It is seen as a non-rivalrous product.</p></speech>

If a person is using the parking meter, they are denying another user.  The question on the public park is a very interesting one.  Is one, by using a public park, denying access to somebody else to that park?  Because one is not, it is a non-rivalrous good.</p></speech>

Excessive usage can be deliberate.  A swimming pool could be considered wasteful, possibly wilfully so.  We need to find a way of building personal responsibility for the use of the resource.  This should not be seen as a revenue-generating exercise.  There are issues on whether the return on investment justifies the investment.  I am a member of a group water scheme.  In the late 1990s that scheme was broke.  It had been charging a flat rate to its members.  Group water schemes include domestic users and non-domestic users such as farmers.  When that scheme moved to meter-based charging, in one year usage was reduced from 18 million gallons to 11 million gallons.  This was not entirely due to conservation.  Farmers sank their own wells.  The question of equity for different users is more complicated than just giving everybody the same amount.  Those with private wells can supply their household, business and many other things.</p></speech>

The witness may envisage an excessive usage charge that is about conservation as opposed to revenue-raising, and may possibly lose money.  However, such an excessive usage charge could be a Trojan horse for broader charges.  There could be pressure to raise revenue, reduce allowances and increase prices.  What is originally introduced as a conservation measure could become a revenue-raising measure over time.  Something similar happened with bin charges.  At present, 51% of revenue due from water charges remains outstanding, a sum of &euro;173.76 million.  Probably the majority of people have paid only some of their bills.  Does the Department have an estimate of how many people have water charges outstanding?  Presumably it is in excess of 51%.  It could be as high as 75%.</p></speech>

The forum has not considered whether a water meter should be installed in every new house, but I anticipate that the forum would approve of such a measure.  It is good management of a scarce resource.  There will always be the potential, once a resource can be measured, that it can be charged for.</p></speech>
