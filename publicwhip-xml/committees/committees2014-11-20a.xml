Agreed.</p><p>  We will deal with correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday, 6 November 2014.  No. 3A is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  We have received correspondence from Mr. Tom O'Malley, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, regarding a briefing on the development of greenways.  The correspondence is to be noted, published and forwarded to Mr. Liam O'Malley and Mr. Michael Murphy.  </p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 6 November 2014, from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection on the insurability of employment and the insurability of couriers.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 11 November 2014, from Mr. Denis Leamy, chief executive of Pobal, regarding the national child care investment programme 2006-10.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence, dated 12 November 2014, received from Mr. John Tracey, chief executive of the Irish Sports Council, regarding a follow-up on correspondence received.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  Part of it relates to Millstreet.  We will write to ask that we be kept informed between now and the end of the year of progress made on the issue.</p><p>  The next item of correspondence is dated 4 November 2014 from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald regarding Amnesty International.  The correspondence is to be noted.  The clerk will prepare a note on the matter and forward it to members.  </p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 3 November 2014, received from Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Callaghan, Cork County Council, on including Irish Water within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This is a policy matter which we will refer to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We had agreed that we would discuss the set-up costs met directly from the Exchequer.  This can be done in the context of the Accounting Officers appearing before the committee in due course.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 10 November 2014, from Mr. John Wolfe regarding a fraud complaint related to a former Taoiseach not being properly investigated.  The correspondence is to be noted.  My understanding is that the matter was investigated and that the terms and conditions associated with the allowance were matters for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I understand there is also a note on the matter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 12 November 2014, received from the HSE on the possible misuse of public moneys at Positive Action.  The correspondence is to be noted.</p></speech>

That is what we were told last week.</p></speech>

The correspondence is to be noted.  Direct payments by the university to a subcontractor are not a matter for us to consider.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The university is effectively repeating the line that it can avoid this issue because of the contract.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-20a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014112000003#O01200"><p>That is effectively it.  I am unsure what we can do.  We will have representatives of the Higher Education Authority before the committee in January.  We might examine the matter then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014112000003#O01300"><p>We could probably bring it up then.  We could give representatives of the HEA notice of the issue to be discussed when they come in January.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-20a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014112000003#O01400"><p>Technically, under regulations and legislatively, there may not be an onus on UCC to pay the subcontractor in this case.  It is, however, a question of fairness.  It is a question of a large entity knowing that works were carried out well and that given amounts of money are owed, yet it has effectively ignored this on the basis of the contract drawn up.  It is fair enough that there is a legal issue involved.  We should, however, put UCC on notice that the matter will certainly come up for discussion.  I asked about the legislation on subcontractors which I understand has not yet been enacted.  Is it in any way relevant to this case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-20a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014112000003#O01500"><p>We will check with the sponsoring Department and obtain a note on the matter.  That is probably the best thing to do.  I am not aware of the subcontractors Bill, but I will obtain a note from the Department on it because it could be important.</p></speech>

Is the legislation specifically geared towards Departments, State agencies or entities funded by the State?  If it covers entities funded by the State to a certain degree, does it kick in when it comes to such companies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-20a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014112000003#O01700"><p>It probably should.</p></speech>

It cannot simply ignore the matter based on the contract because the legislation will supersede the contract.</p></speech>

The correspondence raises many issues in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology generally.  Correspondence on Cork Institute of Technology has also been received by the Comptroller and Auditor General and me which we should circulate.</p></speech>

We asked the Comptroller and Auditor General about the costs and the answer we received was there are substantial costs involved with a joint application.  It is something over which the committee has jurisdiction.  People in Carlow and Waterford are really interested in finding out about who knew about the process while it was not evolving, at what point was it, in effect, a broken process, and if money was spent after the fact.  The HEA and the Department of Education and Skills know what was going on over the past two and a half years with regard to the point the Chairman made on due diligence being started, and that is when the process began to fragment.  That needs to be explored further, because if we find out that it was clear at a very early date that this was not going to work and some kind of charade was entered into, the process pursued and money spent after the fact, that is serious.</p></speech>

Everybody wants a particular entity to come before the committee yesterday, but there is a schedule and there are only a certain number of weeks available.  The last time I spoke to the clerk about this he suggested that Carlow and Waterford could come before the committee in January.  The situation, as it lies now, is that the Minister has appointed Mr. Michael Kelly, a former head of the HEA, to try to get the merger back on track.  One of the parties involved has said it is not co-operating with that.  There is a bit of a stand-off.  The committee could do some useful work by bringing all entities in here sooner rather than later, based on the correspondence the Chairman has received, to get to the bottom of this.  The meeting could include the sports centre to which he referred.</p></speech>

The financial statements recognise a total deferred pension funding asset of &euro;915 million, but one element of that is &euro;8.3 million related to professional added years liability, and there is a dispute between the university and the Department about that.  The Department has indicated that it will not meet that liability and, therefore, it fails the test for inclusion in the balance sheet of the university.  I have qualified the opinion and made the point that the deferred pension funding asset, the net assets and the revenue reserves at 30 September 2012 should be reduced by &euro;8.3 million.</p></speech>

They record gross expenditure by the service of &euro;104.6 million in 2013.  This represents a 2.9% reduction in expenditure year on year.  I have provided a graphic to illustrate the composition of Courts Service expenditure in 2013.</p><p>  Salaries accounted for 47% of expenditure, with total payroll costs amounting to &euro;49 million.  There were 927 full-time equivalent posts at the end of 2013, down from 945 at the end of 2012.</p><p>  The most significant programme spend relates to payments under the Criminal Courts of Justice PPP deal.  These are in the form of monthly unitary or combined payments which cover the cost of facility availability, financing, insurance and the provision of specified facility maintenance and support services for the users of the complex.  The charge in 2013 amounted to a total of &euro;20.2 million which represents an 11% reduction year on year.  This includes the effect of a rebate of &euro;566,000 arising from a periodic review of insurance costs, as provided for in the PPP contract.</p><p>  Programme expenditure under the Vote also includes spending on capital works for other courthouses.  A provision of &euro;3.9 million was made for such spending in 2013 and the outturn was &euro;2.5 million.  Note 3 explains that the underspend was due to delays in commencing works on a number of courthouse projects, including a delay in commencing preparatory works for a planned PPP bundle to provide new or refurbished courthouses at seven locations.</p><p>  On the receipts side, there were appropriations-in-aid amounting to &euro;46.8 million, of which &euro;42 million relates to fees charged for various categories of court transactions.  In addition, the Courts Service collected court fines, totalling &euro;11.7 million, which were remitted to the Exchequer.  A further &euro;7.6 million was collected and remitted to the Revenue Commissioners and a number of other State bodies.  This mainly comprised fines imposed in cases prosecuted by the Revenue Commissioners and fees paid for licensing applications.</p><p>  Members of the committee may wish to be aware that, as provided for by law and under the rules of the superior courts, the Judiciary oversees the investment and management of court funds.  They include funds held on behalf of wards of court and awards to minors arising from certain court proceedings.  These funds, amounting to around &euro;1.3 billion at end 2013, are not accounted for in the appropriations account for the Courts Service.  Annual financial statements for these funds are produced by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and audited by an audit firm appointed by that office.  They are not within my remit.</p></speech>

I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with the Chairman and members of the committee.</p><p>  I am pleased to report that a clean audit report has been provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2013 appropriations account.  Overall, the Vote was managed successfully and within budget at year end.  A surrender balance of &euro;515,170 was recorded in the Vote.</p><p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  The administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary and, in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions today I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.</p><p>  Since its establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved and that the best possible service is provided for court users.  Since the Vote was last considered by the committee in 2010, the Courts Service has seen very severe reductions in funding and staff numbers.  In this regard, the service has worked tirelessly to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms to bring about savings for the Exchequer, while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and, through proactive management, increased court fees, resulting in a significant contribution to the Government's recovery programme.  The net cost to the Exchequer of operating the service has reduced by &euro;41 million, or 41%, since 2008 - from &euro;99 million to &euro;58 million - as provided in the Estimates for 2014.  During this period day-to-day running costs as represented by non-pay current expenditure decreased by &euro;19.3 million, or 44%, with an 18% reduction in pay and a 73% reduction in capital expenditure.  Court fee income in 2008 was &euro;39 million, whereas the fee income target for 2014 is &euro;46.5 million, an increase of 19%.  The fee income for 2014 is forecasted to exceed this target.</p><p>  The Courts Service fully accepts and supports the Government&rsquo;s ongoing requirement for savings to be achieved and reforms introduced in the delivery of public services.  In this regard, the service has in place robust financial control measures across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum, incurred only where absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that value for money is achieved.  In the past six years the service has been to the fore in the introduction of a range of transformational changes which have delivered very significant savings.  Given the severity of the funding and staffing reductions in the service which saw a 16% reduction in staff numbers - double the Civil Service average and significantly greater than the public service average of 10% - it would not have been possible to maintain services without introducing a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of Courts Service structures, administration and operation, while maintaining access to justice.</p><p>  The modernisation programme has included significant structural and administrative reforms, with the completion of the combined office project, and the rationalisation of stand-alone offices and the regional management structure.  We have also carried out a review and rationalisation of court venues and the hearing of cases in larger venues has freed up judicial and staff time.  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reforms to enable improved operation of the courts and efficiency in deployment of court resources.  The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll out of digital audio recording, DAR, to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and video conferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiencies; the development of case management systems for the debt claims on-line project, the new insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court; and ICT support for the new fines legislation.  There has also been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas such as DAR logging by court registrars, as well as increased in-house ICT and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.</p> <p>The increased productivity arising from these measures has enabled the service to support a 7% increase in the number of judges, not including the ten new judges appointed to the Court of Appeal, and an estimated increase of 10% in the number of court sitting days in recent years, despite reduced staffing and funding.  It has also allowed us to initiate an ambitious public private partnership programme which will see the refurbishment of seven courthouses around the country in the coming years. </p><p> The Courts Service very much welcomes the funding and staffing provision sanctioned this year to support the establishment and running of the Court of Appeal.  That court is now sitting and work on the infrastructure it will require is under way.  We also welcome the increased funding announced for the Courts Service Vote for 2015.  An increase in investment will continue to be required in the coming years to address the consequences of the austerity measures which had to be introduced.  Investment is required in ICT, for example, which, if made, has the potential to bring about a transformation in the way the courts operate and achieve significant further savings.  In the context of reduced resources and growing workloads, technology offers the best solution to enhancing customer service and delivering improved value for money.</p><p> Investment is also required to undertake a number of smaller courthouse capital refurbishment projects and urgent maintenance in courthouses.  These works have continued to be deferred owing to a lack of funding and are now urgently required if the fabric of these buildings is not to be totally compromised and if the future of our historic structures is to be safeguarded.  </p><p> The prioritisation of court sittings and front-line services has resulted in the stripping of back office and support functions, which in itself carries operational risks.  The Courts Service has reached tipping point in regard to staff numbers.  Additional staff are required if we are to continue to support court sittings as required by the presidents of the courts, maintain court services in offices around the country and support Government initiatives such as the implementation of the new fines legislation, new arrangements for the hearing of child care cases, the new legal costs adjudication regime to be provided for under the Legal Services Bill and the restructuring of the family law courts.  Just as with the Court of Appeal which was successfully established on 28 October, the successful implementation of these initiatives will require provision of the necessary funding and staffing.  </p><p> Our priority has always been and will continue to be the provision of front-line, core court services to support the Judiciary and court users.  This can only be achieved through the ongoing review of the organisation and delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change and modernisation programme.  The Courts Service strategic plan 2014&ndash;17 which sets out the key priorities for the service in the next three years has been submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality for approval.  Over the lifetime of the plan we propose to build on the progress made in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery to bring about improved services and value for money.  We intend to focus on maximising the use of technology, developing our staff to ensure they have the necessary legal, technical and management skills and placing particular emphasis on the ongoing standardisation and rationalisation of processes and procedures to enable us to achieve significant economies and efficiencies in the delivery of services.  The service will work to ensure we continue to improve services for court users, make the courts as accessible as possible and achieve real value for money in the provision of these services.</p></speech>

It began hearing criminal appeals and sentence-related matters on 10 November and these sittings will continue each day until the end of term, on 19 December.  Hearing dates have been given for 140 such cases this term.  On 17 November the President of the court held further list hearings to fix dates to hear transferred appeals against convictions.  The court will sit Monday to Friday each week to consider these matters.  </p><p>  In civil matters, all notices of civil appeals are given a date for a directions hearing before a nominated judge.  Directions hearings for expedited appeals will be held each Thursday, while ordinary appeals will be listed for directions hearings on Fridays.</p><p>  We anticipate annual expenditure on the Court of Appeal will be in the region of &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million.  This estimated expenditure includes judicial salaries plus overhead costs.  However, judicial salaries do not come from the Courts Service but are paid from the Central Fund.  The figure given will also cover court equipment and support staff.</p></speech>

In the 2014 budget we were given &euro;2 million to bring forward the Court of Appeal.  A lot of this money has gone on infrastructure.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the 26 staff and has provided funding in 2015 for them.  Work on the infrastructure required is ongoing.  The Four Courts are housed in an old building and bringing ten new judges on board has caused some difficulties.  To accommodate some of the new appointees we are preparing the old public records building which was formerly the home of the National Archives of Ireland before that body moved to Bishop Street.  That accommodation will be ready for occupation in mid-January.</p><p>  Judges of the new court are concentrating their resources on the criminal business side and spending most of their time sitting on two benches in the Criminal Courts of Justice where there is spare capacity.  They come down on a regular basis to call on civil matter lists.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Ryan explain why plans to close four courthouses in the Dublin area, namely, in Tallaght, Balbriggan, Swords and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, were abandoned?</p></speech>

Where a venue is being considered for closure, all interested parties are consulted as part of the detailed assessment.  Where parties are consulted, they are provided with full details of the assessment undertaken by the Courts Service of the proposal in question.  The views expressed by those consulted form part of a detailed assessment provided for the building committee of the Courts Service.  If the committee proposes to recommend to the Courts Service board the closure of a particular venue, all those previously consulted are informed of this proposal and allowed to make a submission directly to the board.  As I said, it is an open and transparent system.</p><p>  On the Dublin venues to which the Deputy referred, we took the view that their closure was warranted from a Courts Service perspective.  I have mentioned that we have had severe reductions in funding and a 16% reduction in staff numbers.  There are challenges in maintaining sittings on a daily basis.  The Courts Service and its staff should be applauded in that, despite all the cutbacks made in the past six years, the fact that judicial numbers have increased by 8% or so and the 10% rise in the number of sitting days, no scheduled court sitting has been cancelled.  However, in the central Dublin area, we considered it would be more efficient to centralise all of our business within the Criminal Courts of Justice and the Four Courts area.</p></speech>

In fact, nobody was in favour of them, other than the Courts Service.  We took all of these submissions into consideration when we were preparing the report for the building committee.  The process, as I outlined, is that the report goes to the building committee and then to the board with a recommendation.</p> <p>We recommended to the building committee that this matter not be progressed further.  Proceeding with the closures would have had significant consequences for other justice agencies and we considered, based on their concerns, that the closures should not take place.  Some 12 members of staff in the outlying venues mentioned would have come into the centre and while the savings in the cost of maintenance for the Courts Service would have been around &euro;300,000, there is no doubt the closures would have caused difficulties.  The courthouse in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a fine venue and while there are issues with the courthouse in Tallaght, it is not bad.  The courthouses in Swords and Balbriggan are poor venues that need significant investment to bring them up to acceptable standards, but we do not have the money.  There is still an issue, but we accept the point on the submissions made, as the Courts Service is open in this manner.</p></speech>

It indicated that some garda&iacute; would be removed from local policing duties to appear in court; therefore, this measure would have had a significant effect on policing in certain areas.  We took this on board, but we take the view that the Garda could revisit the issue of court process management.  In Dublin a presenter system is used such that instead of all garda&iacute; attending court for initial case hearings, an inspector or sergeant will present the evidence to the court.  Perhaps this system might be expanded further.  We took on board the views of the Garda and other organisations.  I think the Irish Prison Service was in favour of centralisation, while the Probation Service was neutral, but all other stakeholders were opposed.</p></speech>

The Courts Service, in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998, is responsible for the management and administration of the courts and provides a support service for judges.  It is in this capacity that the service has a role in the management and investment of court funds.  These funds are invested in line with the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958 and subsequent orders.  The Courts Service was established in 1999 and in 2001 commenced a review of the management and investment of court funds which culminated in the establishment of a number of customised funds in December 2003.  Most court funds have since been invested according to the new arrangements, including District Court and Circuit Court funds, in addition to High Court funds.  The Courts Service operates a very conservative investment policy to ensure the capital sum is protected, particularly in the case of minors.  Where necessary, an appropriate balance is struck between income generation and capital preservation and this approach has worked well in the past 11 years.  Very good returns have been generated, while protecting court funds from the worst effects of the credit crisis.  Some 65% of funds are held in cash-based assets and bonds, while there is a 35% exposure to equities and corporate bonds.</p><p>  In making a decision to invest court funds on behalf of a ward or a minor a key factor is the length of time the funds will be held by the courts.  Shorter term funds are invested in cash-based assets and funds held for longer periods are invested in the most appropriate funds available.</p></speech>

When a person is taken into wardship, the President of the High Court appoints a committee, usually one person, to deal with the ward's property and, in certain cases, make recommendations for his or her personal welfare.  In approximately 75% of cases the ward's committee comprises a family member or a friend.  If no suitable or willing private person resident in the jurisdiction is available or if there is a conflict of interest between the ward and the person who would otherwise have been appointed, the President of the High Court can appoint a general solicitor for minors and wards of court to act as the committee.  A committee only has the powers conferred on it by order of the President of the High Court.  Where a committee is authorised to collect a ward's income from any source, it is its duty to make all appropriate tax returns on behalf of the ward and discharge his or her tax liabilities.  A committee in receipt of income is requested periodically to account to the Office of Wards of Court.</p></speech>

The practice predates the foundation of the State and it does not appear that there is a statutory basis for it.  It appears to extend from the judge's common law jurisdiction to exercise discretion in imposing penalties and other conditions such as the making of a donation to the poor box or a particular charity.  While each court of first jurisdiction - the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court - has used the poor box on occasion, the facility is mostly invoked in the District Court.</p></speech>

In the High Court earlier in the year Mr. Justice Hogan concluded:<blockquote><br />The District Court enjoys no jurisdiction to impose an informal sanction short of actual conviction such as accepting a donation to the poor box ... This would amount to an indirect circumvention of these statutory provisions.</blockquote>The Courts Service manages the funds, but it only has a management function and has no responsibility or discretion with regard to whom the money is paid.</p></speech>

The proposed legislation will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service.  The new Bill will abolish the poor box and replace it with reparation funds to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court.  The replacement of the poor box with a statutory reparation fund was recommended, as the Deputy may recall, by the Law Reform Commission in 2005.  The new reparation fund will be used to provide additional funding for services for the victims of crime and compensation payments payable by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  The legislation will clearly provide that the fund may not be used for any purpose other than the provision of compensation, reparation and assistance for the victims of crime.</p></speech>

At that stage we were using approximately 16 courts on a daily basis.  Today, all 22 courts are in use.  Obviously, the new Court of Appeal has been located within the building and it uses two courtrooms.  Business has increased in the building, while the number of judges has increased significantly since we took over the building in 2009.  The number of court sitting days throughout the country has increased by approximately 10%.  It is a very busy building.

We have not costed this project.  It all comes down to reductions in staff numbers and funding.  As stated, we have been stripping back office areas to support front-line sittings.  I take great pride in the fact that no scheduled sitting has been cancelled.  In that context, the number of staff in the ICT unit has been reduced from 16 to 12.  That is just one of the areas to which I refer that has been affected.  In general, we know what we need, but we have not costed it.  If we are going to go down the route of having a standardised civil system for the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court - such a system will really generate significant efficiencies - we will be obliged to take staff out of all three in order to build the business case and supply the ICT people who provide exactly what is required.  The difficulty is that we have stripped out staff all over the place.  We cannot pursue this matter unless we obtain additional resources.  As I stated, we have reached tipping point.  I reiterate that we have lost 16% of our staff and that the net cost to the Exchequer of running the Courts Service has fallen by 41%, which is amazing.  In 2009 the Exchequer was obliged to provide us with funding of &euro;99 million.  This year the figure is &euro;58 million.  We have made huge efficiency gains, but we need to start investing.  If the cut to our staffing levels had been similar to that applied in other areas of the Civil Service - according to a report by Mr. Boyle of the IPA, it stands at 8% - we would have a staff of 980.  We have 903 staff members, which is giving rise to significant consequences.  I am not stating we need 980 staff.</p></speech>

Fixed charge penalty points apply to a range of motoring offences.  What happens in any case is that a fixed charge penalty notice is issued by the Garda national processing office in Thurles when a motoring offence has been detected by a garda or a speed or safety camera, either static or mobile.  The notice is issued to the registered owner of the vehicle in the case of detection by a camera or the driver if the vehicle is stopped by a garda.  When the initial 28 day period has elapsed, the registered owner or driver has a further 28 days in which to pay the fine and incur penalty points.</p> <p>Once the fine is paid, the Garda electronically updates the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport with the offence details.  Once the 26-day period has elapsed, a fine cannot be paid.  I will come back to the issue.  The unpaid fine triggers an application to the courts for the issue of a summons.</p></speech>

The summons is served and when the accused person is convicted of the offence, approximately 28 days after the conviction we inform the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of the penalty points.  The notification is electronic.</p><p>  To return to the Deputy's point on the collection of driving licences, section 63 of the 2010 Act provides that, where a person is alleged to have committed an offence or has been charged with the commission of an offence under the Road Traffic Act and is due to appear before the court, the court is required to collect sufficient information - that is, the driving licence number - to provide to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport so that the penalty points are applied appropriately to the licence holder.</p><p>  The Courts Service has taken the following steps to implement penalty points.  All summonses issued in respect of the alleged offences under the Road Traffic Act include a specific provision that notifies the accused person that he or she must bring to court his or her driving licence permit and a legible copy of the driving licence.  The court registrar, following consultation with the presiding judge, makes an announcement at the start of the court proceedings to the effect that, as required by the summons, the person must produce his or her driving licence permit and a copy to the registrar once the case has been called.  Where a driving licence permit and a copy are produced, we put it into our system and the information is transferred electronically.  Where a driving licence permit is not produced, the registrar records that in the summons book and the minute book.</p><p>  We have made the case over a long period that we view this as an inefficient use of court resources.  I do not know whether the Deputy has ever been in a District Court when it is dealing with road traffic offences, but it is a very busy court with a lot of hustle and bustle.  Stopping the court just to try to collect details has caused issues for busy courts.  We believe it is very inefficient but, more importantly, we think it is a very ineffective way of collecting much-needed data in this area.  Over the years we have pointed out to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority and others the specific difficulties associated with the collection of driving licence numbers when the business of the court is being conducted.  It is inefficient and, more importantly, it is ineffective.</p><p>  When an accused person is convicted in his or her absence of a road traffic offence, which is a regular occurrence in court, the Courts Service is not in any position to collect his or her driving licence details.  The Courts Service has consistently advocated an alternative approach, going back many years.  We feel that the national vehicle driving file and the motor tax file should be linked.  At the first registration of a vehicle and upon every change of ownership, the owner of a car should have to indicate his or her driving licence number.  Through the years we have changed the manner in which road tax has been paid.  Years ago in Dublin, one had to queue up for hours to apply to pay road tax, but mostly people now do it online, and one also provides details of one&rsquo;s insurance certificate number.  We are of the view that when one buys a car or it changes ownership the detail of one&rsquo;s driving licence should be incorporated.  That would address the inefficiency in the system and, critically, would result in driving licence numbers being available at the point of detection, either by camera or upon being stopped by a garda, and when a summons is being issued.</p><p>  We did not seem to make any progress in the area for years but, following the Garda Inspectorate report on fixed-charge processing systems, a working group was set up - the criminal justice fixed charge processing group - of which we are a member, and which is jointly chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The group has been actively considering the proposal and we hope it will be implemented.  We feel this is the only sensible approach.</p><p>  There is also the third payment option.  I mentioned earlier that after 56 days, when the summons issues, if a motorist wants to pay his or her fine at that stage, unfortunately, that is not possible at the moment.  That is regrettable, but it is the way the legislation is framed.  Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for a scenario where the appropriate fixed charge penalty will now be paid after the issue of a summons and not later than seven days before a person comes into the court, as the court needs seven days to take the issue out of the court list.  A subgroup of the criminal justice fixed charge processing group examined the option of bringing this section into effect.  Based on the approach agreed at the working group, the solution will involve the Garda taking on from the Courts Service the printing of all District Court summonses - not just those relating to road traffic offences - using an outsourced printing service provider and extending the payment system to include third payment options, and then electronically updating the court case management system to remove cases from the court list when a person has availed of the third payment option.  Such an approach would make it possible to automate aspects of the process that are currently managed manually and would provide assurances that the same organisation will generate the payment notice and managing receipts.  Obviously the Courts Service is fully supportive of the process.  From our perspective, it would reduce the number of cases that come before the courts-----</p></speech>

The national cleaning contract for the Courts Service was put in place some years ago and it commenced in the Dublin area.  It was then rolled out to the regions; we have four or five regions outside Dublin.  They started at various stages several months after the Dublin one.  An issue arose when we were going to a framework document in regard to new contracts as to when the two or three years for those contracts finished.  That took some resolving, but eventually it was resolved.  We then went out to tender, and just before we were due to appoint new providers, there was a threat of a legal action which delayed us another few weeks.  Seven of those new contracts are in place, and the other three will be completed by the end of the year, or we have ceased procuring those goods.  Circular 40/02 is an area in which I take personal interest and I regret that this has happened, but there was no waste of public funds.  It came down to interpretation as to when the previous contract ended and there was some misunderstanding with regard to that.  We have cleared that up now.  As I indicated, since the report seven of them have gone into the new contracts and the other three will be resolved by the end of this year.</p></speech>

I have no doubt there have been other cancellations, but I do not have those figures.  It depends on the scheduling of cases in any Circuit Court in Ireland.  They are scheduled a year in advance.  They are scheduled either for criminal court, the civil court or the family court.  If most of those scheduled sittings this month were criminal court, the impact on the civil court would be minimal because the judges are still dealing with criminal matters.  If the scheduled sittings were for the civil court, as was the case in Waterford, unfortunately, the president has directed that criminal matters have to take priority because, as the Deputy will appreciate, people may be in custody.</p></speech>

I am trying to find out how this occurred procedurally and make the point to the Department that it should not occur again.  We are in an unusual situation with the creation of an entirely different court, but at the same time, these things happen on occasion because of retirements, deaths, promotions and elevations of a kind, and always have done.  In this particular case, seven vacancies were created as a result of one retirement, one elevation to the Court of Appeal and the elevation to the High Court of five individuals.  The Government promoted judges from the High Court to the Court of Appeal and it promoted judges from the Circuit Court to the High Court, but what it did not do was make new appointments to the Circuit Court or the District Court in their places.  That occurred in the past 24 hours, but there was a gap.</p></speech>

Yet when it comes to this area, it appears to be acceptable.  It is a political process.  I know it should not be, and it is something this Government probably has fallen down on when it comes to judicial appointments.  In our programme for Government we promised that we would look at this, and I believe it is a failing.  People such as Mrs. Justice Susan Denham have commented that it is a miracle our Judiciary has maintained its independence so well considering it is so political.  That aside, what we can do at the very least - I understand this is not Mr. Ryan's role - is to have a reasonable transition when something like this occurs to ensure there are no gaps and that sittings are not postponed.</p><p>  I know Ms Duffy does not set policy, but she deals with it within the Department of Justice and Equality.  I can raise this with the Minister, but it is a simple question.  The suggestion I am making and that I will make to the Minister - I am raising it with Mr. Ryan now because he is the person dealing with policy in the Department when it comes to the courts - is that when this occurs, the appointments to the Circuit Court and the District Court should happen at the same time.</p> <p>They should happen in tandem or, at the very least, within a specified period.  That is a simple suggestion.  </p><p> Mr. Ryan makes a good case about the Courts Service's efficiency and talked about a 16% reduction in its staff.  Some would state it is too efficient, while plenty of communities nationwide would suggest it has stripped down courthouses and so on.  The service has done a good job in cutting costs and, at the very least, it is possible to have sittings take place.  While one part of the Government system may be working well, another is not and has failed in providing judges to preside over sittings in the Circuit Court.  This is something that could be rectified easily.  I do not know whether the witnesses have a comment to make on this.  I again acknowledge to Ms Duffy that I am aware departmental officials do not set policy.  I do not know whether this issue has been raised in the past, but it appears to be a reasonable suggestion that when something like this occurs - retirements and deaths take place all the time - this could happen in tandem.</p></speech>

In the past four to six weeks she has brought a series of memorandums to the Government on appointing ten judges to the Court of Appeal, the subsequent replacements to the High Court and, this week, on appointments to the Circuit Court.  As Mr. Ryan stated, this has been unprecedented.  This is the first new court jurisdiction established since 1961.  It has been a long time since we went through such a major change to the system.  As for the nominations to the Circuit Court announced by the Government yesterday, the process was completed in as speedy a manner as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, names are submitted via the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which conducts its process.  The Government then has its part to play in evaluating the names and considering serving judges for the position.  However, I appreciate that there has been a consequence, of which the Minister will certainly be made aware.</p></speech>

The situation was unusual.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question on this matter a few days ago and what has happened in the past couple of days is miraculous, considering that the last line of the reply indicated that the Government would be dealing with the matter in the coming weeks.  What role does Mr. Ryan play when something like this occurs?  Obviously, the presidents of the different courts have a major role to play in this regard, but as far as rostering is concerned, the issue about court sittings taking place on Monday afternoons or Fridays has come up repeatedly.  Is this something in which the Courts Service gets involved in any way, shape or form?</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Duffy might take the suggestion back to the Minister.  While I can raise it directly with her, it is reasonable to avoid such delays because, as Mr. Ryan is aware, practitioners could not believe people had not thought about the gaps that there would be as a result of these appointments or elevations.</p></speech>

For example, in Drogheda it is a greenfield site as such and the courthouse is small and will go up easily.  The Deputy will appreciate that in Waterford there is a lot of conservation work involved.  Moreover, it is an extension to an existing building in respect of which there are preservation issues; consequently, it will take a little longer to complete.</p><p>  I was delighted when the courts bundle was included in the stimulus package announced by the Government couple of years ago.  We have 12 projects outstanding.  While we have carried out numerous building projects, 12 county towns remain and once these seven projects are completed, only five county town venues will remain to be dealt with.  They will all be significant and efficient buildings; consequently, I was delighted when they were included in the stimulus package.  I am also delighted that the work has proceeded to this extent.  We have handed over the procurement process to the National Development Finance Agency which is working on it.</p></speech>

It is the issue of wards of courts in terms of the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, although I would say it was more within Mr. Quigley's domain.  Members of the committee have on and off received written correspondence on the issue, about which I have a couple of questions.  The office is independent in the way it functions and has its own investment committee.  Funds in the order of &euro;1.3 billion at the end of 2013 were involved.  Funds are audited independently; the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a role.  The question that arises is whether Mr. Quigley is satisfied with the management strategy for investments and that the funds have been properly benchmarked in terms of performance.  He might put the matter in context.</p><p>  Awards have been made to persons who are wards of court.  In some cases, relatives are worried that there may not be sufficient funds available to deal with all eventualities in meeting the needs of an individual who is a ward of court.  They have major worries about the make-up of investments, as between equities and cash.  Mr. Quigley might give his perspective.  During the downturn, in the period from 2007, was there a fall in investments?  I suppose it is about providing comfort.  I am not questioning the independence of the investments committee and what it does, but Mr. Quigley might give his perspective in terms of ensuring there are sufficient funds available.  Has the State had to provide funds?</p></speech>

Arising from that review, a range of investment strategies were put in place.  There was a new governance structure put in place which included an investment committee headed by the President of the High Court.  We also went to tender for fund managers and Bank of Ireland Asset Management and State Street were awarded the contract.  We again went to tender, I think, in 2011, at which time State Street was again successful, by which time it had taken over Bank of Ireland Asset Management.  Our objective is to have investment strategies that match as closely as possible the requirements of individual beneficiaries, taking account of the duration of the investment and also capital preservation, particularly in the case of minors.</p><p>  During the financial crisis, about which the Vice Chairman asked, the funds were hit like every other investment.  At the year end of 2008, our growth fund, the one exposed most to equities, stood at minus 17%.  However, as we keep telling people, one is in such a fund for the long term, not for one or two years but for at least five or ten years plus.</p></speech>

Have there ever been circumstances in which the State has had to cover the shortfall?  What would happen if there were a shortfall?

We manage whatever that settlement is to the best of our ability.  We have no ability to guarantee the value of the award of the court will be sufficient.  This has been recognised more recently with the consideration of the periodic payments.  It is a difficulty and we recognise that.  The evidence, certainly in relation to the arrangements the Courts Service has put in place over the past ten or 11 years, is that those arrangements are working very effectively.  If there is a shortfall, it is not down to what the Courts Service has been doing.</p></speech>

I think it is something that we should all personally try to advance.  Given that there was no legal impediment, I cannot really understand why it has not happened until now.</p></speech>

There would be a constraint around looking at a decision of the judge in determining the award.  Obviously that would be outside the remit.

I appreciate that the specific sums are not the decision of the Courts Service.  Mr. Quigley said the Courts Service was prudent in the management of the funds and obtained the best possible advice to maximise the value of funds.  What happens if and when things go wrong?</p></speech>

The registrar of wards of court must look at the ongoing and future expenditure requirements.  There are modelling tools available to the registrar which can forecast how long the money would be expected to last based on projected expenditure.  The investment decision will be aimed at maximising the value that can be got from the fund.  Obviously, if the value of the award in the first place was determined by taking account of contributory negligence or other factors, it is very difficult to guarantee things.  While it may be the wish of the court, circumstances can change.  Inflation can have an impact.  However, we do everything we can to maximise the value of the award.  It has been recognised that there may be a need for a different approach involving, perhaps, periodic payments to help to mitigate risk.  Within the current system, we are doing the best job we can.</p></speech>

Without getting into the precise circumstances of her son, a woman told me that over a two-year period the relevant fund had diminished from &euro;510,685 to &euro;280,145.  These are precise figures, and that is quite a drop over that period of time.  The family - and there are many others - were very alarmed by the drop and very concerned, and they feel helpless in this scenario.  They believe there are insufficient protections for these funds.  I ask Mr. Quigley to comment on that.  These are families who do not necessarily have any interest in the money markets or its vagaries.  They simply have to provide for their loved one.  They believe there are insufficient checks and balances.  They also feel they are entirely locked out of any decisions around investment and report that they find it nearly impossible to get detailed information in respect of investments and returns.  That is their experience.</p></speech>

I think I understand the scenario to which the Deputy refers.  We are looking at the value of those funds at the worst point in the financial crisis.  As I alluded to earlier, all those funds took a hit.  We have looked at a number of cases.  If one looks at them over the longer term, even since December 2003, all of them are significantly up.  Of course, if one looks at any long-term fund in a particular year, which is what we are looking at here, and the fund is down substantially, it is not a real loss.  It is a paper loss.  If one were to sell all those units at that point in time, one would trigger the loss, but that did not happen in this case.  We are getting into investments where there is going to be fluctuation in the value of funds in the short term.  We get into those investments, however, because we take a long-term view.  That has been determined to be in the best interests of cases such as the one the Deputy has mentioned.  If we were to take an approach in which we took no risk with the funds and put them into a cash-type investment, we would be criticised because the return is extremely low and would not achieve the long-term objective of growing the investment.</p><p>  In terms of input, there is consultation between the wards of court office and individual beneficiaries, but, ultimately, the registrar and the courts must make a decision based on what is in the best interests of the beneficiary.</p></speech>

He describes in financial terms the best interest of the funds.  I am not suggesting that he is indifferent to the circumstances of the people affected.  I ask him not to misunderstand what I am saying.  He is talking about the best interest and the best investment decisions, which is fine on the face of it.  However, families feel very locked out of the system and actually quite helpless.  The families I have spoken to have the bigger best interest at the core of their concerns, which is the best interest of their injured child or disabled parent or whoever it might be.  I suggest to Mr. Quigley, without intending to open a long discussion, that it might be useful to go back and look again at that interaction between individuals and the system in these cases.  People have told me that attempting to get any detailed information is like trying to get the third secret of Fatima.  One is sent from Billy to Jack if one is not fortunate enough to know exactly who to go to and exactly what questions to ask.  As a politician famously said, "You asked the wrong question."  That might be fine in politics, but it is not right in this scenario.</p><p>  Another question families have is whether there are protocols for investment.</p></speech>

Has that been looked at?  The question boils down to that.  Where the Comptroller and Auditor General comes in is that if a fund in respect of a particular individual runs out, it falls back on the State and public funds to deal with the costs thereafter.  As a committee, it is something on which we should make a recommendation to the Department of Justice and Equality.  This matter should be examined again in consultation with the good people of the Courts Service.  The question is on the periodic issue.  The service would say, for a fund of &euro;3 million, for example, that it was going to pay so much per year.</p> <p>To date, in respect of how many individuals that were wards of court has a fund run out leaving the HSE and other organs of the State to deal with the costs involved in their care?</p></speech>

In respect of the periodic payments, it is really a legislative matter and a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  As I understand it, the decision in principle has been made to bring forward legislation to provide for periodic payments.  It is a question of when it happens.  I do not know if my colleague here from the Department of Justice and Equality has any comment to make on that.</p></speech>

Mr. Quigley said that he was not the registrar of the wards of court.  We might write to the registrar and put some of these questions to them.  I know they are not directly accountancy questions but nonetheless they are important process issues.  Is there merit in a review of all of the above - the management of the fund, the performance of the fund, capturing the practices, the interaction, the role of families and the role of the person to whom the award is made?  Would there be merit in doing that because I know that prior to the last foray by this committee into this area, there had been no real accountability for any of this for some 20 years so it has had a chequered history?  Might it be an idea for such a review to take place?  I do not know who might answer that.</p></speech>

Ultimately, our only concern is the interest of the beneficiary so that whatever arrangements are in place, they meet the requirements of the beneficiary.  I accept what the Vice Chairman says.  We are sympathetic to the concerns that wards of court beneficiaries have.  We work within the existing arrangements to the best of our ability but there is obviously potential for improvement there.  The two changes that are coming down the tracks will, hopefully, bring about that improvement.  It would be timely to have a comprehensive review.</p></speech>

The Courts Service's track record seems very good in terms of the success it has had in reducing the amount of money that is required from the Exchequer.  There has been a 41% reduction between 2008 and 2014.  I would say that the Comptroller and Auditor General has not come across that in too many areas.</p></speech>

I have not heard any demand from the Courts Service for an increase in its budget from the Exchequer at this point in time but it has used the fee income very successfully.<br/>I wish to mention two points.  I wrote to Mr. Ryan last month about issues concerning decisions that had been made in the Circuit Court and the High Court and possession orders that had been issued.  Mr. Ryan wrote me a very fine and extensive letter.  However, there seems to be considerable discrepancies in the manner in which the Circuit Court and the High Court conduct their business.  For example, I was looking for possessions broken down in terms of residential possessions and non-residential orders that had been issued.  The Circuit Court was able to supply those details but the High Court did not have any breakdown of that nature.  Likewise, I was looking for location.  The Circuit Court had the breakdown in respect of location but the High Court had none.  It just had a bald figure.<br/>While I understand that nobody wants to interfere too much with the Judiciary and the manner in which it conducts its business, it would seem that we could do with a more detailed level of information and at least a standardised level of information related to the same matters from the different courts.  I cannot understand why we cannot get information with regard to residential and non-residential and for both courts to be able to provide a breakdown with regard to the various areas.  Now that the Department of Justice and Equality is no longer the go-between with regard to Oireachtas Members because the Courts Service provides that information, the relationship between the Courts Service and the Oireachtas Members - because this is information that is coming from our clientele - is very interesting and it is very important that we are aware of it.<br/>In the context of the new Courts Service strategy plan for 2014, I think the witnesses suggested that this was before the Department of Justice and Equality so it is a draft plan.  Is there any chance of us getting a look at that draft plan to see whether or not we could have an input before it is finalised in the context of our relationship with the Courts Service as serving Members of the Oireachtas and the work we are doing as it would be mutually beneficial?  </p></speech>

It has gone to the Minister for approval.  I do not know when she will approve it so I do not know what the time line is for her to approve it.  It is due at this stage but we have no problem sending on the draft plan to the committee.  It has gone from the Courts Service so we will do that.</p> <p>The High Court has a very old IT system.  It is a legacy system which predates the establishment of the Courts Service, unlike the Circuit Court and District Court system, which is a very modern civil courts management system.  It is part of our agenda to upgrade the High Court system but it is a funding and staffing issue.  Providing the details sought by the Deputy would require us go through every file.  We just do not have the resources, but we intend to update our IT system for the High Court when funds become available.</p></speech>

We can get a degree of information on this issue, but once cases go the High Court we are almost blanked, because there is no breakdown of the figures.</p></speech>
