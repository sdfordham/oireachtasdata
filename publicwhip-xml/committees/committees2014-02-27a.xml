Are those minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I will now deal with matters arising from that meeting.  At last week's meeting, we agreed to visit NAMA.  The chairman of NAMA is currently away but a meeting will be arranged in the coming weeks where we will get a briefing and a walk through on their operations.  That meeting will be the subgroup, which is possibly the full committee.</p><p>The Oireachtas library and research service is also engaged in doing work for the committee on NAMA.  As soon as the chairman of NAMA returns we will set that date and will visit them in their offices.</p><p>I will now deal with correspondence received since our meeting of Thursday, 20 February 2014.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers.</p><p>No. 3A.1 is correspondence received 20 February 2014 from Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, CEO, SOLAS, re investigation into whistleblowing at SOLAS, to be noted and published.</p><p>No. 3A.2 is correspondence received 24 February 2014 from Mr. Ray Mitchell, HSE, re update on section 38 agencies, to be noted and published.</p><p>No. 3B is individual correspondence.</p><p>No. 3B.1 is correspondence dated 17 February 2014 from Mr. Brendan Ryan, CEO, Courts Service re reply to correspondence from Deputy Derek Nolan to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Brian McDonald.</p><p>No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 5 February 2013 from Mr. John Ryan, Enniskerry, County Wicklow, re correspondence re inappropriate follow-up by the Garda and the cancellation of penalty points, to be noted and forwarded to the Garda Commissioner for a note and for appropriate follow-up.</p><p>No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 15 February 2014 from Dr. Colm Henry, Chairperson, An Bord Bainist&iacute;ochta, Gaelscoil an Ghoirt Alainn, re Gaelscoil an Ghoirt Alainn, Mayfield, Cork, to be noted and a reply will issue to Dr. Henry outlining the position of the committee</p><p>No. 3B.4 is correspondence dated 18 November 2014 from Deputy Colm Keaveney re investigation in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, to be noted and a copy to be forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the issues raised.</p><p>No. 3B.5 is correspondence received 20 February 2014 from Mr. William Treacy re correspondence to the Committee of Public Accounts, to be noted.</p><p>No. 3B.6 is correspondence dated 18 November 2013 from Mr. Dan Foley re Kildimo and Pallaskenry Bleach Lough Water Retention Committee, to be noted.  This is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts and it is an issue that has been ongoing since 1997.  While it is primarily a matter for the local authority, I propose that it now be sent to Irish Water to see if a resolution can be found that will satisfy the local community.  Mr. Foley will be notified of this.</p><p>No. 3B.7 is correspondence dated 25 February 2014 from Mr. Martin Nolan, Bus &Eacute;ireann, re Bus &Eacute;ireann investigation into the school transport scheme, to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Gerry Mullins, Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, for his information.  There was further correspondence querying the school transport scheme so this reply needs to go to those individuals and perhaps to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for its comment on the matter.  It has been raised with the Department.</p><p>No. 3.C is correspondence relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting.  This includes 3C.1 to 3C.4, opening statements from today&rsquo;s witnesses, to be noted and published.</p><p>No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting of 20 February 2014.  They are listed below from 4.1 to 4.3, inclusive.

The charitable lotteries scheme was established in 1997 by the Minister for Finance.  The purpose of the scheme is to supplement the income of the promoters of private charitable lotteries conducted under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  The scheme applies only to lotteries with products similar to products sold by the national lottery.  The Department of Justice and Equality only assumed responsibility for the administration of the scheme in mid-2011.  Prior to that, responsibility for the scheme rested with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and previously the Department of Finance.  The charitable lotteries scheme is currently administered by staff in the charities regulation unit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Applications are invited each year from charities that have been operating a charitable lottery since at least 1 January 1997.</p><p>  Following processing of applications, the total available fund for the year is divided among successful applicants on the basis of their gross sales of eligible lottery products averaged over the previous three years.  By eligible lottery products, I mean certain products similar to products offered by the national lottery, chiefly scratch cards, regular draw lotteries, and bingo.  The criterion used to apportion funding under the scheme ensures that charities whose lotteries have the highest proportion of gross ticket sales secure the highest proportion of the overall fund.  A single payment is made to each successful applicant, typically in late November or early December in respect of that year.</p><p>  The scheme was initially financed entirely from the national lottery surplus, but since 2005 it has been financed jointly by the national lottery surplus and by the Exchequer.  In 2013, the ratio of national lottery surplus to Exchequer funding was at almost 3:1.  That is, 73% of the funding was from the national lottery surplus with the remaining 27% provided through direct Exchequer funding.  Shortly before the transfer of the scheme to the Department of Justice and Equality, the total funding available under the scheme was reduced from &euro;8.6 million in 2010 to &euro;6 million in 2011.</p><p>  Following the transfer and a review of these payments by the Department of Justice and Equality, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced his decision in 2012 to phase out the scheme over a period of three years, with no further payments to be made after 2015.  Beneficiaries of the charitable lotteries scheme were advised in October 2012 that the scheme would be phased out over a three year period beginning in late 2013.  This was necessitated by the urgent need to make savings in Government expenditure across many programmes.  The decision was further informed by a concern that the scheme did not represent an efficient use of funds and did not incentivise effective fund-raising practices by the charities benefiting from the scheme.  It was decided to phase out the scheme on a gradual basis to give affected organisations as much time as possible to adjust to the change and to consider alternative methods of charitable fund-raising.</p><p>  In the meantime, we are continuing to administer the scheme in the usual way.  A total of 20 applications for funding were received in 2013, of which 19 qualified for funding.  Each of the 19 applicants that qualified for funding also received funding in 2012.  The scheme is only open to organisations that were already running charitable lotteries in 1997 and so the beneficiaries have remained relatively constant over time.  The full &euro;4 million allocated to the scheme for 2013 was disbursed in late November 2013.</p><p>  Since the scheme's inception in 1997, payments totalling almost &euro;86 million have been made to the Rehab Group.  This is out of a total of almost &euro;124 million paid out under the scheme since 1997.   Rehab typically receives almost two thirds of the funding available under the scheme each year.  This is because the total funding available is divided among successful applicants in direct proportion to their gross annual sales of eligible products averaged over three years.  Under this formula, Rehab receives the majority of the funding due to the sales volume of its lottery.</p><p>  It is a condition of the scheme that any funding provided must be applied to the charitable activities of the organisation and cannot be used for administrative purposes.  This condition is included in the documentation provided to applicants.  In 2012, in response to a recommendation from the internal audit unit of the Department of Justice and Equality, the supporting documentation for the scheme was amended to include an indicative list of administration costs ineligible for funding under the scheme.  The main purpose of this change was to help recipients to ensure they were adhering to this condition of the scheme and to give the Department greater confidence that this was the case.</p><p>  In addition, and again in response to the audit findings, a new requirement was introduced in 2012 whereby recipients were advised that they would have to supply a report to the Department of Justice and Equality not more than 12 months following receipt of the funding detailing the uses to which the funding was put and the outputs achieved.  In line with this requirement, a report in respect of Rehab's use of the funding it received in 2012 was provided to the Department by Rehab in 2013.  This report detailed expenditure by Rehab of the &euro;3.9 million in assistance received in 2012 under the following headings: building and other capital expenditure costs for the provision of new and enhanced services; information technology used directly in front-line services; promoting and creating awareness of Rehab's services and disability issues; expenditure into the development of service delivery; and carry-forward of the prior year's application.</p><p>  Assistance in the amount of &euro;2.58 million was provided to Rehab under the scheme in 2013.  In addition to the funding provided under the charitable lotteries scheme, a number of other payments to Rehab over the period 2009 to 2013 were drawn on the justice Vote.  These totalled approximately &euro;250,000 over the period and related primarily to disability services.  I can provide the committee with further detail on these payments if that would be of assistance.  I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention.</p></speech>

Voluntary non-statutory service providers have a long history of providing health and personal social services in Ireland.  These organisations vary in scale and complexity, ranging from large acute hospitals to local community-based organisations providing social care services.  The HSE acknowledges the role and significant contribution of such organisations in the development and provision of health and personal social services and is committed to the continuing improvement of effective governance arrangements with the sector in accordance with the legislative intent of the Health Act 2004 and in accordance with the requirements of good practice.</p><p>  The HSE funds more than 2,600 agencies which operate more than 4,200 separate funding arrangements to a value of approximately &euro;3.3 billion.  A total of 39 of these agencies, accounting for &euro;2.4 billion, are funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004, while the remaining agencies, of which there are more than 2,500, are funded under section 39 of the Act.</p></speech>

For almost 70 years the Rehab Group has been at the forefront in providing support and services for people with disabilities and others who need support.  It was established as an independent not-for-profit organisation with the purpose of promoting equality and fighting disadvantage through quality services and initiatives.  We are here on a voluntary basis following an invitation to assist the committee to understand the type, volume and outcomes of the services we provide from payments from the HSE and SOLAS and to clarify the nature of the charity lottery compensation fund.</p><p>  I want to state clearly at the outset that ours is not a State-run organisation, nor is any of our staff a public servant.  Our staff do not have access to public pension funds and, like any other independent organisation, we are responsible for paying all our own bills.  Our contracts with Government agencies, otherwise called, as the committee has heard, service level agreements, SLAs, are of one year duration and often less - about four months - and we have no guarantees from Departments to cover our deficits.</p><p>  Many people will not be aware that the Rehab Group is made up of a number of charities and commercial companies in Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, Poland, the Netherlands and now the Middle East.  We are headquartered in Dublin and employ over 3,500 people.  We reinvest any profit back into our services, in projects which benefit individuals with disabilities and social initiatives.  We also provide support for other disability organisations, both nationally and internationally.</p><p>  In addition to what members will hear from my colleagues whose divisions contract with the HSE and SOLAS, we are Ireland's largest glass recycler, processing 96,000 tonnes of glass each year, 10,000 tonnes of electronic equipment and 2,400 tonnes of aluminium.  We also operate a number of retail shops and logistic facilities, including warehousing, assembly, work-wear manufacturing, keyboard printing, document scanning and destruction and packaging facilities.  We are also the largest employer of people with disabilities in Ireland and working not only to maintain these jobs but also to increase the number of jobs here every year.</p><p>  We have grown from small beginnings to become a major Irish company, with over 2,300 employees in Ireland and a further 1,200 internationally.  We face the same challenges as all other companies and charities owing to difficult economic environments, changes in market conditions and the need to attract highly able and skilled staff.  In all of this activity we affect the lives of some 60,000 clients group-wide, including 11,300 individuals the length and breadth of Ireland.  Each of our clients is someone's child, brother, sister, parent or friend.  Our ethos is to help our clients achieve their potential, live and work as independently as possible and promote their skills and abilities.  Rehab supports people with every kind of disability, as well as people with mental health difficulties.  Those who are unemployed who need additional help to get back to work are also assisted.</p><p>  The clients of our services include children with autism who need respite care or after-school services.  We support young people who have challenging behaviour and can no longer live at home, perhaps having spent time in an inappropriate placement in psychiatric care.  Our day services give support to people with intellectual disabilities to plan their goals and support them in their achievements, be it getting a job, learning how to cook or moving into their own home.  We provide highly specialised support for people whose lives have been turned upside down by a catastrophic brain injury following an accident or a stroke.  We help them to relearn the skills they need to live independently.  We help people for whom a mental health difficulty or a setback in life has meant that they cannot continue in their career and need help to rebuild their confidence and skills, retrain and get back into the workplace.</p><p>  We are proud of what we do and how we do it.  We are most proud of the achievements of our clients.  Ours is known, both nationally and internationally, as an entrepreneurial "can do" and innovative organisation, willing to take risks for our clients, to enable them to live as full a life as possible, and we do this while, at the same time, thankfully, giving value for money to our customers.</p></speech>

I welcome the words of the HSE, which confirm our compliance with the service arrangements in place.  RehabCare is the health and social care division of the Rehab Group.  We are a not-for-profit voluntary organisation and a registered charity.  We are located in every county and structured to deliver our services through operational regions, with a devolved management responsibility and accountability.  RehabCare has developed significantly and we are currently one of the main employers in the health and social care sector.  We work closely and collaborate with the Health Service Executive disability services and services for the older person.  We have developed a reputation for being a solution-focused can-do organisation which responds promptly and flexibly to complex situations, many of which involve people in crisis.</p><p>  From a contractual perspective, we have 22 service level arrangements with additional grant aid agreements that we deliver.  These contracts clearly set out budgets, performance targets, quality standards, monitoring and compliance requirements.  Planned meetings take place on an ongoing basis to review compliance with service arrangements, formulate solutions for people in difficulty and consider key developments in networking and partnership.  We have recorded 122 review meetings with the HSE to consider all the areas in which we deliver regarding compliance.  We submit quarterly returns to the HSE regions in respect of key performance indicators and regional national returns such as complaints, Children First compliance, monthly respite key performance indicators and service user attendant records.  That has been confirmed this morning.</p><p>  Since 2008 RehabCare has experienced cuts of &euro;6.4 million, in line with annual funding cuts across the sector.  Naturally, cuts of this nature have a significant impact on the independent organisation, resulting in deficits for three years.  However, we are committed to protecting front-line services and we implemented challenging cost-containment plans which resulted in our coming in line and managing within our budget for 2012 and 2013.  Not only that, we also increased the number of service users by 838 during this time.</p><p>  Our resource centres are our day facilities and there are 48 across the country, all of which are accredited with EQUASS assurance, or the European Quality in Social Services Award.  We deliver services on a daily basis to 1,500 people attending those facilities.  They have individual person-centred plans, programmes, outlines and goals in their lives to enable them to achieve their potential.  There are seven respite centres, which are residential services with a two-pronged approach to supporting people with disabilities.  Three of these deal with children and four deal with adults.  We delivered 7,294 bed nights for people with disabilities in 2013.  Within our residential services we support 219 people, with 79 having very complex care needs.  In most cases, our services must have waking night duty and sleep-over staff.  Many of the people in those services are unable to articulate needs and they must often resort to challenging behaviour to be able to communicate needs, which results in very difficult and challenging environments.</p><p>  Our supported accommodation services support 140 people living in their own homes within communities.  We support 962 people in the country with home services.  In 2013, we delivered 190,569 hours of home support, which involves helping the person get out of bed in the morning, administering medication, providing meals and supporting the person in going to bed at night.  Many of these people would not be able to survive in their own homes in the community without the support of our highly qualified staff.  We provide individual packages of support to 85 service users and 22,560 hours of outreach services were delivered in 2013.</p><p>  We do not only deliver and comply with contractual arrangements, as RehabCare is able to produce enhanced services and value for money.  I will give one example before I finish, that of HeadsUp, a RehabCare service targeted at improving young people's mental health and well-being.  HeadsUp was set up as part of a fund-raising and health promotion initiative for young people.</p></speech>

I am the director of training, education and employment services for the Rehab Group.</p><p>  The National Learning Network is about removing the barriers that prevent people from progressing.  I refer to people who have barriers in their lives, such as early school leavers, people with sporadic work history, low literacy and numeracy ability, acquired brain injuries and illness and mental health issues, including not being able to function, not being able to get out of bed in the morning and looking at suicide as the only option.  I refer to people who are really suffering.  We work with people who are recovering addicts and with ex-offenders.  More recently, we have been awarded contracts to assist the long-term unemployed.</p><p>  Our programmes are equally applicable to many people.  We work with people and explore what they want to achieve and analyse what is needed to educate them and what will improve their social inclusion.  Our clients range in age from three to 65 years and we work with primary schools, further education and SOLAS.  I wish to acknowledge the positive comments made by SOLAS and the HSE earlier.  Our outcomes speak for themselves.  On average, 90% of the people who complete our programme get into employment or further education every year.  We have highly qualified staff who form multidisciplinary teams.  An interesting staff statistic is that 75% of our costs relate to pay, of which 91% is spent on front-line services provision.</p><p>  We have recently entered into a F&Aacute;S contract for training, which we tendered for.  We have been successful in the provision of courses for the long-term unemployed.  We have tried to diversify our business because we believe the skills we have acquired through the provision of support services to people with disabilities represent an opportunity for the wider population.</p><p>  All of our work is underpinned by service level agreements.  We have had 23 service level agreements with the HSE and a similar number with SOLAS.  The agreements govern quality as well as the various Acts that we work under.  They also govern outcomes and key performance indicators.  We exceed our quality standards.  The National Learning Network has been awarded a level 5 excellence award in every centre in the country.  We have also been awarded the European quality and social services excellence award.  Last year we had 159 review meetings with SOLAS and 235 review meetings with F&Aacute;S.</p><p>  NLN is about working within the community.  It is about dealing with people who are marginalised - people who are looking to remove barriers but need support to pursue further education, training or employment.  We provide a wide range of courses such as culinary skills, catering skills, business, IT, games design and web design.  We work with 3,500 employers.  They work with us to provide real jobs and real work experience.  We have 50 locations in Ireland and we now provide services to more than 7,000 people through a range of very well qualified staff, teachers, psychologists, programme development officers and rehabilitation officers.  We put the client at the centre of everything we do.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  If Ms Kelly and Ms Keane have a copy of their statements, perhaps they will circulate them to the members and to the press gallery.</p><p>  Before calling Deputy McDonald, I must say something to Ms Kerins.  There might be people who will hang on her every word and might consider her comment on what we published on the website as a bit of a ticking off for the Committee of Public Accounts.  I must say that in preparation for this meeting we had to ask each of the agencies for a submission.  As we do our business in public, that submission is then published on our website.  If she has a concern about that - which she has articulated - then I suggest that she take the matter up with the agencies that provided us with the information.  We would not be aware of the commercial sensitivity or otherwise of the documents.  Generally speaking, if there is something sensitive in them, it would be redacted for us.  We published the documents as we got them from the different agencies.</p><p>  I ask Deputy McDonald to commence.</p></speech>

I welcome all of the witnesses.  We are in the strange situation whereby the number of witnesses equals the number of members.  That will make it a fair match this morning.</p><p>  I shall start with Ms Kerins.  When the committee invited her to attend we were quite specific about the witnesses that we asked her to bring along.  The clerk had been in communication with her in respect of the remuneration committee of Rehab and specifically regarding Mr. Flannery, her predecessor.  Why are those persons not in attendance today?</p></speech>

We have brought along representatives of RehabCare, the National Learning Network and our charitable lotteries.</p><p>  Frank Flannery is no longer working for the Rehab Group and has not been an employee of the Rehab Group for what must be seven years now.  I will be in a position to deal with issues in relation to remuneration, should they come up.  Our whole focus - and that is why we required clarity on what we needed to prepare today in relation to what that we are working on - is on the three areas mentioned in the invitation letter.  It was felt that the team that has been fielded today were the best placed to respond to those questions.</p></speech>

None the less, the committee considered it important to have people with specialist knowledge in respect of pay and pensions in attendance.  It specifically asked for the attendance of Mr. Frank Flannery, who is quite a regular attendee around the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Did Ms Kerins pass the invitation on to him?  Did she invite him to attend?  Is there a reason, from his perspective, why he is not here?</p></speech>

Obviously people would be aware of any invitation.  To reply to the Deputy's question, the comittee members have in front of them the people who are most competent to speak about the salaries and remuneration of the staff who are funded through the HSE and SOLAS.  There are no staff funded through the charitable lotteries compensation fund.</p></speech>

The reason Mr. Flannery is significant is the same reason Ms Kerins is significant in an assessment of Rehab.  It is because she, as Mr. Flannery did before her, occupies the position of CEO of the Rehab Group.  We will come to the issue of pay and pensions in due course.  The committee believed Mr. Flannery would have something to say and contribute on these matters.  Ms Kerins has reassured us that any question we have to put to Mr. Flannery can be fielded and responded to by her and her team.</p></speech>

The problem is that Ms Kerins, publicly and stubbornly, has maintained a position that, because she has commercial interests, the public, including volunteers and those who contribute to the organisation in charitable donations, are not to meddle, interfere or ask questions that Rehab, in its collective wisdom, deems to be inappropriate or commercially sensitive.</p></speech>

In her opening statement Ms Kerins emphasised that Rehab was not a State-run organisation and that its staff were not public servants.  This has been reiterated by the HSE.  Interestingly, I have a copy of a recommendation from the Labour Court.  In 2010 Ms Kerins sought to impose pay cuts on staff in line with those in the public sector.  It makes for interesting reading because the argument of Rehab, as stated in the document,  makes a very clear link between public service pay rates and Rehab staff, irrespective of the fact that they are not public servants.  The second prong to the argument is that the group is fully dependent on funders, in other words, public funders such as SOLAS, the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Will Ms Kerins explain the anomaly to me?</p></speech>

We had to make a difficult decision about the services being delivered and to make pay adjustments for all staff in the relevant companies from February 2010.  As soon as the organisation was advised of the reduction in fees, management immediately engaged with the staff working in the relevant divisions to inform them of the need for adjustment.  The pay adjustments were applied to all grades of staff, with the reductions ranging from 5% in the case of staff on lower incomes to more than 10% at higher management levels.  The management team met staff all over the country to communicate the necessity for the reductions within the organisation.  Following implementation of the pay reductions, SIPTU, in representing a number of staff who had been impacted on, brought the matter to the Labour Court which in a ruling in January 2012 found that the reductions were necessary to maintain the viability of the organisation and the employment it provided.  It recommended that the union accept the pay adjustments.  Subsequently, the organisation agreed a solution with SIPTU and staff representatives and the matter was resolved in 2012.</p></speech>

The group chief executive is responsible for the totality of the organisation, not only in Ireland but elsewhere also.  As I said - I will go back through the methodology we have used for many years; in fact, for well over a decade - it has always been the case that there has been independent assessment by experts of the remuneration of the group management team within the Rehab Group.  It is not a case of people deciding what they earn themselves; it is independently and expertly done.  The organisations which do this are well recognised for what they do.  The salaries of the staff within the organisations about which we are talking, as the Deputy heard my colleagues say, are benchmarked, if that is the appropriate word - I ask my two colleagues to comment on this - against salaries within the sectors in which they are operating.</p></speech>

We have the position where the staff are benchmarked within their sector.  I am not speculating, as I have it in the recommendation, that Ms Kerins argued vigorously that public service rates of pay and pay movements had to be observed for the staff.  Then we find she takes a very different approach in her own case and that of her senior executive colleagues.  We have established this and I find that it jars with me.  I imagine it jars with a lot of people looking at her organisation that some are more equal than others and that some categories of staff further down the line have regard to public pay policy but those at the top do not.  In fact, that is shocking, but it is the situation as she has set it out.</p><p>  Let us talk about Ms Kerins's salary and the benchmarking process to which she referred.  Am I correct that her salary is &euro;240,000?</p></speech>

In addition to the &euro;240,000, I understand she has the use of a company car and a fairly attractive pension arrangement which stands at 6%.  I understand it is a defined contribution scheme.</p></speech>

They cited research which might interest Ms Kerins, in terms of benchmarking, which showed that the average remuneration for CEOs and managers in charities is &euro;59,000 per year, with no bonuses or top-ups.

There are people in the not-for-profit sector who are running one reasonably large charity who are earning &euro;100,000 to &euro;140,000.  Then there are other smaller charities with approximately &euro;2 million in turnover and their CEOs would be on salaries of between &euro;80,000 and &euro;90,000.  What I am trying to say is that the post of chief executive cannot be evaluated in name only.  One needs to look at the total size of the organisation and its breadth in order to establish the proper remuneration for the leadership of that organisation.</p></speech>

The Rehab Group is a group of charities.  The Rehab Group is not just one organisation, nor is it in just one sector.  I can really understand that when people look at the Rehab Group, they do not really know the totality of what it is and they would probably just see it as a particular charity.  We span general industry and the benchmark for the post of group chief executive is based on general industry.</p></speech>

I can tell her that the public is well aware that Rehab is a group.  We are well aware and well conversant in this committee with the variety of activities in which Rehab is engaged.  I put it to Ms Kerins that she earns more than the President of the United States of America.  She earns more than the Taoiseach, senior Ministers and people who hold very significant briefs.  She operates in a sector and to an ethos, according to Ms Kerins, of social inclusion and social engagement.  She relies on very large quantities of State moneys.  In fact, they form the backbone and the bedrock of the entire Rehab enterprise in my view.  She also relies on charitable donations - which we will come to in moment - and on the voluntary effort of people who get paid nothing.  Seen through that prism, does Ms Kerins understand that it is very difficult to square the mission of the Rehab Group, its reliance on the State and on voluntary effort and contributions with a basic salary of &euro;240,000 per annum.  Is that an alien concept to Ms Kerins?  Are we operating on completely different planets?</p></speech>

However, in her commentary, she forgets that there is a significant other part of the Rehab Group.  There is a significant part of the group that is not in Ireland and a significant part that is commercial.  In addition to all of the very important work that Rehab Care, NLN and other organisations within the Rehab Group do, there is a very significant commercial organisation and the running of businesses within that organisation.  I mentioned our recycling business already today, which is the largest recycling business in this country.  Regarding social progress, I have said it many times, a social enterprise is about creating jobs.  We have created quite a substantial number of jobs and continue to do so, but there is a huge challenge in maintaining jobs, particularly in this country.  It is not just the delivery of services, which is very important and terribly challenging at times.  There is also the issue of ensuring the 2,300 people in this country who are working for us continue to work for us and not just in the charity arena but also in the broad church-----</p></speech>

Let us turn now to the commercial aspect because Ms Kerins has laid emphasis on it.  I wish to ask about one specific commercial venture and ask Ms Kerins to shed some light on it.  Rehab had a relationship with an organisation called Complete Eco Solutions Limited.  I checked it today and it is currently described as being involved in the wholesale of electrical household appliances and radio and television goods.  It has two named directors, Mr. Frank Flannery, to whom we referred earlier, and Mr. Joseph McCarthy.  I understand that both gentlemen are known to Ms Kerins.</p> <p>We know Mr. Frank Flannery but will Ms Kerins identify Mr. Joseph McCarthy? </p></speech>

A number of years ago, Rehab Group wanted to get into this business.  In piloting and checking to see if that venture is what it wanted to do, it was helped by this organisation.  There was no financial benefit to anybody.  The Complete Eco Solutions Limited, having done some trading in China, agreed to help Rehab Group.  It was a pilot project that did not progress.  There was no further involvement by Complete Eco Solutions Limited.</p></speech>

I am sure the matter could be established quite easily.</p><p>  Complete Eco Solutions Limited set up shop in 2009.  As I understood the turn of events, Rehab initially imported materials for the construction of these coffins directly from China and that afterwards, Complete Eco Solutions Limited became an intermediary, a third party.  In other words rather than the raw materials coming directly to Rehab, Complete Eco Solutions Limited was an agent.</p></speech>

I wish to put a question to Ms Kerins on her earlier contribution this morning on the Rehab lottery.  Ms Kerins disputes the audit claim that &euro;700,000 was spent on communications, publicity and so on.  Ms Kerins stated that the funds were not used for lobbying but for advocacy work with clients.  Will Ms Kerins tell me in the simplest terms she can muster what that means?

We have put quite a bit of effort and we continue to develop the advocacy skills of the clients across Rehab Group.  We have a number of advocacy officers working with Rehab Group.  One of the delegates heads that up.  Some members will have been involved in our voter education programmes that were run through the advocacy service.  Leading up to an election we bring in local authority members or politicians running for election in order that the politicians would meet and talk to our clients.  All the political parties have done that.</p><p>  There are many aspects to this service.  It is a pity in some ways that members cannot see the video because it would give them a very good view of what advocacy means to our clients.</p></speech>

The report recommends that a funding contract specifically state the deliverables and the reporting and monitoring processes in place.  The report also found that some of the cost to which the charitable lotteries funding had applied appears to have been of an administrative nature and the recommendations were that allowable costs and the specific use of the funds should be clearly defined and agreed annually.  The report noted that the Rehab lottery had high costs.  The internal audit recommended that ongoing funding to the scheme required that findings and recommendations outlined by it be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

There was no breakdown for hospitality.  It was included in a list that informed the committee that some of these costs were administrative.

As I said in my opening statement, the Department took over the administration of the charitable lotteries fund in the middle of 2011.  In light of what was going on at that time with regard to general Government expenditure and the expenditure of individual Departments and agencies, I think it would have been prudent for the Department, in the context of the overall review it was doing, to conduct a review of all lines of expenditure within the Department, which is what we were doing.  As the Deputy will recall from her experience in the Committee of Public Accounts, a comprehensive expenditure review was carried out at the time by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This would have been a follow-on from a part of that process as it applied to the Department of Justice and Equality, so it would have been entirely prudent to carry out that audit at the time.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair for his forbearance.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's key concern related to the profit margin on the lottery scratch cards.  A profit of &euro;10,000 was made on card sales of &euro;4 million.  Bingo sales of &euro;3.2 million resulted in profits of &euro;548,000.  Rehab had gross lottery sales of &euro;7.2 million, but this resulted in profits of just &euro;558,000, or 8%.  What does Ms Kerins have to say about that?</p></speech>

There was no definition of "administration" prior to the audit for 2011.  Indeed, the audit itself recommended that there should be a definition of what constituted "administrative costs".  The rules that are now set down in this regard were drawn up in 2013.  I suggest that one cannot judge the submissions of 2011 on the basis of the rules of 2013.  It just does not work.  The funding we get from the charity lottery compensation fund is purely based on our sales and the percentage of our sales.  Regardless of what we would like to submit in relation to items, the only way we can draw money down from the charity lottery compensation scheme is through the amount of sales we have in the charity lottery market, averaged over three years.  First and foremost, the amount of money we draw down is limited by that, rather than by the list of items we shove in.</p></speech>

It may be the case that not everybody is aware of it.  We submit, or over-submit, a list of items that the Department can take from as eligible.  In the year the Deputy is talking about, we submitted items to a greater value of &euro;250,000 above what we can claim from.  We have no idea what items were chosen and what items were not chosen.  Not in any year would we get a report on our drawdown, setting out what items were deemed eligible and what items were deemed ineligible.  We never had any difficulty regarding our claim with the Department of Finance at the time, and we have no difficulty regarding our claim with the Department of Justice and Equality now.  We cannot itemise, or say that X, Y and Z were chosen by the Department, because we do not know.  All we did was submit what we considered to be eligible in relation to the scheme.  I remind the committee that there was no definition of "administration" at that time.  We would have submitted what was eligible.  The Department of Finance and, following on, the Department of Justice and Equality, which has now taken over the scheme, would make those decisions.  They have never come back to us and said "this or this" or "you do not have enough eligible claims here to draw down your whole amount to which you are entitled within the scheme".  That is all I can say on the matter of clarity.</p></speech>

Some section 39 organisations were implementing such pay increases as if it was public policy.</p></speech>

After those agreements, section 38 organisations and direct public employees would not have received pay rises other than in the form of allowable increments.  In fact, they would have had pay reductions.  Section 39 organisations, which are a variety of organisations in both the profit and not-for-profit sectors, would have had a variety of arrangements in place.  At a global level, they would have had reductions in funding from us but we would not have visibility and nor would we have directed them in relation to the pay rates of their personnel.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Kerins.  I am very much aware of the work done by Rehab.  We have received much information on the group and how it operates this morning.  I have accounts here for National Learning Network Limited and Rehab Care and I appreciate there are other enterprise services with an annual turnover of approximately &euro;103 million - that was the figure last year.  It is very hard to identify who pays for whom and how the organisation manages to spread around shared administration costs.  I ask Ms Kerins to explain the position.  I have seen staff salaries in the accounts.  Are the directors of any of the companies paid?  Is it correct that all directors and members of the board work on a voluntary basis?</p></speech>

In Ireland, the three main operators are the National Learning Network, Rehab Care and a number of enterprise activities.  We also have our lotteries.  What the Deputy has before her is not a company structure but a management structure, which seemed to be the easiest way to talk about it.  There would be a number of not-for-profit charities and commercial companies in there.  Some of them are based here, some are based in the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland where there is a lot of development, and some are based in Eindhoven in the Netherlands and Poland.  The array of enterprise activities is quite spread.</p><p>   The training activity is in Ireland and the UK.  People have made comments already in relation to the wider Middle Eastern development, which is in the whole area of training.  The training division and the health care division span the geographies, some more than others.  The enterprises are wider.  They are the ones that are in Poland.  </p></speech>

Our clients are funded only on the days they are in.  They are not funded if they are off the course.  We need to work on full occupancy.  We provided an additional 144 places at the reduced fee.  That was part of our efficiency.  We changed the assessment process quite significantly in that we changed the application, we interviewed candidates, we carried out health reports for individuals before they started on the programme, including assessing their risk factors, and there was greater involvement by psychologists.  We looked at the motor reviews of the individuals by the rehabilitation officer and the regional psychologist.  We streamlined and made the process more focused on the learner in order to reduce the number of people who were placed on a course that did not suit all their needs.</p></speech>

If the Deputy understands, our clients have many difficulties including injury and mental health.  Quite often they will have an episode in which they will come off the programme for a period of three or four weeks and re-enter the programme.  Once they are off a certain length of time we are not funded.  Plus, this allows another person to come onto the programme.  Really, it is about making the most efficient use of the programmes.  We also operate a flexible intake, which means people can come onto our programmes at any time, so one is not waiting for the start of an academic year.  As in the case of many colleges, there is a difficulty in retaining the numbers.  Having started with the full number, by the end of January or February they have lost probably 40%.  Of the number of non-completions or drop-outs - which is a horrible term - 50% of those will return because they leave the programme for medical reasons.  At the moment we are looking at a discharge rate of 37%, half of whom will come back in when they have dealt with their difficulties.</p><p>  Our outcomes are very strong and they are much stronger by international comparison.  We would be seen as the leading edge across Europe.  On average, 90% of those who complete our programmes enter into employment or further education and training.  Many of our clients progress to F&Aacute;S courses, now provided by the local education and training boards, which will provide further continuing education.  It is about getting people on the first step of the ladder and giving them the confidence to go back to education and achieve some level of certification and some level of work experience and scope outside the academic world.  We give them certification but also the supports they require to deal with keeping well and any other difficulties.</p></speech>

Discussions have taken place previously between SOLAS and ourselves about starting the tendering process.  SOLAS has set out three priorities, including streamlining - that is, making the programmes more efficient - which is the key priority, and changing the programmes to reflect labour market awareness.  We provide labour market activation programmes and look at what is required in the local area.  We are in every county in Ireland and have 50 locations.

Maybe I should be asking Mr. Paul O'Toole this question.

Within that group, which we call specialist training providers, there are another 16 organisations which provide more specific services to particular cohorts.  They are much smaller.  They are all not-for-profit charities in their own right.  In terms of a commercial competitor, there is no obvious one at present.  It does not mean there cannot be one, but there is no obvious one at present.</p></speech>

It has certainly been considered.  It was considered by F&Aacute;S in 2009-2010.  We discussed the issue internally and we discussed it with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation at the time.  We set out a path of three points, which are set out in my statement.  We thought there were three important building blocks: efficiency - that is, reducing the rate; improving the service - we have been on a programme of continuous improvement; and testing the market, although we have not to date tested the market.  The organisation is no longer F&Aacute;S, as it has been dissolved.  In future those contracts will be offered through 16 separate organisations.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McGuire" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014022700018#R03100"><p>That is not quite correct.  As an overview, every year Rehab makes in excess of &euro;2.5 million on its lottery activities, including the income from Care Trust Limited.  </p><p>  To go back to what the Deputy was hinting at, last year Care Trust Limited contributed approximately &euro;1.7 million or &euro;1.8 million to both shareholders.  It is a very different lottery from the national lottery and our other lotteries.  Tickets are sold through a different distribution mechanism, through subscription, and because of this it is a very efficient lottery, on which the return last year was 54%.  Therefore, the proceeds were 54%.  I am relating this to indicate that we do run and are involved in some very effective and high profit lotteries.  For reference, the national lottery provides a return of 31%, based on a massive turnover and volume of &euro;730 million last year.  Separately, Rehab has another subscription lottery which has a net profit of approximately 36%.</p><p>  Coming to the two lotteries to which the Deputy probably wants to refer, these are the two lotteries that directly face the national lottery.  We sell through retail outlets our radio bingo and scratch cards.  They contributed in the year referenced in the D&aacute;il by the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, &euro;560,000.  Members of the committee may think this is a small amount of money, but it is very important to us in the context of the services we provide in the way they have been explained to the committee.  In percentage terms, the amount is small and we would dearly love it to be greater.  The only reason it is so low is the unfair cap on lottery prizes in that sector in which we are competing head-on with the national lottery.  Our response to the Government is that if there is a genuine interest in having highly profitable authority lotteries, with returns comparable to those for the national lottery, the unfair cap on lottery prizes must be removed to enable us to compete on a fair basis.</p></speech>

While those agencies are asked to have due regard, they are not strictly speaking obliged to do that.  It is important to stress that if we applied full public sector norms, in many instances it is likely that we would find that the range of benefits available to staff in section 39 organisations are below those that would apply if they were in section 38 or public agencies.  There was some discussion earlier about defined benefit pension schemes.   Such schemes would be absolutely standard for the vast majority of staff in section 38 organisations, and would be more exceptional in current day terms for section 39 organisations.  We do not see like-for-like benefits, so doing exact comparisons is not really practicable.  Equally, it is not in the public interest, or in the interest of the HSE as the funding body, to seek to drive section 39 organisations into being equivalent to section 38 organisations, because that would inevitably reduce the flexibility of that service provision and increase the cost of it in an overall sense.</p><p>  We are focusing specifically on disclosure of pay at the higher levels of the entities with which we have contracts, which are these two subsidiaries in this instance, as opposed to Rehab Group as a whole.</p></speech>

My salary - I am happy to share this information with the Deputy - is independently assessed by external experts, as are those of other members of the Rehab Group management team.  We have no say in it.  It is independent of us and goes to the board which decides whether to accept it.  That is how it has always been.  It is benchmarked against general industry.

They see an organisation that receives significant funding from the public purse and in which Ms Kerins&rsquo;s salary does not specifically come from the private, enterprise company but from the group company above it.  It comes out of a pool of funds, 95% of which comes from the State for RehabCare and National Learning Network.  For the overall Rehab Group, State funding is just short of 50%.  Does Ms Kerins understand that the person looking in will ask how she reconciles taking &euro;83 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money with having a salary that exceeds public pay guidelines?  That is the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Angela Kerins" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014022700020#U02400"><p>We do not take &euro;83 million from the State.  We deliver &euro;83 million worth of services to the State.  Every penny of that money is associated with a cost in service delivery and within the organisations and the service level agreements in the organisation represented here.  It is important that people do not think the State just gives us money.  We sign contracts, like any other subcontractor, with the State and deliver services for that money.  It is not free money rattling around; it is directly associated with the cost base for service delivery.  The HSE and Solas have to ensure that is the case and they are validating this now.  We all want to ensure they are reassured.</p><p>  The Rehab Group is much broader than these two companies; there is much more going on in many countries.  The remuneration of the management team is fairly and independently assessed for its size.  The Rehab Group has been compared with semi-State bodies; it is not a section 39 organisation.  The funding stream for National Learning Network and RehabCare is through section 39.  Approximately &euro;40 million worth of services are purchased from the private sector and I am not sure whether it comes through section 39 or another section.  They are disability services.  There are private for-profit companies competing with not-for-profit organisations for the contracts to deliver residential, respite and day care services.  It is not the case that Rehab simply gets a pile of money from the two organisations and can do what it likes with it - it cannot.  We have to meet very specific and comprehensive contracts.  There are also quality measurements, as my colleagues said.  We have a level 5 award from the European Foundation for Quality Management, EFQM, and there are European quality systems.  We put all of these through and support them from a company and a group perspective. </p><p>  It would be narrow and misleading to compare Rehab with a normal, regular charity because it is much broader than that.  Neither can it be compared with the private sector because the private sector does not have a not-for-profit ethos.  It cannot be compared with the State because we have to pay our own bills.  If contracts are withdrawn, which sometimes happens, or we lose one, the cost base of redundancy, etc. sits with us.  The Rehab Group does not enjoy the comfort of being a public sector organisation.  I am not saying it is easy to be a public sector organisation, as people work very hard in the public sector and there are some very good people working in it.  Most of them are superb, hard-working individuals.  The matter is complicated.  It is neither a private nor a public sector organisation; it is a not-for-profit organisation which combines all of these aspects.</p></speech>

Therefore, there is a good spread of organisations among the 2,500 funded under section 39.  For the purposes of competition and procurement, under the section the HSE is not an entity for the purposes of the legislation; therefore, we are not required, provided we are satisfied there is good value and so on, to enter into competitive procurement in the way we would in the case of some purely commercial services we purchase.  There is a great variety of organisations of various scale doing a variety of things.  The chief executive of the Rehab Group has just given a fair overall description of the diversity in the sector.</p></speech>

Bonuses, or performance-related pay, are paid on the basis of key targets being reached.  For example, in the sales area which most people can understand better a person getting a bonus must achieve a certain level of sales.  It is no different in the case of any other staff member in the organisation who may or may not in the past or may have in the future performance-related pay.  Targets are set at the beginning of the year in the budgets and business plans for the year.  That is how the bonuses are established, to what percentage was the target or a number of targets achieved.</p></speech>

I would have to meet particular targets to achieve a bonus.  That is the extent of it.  The reality is that I have not had a bonus for many years.  To be quite honest, I do not know what it was in 2009.  It is not my intention to look for it in years to come.  A lot of organisations buy out bonus payments if they do not wish to pay them any longer or if people do not wish to receive them.

The point I am making is that the Rehab Group appears to contain an even mix of private and public funding, in that 50% of its turnover comes from the State, yet it is all under the one umbrella.  Was separating the public side from the private side ever considered to have absolute clarity?  I agree that the group delivers services, but the funding is coming from the public purse, no matter which way one looks at it, and there is a cloud.  Was dividing the group to make part of it private and part of it public ever considered?  That would provide absolute clarity about the public funding mechanisms.  </p><p>  How does Ms Kerins explain to an outsider that in respect of one element of the lottery - the scratch card - it virtually made no profit - &euro;10,000 - in the past couple of years on a turnover of &euro;4 million?  It is a little like chasing the dragon.  Is it an inefficient lottery system, with the public purse providing matching funding?  How can Ms Kerins justify having a lottery scratch card resulting in a profit of &euro;10,000 on of a turnover of &euro;4 million?  On a turnover of &euro;3.2 million in the case of bingo cards, there was probably a profit of &euro;450,000.  I ask Ms Kerins to deal with these questions.</p></speech>

The organisation is a very busy one and this issue has really started to rear its head again in the past couple of months.  I said in my opening statement that we had to look at the structure of the organisation to see how effectively it could restructure the commercial side and the not-for-profit side in order that there was absolute clarity for everyone.  Our organisation is terribly complex and very complicated to explain.  No matter how many times-----</p></speech>

However, when one is trying to talk about an organisation that is involved in so many different areas - and most people know the Rehab that they face, whether it is through its services or our recycling companies and whether it is in the UK, Scotland or Poland - everybody has a different view of it.  They think they know what it is.  It is amazing how many times we have to break through the barrier of people thinking they know what it is in order to try to explain it.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  We have got to make matters clearer and we need to restructure our operations in order to do that.  This matter is heavy on our minds.  There is already a committee in place within the Rehab Group which is taking advice from our auditors, the PwCs of the world and our legal people as to how best we might do this.  If anybody has an interest in contributing to that process, we would be delighted to hear from them.  We need to do it because it is more than overdue.  We need to get it done this year.  The sooner we can complete it, the better.  There are areas in respect of which we require, for very good reasons, quite a number of these company structures.  It could be as a result of grant-aid issues or because they are in a different jurisdiction or whatever.  Without a doubt, however, the Deputy is absolutely right.  Hopefully we will have this piece of work done by year end.  It will be good and positive for the organisation to ensure that it underpins our growth.  We want to grow the organisation and create more services and jobs.</p><p>  I would like Mr. McGuire to answer the Deputy's second question.  Mr. McGuire has been involved in Rehab Lotteries for many years.  If the Deputy does not object, I will pass that question over.</p></speech>

Each year we are making in excess of &euro;2.5 million in net proceeds from all our lottery activity.  Scratch cards have suffered because sales have gone down.  Sales in the year to which the Minister referred in the D&aacute;il, 2010, were just under &euro;4 million.  They have dropped progressively over the years, because of the unfair cap on charity lotteries, from &euro;10 million to just under &euro;4 million.</p></speech>

There are two products that qualify for the charitable lotteries compensation fund: radio bingo and scratch cards.  It is a little artificial to separate the two because we are relying on the same system to sell them both.  They are sold in the same type of shop and the same overhead looks after both products.  To answer the Deputy's question, as a result of the fact that we are the dominant player in the market we have been receiving a percentage in the high 60s of the total fund in any one year.  As the representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality have explained, the fund has varied from year to year.  The maximum value was &euro;8.6 million.  It was down to &euro;4 million last year and is due to fall to &euro;2 million this year.  Of that amount and between the two qualifying turnovers that we have, we receive approximately 68% of the total.</p></speech>

On bingo sales, it only makes a profit of approximately &euro;450,000 from a turnover of &euro;3.2 million.  How is that happening?</p></speech>

I will focus first on our biggest cost in respect of scratch cards.  In order to be competitive we give back to the public the same prizes as the national lottery.  So for every &euro;1 scratch card we sell, 66 cent goes on prizes.  That is a big chunk.  Many people are of the view that if they spend &euro;1 on a scratch card, Rehab receives the full amount.  It does not work like that.  The other direct cost relates to the commission of 12.5% we give to the retailers that sell our tickets.  In the context of income to us, we do not get 100%.  Another very obvious direct cost relates to the fact that these tickets must be printed.</p></speech>

Our biggest cost relates to the infrastructure we have in place to run the business.  We need people to sell tickets and invoice retailers and we need credit control.  We have streamlined that cost over the years.  There are ten people working for Rehab Lotteries now.  The annual payroll is, from memory, &euro;430,000.  That includes everything: pension contributions, PRSI, etc.  At one point we were turning over &euro;10 million and making a profit each year of between &euro;2.5 million and &euro;3 million from our scratch cards - which were a brilliant product for us - but our business has been decimated over the years by the aggressive tactics of the national lottery on one hand, and the unfair cap on lottery prizes on the other.  As the lottery market developed and people began to understand it better, the national lottery started to bring in new products.  Initially it was just scratch cards but then the lotto was introduced, with mega-prizes of up to &euro;190 million.  How could we compete with that?  Our sales went like that and that.  When we go to the retail trade, we are stronger going with two products than with one.  Will we get out of the scratch card business, even though the profitability might be great?  I would say "No".  Why not?  Because we would always be hopeful that a fair Government at some time - either the current Administration or a future one - would address this issue and bring equality and fairness into the market.  There should not be one set of rules for the State-owned national lottery, which can do anything it wants.  The charities are trying to compete with their hands tied behind their backs.  That is why the Government, recognising this, introduced the charitable lotteries fund.</p><p>  I am very pleased to be here today in front of this committee because other committees have considered the situation and that led to the charitable lotteries compensation fund.  The former Select Committee on Legislation and Security examined this matter in 1996.  The committee, which was chaired by Deputy Charles Flanagan, unanimously recommended that the cap on prizes be removed.  For the committee's attention, one of the members of that committee was the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who at that time-----</p></speech>

Picking up on the point regarding salaries on which Deputy O'Donnell finished, it is clear from Ms Kerins's earlier contribution that there is some clarity around the fact that the bulk of State funding goes to two particular companies in the Rehab Group.

I further note that Ms Kerins, in her opening statement said that total remuneration of the senior management team would be published at some stage.  I note she said "total remuneration" and not individual remuneration packages for senior management teams, which would generally be the requirement for positions that are essentially funded by the public purse.</p></speech>

We have consulted the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to disclosure.  One cannot disclose private information on individuals if they do not give one the permission to do so.  That is the law and we cannot break it.  I waived all that.  That is why Rehab could do that because it was waived.  If somebody does waive their rights, it can be seen as that they are doing it under duress.  Let us put that into context.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to get a system of disclosure that is appropriate and acceptable in relation to our senior management.  I think that is important.  The board of the Rehab Group, in responding, said that it would disclose.  It mentioned, if my memory serves me right, FR102.  I think we should do it before that; I think we should do it far sooner than that.  We should try to ensure we can do it in relation to this year.  That is my hope and I hope that is what we will do.</p></speech>

That is reflected in an article in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>, if I many discuss that for a moment, and it was touched upon to a degree by Deputy McDonald earlier, particularly around the necessity to cut pay packets and for wage moderation in the organisation in light of the situation in which the country found itself and in which Rehab's core-funders from the State-side found themselves  In that article, and I am sure Ms Kerins will recall this, a reference was made to getting, as I understand it, staff and union representatives who would have an interest in establishing financial information about the company in the normal course of events to sign confidentiality agreements in the context of a due diligence process around the financial position of the company.  In the normal course of events in my experience, if a company goes to a trade union and says it is in difficulty, the union often requests financial information, which is usually made available, and they can also request an independent financial adviser, a financial consultant, to do a due diligence exercise.  It is often then requested by the Labour Court but there seemed to be serious resistance to that at the time.  Can Ms Kerins, as the chief executive of Rehab, recall asking those who had that information in relation to the financial position of the company to sign confidentiality agreements?  This is in regard to the article in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>.</p></speech>

It is normal practice if one gets an independent financial consultant to come in and evaluate any company's financial records for a particular reason that this is confidential and confidentiality agreements are signed.  There was no particular issue raised against people receiving information on a confidentiality basis.  I am not aware that became an issue at the time in relation to the negotiations.</p></speech>

They generally refer to the fact that directors are explicitly forbidden from receiving remuneration from the organisation.  That is a fact, reflected in the organisation's memorandum and articles of association - in articles 33, 37.1 and 37.2, to the best of my recollection.  In most charities where a member of a board receives remuneration of any description, whether it be consultancy fees or anything else, the widespread practice would be that there may be an identifiable conflict of interest and it is usually the case that the director would stand down.  The person to whom I am referring is Frank Flannery.  It has been in the public domain, and Mr. Flannery has responded to this in the public domain, that he charged the organisation a total of &euro;77,000 for services in 2011 and 2012.</p></speech>

From time to time -  Frank Flannery is not the only person - we engage with companies in which directors have interest.  The proper way to deal with this is all activities in which directors are involved are disclosed fully in the accounts.  The Deputy will see that in all our accounts.  When a director is engaged or in receipt of any fees for service, that is fully disclosed.  That is the proper way of dealing with this.</p></speech>

I believe Deputy O'Donnell also may have viewed its annual accounts, based on his line of questioning.  All of the legal material related to the establishment of Rehab, the ongoing work of Rehab, as well as its memorandum and articles of association, all state clearly that it is a charitable organisation, which is designed to support people with disabilities and those who experience disadvantage and I accept all of that.  At the same time however, notwithstanding the restrictions Ms Kerins states she is under, some of which I accept are quite valid, when seeking financial information from the organisation members are constantly referred to the issue of commercial sensitivity.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to a point regarding the position in which Rehab finds itself.  This is not an academic or an abstract point and it may be in the best interests of the organisation at some stage to find a way of addressing that issue because in my opinion, it is an extremely opaque way in which to operate.  Ms Kerins referred to how complicated it is but I would say it is opaque and I have formed the view it is deliberately opaque.  There are many efforts to hide behind the idea of commercial sensitivity that simply do not add up to me.  It is clear that the organisation, because of its charitable status, does not pay corporation tax in Ireland.  That is the case.  However, some notes in Rehab's accounts suggest it has paid an amount of corporation tax abroad.  Where was that?</p></speech>

Is this not the case?  It paid &euro;74,000 in totality.  I note the organisation made an operating surplus of &euro;2.944 million in 2011 and &euro;1.546 million in 2012.  This also is reflected in Rehab's accounts.</p><p>  There are a couple of other issues in the accounts to which I wish to draw Ms Kerins's attention.  Rehab does not pay deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, either and according to its most recent set of accounts had interest income of approximately &euro;1 million in 2011 and 2012.  Moreover, the company holds more than &euro;35 million in cash on deposit in banks, on which no DIRT was paid.  This is a situation that pertains, generally speaking, to charitable organisations.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

From an accounting point of view, there was a total gain to the company of &euro;59 million.  That is an accounting mechanism to reflect the wind-down of the defined benefit pension scheme.  On page 17, there is a point in respect of a settlement obligation of &euro;7 million in respect of the defined benefit scheme.  I ask Ms Kerins to elaborate on this.  What does it involve?</p></speech>

It relates to the closure of the scheme.  It had to do with the deferred members and the retiring members and so it was the total settlement in trying to close down that scheme.

Can Mr. O'Toole confirm my understanding that the unit cost, if I may put it like that, for trainees who are engaged in programmes with the National Learning Network on average is approximately &euro;15,000?  Alternatively, does it vary?</p></speech>

There is quite a high attrition rate.  Is it then the case that the National Learning Network receives all of the money allocated for that year?  Is there some retrenchment process or is some money returned if, for example, a trainee only spends a month or two in a programme due to a range of different factors that tend to occur in everyday life?  How does that operate?  Does SOLAS seek the return of such money if a programme or project is not completed or if a participant does not complete his or her training programme?</p></speech>

Would there be a considerable number of trainees at any given time on a Rehab NLN training programme who would then go on to work with the commercial element of Rehab?  In other words, is the organisation training individuals with State funding to continue to work in Rehab centres?  Is there a defined job path programme?  Subsequently, is there a form of mentoring?  In general, how many trainees would move out into the open employment market?</p></speech>

We would break down our percentages in our returns to SOLAS as: open labour market; open, part time and full time; and then there would be the subsidies.</p><p>  A very few individuals might apply for work within Rehab enterprise.  They all tend to go outside, and we encourage people to go outside into employment.  From the day they arrive into our centre, we are almost saying to them, "There's the door.  This is your goal.  Your goal is to go out there.  It is for community integration.

I would like to get a rundown of that scheme and how it works in practice, and I will base some of my questions on the internal audit that was done by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2012.</p><p>  To be clear on how the scheme works, Rehab gets an amount of funding from the Department based its level of ticket sales.  For example, in the year 2010-11, Rehab had nearly &euro;4 million of sales.  Is that sales by newsagents?</p></speech>

What we take off that, off the top, is the retailer's commission, so they keep that.  This is where it gets a little bit complicated to explain.  When printed tickets like these are used there are two types of prizes in the ticket.  There are what we call low-end prizes and high-end prizes.  In each pack, it is, if you like, a promise.  We give a guaranteed amount of low-end prizes so on the &euro;100, there might be, say, &euro;44 in guaranteed prizes.</p></speech>

Anything under &euro;20, the newsagent is paying out in his or her shop.  Is that how it operates?  The &euro;200 in sales is not going back to Rehab.

Only 30% is coming back to Rehab.  Let us consider it from a commercial point of view.  If I supplied to a sports company T-shirts for &euro;1 apiece and it sold them for &euro;10 apiece, I would not go back to my board of directors or shareholders and tell them my sales in the year were the sports company's takings on selling those T-shirts.  I would tell them my revenue was what I received from the sports company for the T-shirts.  It is the same arrangement with the newsagents.</p></speech>

We would invoice for the &euro;100.  From that, we take off the commission and the allowance for the low-end prizes.  Therefore, they are our sales.  We have to account for every ticket we issue so it is important we know where every ticket is.  That is the way we operate it.  In effect, the Deputy is correct that the only real money we actually get back is net of the prizes and commission.</p></speech>

We are and always have been incredibly focused on maximising the return on our scratch cards.  This was a cracking business for us for many years.  We had sales of up to &euro;10 million per year, and this was bringing in almost &euro;3 million in profit.  Right through the years, we have had a good business.  Now, we have stripped back the number employed in the company from 36 to ten or 11.  We need a basic amount of infrastructure to support it, and that has a cost.  Unfortunately, when one pays the prizes, commission and other bills, there is very little left.  We accept that and we are unhappy with it, and we would like it to be better.  We hope there will be better days ahead and we will stick in there hoping that.  Both the scratch cards and radio bingo product go into the same types of shops.  In their totality in the year to which the Minister referred, they were bringing in &euro;560,000 net.  This is wonderful income for us.  We would prefer it to be &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  We would do that.</p><p>  We are of the view that if there were fairness in the market in terms of there being no cap on the prizes, and if we could offer similar prizes to a competitor, we would have at least 10% or 15% of the market, representing turnover of approximately &euro;75 million or &euro;100 million, which would bring us in approximately &euro;30 million in profit.</p></speech>

We will address that or else the courts will take that view.  We are continually looking for other ways of developing our scratch card business.</p></speech>

Given what we had identified, the audit raised a concern that the costs associated with the Rehab lottery were very high, including the issues the Deputy mentioned about percentages, etc.  I should point out that there was full co-operation with Rehab during the course of the conduct of that audit.

We wanted to sit down with the Department and go through this report line by line to deal with the issues, and the overall context of how the Department saw the scheme.  In other words, it was not a grant scheme but a compensation scheme.  That is where the issues broke down.</p></speech>

It is a scheme of compensation that Rehab receives because competition in the market has been altered by Government legislation.  However, when one looks at something like the document from the Department of Finance in 2004, those involved do talk about it as a grant scheme.</p></speech>

In Ms Kerins's letter to the Department of Justice and Equality, she says there is not an Exchequer grant to organisations to provide services but according to the Department of Finance it is a grant scheme.  Ms Kerins says it is not appropriate for the Department of Justice and Equality to seek to influence the operations of a private body by insisting that its earned income be applied to certain areas.  When Ms Kerins made that point to the Department of Justice and Equality, was she saying that the Department could not tell Rehab whether it could spend this money on administrative services, IT procurement, bank interest fees, professional fees or advertising, as she had been spending the money prior to that point in time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Angela Kerins" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014022700027#BB03100"><p>Can I make two points on that?  Mr. McGuire may wish to come in on this.  We have always considered this as a scheme to compensate charity lotteries.  The point I was making is that it is not like a normal grant scheme that is advertised and to which organisations apply for grant aid.  As Mr. McGuire said earlier, if the cap was scrapped on the charitable lotteries we would be in a much better position to increase our income, which would be our independent income, into the Rehab group.  Instead of that, in 1996, following a lot of lobbying - not only by us, by the way; we are not the only charity lottery - the decision was taken and the agreement was reached between the charity lotteries and the Government that a charity lottery fund would be established to support that.  The issue for us was that, for the first time, this audit was auditing that scheme as if it was a grant-in-aid scheme for specific purposes.  The scheme was never for that.</p><p>  We supplied to the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality a wide list of activities that we had engaged in.  As I said earlier, they could choose what activities or areas of spending they felt were compatible with the fund, but we would have spent this funding.  Therefore, it was not a grant scheme.  It was not a scheme that the Government put up and said we could apply to for particular items.  It was a far freer environment in relation to the organisation being able to apply it to certain areas.</p></speech>

I accept that it is a compensatory scheme, but it is a grant given by the Department with conditions.  Does Ms Kerins accept that?</p></speech>

The authorities that decided whether our submissions were compliant were the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality, not us.

Ms Kerins said it was a very broad interpretation of the administrative purpose definition because it was not actually laid out in the document.  However, it is quite clear that it cannot be used for administration.</p></speech>

We received a letter from Mr. Purcell on 30 January 2014 in which it stated:<blockquote><br />In respect of the audit [report], it should be noted that it was not possible to fully conclude the internal audit process as the management response to the audit findings and recommendations sought from Rehab as a routine element of the audit process was not received.</blockquote>Since we received that letter, I have been livid at Rehab for not responding to the audit and not allowing the Department to conclude it.</p></speech>

It was clear enough that there did not appear to be any dispute with the findings.  Essentially, the audit showed up particular weaknesses in the system.  In a nutshell, the funding was to cover charitable activities, not administrative costs.  What had happened previously was that it had been pretty much accepted on a straightforward basis whatever was put in.  The audit identified weaknesses within the internal system for the disbursement of the fund.  Following on from this, the recommendations were made that there would have to be a more concise and comprehensive application process whereby the various elements that made up, say, the administrative costs would be dealt with.  There was an indicative list of items that could not be included unless they were incurred directly in the provision of front-line services.</p></speech>

It appears that there was more of an issue of principle as to whether the audit should cover this.  To some extent, it would probably hinge on the case we had to deal with this as it was, while Rehab, perhaps, viewed it as a compensation fund.</p></speech>

Out of the four recommendations, three were directed at the Department and one at Rehab.  The recommendations were almost stating everything was going to continue.</p></speech>

I sent him the letter subsequently.  A number of people in my office tried to have this meeting established on a number of occasions to progress the issue.  What we really wanted to do was sit down with the Department and the audit section to go through these issues.  There was a very clear discussion where we felt the best thing to do was write down the key issues for us.  As the Chairman said, most of the recommendations concerned the Department.  There was at least one conversation and several attempts by Rehab to set up that meeting.</p></speech>

An earlier letter states Rehab wants to help to finalise the report and it now seems the Department dropped the ball by not getting back to it.  On 30 January 2014 the Department wrote to the committee informing us it could not complete the audit because of Rehab.</p></speech>

The two core elements are, first, we had to look at this fund in the context of the overall spend within the Department, the expenditure review and where we would have to make savings within the Departmental budget.  The other issue flagged by the audit was the actual scheme itself and the fact that there were very high costs.  That was a flaw in the system.  The decision-making process to wind down the scheme was under way at that point.  Once the audit was there and we did not get the formal response, the letter issued.  The letter invited submissions in respect of that issue.  No response was received and the next thing was that the litigation was launched in November.</p></speech>

The first recommendation says that an agreement shall be put in place.  Part of what the first recommendation states is that there should be conditions to end the funding.  That is what it says here.  The Department did not implement that because it did not write back to Rehab.  The second recommendation relates to monitoring and reporting how charitable lottery funds are allocated.  The third recommendation refers to the internal audit recommendation that Rehab review all aspects of the fund-raising scheme to determine its viability and address the level of costs.  It said that Rehab must seek to increase the surplus on lottery sales through a reduction in the associated costs.  That is for Rehab.  The fourth recommendation said that there was a lack of clarity on what constitutes an administrative expense and asks for the Department to clarify that.</p></speech>

We are talking about how we do that.  I would like to get to a system regardless of whether it is a statement of recommended practice, SORP, or whatever.  Many organisations do different things.  Many organisations just disclose the chief executive's remuneration and then everybody else is in a total group.  One could use the other way where one uses the bands where so many people are within so many bands.  We need to ensure that we find the best way forward for us.

I do not think that is in anybody's interest, including that of Ms Kerins's colleagues and the service users of the Rehab Group.

In her opening statement, she referred to the Rehab model.  I think she used the word "unique".  Again, there are other organisations, some of which we have met, about which I have concerns regarding how one separates and puts protections in place for the public or charity element versus the private or commercial element.  What protections or safeguards are in place in the Rehab Group?  To be clear, this is not about the transfer of money.  I am not necessarily talking about safeguards in respect of money.  I am talking about corporate governance safeguards in terms of when decisions are being made; who is wearing what hat and when; when Rehab is making decisions as a charity, when it is making decisions as a commercial entity and when it is making decisions for its profitable companies; and what consideration it gives to its not-for profit sections.  I would really appreciate an answer as it would be useful to have an insight into what safeguards are in place in terms of those two elements.</p></speech>

In respect of corporate governance, if one is on the board of a company, one must work in the interest of that organisation.  We comply with all of the necessary company laws in respect of that.  It is irrelevant as to whether one is a not-for-profit or commercial entity.  It makes no difference.  One has to behave and work in the interests of that organisation.</p></speech>

I heard that radio interview, in which he also asked when was a charity not a charity, when did it become a commercial entity and that, if one reached a point where a certain proportion of one's work was commercial, it was better to be called a commercial entity with a certain ethos rather than a charity.  I am paraphrasing, but Ms Kerins probably heard the interview.  I would be interested in her views.</p></speech>

We cannot turn around and decide something is now commercial and no longer owned by the charity, unless it wants to sell it, but then the money would have to come back to the charity.  If one closes down a charity, its assets must transfer to a similar charity with a similar ethos.  Trying to define a new structure is a green field.  We are on our own in Ireland, if not elsewhere.  We have built a commercial side to the organisation which is wholly owned by the charity.  In the United States and perhaps elsewhere there are examples.  Bupa is a not-for-profit organisation which owns substantial businesses.  We have work to do.  We have grown significantly and now need to stand back, challenge the structure and see if it is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

We would not want him to think we had forgotten him.  I heard his exchanges with my colleagues.  Where, exactly, are we going with this review of the section 39 organisations?  I understand where we are going with the section 38 organisations.  People must be in compliance with pay policy; the HSE is introducing new corporate governance standards and we are engaging and working with the HSE in that regard.  Regarding the section 39 organisations, of which there are many and one of which is before us today, what is the HSE's end game for the sector?</p></speech>

That is in the context of transparency between us and the entities we fund under section 39 recognising, as I said, that they are required to have regard to public pay policy.  When processes such as those in the Haddington Road agreement arise, we pass on the cuts commensurate with what we expect these agreements to yield in terms of extra hours, etc.  However, as they are not formally subject to public pay policy, we are not in the same ballpark as section 38 organisations.  That fits into an overall process designed to ensure all section 39 funded entities are providing the right type, volume, scale and quality of services for which we are paying.  As I emphasised before, in that regard we are generally satisfied that the two companies the subject of today's discussion are doing exactly this.</p><p>  I do not envisage our getting into the space we are in with the section 38 organisations.  However, we are going through a validation process and where disclosures are made which may suggest to us there are disproportionately high numbers of staff paid at whatever grade levels, this will be the subject of discussion between us and the entities involved.  That will not purely be in a pay-compliance space but around the overall metric and nature of the organisation having regard to the fact that many of these organisations are either in the elderly or disability care space.  There is a disability service value for money review which has been published by the Department of Health in the past 18 months which forms part of our objectives in the 2014 service plan.  Some of the issues Ms Kerins raised about consolidation of service providers and back offices and generating better value which my colleague, Mr. Healy, will lead out will be informed by what we see in these disclosures.</p></speech>

As somebody who for many years worked with people with disabilities, I acknowledge the important work done by Rehab in that regard.  It is important to do so on a day like this.

It started out many years ago in the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It has had a few names, but it is called the wage subsidy scheme under which funding is provided for any employer - it does not have to be Rehab - towards meeting the productivity deficit in respect of an employee with a disability.  Many years ago we campaigned for and promoted the employment of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

The share in the care trust is owned not by the CRC, but by the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic.

I thank Mr. O'Brien for that.</p><p>  This brings me back to the issue of Ms Kerins's salary.  Does she see a connection between the discussion of her salary, Mr. Kiely's salary and so on, and the negative impact this is having not just on the Rehab organisation and the CRC, but on other charitable organisations that may have no skeletons in their cupboards and whose CEOs are paid relatively small salaries?</p></speech>

She is paid more than the Taoiseach and, as someone mentioned, President Obama.</p></speech>

I donate money to various charities.  One hears much about senior salaries and people earning more than &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  Some people believe these are too high.  Some charities depend on their entire fund-raising incomes to pay for everything, including salaries, pensions and activities, whereas others do not because they have other incomes.  It is important that the public knows to what it is contributing.  It would be wise to make this point clear.  I have no problem with contributing to the total running costs of a charity, but some may.  They may wish to contribute to front-line service delivery only.  I have spoken much about myself.  My work goes way beyond the charitable activities of the Rehab Group.  We can argue this-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.711" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014022700032#GG00400"><p>I appreciate that, but Ms Kerins is mixed up with the charity.  I appreciate that Rehab is a particularly unusual creation, but the public views it as a charity because a part of it is charitable.  The message to Rehab and all charitable organisations should be to keep their books clear and their salaries to as a moderate a level as possible.  It is a lesson that must be learned from this debacle.</p><p>  If I may, I will ask a final question on the National Learning Network, NLN.  From my experience, this is a difficult area to discuss in terms of achievement, etc.  What is possible for one person with a disability is not possible for another.  Does it concern the witnesses that there is such a high drop-out rate among the NLN's participants?  Reference has been made to illness, which is a genuine reason for dropping out, but has this matter been examined closely and has the question of whether what is being provided is appropriate for the individual concerned been asked?  From my experience of working with people with disabilities, what is possible for one may be impossible for another.  As such, I appreciate that people must cut their cloth to suit their measure in a way they might not need to do in other areas of life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Kelly" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014022700032#GG00500"><p>That is a genuine question.  We have done a great deal of work on analysing the drop-out rate and what is creating it.  Given the norm, 34% is not huge by the standards and the clients we deal with, although that is how it might sound.  The level is usually 34% to 37%.  It must also be taken into account that the majority, some 17%, who drop out for medical reasons return.</p><p>  To break down the remainder, some people found the courses too difficult to cope with and dropped down a level.  They are also considered drop-outs even though they return.  Obviously, people also have personal reasons for dropping out.  For example, ten people dropped out last year due to maternity issues.  I have an analysis that will give the committee a flavour.  Seven people's benefits or allowances were withdrawn.  One person was dissatisfied with the course.  Death was obviously a genuine reason.  Some people went to the Department of Justice and Equality, others went on maternity leave, had personal commitments or were unable to cope and transferred to a lower level of training or, in some cases, to a day service.  There might be other issues, for example, returning to hospital.  There is a significant variety.</p><p>  With SOLAS, we considered ways to prevent people from dropping out.  Our psychologists have done a great deal of work on the assessment process so that it is tailored to focus people on the right courses.  According to the Higher Education Authority, HEA's figures, 31% of people drop out in the IT sector.  I do not have access to drop-out rates in the further education system, but SOLAS might be able to give us an indication.</p><p>  Overall, the numbers are comparable at this level of education.  People do not tend to drop out of medical school, but there tends to be a higher drop-out rate in other fields, for example, IT and business.  Given the fact that the people we are discussing have disabilities, there is additional pressure.</p></speech>

We undertake comprehensive monitoring on an ongoing basis.  We have quarterly reviews of each of the centres and we get a great deal of information from the NLN.  We are trying to ensure a process of continuous improvement.  We have been working on many of these issues.  As to the specific one mentioned by the Deputy, we have worked constructively with the NLN to consider assessments of suitability before people start courses.  Instead of accepting someone onto a programme and then finding out that it is not the correct one for him or her, a little bit more could be done up front in the form of an assessment process.  We have worked constructively with the NLN and other specialist providers to work on this and improve ratios.</p></speech>

Does Ms Kerins understand that this is disappointing?  We have asked representatives of Rehab here today because of what is obviously perceived as a massive lack of transparency.  She is as aware as anybody else of the problems in the charity industry.  I do not dispute the great work done by the group; nobody would do so as it is fantastic.  We have not achieved further transparency today, and that opacity was symbolised by Ms Kerins's salary issue.</p><p>  As Deputy McDonald indicated earlier, we specifically asked for the remuneration committee to come before us, along with the chairman and former chief executive.  That was for the specific reason of finding out the matters exercising the public and which concerned us because we are examining the charities sector.  Instead of bringing in the people we asked for, Ms Kerins brought along three people we did not ask for.  They have mentioned some very useful things in a different context.  Why is Mr. Flannery not here?  As far as I can see he is on the board of five subsidiaries and the main company.  He is also on the board of the National Learning Network.  Why is he not here?</p></speech>

It was on that basis that we came here on a voluntary basis.  To clarify an issue, we got an e-mail seeking the attendance of the remuneration committee and Mr. Flannery.  We have never directly been asked for the attendance of our chairman, who happens to be on the remuneration committee.</p></speech>

The questions we were being asked were in regard to the National Learning Network, RehabCare and our charitable lotteries compensation fund spend.</p></speech>

We are entitled to ask to attend the people who we think will be useful to us.  For Ms Kerins to come back and say Rehab has decided the other people will or somebody else will attend is absurd.  It is clear that we wanted to ask questions on this whole issue of remuneration, and on which this whole meeting has concentrated more than any others.  That is not just a prurient matter, it is because the health and the transparency of an organisation is decided by how much information comes out.  Where Rehab is seen not to be transparent is on remuneration.  We have seen that just now when Ms Kerin's colleagues refused to outline their salaries, which meant that we had to extract that information from somewhere else.  That information is important, and is also important to the public.  That is why we asked them to attend this meeting.</p></speech>

They are not on the pubic pay scale.  They are not on public pensions.  They are entitled by right - and the law of this country - to their protection and privacy.  That is where we are with this matter.  They, and others, are working to ensure that there is adequate disclosure regarding their pay and conditions of employment.  We have said that we would do that and today we have said that we will do that sooner than we thought.  I would like the Deputy to let us get on with that so that we can get this issue out of the way.  It is very important that we do that.  The Deputy has seen, I would hope, nothing but good will from Rehab to ensure that is now achieved, as soon as possible and currently.  I ask him to do that.</p><p>  In regard to the remuneration committee, as I have said before - I have not had a chance to do this yet but I have said it many times today - we are going to give the report, albeit we need to check if there are any issues that need to be redacted, to the Chairman.  I am also very willing to go through the issues here today, as to the methodology and how the independent assessors or salaries - the independent organisations - came to their position.  I can provide all of the information the Deputy needs and I am willing to do that.</p></speech>

I have been here for hours listening to this and I suppose I had a pretty open mind before I arrived here at 10 a.m.  Over the past few weeks, there have been a number of differences of opinion between committee members as to how to deal with Rehab, including the timing of the meetings, who should come in, etc.  The private session has got pretty heavy.  I have to say that after listening to the interaction between Ms Kerins and various members of the committee, I have come to the conclusion that she has made a big song and dance about this and it is unnecessary.  She has been evasive and I do not think any of this has been necessary at all.  As &euro;82 million of public money goes into Rehab, she should have been far more forthcoming, even before today.  This evasion and this subjective opinion with regard to what she should and what she cannot say is ridiculous.  I really think Ms Kerins needs to get a grip on herself, because this event today is completely unnecessary.</p><p>  Rehab is a charitable organisation, with charitable status.  Some of us on this committee have tried to make sure the charitable sector is not further damaged as time goes on, and it has been damaged over the last few months because of the CRC, etc.  Now we are in a situation where Ms Kerins is being forced to give information when it comes to Ms Keane.  RehabCare is 98% funded by the HSE.  Mr. Tony O'Brien has had to say that if the clerk to the committee asks for this information, the committee will be given it.  It is unnecessary.  That did not need to happen and that should have been thought about before Ms Kerins arrived in here today.  It had to be dragged out of her.  The manner in which her solicitors contacted this committee yesterday was incredible - informing us as to what our remit is.  It was completely unnecessary.  All this has done is to prolong this for another couple of days, maybe another week.  Ms Kerins and her executives in Rehab should have a long hard think and whatever information, within reason, this committee wants and expects and that the HSE expects - I know a process is ongoing - should just be given, because she is doing more damage than good to the entire charitable sector as this goes on.</p></speech>

RehabCare has its contract with the HSE to deliver the services and it has provided all the information to the HSE as part of that.  A staffing template was introduced this year to provide salaries and all of the rest.  As part of our compliance, as part of my responsibilities in complying with legislation and in complying with my obligations under the contract of RehabCare, as data controller for RehabCare and in terms of disclosing salaries - as it is a private entity we must consider the whole area of data protection legislation - I sought advice from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to that.  It advised that there were a certain number of parameters by which I had to abide as a data controller.  I have done my best to provide the information the HSE required as part of that while also fulfilling my obligations and ensuring I do not break the law or the data protection issues around the staff.</p></speech>

I look at the Rehab Group <i>in toto</i> and I believe it has a turnover somewhere in the region of &euro;180 million, of which approximately &euro;80 million, or 40%, comes from the Irish taxpayer.  Less than half of the income of the group comes from the Irish taxpayer.  I can understand why an organisation might make the case, when the majority of its funding does not come from the taxpayer, that it is not fully answerable here.  However, RehabCare is a State agency in all but name because it is 98% funded by the State.  I would like to ask Mr. O'Brien about that, because people get lost in the debate.  There is a general understanding that the vast majority of funding for the section 38 organisations comes from the HSE and that it is a lower percentage in the case of section 39 organisations, perhaps with a service level agreement or a grant payment.  Will Mr. O'Brien very simply define the two types of organisation?  The public often asks what is the difference between a section 38 and a section 39 organisation.  Will Mr. O'Brien tell the public in a nutshell what is the difference?  We are in a bubble here and use these phrases all the time but the public is utterly mystified as to the difference between the two.</p></speech>

Section 38 is a reference to section 38 of the Heath Act 2004, which sets out in quite considerable detail the criteria and characteristics of a section 38 organisation.  Essentially, it is one that has been classified by a formal process as being a public sector body and all of its personnel are classified as public servants, are treated as such and, therefore, are admitted to public service pension schemes of one kind or another - in most cases, it is the voluntary health bodies superannuation scheme.  Therefore, they are in general entirely bound by public sector policies.</p><p>  Section 39 organisations range quite considerably in terms of their size and scope.  There are more than 2,500 of them and some of them are very small, such as small voluntary bodies providing an early morning call service or a meals-on-wheels service, while others are much larger entities which can be either not-for-profits or for-profits.  They are simply entities providing services which are similar, or ancillary, to our activities, where we are entitled to support the provision of services through them.  By virtue of section 39, we are not recognised in our capacity as an entity for the purposes of normal competition and procurement law, so it is not like procuring other general services in the way we would from other purely commercial suppliers.  Those entities are not regarded as public sector bodies, their staff are not regarded as public sector staff and they are not admitted to public sector pension schemes.</p></speech>

I would like to put something to Mr. O'Brien and the HSE, which has been giving RehabCare 98% of its funding each year.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would have hoped that Mr. O'Brien, as the HSE's Accounting Officer, would have had a far greater handle on the activities of an organisation that gets 98% of its money from the HSE.  However, it seems that this template was not sent out until recently.  Was that not in place before now, given that over &euro;40 million of this organisation's funding of &euro;43 million comes from the taxpayer?  Why did we have to wait until now to talk about this template?</p></speech>

Essentially, we are purchasing services from RehabCare and we are doing so at what we consider to be a fair cost.  What differentiates this from our relationship with the ESB, Vodafone or any other company that we might buy services from is that in this case, the services are provided to people who are beneficiaries of health care.  That is not the case with the other types of service we buy.  Our service arrangement sets out in very fine detail the detailed process, as described today by the HSE delegation and the team from Rehab, that is used to hold service providers to account in terms of the quantum, the nature, the standards and the quality of their services.  We do not seek to micro-manage their business in the same way we are often accused of doing with section 38 organisations.  We have a different relationship with these organisations.  During the course of 2012, in light of the overall level of concern we had about efficiency and value for money and in the context of the value for money report that was published in 2012, we introduced for 2013 a template requiring all salaries paid at or above the public sector pay grade known as grade 8 to be disclosed to us.  That was a new thing that was introduced.  During the course of 2013, entities such as RehabCare and the NLN have been coming into compliance with that process.  As it is a new process, there has been a process of clarification, as I have said.  Both entities made certain disclosures to us.  We needed a bit more information to understand it fully.  During the last few weeks, they have provided in full the information we have required.  This continued until last week.  Indeed, we got some additional information yesterday.  All of this information has formed the basis for some of the information I have provided for the consideration of the clerk.</p></speech>

I also said in response to a question asked by Deputy Harris that we are not in a section 38-type process here.  We are using this information to inform our overall view of the value we get and the opportunities for increased value in this sector as a whole.  I am not really going to be in a position to judge whether entities are in compliance with a policy that does not apply to them, and it is not necessary to do so.</p></speech>

All the HSE can confirm is that just ten of the approximately 40 organisations or agencies are fully compliant.  Most of them have made a business case at this stage, but just ten of them have been accepted by the HSE as being fully compliant.  That happened after confirmation was received on foot of an internal audit report.  How can we be confident that the HSE will have confidence in the information it gets back from all the bodies when the validating exercise is completed between now and the end of March?  How will the HSE be able to come to an understanding that what it is told is the case?  That was not the experience in the case of the section 38 organisations.  A year on, we are a long way from concluding the process.  What does Mr. O'Brien see as the position regarding the section 39 organisations?  Will the HSE do a sample test?  I understand that it does not intend to check them.  Given that there are so many section 39 organisations, I suggest that the HSE internal audit committee should do some sample audits of some of the section 39 returns.  As we have heard, some of them are 98% funded by the State.</p></speech>

We have differed on the interpretation of whether the information means they are in compliance.  We have not really had any failure to disclose, other than in the case of a few genuinely marginal issues.  We are going through a validation process with respect to the section 39 organisations.  As this committee is aware from various reports that have been before it, the internal audit service in the HSE is quite sophisticated.  Section 39 organisations are likely to be sampled in relation to the accuracy of the information they supply to us.  We have the ability to do that under our service level arrangement.  Our internal audit service will be deployed in the section 39 space as part of this ongoing process.</p></speech>

Rehab is not a public entity.  It is a private organisation.  We contract for all the services we deliver.  We have very specific contracts in place.  As I explained earlier, those contracts are monitored.  We have to deliver on a very specific quantum or number of services.  All of those are divided up and are reported on.  We are expected to deliver on certain standards and report on our monitoring and performance data.  In addition, the people we employ are privately employed.  We are not on consolidated pay scales.  We do not have the same opportunities or benefits from a superannuation scheme perspective.  We pay a separate scheme ourselves.  If we do not perform, in relation to our business, we can lose that business.</p> <p>There is that risk to us as a private entity.  We do not have security of tenure as employees and if we are not competitive and performing, we will lose that business and it will be up to us as a private agency to recoup or manage these losses.  During the years, perhaps because we were not as competitive, we have lost certain contracts to for-profit agencies which may be operating on different terms and conditions.  They are not expected to disclose a number of elements of their contacts.</p><p> On the other element that separates us, we are already undergoing tendering and procurement processes for our business.  We recently went through the public procurement process and won a tender.  We competed against for-profit agencies and came out as the preferred provider based on value for money and finance.  From that perspective, ours is a different entity.</p></speech>

Although I said Rehab was almost a public entity, I did not suggest it was.  Having looked at the figures, I will compliment it because everybody has been having a go at the salaries paid in the organisation.  Based on the audited accounts for RehabCare in the year under review, staff costs, including PRSI and pensions, were &euro;33.53 million.  On page 3 it is stated the organisation had an average of 1,052 employees in the year.  This gives an average salary per employee, including PRSI and pensions, of &euro;31,873 per annum, which is less than the average industrial wage.  Including PRSI and pensions, this amounts to an average weekly salary of &euro;613.  The salaries paid in the organisation generally appear to be modest.  We have concentrated on the salaries of a few key personnel.</p><p>  Without wishing to bore members, I have produced similar figures for National Learning Network.  The accounts show that payroll costs were &euro;31.11 million and that there were 705 employees.  This gives an average salary of &euro;44,000 per annum or &euro;849 per week.  While the figures for both organisations are not excessive, the average salary in National Learning Network is higher than that in RehabCare, although neither figure is excessive.  What is the difference in the pay structures between the two entities?  I apologise for giving so much detail, but I am thinking of the 3,800 employees who will get it in the neck tomorrow morning for purportedly having high salaries.  I want those who avail of Rehab's services to know that the average person working on their behalf receives less than &euro;600 per week.</p></speech>

When one looks at figures for numbers of employees, it is an average figure.  Not everybody works full time, which can distort salaries.  Often, even in the care sector, people work part-time.  They are predominately women and sometimes part-time hours suit them.  One would need to break down the analysis to the number of hours provided.</p></speech>

This type of analysis in which one produces an average salary gives rise to the wrong conclusions because it includes many part-time, low paid workers.  We need to single out senior executive pay scales and obtain the relevant information.  This informs public opinion.  Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and &Aacute;ine Collins would like to ask some brief questions before we conclude the meeting which started at 10 a.m.  Mr. Purcell wishes to clarify a matter before we conclude.</p></speech>

I must leave in a moment.</p><p>  I wish to restate my earlier comment.  We carried out the audit and got the letter back.  We would have expected a formal response to some of the recommendations made, but we did not get it.  At that stage, a policy decision was taken that the scheme would be wound down and the matter proceeded on that basis.  A letter issued on 5 October, inviting submissions that people wished to make.  We were then notified that leave to take a judicial review had been sought in November.  There was no question of a meeting after this.  As I stated, the decision to wind down the scheme was taken in the context of our examination of our overall budgetary situation and the need to find savings.  In addition, we felt there were issues in relation to the scheme.  The audit brought to the fore the issue that there were very high costs involved.  The main reasons were that we believed the existing criteria for the scheme created an incentive to run these charitable lotteries at a very low profit margin or even, in some instances, at a loss.  Further, there was no incentive to keep administrative costs down and, of the profits generated, the amount going to the charitable causes was often very low, given the first two reasons I gave.  In addition, the lotteries had effectively come to service vehicles for the generation of charitable lotteries funding rather than as mechanisms for raising charitable funding directly from the public, as originally intended.  Those were the reasons the policy decision was taken.  We regarded the implementation of the recommendations made in the report as a proportionate response in circumstances where the policy decision was taken to wind them down.  They were mainly administrative outcomes to the audit and have been put in place.  As the funding continues to be dispersed for the period that the fund will remain in place, the recommendations which the audit identified are being carried out.</p></speech>

The Chairman referred to the fact that one of the recommendations stated there was to be an agreement.  The fact is that there was no specific objection to, if one likes, the administration issues in relation to them.  In fact, as we have continued to pay out the money under the schemes which we will continue to do until the end of 2015 when the final payments will be made under the schemes, these new arrangements will continue to be in place.  Notwithstanding the one line in the first recommendation that there be an agreement and even if there was no formal agreement, these procedures are in place and accepted.</p></speech>

When the National Rehabilitation Board, NRB, was dissolved and F&Aacute;S was set up and became responsible for budget service provision, we had to pay training allowances on behalf of F&Aacute;S.  We are like a managing agent which is just part of the process.  There is no administration charge.  We pay the allowances to the clients and then we bill F&Aacute;S and because there was a timing difference, F&Aacute;S gave a float of &euro;1.5 million a number of years ago at the very start.  Discussions have taken place recently with SOLAS on how such funds are to be distributed and managed in future.  The float goes back a number of years.  It allowed us to pay the allowances while we recoup them later from F&Aacute;S, so it was a timing issue.</p></speech>

The only way the charity would divest itself of Rehab is if it sold it or transferred it as an asset to a similar charity.  There are serious complications involved.  We have been examining this issue for the past nine months.  There has been a slowdown in recent months but we are speeding it up again.  We need to work this through.  There are some experts helping us on this and they have not come up with a solution yet.  It would seem that the top organisation would need to stay as a charity, otherwise it is divesting its assets and it is not permitted to do that.</p></speech>

That is not a problem.  However, one cannot take the assets away from the charity without giving it proper value for them.  Therein lies the problem.  One cannot just say here is the commercial and over there is the charity and the two do not meet, because the actual charity, Rehab, owns the commercial.  That is the problem.  Somewhere there must be a solution to this problem.  Our motivation is to get clarity here for everyone in order that people are not delving in and trying to find things out in relation to the structure of the organisation.</p></speech>

It was a difficult move for us, but we were able to save quite a number of those jobs and we have now moved them into a more sustainable situation.  We do have a problem.  It is a very difficult decision to make.  One minute it is being said there should be equal pay for people with disabilities.  Our philosophy is they should be paid for doing an equal job, but there is a downside to this also and that comes about if the commercial activity is not doing well and if the business is down.  What do we do in that situation?  We underpin quite a few jobs within Rehab Enterprises to ensure there are as few job losses as possible during the downturn.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on the new contract, just announced, for the Rehab Group in Saudi Arabia.  I understand Rehab will deliver training and education programmes.  How many Irish jobs will be involved in delivering this service?</p></speech>

We are a service provider, not consultants.  We decided, with the support of the ministries there, that we would set up a service.  There are many people there with disabilities, over 20% of the population.</p><p>  On jobs, there is a great opportunity for Irish business in Saudi Arabia and there is significant interaction between the Saudi-Irish business councils, and Enterprise Ireland is also doing work.  Small and medium Irish businesses have an opportunity, but Saudi Arabia is a difficult place in which to do business if a company does not have support.  What we are doing in the organisation we are associated with in the Saudi-Ireland visit is creating links and connections for young businesses.  We have begun this and a growing number of Irish businesses are now taking the plunge.</p><p>  For us and the wider disability sector, particularly in areas where there may be some challenges with employment, there is a huge opportunity for us to grow services out there in regard to people with disabilities.  This is true not only for the Rehab Group, but for other organisations, and also for younger and older people who wish to go overseas for a period.  We have very talented and very skilled people here and that is recognised.  To answer the question, there is a great opportunity.  We will move forward with this and will provide, not only colleagues from within the Rehab Group, but others who may be interested in coming and working under our umbrella there.  Generally, there is a great opportunity, particularly for SMEs, in the Middle East and particularly in Saudi Arabia.</p></speech>

When I was looking at the figures going from Departments and agencies to Rehab, I considered that they were going directly to services.  I was not aware until today of the detail of the service level agreements.  That service level agreement in respect of Ms Kerins's operation is over 90%.  Therefore, it comes to the question of the disclosure of salaries at executive level.  I believe that because of the amount of money that goes into her section, such money should be declared.  I encourage Rehab and the other organisations we have been speaking about to put that information into the public domain as quickly as possible.  Obviously the information is with the HSE. Mr. O'Toole has been asked for information today, and I would much prefer to see Rehab volunteering the information.  It removes the cloud that some of the committee members were speaking about earlier on.  The sooner that happens, the better.</p><p>  I want to go back to something Deputy Deasy said because I agree with him.  I did not want to say this at the outset, because I did not want to cause the meeting to go in any particular direction.  I thought that the telephone call from Rehab's solicitors to the legal service in the House was unnecessary.  Having gone through the hearing from 10 a.m. until now, much of the information that we sought was given by Ms Kerins without this perception that there was going to be a stand-off at today's meeting.  It would have been much more helpful if that legal issue did not arise.  We have acted generally within our remit.  We may have gone a little bit beyond it in pursuing salaries and so on, but that was because we wanted to get an overall view of the organisation.  Today's exchange has helped that.  What has not helped us has been the lead-up to this and having to drag that information into the public domain.  As Mr. O'Toole and Mr. O'Brien have the information, it would be important for Ms Kerins that this information would be put into the public domain.  That gives everybody a clear picture of what is happening within Rehab and of its funding from the Government.</p><p>  The details of the transaction between whatever section within Rehab and Complete Eco Solutions should be made available.  Deputy McDonald has asked for it, and the sooner it is cleared up, the more it will help the public image of Rehab and the charities sector.  It was in the past - I think it was 2009 - that the company started.</p><p>  The point I am going to make about Mr. Flannery and the remuneration committee relates to the wishes of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was clearly expressed by the members of this committee at our last meeting that Mr. Flannery and the remuneration committee be asked to attend, and the report on the benchmarking of the salaries be made available as well.  Did Ms Kerins ask Mr. Flannery to attend?  Did she ask the remuneration committee to attend?</p></speech>

We have the report and we said that we would provide it to you.  I am fully prepared to go through the methodology and the information that would have been given to the committee.   With the exception of past chief executives' pension scenario, which I do not have, I would have been able to deal with everything.

That was the same with other pieces of information we tried to get from Ms Kerins.  I will finish on this point because obviously we will not agree on it.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a job to do.  I told Ms Kerins that the legal end of it, the lead-up to this, how to present it and so on, was unhelpful.  The exchange today has been constructive.  We got excellent information about everything we needed to know.</p><p>  It would be helpful if the remuneration committee and Mr. Flannery were here.  The Committee of Public Accounts extended an invitation to them.  I would have thought that Ms Kerins would have thought long and hard about that and the wishes of the Committee on Public Accounts and have brought them along.  It is unhelpful it did not happen.  It gives rise to unnecessary speculation and tension.  The exchange we have just had is typical of some of the questions that were asked.  I know they were difficult and that it is not easy for all of the people invited to be here but we have a job to do.  We have done that job today.  We could have done it with much less tension had it been approached differently.</p><p>  What coaching and so on went into the witnesses' preparation for this meeting?</p></speech>

We came in at short notice.  We have done a significant amount of work going through all our data to ensure we could answer the questions put here.

I compliment them on coming in and for being here since 10.30 a.m.  It is not an easy process.  We could have made it much easier had it been approached differently.  I thank the witnesses for being here and for giving the information.  We are much clearer now on the salaries and everything else, and the structure.  We may have other queries, which we will put to Ms Kerins again.  The clerk to the committee will contact her about the outstanding information we need.  If anything else arises from that, we will speak to Ms Kerins again.</p><p>  I thank the various Departments and Mr. O'Toole for being here.  It was a long day but it is important to deal with this matter.  We will return to it in more detail at a later stage.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is to change the payment from the party leader's allowance to the parliamentary activities allowance.  The cheque comes from the Department of Finance or perhaps from the Minister's Department.  It comes from the Central Fund.  It should not come from the Central Fund, nor should it be made payable to the party leader, for instance, Deputy &Eacute;amon Gilmore, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin or Deputy Enda Kenny.  It should be payable to the party.  Up to now the allowance is deemed to be the party leader's allowance and the payment is made payable to the leader.  It will now become a parliamentary activities' allowance and it is only logical that the payee should be changed to the party name in the case of a party or to an individual Member where applicable.  The payment should not be paid to the leader personally.  The Minister may supply a more precise wording but I will return with a more precise wording on Report Stage.  This amendment may be changed because I was caught for time when tabling it.</p></speech>

I have no resistance to the point.  The allowance is for the party and not for the party leader.  My job is to ensure the payment is accountable.  The legislation contains accountability measures which make the party leader responsible.  A person must be designated to be accountable and it needs to be the person who gets the money.  It cannot be payable to some other individual who might be a temporary officer of the party and then have someone else accountable for it.  While it is a parliamentary activities' allowance for the designated activities as set out, the party leader - in the case of Fianna F&aacute;il, uachtar&aacute;n Fhianna F&aacute;il - is the person responsible for accounting for it.</p></speech>

However, accounting officers operate in every area of the civil and public service.  In that context, cheques that are presented to Departments, for example, are not made out to the accounting officer.  I am sure cheques from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the Estimates are addressed to the other individual Departments and not to their accounting officers.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will be able to support what I am seeking to do.  I am moving in the same direction as he is in respect of this issue.  He has expressed sentiments to the effect that he wants to reduce State funding of politics during periods of recession.  One of the things the Bill does, which I support, is to reduce the leaders' allowance by 10%.  The other major source of funding for political parties is the Exchequer.  I do not know that is the exact amount of such funding but it is significantly greater than that which comes in the form of the leaders' allowance.  These amendments propose to do in respect of Exchequer funding exactly what the Bill does in respect of the leaders' allowance.

Again, I am of the view that the public would be happy with what is proposed.  The amendment states that &quot;The fund into which the parliamentary activities allowance is paid shall be obliged to produce an annual tax clearance certificate.&quot;  In general, everyone who stands for election must produce a tax clearance certificate before entering the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I presume that, following a general election, a Member would have to produce a tax clearance certificate before he or she could be paid.  It is not that difficult to obtain a tax clearance certificate.  Millions of euro go through the Oireachtas.  Those who carry out event the smallest jobs in local schools or for local authorities or the HSE are required to produce current tax clearance certificates.  The idea that someone could go for four or five years without being tax compliant and would not require to be so is not really acceptable.  I accept that what I propose might create difficulties for individual Members but so be it.  Parties that are receiving millions of euro each year should be required to be tax compliant.</p><p>  Voluntary organisations applying for sports capital grants from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport during the past month were not only obliged to supply tax clearance numbers, they also had to produce copies of their tax clearance certificates before their applications could be considered valid.  The tax office was quite busy in the past couple of weeks dealing with organisations which knew themselves to be tax compliant but which did not have tax compliance certificates.  Local girl guide troops, hockey clubs or GAA clubs that were seeking grants of &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 are obliged to produce up-to-date tax clearance certificates.  There is a need for consistency of approach in respect of this matter and it would be wrong for money to be continually handed out to those involved in the political process over a five-year period without their being required to produce tax clearance certificates.</p><p>  I am sure the Minister sees the consistency in what I am seeking to achieve here.  Let there be - as should be the case - an administrative burden on those who are in receipt of the money to which I refer in the context of producing tax clearance certificates.  The latter cannot receive money year in and year out without tax compliance certificates being requested from them.  I presume the amendment will be accepted, particularly as I cannot understand how a Government that would ask a local girl guide or boy scout troop to produce a tax clearance certificate in order to obtain a lottery grant would not request the same of Members of the national Parliament.  There cannot be one standard for voluntary and community organisations and every contractor that works for the State and a different one for the Members of Parliament.  I think the Minister will see the merit in what I am saying.</p></speech>

To what fund is reference being made in this regard?</p></speech>

A fund cannot apply for tax clearance certificate, so it is the parliamentary party or the individual members.  The Deputy needs to be specific in who is applying.  My own party obviously publishes annual audited accounts.  I think ours is the only party to do that and we are happy to do that.  Each Member of the Oireachtas is obliged, within 90 days of election, to provide a tax clearance certificate to the Standards in Public Offices Commission under the Standards in Public Office Act.  I have no difficulty with any mechanism to provide further clarity in regard to people's tax compliance but the proposal that the fund would be required to be tax compliant would be meaningless.  A fund cannot be tax complaint.  Would it be the individual account holder, the chairman of the parliamentary party or the leader of the party?  We need to tease it out a bit more and it needs much more clarity in terms of acceptance for legislative purposes.</p></speech>

The wording should have been "The qualifying party or the member to which the parliamentary activities allowance shall be obliged to produce an annual tax clearance certificate".  I will table an amendment with that wording on Report Stage because the payment is made to qualifying parties.  "Qualifying party" is the phrase used in the legislation and it goes on to say or to a Member if he or she is not a member of a qualifying party.  I understand the Minister picking me up on the use of the word "fund".</p></speech>

I get the feeling going into the algebra of this Bill that perhaps we should take a clean slate approach to this and start defining exactly what these parliamentary activities allowance should be and build from that, from page 1, rather than trying to do sticky-plaster amendments or codicils to an existing framework.  Questions arise about the status of a Member of the Oireachtas throughout the course of a D&aacute;il or a Seanad, a Member's status can change and yet the work as a parliamentarian representing the whole people is very much there.  To take away resources from doing that representative work for all the people is undermined by the way the architecture of these allowances - even though they are going to be renamed - will continue.  That is not satisfactory.  It is not transparent or clear.  This should be capable of being presented on one page, in words and figures, which should then be stamped "Agreed".  That is what is done in business.  It makes sense and one would put a note down opposite-----</p></speech>

One does not start adding and subtracting wings, chains or wheels to the first aeroplane or prototype that did not fly.  One goes back to the drawing board with one's theory and then with one's practical application of theory and one tries it again.  I believe we have reached that stage.  As Deputy Fleming has proposed, one starts off with one's tax clearance certificate as one's initial political and financial health screening.  I believe the point he was trying to make is there should be a continuing good health certificate tax-wise each year for everyone who is a direct or indirect beneficiary.  People benefit indirectly if it is through a party and directly if it is through an individual.  If someone leaves a party, the amount of money that is dedicated towards his or her parliamentary activities' allowance arguably should be increased because he or she has fewer resources.  Such people lack the resources available to a member of a party in government for which additional departmental resources are available.  Consequently, I invite the Minister to start thinking again afresh.  It is not that difficult, it is easier than trying to argue and validate amendments to an existing framework that is somewhat leaky.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with Members being tax compliant, as they absolutely should be.  Moreover, things should be vouched and open and there should be proper oversight and so on.  However, my understanding is no individual receives funding in this way and only political parties actually receive any kind of funding under the Electoral Acts from 1938 onwards.  I believe one must get 2% of the first preference vote to qualify.</p></speech>

While I hope I can remember all the points, an important point was made by Deputy Creighton.  The whole idea of this is that at the time, there was huge controversy regarding the nexus between business, developers and politics.  Chunks of money were going into political parties that were not accountable.  That was all changed and it was agreed that different funding mechanisms would be put in place, some of which would be State funding for the political system and for the parliamentary activities element thereof.  This particular system predates all of that because this goes back to the 1930s.</p><p>  It always has been felt that we organise our political system, by and large, through party politics.  I acknowledge there also are many individuals, but it is through party politics in the main and party politics had to have a structural base to operate.  Consequently, that system has been in place since the 1930s.  I disagree completely with Deputy Mathews that this is a sticking plaster.  I listened last night again to Deputy Mathews's view on these matters.  He has a view that once he makes a determination on a matter, that is wholly true, right and righteous and therefore, everyone else must-----</p></speech>

Following strong contributions that were made during the Second Stage debate, I am familiar with the views of members of the select committee.  However, I also am entitled to a view and to have it heard, even if it is not in accord with those of others.  In essence, the two net issues are first, to reduce the total funding by 10% and second, to have a much more accountable audit system for everyone who is in receipt of parliamentary activity funding.  This will include the Independents for the first time and I believe that is broadly welcomed by everyone.  The net issue in respect of the amendment before the select committee is the issue of tax compliance.  Every Member of the Oireachtas is in receipt of State funding, be it his or her salary or in some other way, such as travel allowance or whatever.  Each Member should be legally obliged to be tax-compliant and I am very happy to consider any proposal that underscores or enhances that in any way.</p></speech>

The funds are clearly specifically designed for parliamentary activity.  While I understand that completely, it is not clear to me that they are paid separately to a parliamentary party as distinct from a party.  My hunch is that it is paid into a general fund, which is administered by a party, presumably largely in compliance with the legislation used to pay salaries for research and parliamentary activities.  However, can one be certain of this?  Is that actually spelled out?  Is the Minister satisfied that the main political parties in the State actually spend it that way, that is, that they spend it separately and distinctly from all the other moneys that either are raised through fund-raising or through the Electoral Acts and so on?  Do they have two distinct vehicles, if one likes, for expenditure of these moneys, one in compliance with this legislation and one in compliance with their other obligations under the Electoral Acts?  I am not clear in this regard and that is the essence of my question.  I am not making a speech but am asking a question.</p></speech>

Yes, I am satisfied that the moneys allocated to the parliamentary activities allowance to be, that is, the party leader's allowance up to now, can only be expended for the specific purposes designated in the Act and they are set out in the Act.  As to whether other funds that are generated elsewhere can be used for the same type of activities, of course they can, if a party generates separate funds for that purpose.  However, this funding is for the designated parliamentary activities and the party must be accountable for every euro that it is properly and appropriately allocated.  Moreover, the Government is now broadening that accountability to people who received funding under this heading previously but who were not required to make such declarations and to submit those reports.</p></speech>

It is straightforward.  If somebody leaves a political party for whatever reason or is expelled, the party should not continue to receive the funding in respect of him or her as he or she is no longer a member of it.  There is a pure natural justice issue here and the allowance should be for the member.</p><p>  When I raised this on Second Stage, the Minister's reply was along the lines that when those Members stood for election they had the name of their political party on the ballot party.  As we all will be aware, that is the case.  It was not the political party that was elected; it was the individual.  No returning officer stands up in a constituency and states that the results of the election are as follows: Fine Gael, one seat; Fianna F&aacute;il, one seat, Independents, one seat.  He or she stands up and gives the names of the Members elected.</p></speech>

Historically, most Members who leave parties tend to leave government parties over particular issues.  I am sure Members have left Opposition parties when issues arose as well but it probably affects on balance government parties more often than Opposition parties.  It is a matter of natural justice.</p><p>  I think the members on both sides of me will have something to say on this amendment.</p></speech>

There were long presentations on Second Stage.  As I stated, I fully respect the point of view of every Member who feels that the allowance should be portable, that it should not be determined in the immediate aftermath of the election and apportioned out to support the parliamentary activities as determined by the electorate at a point in time, and that if Members move their political allegiance for whatever reason, following expulsion or voluntarily, that allowance should be portable to some degree with them.</p><p>  There are different amendments to it.  Some have proposed that the allowance should migrate with the Member.  Some have suggested a proportion, as has this amendment, analogous to the division that would be the Member's due as a member of a defined parliamentary party.  Others say that it should be foregone completely and kept within the Exchequer.  These all are valid perspectives.</p><p>  I argue - it is my view which that has been endorsed by Government - for the traditional way that this is done, that this is determined subsequent to the vote of the people after a general election and that it is not a portable allowance to be determined by the individual Member thereafter, either to migrate in or out, as some Members have.  Some Members have temporarily left a party.  An allowance is not portable to go with them.  It is determined in a snapshot after the general election and that is the valid snapshot, unless there is a by-election where it applies between then and the next general election, until the people have their say again.  I note Members have different strong and honourably-held views, but that is my view.</p></speech>

We cannot respect the will or intent of the electorate on the basis of trite snapshots after an election.</p><p>  It is particularly telling that those snapshots are quite moveable in the event of a by-election from the point of view of the prevailing perspective in government and, indeed, the Minister's perspective.  Frankly, that is convenient.  It does not add up.  It is not consistent with the Minister's overall point.</p><p>  It is astonishing for a number of reasons.  The financial supports for Oireachtas Members are hugely important.  I can assure the Minister that when one is thrown out into the cold through no fault of one's own for upholding pre-election commitments, it is a stark and shocking position to suddenly find that the might of a political party can be used in one's name for research purposes and whatever other purposes that party determines to be appropriate.  The David and Goliath factor is one aspect.</p><p>  There is a much more fundamental issue.  When I speak to friends from parliaments in other parts of Europe, they find it extraordinary that there is not equality between Members in this Parliament, that there are 166 Members who are elected to the Lower House on a range of bases, such as manifestos and pre-election commitments, to represent the people in their constituencies and the people of the country and they are treated differently.  Some are treated with great privilege, support and resources and some are treated as poor relations, not only in terms of the resources, but in terms of speaking rights, seating rights, participation in Oireachtas debates, the right to table Private Members' legislation, etc.  It is unheard of in any other parliament that I am aware of across the European Union.  It is a serious issue.  In my view, it is unconstitutional.  Not only is that my view, but I have sought the opinion of senior counsel and I will furnish that opinion to the Minister.  It is unacceptable under constitutional law, not to mention natural justice to which Deputy Mathews has already referred.  It is completely incompatible with the constitutional protections to state that certain Members of the Parliament can be treated differently, with less equality and less respect, than other Members.  We all are elected equally and we all should be supported equally with the resources of the State.</p></speech>

Before I ran for election, I knew very little or nothing about this Parliament.  I was talking to a man who had been around the D&aacute;il for years, although not in an elected capacity, and he assured me that irrespective of how bad, dysfunctional or cynical I believed D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was, it was much worse.  The stance the Minister is taking on this issue, that is, to penalise Independent Deputies and Senators who receive a fraction of what party Deputies and Senators receive and also Deputies and Senators who, for whatever reason, leave their parties, is extraordinary.  It makes a mockery of the so-called democratic revolution.  There are three Deputies present for whom the Taoiseach will have received &euro;500,000 in public funding between the time they were kicked out of their party for standing up for a party promise and the next election.  How can anybody in a modern democracy stand over this?  I have examined the numbers.  For all the Deputies who have either left or been kicked out of his party the Taoiseach will receive over &euro;1 million.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, will also receive over &euro;1 million.  Between them, they will receive &euro;2.2 million.  The Taoiseach is paid approximately &euro;65,000 per Deputy.  For the three Deputies in question who are present, he will receive approximately &euro;500,000 over a period of two and a half years.  It is astounding that the Government would stand over stating the Taoiseach should be paid &euro;500,000 of taxpayers' money for these three Deputies since they have been kicked out of his party.  I agree wholeheartedly with the amendment.  It is a version of my amendment that was ruled out of order.  I support Deputy Sean Fleming's amendment and the points made by the other Deputies, including Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  It is an outrageous use of public money and outrageous discrimination against elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

There is no justification for political groupings in this House receiving &euro;2.5 million, based on Deputy Stephen Donnelly's figures, over the lifetime of the Government for Members who are no longer in their groupings.  We are talking about one tenth of the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s membership, not one or two Members.</p><p>  I know the Minister&rsquo;s argument is that this allowance is based on a Member&rsquo;s designation on polling day.  He has made the argument that people vote for a party, not an individual.  That is not the case in Ireland, a point I made clearly to him on Second Stage.  He cannot argue that in 1997 when he, Deputy Willie Penrose and others were elected, that it was people voting for the Labour Party.  They were voting for him, based on his record.  It was the same in 2002 when there was a meltdown in Fine Gael.  It was about the individuals who went before the electorate.  It was the same in the last general election with Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is a significant criticism of the political system that people vote for individuals.  Even when one looks at the ballot paper, the majority of the space is taken over by the photographs of the candidates, the candidates' names and addresses, not their party affiliations, which are only a small part of it.  It is not fair or right to allocate funding on that basis.</p><p>  Like Deputy Lucinda Creighton, I also believe it is unconstitutional to discriminate against Members on that basis and that we will be vindicated in the courts, but no one wants to go down that road.  This is a sensible amendment.  The argument the Minister makes is that polling day or the day on which the House first sits is sacrosanct in determining this allocation.  If that is the case, there is a weighting in how funding is distributed between the Government and the Opposition because the Government has more resources available to it.  What happened between 1992 and 1997 was that Fine Gael went from being in opposition to being in government, while Fianna F&aacute;il went from being in government to being in opposition.  Did Fine Gael hold on to the same funding stream during that time?  No, it did not.  Fianna F&aacute;il then received a larger proportion.  The position does change between elections; it is not based on what happens on polling day.  Changes do occur between elections.</p><p>  I have known the Minister for a long time and he is a fair-minded individual.  Will he examine this issue between now and Report Stage?  Will he discuss it with the Attorney General to come forward with an amendment that is fair to every Member and to ensure they all receive similar treatment?  It is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest to have this issue dragged out in argy-bargy on Report Stage and to have all of us ending up in the courts to have this legislation changed.  Will the Minister examine this amendment sincerely?</p></speech>

It is not just the Opposition&rsquo;s role to hold the Government to account but also that of Government backbenchers.  The culture that has developed is a consequence of it being all stick.  If a Government backbencher votes against the Government, not only is he or she excluded from his or her political party, there are consequences for his or her access to funding and resources.  That to me is not in keeping with the Constitution.  The Oireachtas has a much stronger role in the Constitution, but the way we have organised resources, Standing Orders, etc, is not in keeping with this.  That is the point we have to keep to the fore.  This should not be about the five individuals who have lost the Whip, rather it should be about the principle at stake.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly and I argued about this two years ago on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill and it was rejected at the time by some of the very Members who are now arguing for it.  It is only when a Member experiences this that its full import is understood.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

I do not say that in any light fashion, but I happen to have a different view which is honestly held.  I ask members to simply respect that there can be a different perspective honestly held.</p><p>  Deputy Lucinda Creighton made an impassioned contribution.  Starting off with my characterisation of a snapshot, there has to be legitimacy about it, but that is a point of contention.  I have said the legitimacy comes from the decision of the people in a general election.  They determine the composition of the national Parliament.  I know it has been conflated with other issues such as electoral funding by Deputy Stephen Donnelly which I will deal with separately.  What we are discussing is the support of parliamentary activity and how it is determined.</p><p>  There is a view that once a Member is elected to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, he or she has ownership of the resources allocated.  I contend that is not the case.  I sought a nomination in my party and contested it.  There are many people in my constituency who will vote for a Labour Party candidate, irrespective of who it is.  The same goes for Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and so on.  They are entitled to have their determined decision on polling day vindicated.  It is not Brendan Howlin&rsquo;s mandate alone because I sought a mandate on a party platform.</p><p>  One can argue about the internal party machinations of Fine Gael.  However, I do not want to go into them because it is none of my business.  Once the people have made that determination, we want to support the activities of parliamentarians.  Deputies Lucinda Creighton and Denis Naughten have said that, on occasion, it can be a moveable feast with, for example, by-elections.  The difference with a by-election is that, again, the people are consulted.</p></speech>

However, the vote must determine the composition of the Parliament so it would be fundamentally undemocratic if it did not.  In terms of access to speaking time, there is a much larger complaint from the large parliamentary parties - Labour and Fine Gael - where backbenchers do not get speaking time.  It is much easier in the Opposition because it is disproportionately given to those groups.  A simple check of the record of the House in terms of the volume of speaking time would copperfasten that point.</p><p>  In respect of the final impassioned point made by Deputy Creighton about the democratic revolution, I know Deputies sometimes do not want to acknowledge things.  That is fair enough.  However, I need to put on the record the suite of measures this Government is introducing relating to the reform of freedom of information include undoing the damage done by Fianna F&aacute;il the last time, the whistleblowers' legislation which passed Second Stage without opposition yesterday in the D&aacute;il and passed the Seanad, the inquires legislation to strengthen the hand of inquiries and the register of lobbyists that will come is fundamental in terms of changing the democratic structure and openness.  To drive that along with the open Government agenda we have, the open data project I am pushing is a real improvement.  Objectively, people acknowledge that.  Perhaps on a partisan basis it cannot be done but it should be said.</p><p>  Deputy Donnelly talked about how he had spoken to somebody before he came into the House who told him that however cynical he was, he would be more cynical once he got in here and that however dysfunctional he thought it was, it was worse.  That can be a point of view.  I have been here 30 years and have respected all sorts of views.  I have faced trenchant opposition within and outside my party.  One can present that cynical perspective if one likes or one can present a positivity about it because one does not agree with everybody.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of funding.  He talked about a sum of money that will be available to political parties on foot of a variety of funding mechanisms including the Electoral Act.  The Electoral Act is not related to individual Members who are elected.  It is related to first preference votes received in the last election.  There are parties funded from the Electoral Acts who have no members in Parliament because that is the determination of the people.  That is not the Deputy's personal money to hawk around and push back when he likes.  That is determined by the vote of the people on election day to parties represented in the D&aacute;il and those who do not get people elected to the D&aacute;il on the decision of the people on election day.  I pointed that out last time but the Deputy resurrected it again.  </p><p>  Deputy Mathews spoke about the fairness of the snapshot.  We have a point of view in respect of that.  The Deputy says that we are not hidebound by that day in February 2011.  We are actually because this Parliament and Government have a mandate under the law and Constitution that lasts until the next election when the people are asked to vote again.  So that is set in aspic.</p></speech>

By way of convention, I will explain.  It is not possible for a member of Government to present legislation to the Oireachtas without being advised by the Attorney General that it is fully compliant with the Constitution.  The Attorney General is the chief law officer and adviser to the Government and is, obviously, required to formally stamp draft legislation as being approved by her legally.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the amendment is constitutional or not.  I am not accepting it.  I am saying that the law as drafted is constitutional in the view of the Attorney General and the Government.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten again talks in terms of parties or individuals.  It is a fairly fundamental philosophical discussion.  We organise our political systems in parties.  It is a point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy as well in terms of opposing the Whip system.  I can honestly say that we came into Government three years ago and faced a set of economic challenges that were virtually unprecedented, certainly in my political lifetime and probably in anybody's lifetime.  We had to make a series of decisions that were enormously difficult and usually unpopular.  If everybody could parse and analyse every one of those decisions and have a free vote, would we have made progress?  I believe in the party system, internal debate, majority decision and a Whip process that will get the matters done or not.</p></speech>

However, this section we are dealing with in this legislation does not fully back up what the Minister has just said.  At the bottom of page 5 of the legislation, subsection (12) refers to the same topic and says if the members of a party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann decide to dissolve their party and join another party, their entire allowance can transfer to a party to which they were not elected.  For the last half-hour at the Minister has been telling us the snapshot of the general election holds unless the people are consulted in a subsequent by-election or  whatever.  I will be polite: it does not stand up at all based on the section we are discussing.</p></speech>

That is the party the people voted for.  We will clarify that subsection and I am sure Deputies here will want amendments to it on Report Stage.  What is most interesting is that it goes on to state that the allowance for those Members can be transferred to a different party from which they were not elected, and which they probably bitterly opposed during the election campaign.  Nevertheless, the money can travel with them to another party.  The same section states that if some of those Members leave their party and do not join another party, there is no provision for their allowance to travel with them.  It appears to be lost back to the Exchequer.  The only option this section allows is that if members of a party, <i>en masse</i>, dissolve a party and move to another party, the allowance can go to the new party.  If some of them do not go, the allowance is lost back to the Exchequer.  Finally, subsection (13) states, &quot;The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission may make regulations for the purposes of subsection (5)&rdquo;.  That does not synchronise 100% with what the Minister has been saying.  This is a clear exception.  We will call it an exception to the general rule the Minister has been arguing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014022700010#J00500"><p>I will make three very brief points.  First, I asked a question about Governments changing mid-stream.  It does not always take an election to change a Government.  This Government does not have a mandate for five years, but for as long as Parliament gives it that mandate.  As we saw between 1992 and 1997, Parliament gave a mandate to a new Government.  The figures shifted, so it is not set in stone on polling day.  This counteracts the Minister's argument.</p><p>  Second, I have no difficulty with parties receiving funding.  I agree with the Minister on that.  That is why we have provision in the electoral Acts specifically for parties to receive funding based on their performance in the election.  My difficulty is that all of the subsequent funding for the operation of parliamentary duties is based on that result on polling day and this excludes 10% of the Parliament from having basic information so they can actively participate in a lot of debates.</p><p>  My third point is on access to committees, because I would not like this to go unchecked.  The Minister is correct that there is nothing to stop me from coming before any committee.  I would come in at the tail end of the committee.  That is the process and I understand that.  However, the major difficulty with not being a member of the committee is that one does not have access to the committee documentation.  For example, this week I was at the health committee.  Three presentations were given.  Every member of the committee had that documentation and I was trying to participate in that debate blind.</p><p>  This is the fundamental argument I have with this amendment.  Members of Parliament who are denied access to information cannot participate to the same level as Members who have access to information.  When one is outside the party structure one does not have that research capability and access to that information.  The library and research service helps to fill some of that void regarding basic information, but much of the information as legislation goes through the House and issues are debated in committee is denied to non-members.  That is the fundamental problem.  The Minister is ensuring that 10% of the Parliament are trying to participate in the passage of legislation or Government policy decisions with one arm tied behind their backs.</p></speech>

Can we tighten up the debate?  We have allowed a lot of latitude but I do not want the meeting to go on all morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1186" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014022700010#J00700"><p>This goes to the very core of the legislation and it is relevant.  I appreciate that Oireachtas Members are elected on the basis of how they present themselves at election time, whether as members of a political party or not.  However, they are also individually selected.  The two go hand in hand so the Minister cannot say the party brand supersedes the individual.  Perhaps we will have an answer to that of the next election.  It is important that the Minister acknowledge that a party is more than just a logo.  It is not just a name and a brand after one's name.  It is about what the party stands for and what platform it stands on at election time.  A number of Members have spoken of some of us here "leaving" our parliamentary party.  We did not leave our parliamentary party; we were kicked out for a very specific reason, for upholding a pre-election pledge.  If one wants to drill down into the essence of this, what are the sanctions for political parties that do not honour their pre-election platforms?</p></speech>

In fact, it is not that simple.  The individuals are punished through this legislation while the political parties get a bonus for reneging on pre-election commitments because they have fewer people on whom to spend the funds.  When a party presents itself for election and individuals present themselves as candidates for that party, it is about a lot more than simply a logo.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten made a very valid point about the changes that occur if a party leaves Government and the composition of a Government changes mid-way through its term.  It puts paid to the Minister's argument that this is on the basis of a snapshot on polling day, because clearly it is not.  It can change.  There is movement, flexibility and fluidity.  This legislation tries to deny that but then goes on, in section 12, to acknowledge it, so it is completely inconsistent, as Deputy Fleming has pointed out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014022700011#K00200"><p>The two sources of State funding are through the Electoral Act and through the leaders' allowance.  One is paid per Deputy; the leaders' allowance has a sliding scale.  As the Minister pointed out, the Exchequer funding through the Electoral Act is paid per vote.  Whether it is paid per Deputy or per vote, it does not take a great leap to say that the Deputies present today got the votes for which Fine Gael is getting the money.  It is certainly not a great leap to say that when considering the money that should move with a Member of the Oireachtas, one can consider the money that goes for his or her seat and the money that goes in some proportion for the votes he or she got because both amounts of money are directly linked to those Deputies.</p><p>  The Bill renames the leaders' allowance the parliamentary activities allowance.  It would provide that for three Deputies present and other Deputies and Senators the funding provided by the voter for parliamentary activities of Deputies will not be given to Deputies who are kicked out of their parties.  That is an extraordinary thing to say to the voter.  It is saying that the voter will pay for my parliamentary activities as well as those of Deputies Fleming, Murphy and Humphreys, but not for the parliamentary activities of these three Deputies.  That is an extraordinary position.</p><p>  Do they not have parliamentary activities in which they need to engage as Members of the D&aacute;il in the same way that the rest of us do?  The direct implication of not giving taxpayer money for parliamentary activities to a Member, who is kicked out of or leaves his or her party, is that the Member does not have the same parliamentary activities to do that the rest of us have to do.  I ask for the Minister's opinion on that.  That seems to be the inference of not giving them the money, which seems bizarre.</p></speech>

We are talking about taxpayers' money.  It would be very unfair and unethical for the Minister not to accept the amendment.

I will respond as best I can.</p><p>  Deputy Sean Fleming spoke about a dissolution as mentioned in section 12.  It plainly the fact that the will of the people as determined in a general election cannot be fulfilled where the party ceases to exist.  We cannot pay for the parliamentary activities of a non-existent party so provision must be made for that.  If an amalgamation of parties were to take place, it seems reasonable and sensible that we would have provision in law for that amalgamation to be supported in its parliamentary activities.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Naughten's points, I did not mention the issue of changing in mid-stream.  I dealt with that in covering the equality issue.  Where it is understood that there is a proper - I believe Deputy Creighton agreed - rebalancing to be made between the supports for parliamentary activities to be given between Government and Opposition, I have heard nobody resile from that principle.  Obviously, where the structure of Government changes in the course of a Parliament, that tipping in terms of equality must take place and did take place at the time of the change in Government in 1994.

It seems reasonable and logical that this would be the outcome of that very unusual - I believe unprecedented - change within a Parliament.</p><p>  The Deputy made a compelling case on committees and one with which I have absolute sympathy.  My view is that every Member of this House should be entitled to every document that is generated for every committee.  That is a matter that should be taken up with the CPP.  I have no difficult with that, but it is not germane to this legislation, good, bad or indifferent.  However, the Deputy made a very valid point.  He should be equipped on an open data basis to participate in any committee he chooses, as should I and any other elected representative.  However, on the voting, the majority, as determined in the House, has to be reflected in the committees for obvious reasons.</p><p>  Deputy Creighton came back on a number of points.  She made charges against her own party that I will not get into, including that they are being punished at the whim of Government and all the rest.  I understand the angst that underscores that and the genuine feeling, but it has nothing to do with the Bill.  It is not for the discussion here and it is to be taken up elsewhere.</p></speech>

Everybody recognises and the original legislation recognised that there should be a reduction by one third of the allowance payable to parties in government.  My amendment would change the reduction form one third to one half on the basis that when the original legislation was introduced 50 or 60 years ago, we probably had a much more streamlined government and public service at the time.  We now have more special advisers and others in ministerial offices.  We have greater press offices attached to all Ministers' offices.  There is a substantial Government Information Service.  The level of State support through the civil and public service available to the Government has increased over the decades since the one-third reduction for Government Members was introduced.  A reduction of one half would be reflective of the greater level of support the Government now receives from the Civil Service than it would have received heretofore.  Because the principle was recognised from day one, since the original legislation was passed, and the functioning of government has changed quite a bit, we should revisit the proportion of the reduction for Government parties.</p></speech>

For most of the operation of this system, the Government and the Opposition were supported equally.  In 1996 the then Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, determined to rebalance the system when in government.  There was no enthusiasm on the part of Deputy Sean Fleming's party in advance of 1996 to make the adjustment and no enthusiasm subsequent to 1996 to enhance the rebalancing introduced by the then Minister.  My judgment is that it is about right.  There is a requirement that Government Deputies be supported in research and so on.  On our previous discussion, there will be instances when Members on the Government side will have searching points to make and they should have the support of research and so on.  Obviously, they will also need access to present their views to their electorates through a press office.  They will certainly require support and I believe the balance is about right.</p></speech>

We are talking about the level of the reduction.  I did not know it had been introduced in 1996.  Approximately 30 Government Members are Ministers or Ministers of State.  By definition, they do not need the party's research to quite the same extent.  I know they require it for political purposes or whatever else, but they have a lot of advice.  However, most of the time of Ministers and Ministers of State is spent on their ministerial roles, for which they receive ample support from the public service.  I accept that Government backbenchers should have facilities to draft Private Members' Bills, Topical Issues and so on.  In view of the level of support available to the Government, I would have thought a reduction of one half would be more reasonable.</p></speech>

I have a later amendment on the broader issue.  The Minister spoke about open government.  There is no reason for the parliamentary activities allowance not to come through the Minister's Vote every year.  I know it is not germane to his Department.  However, we need to have some mechanism for us to have a debate each year in the Dail.  There is a debate on every other Estimate of Government expenditure apart from a handful of items.  I do not know why the political system is so sensitive about it - historically it has been.  This is paid from the Central Fund to the parties.  Is it paid by the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  I suspect it is the Department of Finance if it comes from the Central Fund.  This is not quite right.  The Minister is the sponsoring Minister for this legislation, yet the payment is not coming through his Department but through the Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.  Even though this might be a difficult debate, it would be healthier for democracy if we had a brief debate on this issue each year as part of the Estimates process through some mechanism.  I am always opposed to any of these payments going through the Central Fund because that bypasses the entire Oireachtas every year and there is no Estimates debate on it.</p></speech>

It also comes in light of general debate about top-up payments.  The amendment indicates &quot;The combined parliamentary activities allowances paid to a party under this section, shall be reduced by the amount of any payment, that is in excess of public sector pay guidelines, paid to any person working for a Minister who is a member of that party.&quot;.  Everybody would see merit in that.  Ministers may have special advisers, as that is the way the system works.  Where the payments to advisers working for Ministers are in excess of public sector guidelines, it amounts to the equivalent of a top-up payment to a special adviser.  There is merit in reducing the payments under the parliamentary activities allowance by the amount of the top-up.  It might help Ministers refrain from seeking such payments for special advisers above public sector pay guidelines.</p><p>  The issue arose in the other committee which I should also be attending now, the Committee of Public Accounts, with regard to Rehab and other organisations which had top-up payments.  The HSE recently made it very clear that it would not tolerate paying taxpayers' money to organisations substantially funded by the State which are paying out topped-up salaries to staff.  The HSE even threatened a 20% reduction in order to force those organisations to eliminate the top-up payments.  If it is good enough for the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to act on section 38 hospitals and organisations, the same logic should apply here.</p><p>  A principled approach has been taken on the issue of payments in excess of public sector pay guidelines by the Department of Health with regard to organisations making payments above those guidelines.  These organisations have been told that funding will be reduced unless payments are brought into line.  The principle being espoused by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, should be reflected in this legislation as well.  It would be very wrong if the message went out from here that the Government or the Oireachtas was opposed to people in receipt of substantial amounts of State funding having a top-up salary but had a different opinion on parliamentary activities allowance, with such payments being made regardless of top-up salaries over and above public sector pay guidelines.  There is a clear political point in this amendment.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, I will deal with the issue, about which I have strong feelings.  I have had the privilege of holding a ministerial post in three Departments, all of which were challenging.  They were in the areas of health, environment and, in the past three years, public expenditure and reform.  Every parliamentary democracy that I know of, where an executive is elected, has parliamentary advisers who are akin to the political thinking of the Minister.  It is absolutely essential for the efficient working of the Government.  We all know that, and when we are in Government we need such a service.  There is not enough of it, to put it bluntly.  It does not matter how many civil servants we have, and there can be any number at any rate of pay; if we have two non-civil servants, however, this seems to be a bone of contention.  We should get off that hook.</p><p>  With regard to rates of pay, as a result of the dire circumstances we were in I determined a guideline level of pay, which was the principal officer standard rate.  That pay rate was well below the rate paid to special advisers in the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  To put it bluntly, implicit in that decision was that where suitable and really good people were to be coaxed into the public service on a temporary basis, we would at least pay them what they received before they came to the public service.  He would kill me for saying it, but I could quote my own special adviser.  I rang a guy whom I absolutely wanted to work with me with an offer.  I asked him to give up his current full-time salaried permanent position and work for me.  I did not know how long that would be for, as I did not know how long the Government would survive.  It could have been a month, a year or five years at the outside.  I asked him to take a pay cut and understand that everything he did would be in the public domain.  I asked him to work all the hours God would send.  Foolishly, he said "Yes" to all those questions.</p><p>  The notion that we can get people of calibre but not pay them a rate for the job - while asking them to work all the hours God sends with no security - means that we would not get a throng of good people, unless there are people with an extraordinary view of the public service.  Most of the people working with Ministers of all persuasions are imbued with that sense of public service.  We need a broader narrative in this regard.</p><p>  I know I am straying well outside the confines of the amendment.  We should appreciate the work done by the political adviser system, which is the norm in public administration everywhere else, and value rather than diminish it.</p></speech>

We have been at odds on many issues today, but this is a really important point.  I strongly support any initiative in the Government to establish a <i>cabinet</i> system whereby senior officials in Departments would be linked to the tenure of a Minister.  There should be equal numbers of external advisers adding value and bringing expertise from outside and the existing expertise, of which there is much, in many Departments.  I do not want to take from that.  The pay of special advisers should be very much linked to the grade of assistant secretary or Secretary General if there is a choice.  I know the Minister went &quot;outside the box&quot; in his choice.  If a political agenda or programme for Government is to be implemented, this is the way to do it.  That is the way it is done in a range of modern democracies and we are very archaic in how we run Departments.  There is an hostility to outside expertise, which is bizarre and nonsensical.  The Government nevertheless created a hostage to fortune by portraying the issue as if caps were in place; perhaps a lesson has been learned from that.  We should value expertise and make it appealing for people to be part of the Government for two, three or five years.</p></speech>

It is slightly unusual and relates to the Ceann Comhairle.  Subsection (8) provides that the parliamentary activities allowance payment shall not be paid in respect of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle is usually elected as a member of a party.  It shall not be paid in respect of the period of office of the Ceann Comhairle as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann: "(a) other than as a member of a qualifying party, or (b) as a member of a qualifying party but was the only member of the qualifying party so elected."  It appears that if the Ceann Comhairle is elected as a member of a party, that party will continue in the lifetime of the D&aacute;il to draw the allowance for the Ceann Comhairle even though, by definition, his post should be above party politics.  There is something not quite right in the Fine Gael Party, in this case, being able to draw a parliamentary activities allowance in respect of a person who has been elected by the D&aacute;il to be absolutely neutral.  The amount is not phenomenal.</p><p>  The provision goes on to refer to where the person was a member of a qualifying party, but was the only member.  My reading of that is that if a Ceann Comhairle was an Independent Member or non-party Member of the D&aacute;il, no allowance would be paid as he or she would now be Ceann Comhairle, so the money is lost.  If there was a tight situation in the D&aacute;il and the Government had a very narrow majority and it picked an Independent Member to be Ceann Comhairle, no payment would be payable under the parliamentary allowance system for that person, but if the person elected Ceann Comhairle is a member of a party, the allowance is paid.  Given that we accept that if the Ceann Comhairle is an Independent Member or non-party Member no allowance is payable, it would be better for the independence of the Ceann Comhairle if the same principle applied if the Ceann Comhairle is a member of a party.  It is the Fine Gael Party now and it could be our party, hopefully, or any party some time in the future, but I do not consider it right that an allowance of &euro;60,000, or whatever the figure is, can be drawn down in respect of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle should be removed from the equation.</p><p>  Does the Minister understand my point?</p></speech>

Draft guidelines will be submitted by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, to the Minister for his or her approval.  We should trust the Standards in Public Office Commission to do this.  We have an independent Standards in Public Office Commission, but on the other hand the Minister of the day is saying he wishes to approve its regulations.  That is not right.  Elsewhere in the legislation we are allowing the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to draw up regulations under the legislation.  We should trust SIPO.  The idea of having an ombudsman or independent commission while, at the same time, the Minister holds a rein on it to ensure he or she is happy with what it is doing is not right.  We should remove the ministerial approval and trust SIPO.  We are entrusting it to oversee the various legislative measures relating to standards in public office so we should trust it to draw up these guidelines without reference to the Minister.  It is about the independence of SIPO, rather than it having to refer back to the Minister for approval.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery of the need to switch off their mobile phones completely.  This is because they interfere with the broadcasting and recording of proceedings.  It is unfair to members of staff and those watching at home to be obliged to listen to interference on sound.</p><p>  I congratulate the European Parliament on the vote which took place there yesterday in respect of the tobacco products directive.  The Parliament has made a very significant decision, which builds on the work this committee has done and which reflects the decision taken by the Minister for Health during his Presidency of the European Council of Health Ministers.  I compliment both the European Parliament and the Minister on the decision taken yesterday.  I also thank the members of this committee for the work they did during our hearings on the tobacco industry and in respect of the plain packaging of tobacco products.</p><p>  As members are aware, tomorrow is both the last day of February and Rare Diseases Day.  As part of the initiative taken by this committee on behalf of all Irish citizens, and as originally proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, we have held a number of rare diseases information and awareness sessions as part of our work programme.  We are very happy to continue that process at this meeting.  Members will receive an in-depth briefing on the issues which arise in Ireland in the context of various rare diseases from groups which deal with them.  I am aware that the groups represented at this meeting held a significant briefing session in the Mansion House yesterday and that a public awareness day will take place tomorrow in Belfast.  It is appropriate that the committee is both facilitating and hosting this meeting as part of its work programme.  I take this opportunity to welcome our guests, Ms Anne Lawlor, information and development officer with the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, Dr. Se&aacute;n Ennis, direct of  UCD's Academic Centre on Rare Diseases, Professor Eileen Treacy, Ms Lorraine Dempsey, Mr. Declan McPhillips and Mr. Philip Watt.

My name is Anne Lawlor and I am the only employee of the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation.  I work 15 hours a week to facilitate queries and provide signposts to organisations and individuals that can assist the many callers with existing rare conditions or those who are newly diagnosed and who do not know where to turn.  I am also a patient representative.  I am the parent of a young woman who is affected by a rare condition, 22q11 deletion syndrome.  This is a chromosomal deletion syndrome and I helped to co-found the support group relating to it some seven years ago.  At that time, there was no information or support available to me.  I hope to provide the committee with a background on the issue of rare diseases, particularly in the context of the impact of such diseases on families and the work that has been done in the past couple of years to improve the situation.</p><p>  A rare disease is defined by the EU as a condition that affects fewer than five in 10,000 people or 0.05% of the population.  Although precise data on rare disease prevalence have not been collected in Ireland, the Department of Health recognises that between 6% and 8% of the population could be affected by a rare condition.  This is based on estimates by the European Union Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases, EUCERD.  Approximately 80% of rare diseases are genetic in origin and most are life threatening or associated with significant disability, including intellectual disability.  Between 50% and 75% of rare conditions affect children and it is estimated that 30% of these children die before the age of five.  It is accepted that there may be a higher prevalence of rare diseases in Ireland due to our history of being a small island nation with a greater degree of genetic interaction.  Taking a percentile of 6% to 8% into account, alongside the figures from the 2011 census, as many as 350,000 citizens of Ireland could be affected by a rare condition during their lifetimes.  This would represent by far the largest patient constituency in the country.  However, rare diseases are largely ignored and misunderstood.  According to the European database on rare diseases, Orphanet, approximately five new conditions are described each week.  This is due, in part, to new technology which can identify rare conditions.</p><p>  With up to 8,000 rare diseases described, the impact is wide and varied.  Some people are affected by conditions which are life limiting and for which there is no treatment.  Others are diagnosed as infants with a condition that they will grow up with but not out of.  Children and young adults are diagnosed with conditions that are complex in nature and associated with physical, sensory, intellectual, social, emotional and genetic consequences.  Some of them also develop mental health problems.  When a person is diagnosed with a rare condition, the impact on the entire family is enormous.  A diagnosis often goes beyond the immediate symptoms experienced by the person affected and can have effects on the family unit.  This is particularly true in the case of rare diseases due to the high genetic risk of the condition.  In many cases a diagnosis leads to the development of financial and psychological issues.  Many rare diseases require multidisciplinary approaches involving a range of services at each stage of the affected person's life.</p><p>  Due to their complexity, rare conditions can be difficult to manage and those affected can encounter enormous difficulties in finding adequate treatment.  People with rare conditions are often unable to participate in work or education or else their ability to do so is quite limited.  Learning disabilities can add to their difficulties with education.  For a significant proportion whose condition does not affect their ability to participate, however, it is the lack of support which excludes them from education and employment opportunities.  This is a critical issue for members of Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation.  It is also acknowledged that many restrictions and difficulties are encountered with regard to the provision of many types of insurance - including life, motor and medical insurance - as well as problems in acquiring mortgages for people with genetic and rare diseases.</p><p>  Although there has been some progress with better communication between patient groups and specialists in the medical field, it remains the case that those who have received an accurate diagnosis are considered fortunate.  Patients and families affected by rare diseases can wait years for a correct diagnosis and the number who have received an incorrect diagnosis before the final one is made is too high.  Delays in diagnosis have serious implications for both life expectancy and quality of life and are leading to inefficient use of already overstretched resources.  In 2011 a survey by the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation showed that 13.3% of people waited over ten years for a diagnosis and that 37.2% received an incorrect initial diagnosis.  Any delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis can result in multiple and unnecessary appointments with doctors and consultants, incorrect treatments and diagnostic tests and, of course, significant distress.  Diagnostic experiences for patients vary greatly and there are many questions concerning equity of access and fair treatment, depending on where one lives in the country.  The lack of awareness of rare conditions among health care professionals, including family GPs, is of concern to the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation's members, who have highlighted the fact that in the case of paediatrics the parents are the experts who inform the health care professionals.  The delay for a genetic test at the National Centre for Medical Genetics is in excess of 15 months and samples continue to be sent abroad, costing the Government in the region of &euro;1.5 million per annum.</p><p>  When we previously presented to the committee in February 2012, our main concern was the lack of a central point of information for patients or medical professionals in the field of rare diseases.  We demonstrated that in certain areas where patient groups exist, information flows and awareness is greater.  However, thousands of patients have no group to represent them or inform the medical professionals on their conditions.  They feel lost and marginalised and are becoming increasingly desperate.  The Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation is represented on the national steering committee at the Department of Health.  The latter is working with stakeholders on the development of a national plan.  The issue of a national office for rare diseases has emerged as a key recommendation.  This was also one of the key needs to come out of the consultation process on the development of a national plan at a meeting of stakeholders on 11 June 2012 and the associated online consultation that followed.  It is proposed that the rare diseases office would assist with and support epidemiological research and population studies in rare disorders with partners - principal among which would be the Health Research Board, HRB, the Medical Research Charities Group, MRCG, the Department of Health, Institute of Public Health, etc. - and over time consolidate access to all known rare disease registries and incorporate the relevant information into the Orphanet portal.</p><p>  One of the goals of the office would be to support local implementation of best practice, as the patient feedback from European project for rare diseases national plans development, EUROPLAN, and other public consultation indicates that Irish patients seek quality care as near to home as possible.  It is hoped to provide early access to information and referral to ensure that patients will not be obliged to wait longer than necessary to be given a means to manage their mostly life-limiting and debilitating conditions.  In addition, population screening and advances in therapies for rare diseases will emphasise the need for agreed care plans and pathways, which provide life-long care and which will require a governance model through a rare diseases clinical directorate.  The national centre for metabolic disorders at Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the national centre for medical genetics at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, are seen as centres for expertise in rare disorders.  However, both remain severely under-resourced.  Due to significant resource deficits at the national centre for medical genetics, no new clinicians are being trained.  This will result in an even greater shortage of trained professionals in this discipline in the next ten years.  In order to prioritise rare diseases as a whole in the Irish health system and address the current information deficit among health care professionals when it comes to such diseases, networks for provision of equity and safe care to all those affected by rare conditions should be developed.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it, and it is an honour for me as a scientist and the interdisciplinary group I represent.  I commend the interest shown by the committee in rare diseases.</p><p>  My message is simple.  It is that research into the genetic causes of rare diseases works.  What we can achieve in studying a single rare disease today was considered a lifetime achievement only three to five years ago, and this is mainly due to the revolution in genomics and genetic technology and the ability to be able to apply this to any rare disease.  Our focus is on rare genetic diseases, particularly those affecting the Irish and Irish Traveller population.  We have tried to identify a mutation causing the disease - a spelling mistake in the DNA - and we try to develop diagnostic tests, which are passed to our partners, the National Centre for Medical Genetics, to validate and implement these tests.  Once we implicate a gene, we try to build a picture of what is going on, and this knowledge can have an impact on patient management and improve health care for the patient.  Our ultimate aim is to investigate conditions which may be amenable to drug targeting or gene therapy.  Currently, patient symptoms are treated rather than the cause of a rare disease, with limited treatment options available.  Rare diseases take a disproportionate amount of the current health budget.</p><p>  In my submission I have highlighted three success stories to illustrate the potential power for rare disease research.  The story of children born with no eyes was our first major breakthrough using current technology, and we identified the "spelling mistake", as it was, in a gene involved in transporting vitamin A into cells at the right time for the support of eye development.  The second story is one concerning a pigmentation infection disorder, and this was originally thought to be three separate syndromes.  The "spelling mistake" affected two different genes.  The third story - the LARS story - concerned what was thought to be an error in what we call the battery packs of body cells but it turned out to be a life-threatening infantile liver failure disease.</p><p>  What is the impact of these findings?  We have developed diagnostic genetic tests and next month will see the formal introduction by the National Centre for Medical Genetics of those tests, with the conditions added to the testing panel.  With regard to impact on patient management, accurate carrier testing and genetic counselling can be offered to individuals, and there is a psychological benefit for patients just having a diagnosis.  A simple DNA test now avoids hazardous and invasive procedures in children.  Earlier diagnosis allows earlier treatment and it often delays onset of a condition, reducing time to diagnosis.  In some instances we can personalise treatment and heighten awareness.  This type of work allows new insights into the mechanism of disease and the potential for new targets or therapeutics.  It also adds important diagnostic criteria, often with the rare disease informing a broader issue.  Like putting a man on the moon or sending a rocket to Mars, we are working with colleagues around the world and we have a set an aim to drive the field.  We wish to put in place by 2020 a genetic test for all the known 7,000 rare diseases, and to develop therapies for 200 of these diseases.</p><p>  I recommend that the committee consider this approach highly effective and will be of increasing importance in the coming years, with national expertise existing in this arena and making a contribution to Ireland's rare disease burden.  I urge the committee to be brave in long-term planning and consider the widespread implementation of genomics in rare disease and personalised medicine.  I also highlight the importance of basic biomedical research.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eileen Treacy" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022700006#F00300"><p>Good morning.  I thank Deputy Buttimer and the joint committee for the opportunity to speak today.  Members have heard that rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases affecting up to 300,000 Irish people during their lives.  Although a high proportion of these conditions present in childhood, many present for the first time in adulthood.  Across Europe, it is recognized that accurate and timely diagnosis and access to treatment for individuals with rare diseases are severely hampered by their lack of recognition and visibility in health care systems.  This leads to poor co-ordination and communication with limited and fragmented clinical and research resources and often a lack of national specific clinical expertise for the condition.  After the devastating news of the diagnosis of many of these severely debilitating, life-changing conditions is provided to those affected and their families, the normal response is to seek a cure.  Fortunately, major advances in genetic technology and emerging therapies mean that many conditions, previously considered to be untreatable, now have major therapeutic approaches.</p><p>  In Ireland, challenging times of significantly reduced health care spending and reduced HSE employment numbers mean that marginalised and vulnerable people suffer most unless significant protective mechanisms are put in place.  The document Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 explicitly outlines the Government's commitment to faster access to hospital care, improved quality and safety for all Irish patients and better treatment of chronic illness.  According to Fineberg, a US expert writing in 2012, a successful health system is effective, safe, timely, patient-centered, equitable and efficient.  Treatment is applied without discrimination to all individuals and families<i>.  </i>The system must also be fair to the health professionals and institutions delivering care.  A sustainable health system must also be affordable and adaptable to changing health care needs, new diseases and new treatments.  Members will be aware of a 2009 European Council Recommendation calling for action in this area.  This will be elaborated in our emerging national plan and has been described in my written submission.<br /><b></b> I now wish to focus on a number of key items in the patient journey.  These are equality of access to services, care, treatment and support for all rare disease patients in Ireland, whether children or adults; identification and establishment of centres of expertise for multidisciplinary care; and improving the co-ordination and integration of services whether provided in Ireland or in collaboration with neighbouring European centres.  We are pleased to report that the HSE commenced a national clinical programme for rare diseases in December 2013.  The working group held its first meeting earlier this week.  The programme aims to provide clinical expertise for those affected with rare diseases to be provided through a network of national centres of expertise or, for very rare disorders, in collaboration with European designated centres.  Timely access to appropriate diagnosis and care should result in decreased mortality, morbidity and disability, improve quality of life and be cost-effective.</p><p>  In Ireland, the development of national clinical programmes has demonstrated that successful implementation and transformation can occur with improved efficiencies.  This was evident in the success of the national cancer control programme and recent developments in the care of patients with cystic fibrosis.  A further example is the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders which provides multidisciplinary care for children and adults with hereditary coagulation disorders.  Its quality is governed by the National Hemophilia Council.  It is anticipated that staffing and sustainability issues for the principal national centres diagnosing and treating large cohorts of patients will require attention.  Resources are required to provide safe, timely access to diagnosis, multidisciplinary care and treatment for rare disease groupings of high volume, which are provided locally, or requiring very expert specialised care such as such as at the National Centre for Medical Genetics and the National Centre for Inherited Metabolic Disorders.</p><p>  The joint committee has heard that approximately 80% of rare diseases are genetic in origin, which means that effective genetic services have a vital role to play in diagnosis and prevention.  The Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine recommends that appropriate, timely genetic counselling is provided for individuals undergoing predictive genetic tests.  Early genetic diagnosis, screening and early treatment is highly cost effective.  The establishment of a national clinical programme for rare diseases represents a major step forward in the management of rare diseases in line with EU recommendations.  We can now move quickly to benefit from the available EU collaboration.</p><p>  The ongoing consultation process with all stakeholders and the emerging national plan calls for the establishment of a central national rare diseases office linked to the national clinical programme to provide up to date information on new treatments and management options for all Irish patients affected with rare diseases.  The office is proposed to act as a national point of reference for enquiries relating to services, diagnostics and clinical trials.  It would be linked to established databases, particularly the European information portal, Orphanet.  For this function, support by the representative member state is one of the key outcome indicators for rare diseases, national plans and strategies.  It is evident that such a model of care would improve the patient experience, facilitate safe quality care, expedite diagnosis, provide the correct treatment, improve communication and education and prove to be cost efficient.  The economic benefit to the State of the establishment of a central rare diseases office will stem from the streamlining of access to diagnosis for patients and appropriate quality treatments with increased efficiencies.<br /><b></b>The recommendations and strategies to meet European recommendations will cover appropriate governance of centres of expertise and the national rare diseases office; establishment of the required financial and sustainability models; and allocation of human and physical resources and the organisation and management of service delivery.  Recommendations will be forthcoming in the rare disease national plan.  We are well on the journey with the commencement of the clinical programme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022700007#G00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for inviting me to speak on behalf of the Special Needs Parents Association, which is a parent-led voluntary organisation with charitable status.  It was established by parents from all over Ireland to represent the views of the parents of people with special needs and disabilities, regardless of their age or diagnosis.  Our main objective is to support all parents of people with special needs and disabilities by providing information and peer support.  In keeping with this objective, we strongly advocate an ethos of collaboration with other representative organisations and support groups in this field.  We thank the committee for inviting us to address it today, alongside the other organisations that are represented here.</p><p>  Children and adults with rare disorders do not necessarily have a disability as defined in the Disability Act 2005.  In some cases, their main interaction with the health system is almost exclusively at hospital-based tertiary care level, led out by specialist clinical teams.  The members of the Special Needs Parents Association have children with rare diseases who fall into the category of having a disability or a special educational need.  They are the area of our focus in this submission.  Regardless of when parents initially learn their child is not developing as expected - he or she may present with complex medical needs or be diagnosed pre-natally or immediately post-natally - the pathway to be followed can differ dramatically.  Depending on the nature of the condition, the pathway can be relatively well laid-out or can be highly complex.  In the case of patients with rare diseases, establishing a precise diagnosis and initiating a treatment are typically not straightforward.  Additional expertise is often required, but it is not necessarily readily available in Ireland.</p><p>  I propose to speak about five areas that have been identified by our members - the parents of children with rare diseases - as being problematic, namely, information, genetic testing and counselling, disability services, paediatric home care and special educational supports.  Quite often, especially in cases of extremely rare disorders, the available and possibly useful information for parents whose children have rare diseases is not easily accessible or readily signposted.  This is a source of frustration for parents who inadvertently end up embarking on their own Internet searches.  This should be done with extreme caution, as it can cause undue distress to parents who are not readily predisposed to reading medical journals and research papers which, for example, may refer to a particular chromosome.  We dealt with the case of a parent who googled a genetic anomaly that had been identified through testing and came upon an Italian research paper that referenced the chromosome in relation to the development of breast cancer.  Although this had absolutely nothing to do with the genetic condition the child had been diagnosed with, the parent lived with the fear that the child was facing a gruesome prognosis until we provided a more relevant source of information and support, albeit based in the United States.</p><p>  Several valuable websites provide information and family profiles of children with genetic and rare disorders, or, in the case of SWAN UK, children who have syndromes without names.  Some parents have expressed disappointment and frustration about being handed a leaflet by a genetic counsellor directing them to an organisation like Unique and having to source all information by themselves thereafter.  I do not doubt the intention is not to cause further distress to families, but that is the outcome.  The genetic teams are concerned with having the time and resources to be in a position to provide an information pack to those who receive a diagnosis.  The section of our presentation dealing with genetic testing and counselling makes it clear that the time lag between diagnosis and genetic counselling inadvertently leads to families having to fend for themselves and depend on their own capacity to source information and analyse its relevance.  I will read some quotes from parents throughout this presentation.  One parent told us that a neurologist &quot;gave us the diagnosis but knew nothing about the syndrome and said the genetics centre [would] go through it with us&quot;.  This parent received a letter saying &quot;they will see us in 14 months&quot; and was &quot;literally left to google to find out everything myself&quot;.  Our association has developed a page on its website dedicated to rare disorders, which lists useful websites where parents can begin their searches.  As a voluntary organisation, we do not have the specific resources required to assist every parent in need of very specific and often technically presented medical information.  Therefore, we refer parents to other bodies, such as the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation.</p><p>  An investigation that was published by RehabCare in 2008 looked at the social support needs of families on the island of Ireland that have children with rare disorders.  It found that &quot;specialist health professionals involved in this research agreed that the information they have on rare disorders can often be in an unsuitable format for parents and that support is needed to help them translate information and compile it for families&quot;.  The submission I have furnished to the joint committee provides various statistics on medical professionals at tertiary and primary levels, in terms of the information they knew and the deficits thereafter.  The RehabCare investigation stated:<blockquote>All of the family participants in this research had either used the internet to access information on the relevant rare disorder or had a friend who got them information from the internet; 60.3 per cent of the GPs who cited where they sourced their information on rare disorders stated that the internet was their primary tool.  This research has reported on the strengths as well as the risks of internet usage in searching for information on rare disorders.</blockquote>This further endorses our call for the establishment of a national rare diseases office.</p><p>  All that we can offer to the parents of children without a diagnosis is peer support to prevent the isolation experienced by many parents who have no specific group to which to belong.  We are aware that non-governmental organisations involved with rare diseases have a significant role in the dissemination of information and the provision of public support.  In the cases of many rare diseases, these organisations are led by parents or patients on a voluntary basis with the primary function of providing information and peer support.  They do not necessarily fit the criteria for many of the funding schemes that are available.  While they serve a valuable function by providing information and support, they are precluded from applying for funding unless they embark on particular projects, which typically require them to provide matching funding.  This is not a possibility for many of the smaller groups that represent individual rare syndromes.  Such groups are typically run by parents who dedicate their time to addressing the needs of their own children and supporting the needs of other families.  We would welcome a funding scheme of minor grants specifically for the purposes of supporting small voluntary organisations and groups involved in the provision of peer support and information.</p><p>  I will move on to speaking about genetic testing and counselling.  From a practical perspective, waiting times for genetic testing and subsequent genetic counselling have been particularly problematic for families who have to work within the current system, in which diagnosis is essential if educational and therapeutic supports are to be obtained.  We must also consider the psychological impact of waiting for answers over lengthy periods, which can sometimes be measured in years rather than months.  This could be alleviated by increasing the staffing resources in genetic centres.  We have been contacted by a parent who has told us that &quot;the waiting list for geneticist in Crumlin is nearly 2yrs&quot;.  This person's daughter was &quot;referred in Oct 2012 and again in June 2013 and [is] still waiting&quot;.  They have been told they will &quot;be waiting a year to see the genetic councillor to discuss diagnosis&quot; if they are prepared to travel to Dublin.  Alternatively, they will have to wait &quot;over a year and half to see him in my local hospital&quot;.</p><p>  I would like to comment on disability services.  If a child requires a referral for interventions from primary care and disability services, the pathway can be fraught with difficulties depending on the area in which they live and the child's clinical diagnosis.  It would not be unusual for consultants to have to write more than one letter to these services impressing on them the need for patients to receive therapeutic interventions to maximise their potential and minimise the adverse effects of inaction.  I will quote from another parent:<blockquote>I have a 4yr old with 3p syndrome.  She has a lot of issues [including] low muscle tone, moderate hearing, wears glasses, developmentally delayed, not toilet trained.  She has a few words so far so communicating to anyone outside the home is very tough for her.  She's never been assessed by an Occupational Therapist, gets minimal speech therapy even though Temple Street sent letters stating she needs a lot of therapy as she has sensory issues especially regarding food.  I'm at my wits end due to lack of therapy for her and she's pushed round from pillar to post as no one has heard of her syndrome.  She's such a pleasant child [and] my heart is broken [that] she cannot communicate.</blockquote></p></speech>

My daughter, Shauna, is profoundly disabled by Rett syndrome.  I thank the committee for extending the invitation to us to make a presentation at this meeting.  I thank Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in particular who nominated us to attend.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in attended our conference and experienced at first hand the difficulties faced by these families.  I thank everyone from both Houses of the Oireachtas and from the Northern Ireland Assembly who took part in the Mourne Mountains charity walk last year, the proceeds of which were very kindly donated to the Rett Syndrome Association of Ireland.<br /><b></b> The association is a voluntary organisation with nine committee members, all parents of children with Rett syndrome and CDKL 5.  It a rare neurological disorder primarily affecting girls and is caused by a random mutation of a gene on the X chromosome.  The incidence is one in every 10,000 female births, approximately three per year.  In most cases the girls appear normal at birth and continue to develop until a devastating regression takes place, usually between 12 and 18 months, leaving the girls with a multiple range of profound physical and intellectual disabilities.  Most are unable to walk, talk or use their hands, resulting in total dependency for all their needs, day and night, for all their lives  Epilepsy, scoliosis, breathing irregularities and tube feeding are also common features of the condition.  There are a total of 21 symptoms.  CDKL 5 is a very similar condition with similar symptoms and is often referred to as atypical Rett syndrome.  There are three cases of CDKL 5 in Ireland and 74 cases of Rett syndrome in our organisation.</p><p>  The first major breakthrough came in 1999 when the gene responsible for the condition was discovered.  This led to the creation of Rett mice models in laboratories around the world.  In 2007, the scientific and medical world was rocked when Rett syndrome became the first neurological disorder to be reversed or cured in mice in a laboratory.  This has given great hope not only to families affected by Rett syndrome but also to those affected by other neurological disorders, including autism.<br />The search for a cure in humans continues and many trials are taking place around the world in efforts to identify existing drugs, in the Children's Hospital in Boston and in Italy, which may relieve some of the many symptoms of the condition.  That is why continuous funding for research into rare diseases is critical as a breakthrough can often have knock-on effects for other mainstream conditions.</p><p>  We carried out a survey of families which included just over half the number of families in the organisation.</p></speech>

Some 55% of girls with Rett syndrome are under the age of 12 years.  The oldest woman with the condition who I know of in Ireland is 46 years of age and lives in Longford.  I met her at the conference last October.  Some 66% of the women in question have or had scoliosis.  The waiting time for surgery has ranged between four months and three years.  Some of the women have curvatures of 85% and some 89% and 71% suffer from severe constipation and reflux, respectively.</p><p>  Some 59% of parents get less than three to five hours' sleep on a normal night.  Some 63% have received injuries relating to the care of their daughters and 87% have reported that family income for their daughters' care has been reduced by the previous two budgets.  Some 66% of families are the affected children's primary carers, but only 54% receive respite care and 17% of the girls do not receive any physiotherapy at all.  As 83% of them have medical cards, it means that 17% of girls with this condition have none.</p><p>  Of the parents, 94% report stress in their relationships because of caring for their children and 61% have experienced depression over their daughters' disabilities.  Some 47% report difficulties in waiting for surgeries.  Long waiting lists are the most usual problems.  In Northern Ireland, the longest that most families must wait for appointments is eight weeks.</p><p>  Other items referred to by families include inadequate access to medical services, medical service staff not being knowledgeable of Rett syndrome, difficulty in accessing the necessary equipment, cutbacks to transport and being unable to afford alterations to cars.</p><p>  As a parent, I know what it is like...</p></speech>

I will focus on two key areas.  The first will give a brief description of the approach that we have adopted towards promoting the issues and challenges of rare diseases.  The second will outline some of the reasons we need an effective national plan on rare diseases.</p><p>  The rare diseases task force brings together three networks, including the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, GRDO.  I acknowledge the presence of its chairperson, Ms Avril Daly.  The other networks are the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry, IPPOSI - I acknowledge the presence of my colleague, Ms Eibhlin Mulroe - and the MRCG.  We bring together a wide range of patient groups that are concerned with rare diseases, which I have listed in our submission for the benefit of committee members.</p><p>  Mr. McPhillips has set out why we need an effective plan.  I will highlight two further conditions that would benefit from an effective national plan on rare diseases.  Emma is 28 years old and has epidermolysis bullosa, EB, which means her skin is fragile, delicate and easily damaged.  Like most rare diseases, it is a genetic condition and affects approximately 300 people in Ireland.  If someone with EB knocks or rubs his or her skin, it causes the skin to blister and come off.  Emma requires high doses of pain relief, including morphine.  However, she states: "I never let it get me down.  Research into better treatments and cures for EB is happening worldwide.  It is important to have an organisation [Debra Ireland is the name of that patient organisation] that fights on your behalf".</p><p>  I will provide another brief example.  Ciara is in her mid-20s and has Huntington's disease, which is an inherited neurological disorder.  Each child of an affected adult has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disorder.  There are more than 500 sufferers in Ireland.  It begins with involuntary movements and balance problems, progressively impacts on organisation and perception skills and can involve mood and personality changes.  The impact is not just on health, including mental health, but on employment and relationships.  Ciara states: "It sent a shockwave through my family as we found out we are all at risk.  We knew so little about the disease".</p><p>  There are significant problems with the health system as it relates to rare diseases.  We have heard eloquent testimony from everyone present.  There are lengthy delays in diagnosis or, in some cases, there are misdiagnoses, thus delaying treatment or seeing the wrong treatment provided.  Parents and patients have difficulty in accessing accurate information and support.  When a parent is told that his or her child may have a particular disease, naturally the parent's first action is to try to Google it.  Often, this creates much fear, misinformation and concern.  We need a national office from which accurate information can be provided and that parents know to contact directly.</p><p>  In terms of cystic fibrosis, the greatest improvement has been the development of specialised centres with multidisciplinary teams.  However, major gaps and weaknesses exist in the treatment of people with rare diseases.  We have heard of some today.</p><p>  Additional challenges are posed by rare diseases.  Frequently, research into the development of new therapies and drugs carries a very high cost.  Development itself costs a great deal, but there is also less return on that investment for the pharmaceutical companies.  There is a considerable risk in investing large sums of money without knowing whether a particular therapy will be successful.  There is a lack of understanding among the media and the general public as to why drugs for rare diseases - orphan drugs, as they are called - are more expensive.  More information needs to be provided to ensure that people understand why this is the case.</p><p>  There is also insufficient funding of basic health research in Ireland.  There is a slight concern that we are moving more towards applied research, that is, research that simply informs services.  We need to continue investing in basic research and finding cures.  I say this carefully because, in some cases, cures or near-to-cures are being found for some rare diseases.  This is a great beacon of hope - with further investment in basic research, more cures or at least the alleviation of the conditions of those with rare diseases will come about.</p><p>  What is frequently glossed over or misunderstood is the need for greater support and recognition for patient groups.  While I am involved in Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, which is relatively well resourced, many patient groups are basically composed of two, three or four people, for example, parents, who are doing all of the work on a voluntary basis.  They need support.  The GRDO is the organisation that provides that support, although it has few resources to do so.</p></speech>

There are several issues which have to be discussed and teased out on a broader basis.  One relates to the support for individual families and the difficulties they face on a daily basis in dealing with rare diseases.  Another issue is how to fund and put in place a proper system whereby we can have collaborative research and transnational co-operation in terms of diagnostics and treatments.</p><p>  It is fair to say that since we are discussing rare diseases the topic does not have the same impact as others.  This is because many small groups have amalgamated to make a large group, which is disparate by its nature.  It can be insular and isolated in terms of people dealing with these issues.</p><p>  Do we have the capacity in this country to carry our and support research and then move into diagnostics and treatment?  Do we have the capacity to deal with all of the various rare diseases in the country or do we need to accept that we need to be collaborative in our approach with Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and Europe?  Should we accept that and try to put in place structures that will make it seamless, efficient and humane for the people who will need to be diagnosed and who will need to access treatment?  Although we would like to see services available in Ireland, is it always feasible, possible, practical and affordable?  Unfortunately, at the end of the day everything must be addressed around that consideration.  I am keen to hear some thoughts on that.</p><p>  Reference has been made to basic research.  For years we criticised researchers, including those in universities and research institutes throughout the country because they were not moving to a spin-out system whereby research is put into a commercial venture at some stage.  Perhaps we have gone to the extreme in this area whereby we are now forcing people to agree that research must be commercialised as quickly as possible for financial gain.  Is basic research being undermined in our universities and research institutes throughout the country and further afield, including Europe?  Is research primarily focused on commercial outcomes as opposed to the basic research principle?  I am keen to hear some thoughts on that, especially from Dr. Se&aacute;n Ennis.</p><p>  We speak a good deal about primary care and this is how we intend to deliver care in the future in this country.  The funding we are providing for primary care certainly does not match up with the statements of intent.  How do we expect general practitioners to have a basic knowledge of up to 8,000 rare diseases?  How can we expect primary care teams to have a basic knowledge?  How do we expect primary care teams to be able to identify where patients should go for diagnostics?  Do we have sufficient consultants?  Have we the capability or the number of consultants on this island to be able to assist our primary care teams and GPs, who are at the coal-face day-in, day-out in terms of dealing with rare diseases?</p><p>  We have all heard anecdotal evidence and personal statements from individuals whose family members have been affected by rare diseases.  One of the major challenges has been to get the diagnosis.  For years parents were almost vilified in their own minds and thought there was something wrong with them because they believed there was something wrong with their child.  That put considerable stress and pressures on individuals and families.</p><p>  The bottom line is, unfortunately, that everything is resource dependent.  I dislike being blunt on the matter and, from an Opposition Deputy's point of view, it is always easier to say the opposite.  However, the key issue is whether we need to be more collaborative throughout Europe not only in terms of the diagnostics but also in terms of the treatments.  Is it always feasible to have the treatments on this island?  I am keen for some clarity on that issue.</p><p>  The issue of paediatric home carers is a very sensitive area and we need highly-qualified clinicians.  It is not simply a case of putting a person into the home to look after children.  We need well-trained clinicians who can support the family as part of home care paediatric packages.  Do we need to begin to accept that at present our clinicians need further training?  Do we need to enhance their capacity to support individuals who have rare diseases as well as their families?</p></speech>

The message that the deputations have delivered not only in terms of what we need to provide but in the great hope that underlies all of what they have had to say is of great importance.  I hope that on the eve of international rare disease day the broad media will take on board this morning's session of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and report it appropriately.  Too often, the work of this committee is overlooked and I believe that is doing a disservice, particularly to the significant body of people, including many young people among that number, that each of the deputations represent.</p><p>  At the outset of Ms Lawlor's contribution she referred to the condition not affecting the ability of a child, adolescent or even an older life to participate but that it was a lack of support that excludes them from education and employment opportunities.  She said this was of great concern to the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation.  Will Ms Lawlor elaborate on these areas of support to prime us, as elected voices in these Houses not only in this committee?  What supports might open a door to education and employment for young people or older people who are currently excluded from either of those options in life?</p><p>  Reference was made to the lack of awareness of rare conditions among health care professionals, including the family general practitioner.  Often, the GP is the first line of engagement.  This is a major area and it is very important.  I could be repeating a question I asked two years ago but has there been ongoing engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish College of General Practitioners or the National Association of General Practitioners to prime them to fine tune their awareness of this area in order that they can, in turn, impact on their respective memberships?  Most of the memberships would be dual, with the IMO being the most likely overarching body since it represents the greater number.  In that regard GPs are a first point of contact.  What steps have been taken or can now be taken to try to improve that awareness?</p><p>  The deputations highlighted several points in their presentations which we can take up as elected voices.  These included the point about the genetic test and that so many samples continue to be sent abroad with the cost this represents, something in the region of &euro;1.5 million per annum.  All too sadly the economic end of today's life and the cost of things is of major importance.</p></speech>

I think you speak for us all.  We do not necessarily understand, but we appreciate and we are genuine in our approach today, and we thank you, Mr. McPhillips, for being here.  I know it has taken a Trojan effort to be here, and I want to thank you and your family.  I now call on Senator Burke.</p></speech>

One example is of a person being dealt with in Dublin and it was obvious that a diagnosis had not been provided.  When the person went to the treatment abroad fund about getting a referral to Great Ormond Street, we had major difficulty in getting the treatment abroad office to come on board.  Ms Lawlor's organisation deals with many people and I wondered if this is the norm.  How is it being dealt with?  This problem arose because of one line in the medical report in the Dublin hospital stating that there was a need for a second opinion.  As that wording was used, the treatment abroad office decided that it would not fund second opinions.  The problem in this case was that there was no diagnosis so it was not about getting a second opinion anyway, but about getting a first opinion on what the diagnosis should be.  What is Ms Lawlor's experience with that?</p><p>  I had an Adjournment matter on the national rare diseases office recently, trying to press the issue.  Have we looked at the cost of setting up this office?  The response I have received so far from the Department has not been what I would like it to be.  Do we even have an idea of the cost of setting up and running this office for a period of 12 months?  Do the witnesses have any information from the Department as to when this office is likely to be set up?  If we have a costing for it for 12 months at least, perhaps we can examine whether money can be taken from another budget that will not be used over the next 12 months.  I know there is very little in the health care area which is not going to be used up, but I imagine that it is not a phenomenal amount of money to run this office.  I am a bit concerned about the delay in dealing with this issue and I wonder what Ms Lawlor's view is on that.</p></speech>

I have special knowledge of rare diseases, although I do not want to say any more about it.  I think Mr. Watt may know.</p><p>  I would like to speak about the inequality of technical knowledge of the medical profession about the treatment of rare diseases.  We had witnesses before the committee recently speaking about Lyme disease, and they had extreme difficulty in getting the medical profession recognise their condition.  I brought it up in the D&aacute;il last week with the Minister for Health, and he was very forthcoming about the condition and the need for identification and treatment.</p></speech>

The presentations were at times very emotional and excellent and among some of the most compelling made to this committee.</p><p>  I have made a lot of notes because the presentations were so good, but I want to pick up on some points made.  On the lack of awareness of general practitioners of the rare diseases, the representatives said that parents often become the experts, which is correct, but I find at times the GPs are sending the parents to constituency offices to try to access services and get proper assessments on diagnosis.  That comes back to the question, namely, why we are still awaiting a properly resourced national office?  That is a no-brainer.</p><p>  I refer to the point on the transition from child to adult.  I may have picked it up a different way but with regard to children under 16 and the domiciliary care allowance and the carer's allowance, when some children turn 16 they get a letter to the effect that the carer's allowance or the domiciliary allowance is being stopped.  There is sometimes a lack of understanding of the rare diseases.  Parents then raise the issue with us but it might take them another two years to get those allowances in train.  We see that happen frequently, and I am sure the representatives come across it frequently as well.</p><p>  The presentation from the Special Needs Parents Association was very good.  The fact is it is a voluntary organisation and its members have to refer parents to the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, GRDO.  It appears from the presentations that there is just one employee who works 15 hours a week.</p></speech>

With 6% to 8% of the population suffering from rare diseases, surely we should have several whole-time equivalents.  Those are the points that struck me.  Many of the other issues have been covered.  I have taken so many notes, it would take time to refer to all the pages, but I thank the representatives because I have learned a great deal today.</p></speech>

The collaborative approach is very important.  It is clear we will not have enough specialised centres or staff to deal with all rare diseases in Ireland, so crucial co-operation with our partners in the North is vital.  The conference on Friday, which the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, is attending is crucial in that development.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan, the most important thing is the issue around support for patient groups that are emerging.  We had a meeting yesterday at which people were very upset that they are not getting any supports and did not know where to turn.  It is unsustainable to have someone working so few hours.  Wonderful though Ms Anne Lawlor is, resources for GRDO are essential.</p><p>  I am glad the issue of the national office has been raised.  That is probably the most important point we wanted to make today and to acknowledge Senator Colm Burke for his Adjournment debate and keeping the issue alive.  We will need resources for that office.  I think the resources will be relatively modest.  I would not envisage more than &euro;500,000 for an office of that size which will have the potential for savings but most of all decreased angst for parents who will not have to traipse from one Department to another, from one GP to specialists and others to try to get a clear diagnosis for their child.  I am sure the national office, when up and running, will make huge savings for the health service down the line.</p><p>  I acknowledge Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point in terms of the personal support.  I am delighted to hear Mr. Declan McPhillips say he has been very supportive of the work of the group and has given the visibility through his own party.  That is so important.  That little bit of personal support and advice is what keeps people going.  I thank him on a personal basis for that.</p></speech>

In Mr. Declan McPhillips' presentation, the following did not so much come across but jump out at me.  We talked about the withdrawal of the telephone allowance for older people.  I notice a reference in the last line that I do not think Mr. McPhillips delivered in his oral contribution.  He mention telephone support.  If there a factor there?</p></speech>

Part of the condition and part of the symptoms is cold hands and cold feet all the time for these children.  In my house the heating never goes off but the ESB allowance and the telephone allowance have been cut.  Sometimes we have to make telephone calls to America about the condition rather than sending e-mails.  The cut to the telephone allowance and the ESB allowance does not just affect the elderly, it also affects people with special needs.</p></speech>

We are talking specifically about trained nurses in the cases of children who have very complex medical needs.  There are two issues.  One is that the HSE would provide an actual financial budget for paediatric home care for a specific child's package.  The other issue, which is slightly more difficult, is providing the staff to provide that home care.  I am a former nurse.  Among the nursing profession there is not an awareness that one does not have to be a paediatric nurse to provide tracheostomy care for a child at home.  Training is available and those training will be organised through the various agencies with which the HSE is dealing in terms of providing a package of home care.  For nurses who are generally trained there is that option to get involved in their local area with children awaiting staffing of the packages of home care.  They just have to contact the relevant agencies to which the HSE is outsourcing the care and the training will be provided for these children's complex needs, albeit the nurses' primary education would have been in general nursing.  It is important our nursing community is aware of that.  One of the big problems is that while funding may be available after a long time fighting for funding for paediatric home care, the difficulty is staffing those packages.  We are talking about some children who require 24 hour medical and nursing care in the home.</p> <p>The Jack and Jill Children's Foundation would have presented to the committee the figures for primary versus tertiary care and the significant savings for the State and the HSE's budget would have been apparent.</p><p> I met Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in at the Rett syndrome conference a number of years ago when he spent several hours talking to parents.  It is good to see that public representatives get first hand knowledge of what it is like for families to deal with these syndromes.  I wholly empathise with Mr. Declan McPhillips who has a child with disabilities, whom I brought to assist me at the information stand at Rett syndrome conference.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. McPhillips for his speech today.  He opened up on the difficulties that we experience.  Our primary problem is fighting for supports for our children.  It is not fighting the disability or the rare disorder, or the condition itself.  We can cope with that.  What we cannot cope with is the continuous fighting for supports.  It is within the gift of the committee to help us.</p><p>  I will touch on the psychological impact of waiting for a diagnosis.  I have described the pitfalls in the gap between a parent getting a diagnosis and having a discussion on the diagnosis and the long-term prognosis.  </p><p>  In the past 48 hours we polled the members of the organisation whose children have very rare disorders with a view to finding out what disorders the families are dealing with.  The list is too long to mention.  By engaging in that process over the past 48 hours, parents have started to connect on a simple online forum.  We have parents who have a child, who is the only person in Ireland or in some cases the world with a particular diagnosis.  It is very difficult to provide a service.  We can be empathetic and understanding, but it is difficult and the only place in which these parents can get clear and accurate information would be a centralised office where the information can be screened safely and given to them with support.</p><p>  I also thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for acknowledging the fact that we are a voluntary organisation, which I head up by working full time on a voluntary basis.  I am fortunate to be in a position to do so.</p><p>  Senator Burke raised the issue of the difficulties with the treatment abroad scheme.  There is one diagnosis in particular where those who have this diagnosis seem to have constant battles with the treatment abroad scheme.  There are no specialist to treat Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in Ireland.  We deal with a bureaucracy and there is no specialist to refer them to specialist centres abroad.  That seems to be an ironic sticking point in the treatment abroad scheme and its administration.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan raised issues that arise in the period of transition from children to adults, such as what happens in respect of domiciliary care allowance, carer's allowance and disability allowance.  The domiciliary care allowance was reviewed last year and at present the recommendations that were sanctioned by the Minister are being implemented.  I am involved in the implementation group in the Department.  The transition period from domiciliary care allowance to disability allowance is being addressed in the implementation of a more refined scheme.  It is hoped that parents will get longer advanced notification of the application process for the disability allowance which comes into effect when the young person reaches the age of 16 years and this should give them time to get the relevant reports.  Parents need to understand that domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance and disability allowance are very different entitlement with different criteria under the social welfare legislation.  Disability allowance is not an allowance for people who require care, it is an allowance for people who cannot work as a result of his or her disability, whatever it may be.  There is a distinction between domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance, and parents who would have received a domiciliary care allowance for their child under 16 years may find that on reaching 16 years, their young person does not qualify for a disability allowance.  Parents must be educated about these distinctions.</p><p>  Obviously we have been discussing how medical assessor in the Department of Health deal with those with rare disorders.  We have raised points about the awareness of general practitioners.  The 40 or so medical assessors are not specialists in any particular field.  They need to be able to find information on the impacts of the various different rare disorders.  There are 6,000 plus people with rare disorders and the assessors have the same problems as other medical professionals in order to be able to assess the impact of the rare disorder on a child.  The domiciliary care allowance is not based on a particular diagnosis but is based on the impact of the diagnosis.  They too would benefit from a national centre for rare diseases information office.  I would wholly endorse more resources going to the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation, GRDO, which is a voluntary organisation, as we would benefit from having somebody else to refer to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eileen Treacy" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022700013#N00400"><p>I think a number of issues have been addressed but I would like to speak on three issues.</p><p>  First, information for GPs is critical as this is the point of care for all patients.  Members may know of a survey in 2008 which found that 73% of GPs do not know where to get that information.  This is crucial.  We are one of the very few member states in Europe that do not have a central information office linked to Orphanet.  This is not a difficult target to meet.  This central information source can provide the necessary information by a phone call or e-mail to a GP and to all providers as well as patients and families.  It is a false economy to say we do not have money for this service.  The service would be highly cost effective and I am amazed that money is not put forward in this programme for prevention.  However, no economic evaluations has been done.  </p><p>  We hear about the patient journey, a patient that can have ten consultations.  Out of 330,000 patients, all it would cost to provide this service is the cost of 100 consultations per year if it is financed and funded through a service delivery such as a hospital.  This is something that we think would be highly cost effective. </p><p>  Education is totally feasible.  I am pleased to see Dr. Paula Byrne is in the Gallery.  Dr. Paula Byrne is leading out on a UCD module for teaching GPs.  A number of people lecture in this module which is supported by iPosi.  We would hope that all students and trainees would get teaching and education on rare diseases.  I know from the medical students that they do not know about rare diseases.  Learning about rare diseases has not been prioritised and it has not been funded.   On the issue of training for the future, I am pleased to say that the royal college and the HSE medical education and training office under Professor McGovern has set up a review and a module to look at further needs.  There is a call for more funding for genetic specialists and providers in this area.  We can make recommendations.  What we need is implementation and financing from the Government.  The recommendation will not be implemented unless there is funding.</p><p>  There must be appropriate and quality information provided through the office and governed so that patients are not put on the wrong journeys and put on inappropriate clinical trials.  In addition, I fully support the fact that the patient organisations and helpline have to be funded and supported.  This is one of the calls for the key indicators for the programme, across member states.  That could be linked to the central information office and we would fully support that function.</p><p>  Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked quite a lot of questions.  The last issue that must be addressed is our role in the European reference network.  This comes back to the question of research as well about clinical cross-border care.  I was asked what we can do in terms of research in Ireland.  We have certain champions in Ireland and we have wonderful opportunities with the new projects, the RDEC, to develop pharma and research.  We cannot work on every rare disease.  We know from the EURORDIS survey that the three main indicators of success in research are patient empowerment, working with patients, second, having registries and the third major issue is collaborating in a reference network.  We collaborate with a group of investigators in different countries and this would be facilitated by the reference networks.</p></speech>

One of the things that was not mentioned about Dr. Paul O'Byrne's module is that we are leading Europe on that front so we can make an impact from an Irish perspective.</p><p>  Let me return to the discussion on whether we are capable of research.  In my generation one always had a go at things but when the younger generation tackle these conditions they adopt the view that they can solve the issue and are disappointed if they do not succeed.  We have a cohort of individuals that are well able to tackle rare diseases.  However, no one country can tackle all 7,000 rare diseases so we collaborate with our colleagues abroad when and where we can.  In an Irish context such an environment allows clinicians, scientists, bioinformaticians, etc., to interact and give feedback and is a more natural situation for a small country like Ireland.  That environment works very well and there are benefits to be gained from a lot of people knowing each other and from having worked together.  </p><p>  With regard to the cost of &euro;1.5 million, in one sense the figure seems alarming and probably is alarming but not if we are talking about sharing testing with Europe.  No one country can have all of the expertise in genetic testing.  There are reasons that some genetic tests are sent abroad but some of them can be repatriated to Ireland which would boost the national service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-27a.1407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Lawlor" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014022700014#O00300"><p>I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to listen to the debate.  However, I cannot be all things to all men and my position with GRDO has only existed since December.  I work full time on a voluntary basis and my other hat is that of chairperson of the 22Q1 Ireland Support Group.  Individually these conditions are rare but collectively they are common, there is a huge overlap with disability and the issues are the same such as medical, educational, social, psychological and psychiatric.</p><p>  Someone asked a question about the psychiatric angle so I shall tie it to the question about the ability to carry out research.  The 22Q1 Ireland group is totally voluntary and has embarked on its seventh research project in this country.  The latest project is with the genetics centre in Trinity and concerns the link between schizophrenia and 22Q.  We undertook the project because one in four children born with 22Q will develop schizophrenia and will also have a range of mental health problems.  Research is doable because an international 22Q brain consortium exists and I know all of its researchers.  Even though all of this work is done on a voluntary basis one should never underestimate the power of patient groups and what drives them.  We love our children.  As we heard from Mr. Declan McPhillips, we will do anything to help them and the issues are the same.  </p><p>  Most of the points have been covered but I wish to say one thing about GPs.  The problem often lies with the fact that no-one connects the disparate symptoms so awareness among GPs must be raised.  When one goes to a GP with disparate symptoms there may be an underlying cause.  My daughter had dozens of disparate symptoms but she was not diagnosed until she was 15 years old.  Accurate information is not available and that is why I helped set up the group.  I hope that I have covered all of the points.</p></speech>

We must reflect on the issues that arose from the presentations and mobilise a proactive response from the Department and the HSE.  All of that work will take place over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>  I thank all of the delegations for attending and also the people in the public Gallery.  I wish to advise members that we will have a photograph taken on the plinth at the conclusion of the meeting and extend an invitation to the people in the public Gallery to join us.</p><p>  I apologise to members that the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday evening was cancelled during this meeting.  That is why we did not have it at the beginning of our meeting but I am sure the leath l&aacute; is welcome.</p></speech>
