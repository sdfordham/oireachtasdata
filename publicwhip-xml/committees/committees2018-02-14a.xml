A number of MEPs were not able to make it here today and we have been asked to note their apologies, including Brian Crowley, Brian Hayes, Se&aacute;n Kelly and Nessa Childers.  I met with Brian Hayes in person a few days ago and he explained to me what he is doing today.  He made it clear that he wanted to be here, but he cannot, nor can the others.  Due to Murphy's law, at approximately 3.10 p.m., I will have to vacate the Chair to go to the D&aacute;il as we have been selected for a Topical Issue debate.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and people in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  I welcome Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, Ms Deirdre Clune, MEP, Ms Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP and Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP and I thank them for taking the time to engage with the committee today.  We hope to complete this session in one hour so with the agreement of the witnesses, owing to Ms McGuinness's role as first vice president, of which we are immensely proud, I propose to allow her to make a five minute opening statement first, following which each of the other MEPs will have an opportunity to make a five minute opening statement.  We will then have a questions and answers session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>Today we are discussing the Brexit negotiations, the future of Europe, the future composition of the European Parliament following Brexit and any other issues which the MEPs and members would like to discuss.  Before we commence, I must advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <br/><br/>I now invite Ms McGuinness to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

One of my roles as first vice-president is to liaise and dialogue with national Parliaments.  I believe we need to dialogue more and to do so better.  The chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of national Parliaments meet every six months in the country that holds the Presidency.  I attend those meetings.  I understand the Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, has not yet attended.  These are meetings where engagement takes place with colleagues from other national Parliaments.</p></speech>

I sometimes think there is a little bit of tension, unnecessarily so, between national parliamentarians and Members of the European Parliament.  We are all elected by citizens and we do the same work and I think we could do it better together.  I would be interested in hearing the committee's observations in that regard.</p> <p>  On the topics for discussion, the taskforce on subsidiarity is in place.  National parliamentarians will have a role in that taskforce and the European Parliament will provide the facilities.  I hope to be involved in the work of the working group.  Specifically on the future of Europe, I am happy to see that Ireland is doing a lot on the future of Europe by way of national consultations led by the Minister with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy McEntee.  Last night, a meeting was held in County Meath, led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, with a further meeting to be held tonight in Carrick-on-Shannon.  We are doing a lot of work in Ireland on very serious issues around the future of Europe which are linked to the budgetary issues.  This came across very strongly at last night's meeting.  It is important to put on the record that every person who spoke at the meeting last night said that in light of the trend in farm incomes we need not only to hold onto the budget we have but to push for an increase in the budget for the Common Agricultural Policy.  While that might be a difficult proposal to discuss it is important to put on the record the view of the people on the ground.  </p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, we are trying to garner the UK position from various speeches that have been read into the record, including today.  While the UK has said it does not want to see the European Union weakened, with every speech, I get the opposite impression.  There is a sense from the UK side that it is going alone on the high seas, breaking off to do global trade agreements without the European Union and suggesting that it can be bigger and better without being part of the European Union.  For all its flaws, Europe has been very good at keeping people at the table.  Large and small countries have managed to work together and to do so effectively.  We are now seeing the consequences of one country deciding that it might be better off doing its own thing.  This week, a report was published, which shows the serious consequences of Brexit for Ireland.  It will be important for us in the Parliament, in terms of our making sure it fully understands the impact for Ireland. </p> <p>  Parliamentarians are working well together not only on the Irish issues but on the consequences for the European Union around its future but issues are being forgotten about, including public health and consumer protection issues.  Europe currently has in place a huge amount of rules and regulations which protect public health not only in Ireland but across the European Union.  </p> <p>  On the composition of the European Parliament, Ireland is set to gain two seats, although this has yet to be confirmed by the Council.  If that happens, all of us would like to know where and how the boundaries might be drawn to accommodate the two extra seats.  The sooner we know that the better because the elections will take place in May 2019.  The issue of transnational lists was voted down by the Parliament.  My own view is that it is an idea not to be scrapped.  It is one that could be developed in future when other matters at a European level have settled down.  </p> <p>  While our focus is on Brexit, with so much happening we also have to keep an eye to the debate about the future.  I hope that the voice from Ireland that we believe that Europe has a future but that we will have to engage differently.  In my speech to the European Parliament last week I made the point that I will miss the engagement with MEPs from the United Kingdom.  Those who worked well in the Parliament will be missed.  Their voices will be missed at the Council table and we will have to reflect that in how we do our business.   </p> <p>  While the engagement between national Parliaments and the European Parliament is working it could be better.  I am interested to hear the committee's thoughts on that engagement.  I acknowledge that everybody is busy and that the Chairman has to leave soon to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We are never in Ireland when this committee is meeting.  If we believe that Europe needs to be strengthened and reformed then I think we need to work well.  I appreciate this opportunity.</p></speech>

Brexit is consuming Parliament.  In terms of the March session, we are currently working on a resolution on what the future arrangement could or should be with the UK but we are operating in a vacuum because as everybody knows the UK does not know what it wants.  I know that the committee has held numerous hearings on the likely impacts of Brexit.  At the same time, the future of Europe is very much part of the debate in the Parliament.  Only last week the Prime Minister of Croatia was in Parliament outlining Croatia's position and the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was also there outlining issues relating to Ireland' s position.  The budget is dominating procedures today.  An announcement was made earlier today by the Commission on how the future budget of the European Union could be structured.  When the UK leaves Europe, there will be a gap in funding of approximately &euro;12 billion.  How this gap is to be filled needs to be addressed.</p><p>Is it going to be filled or is it going to be addressed by increased contributions from member states or is it going to be a combination of budgetary cuts and contributions from member states, or is it going to be completely left as a gap and the programmes cut?  This is going to be a matter for member states.  We certainly do not want to see a cut in programmes, especially those such as the CAP, but there is a lot of pressure to increase funding for security.  We are all very much aware of the security issue and the challenge is there with the fight against terrorism and ensuring that borders are protected, that information is shared among member states and that citizens are protected.  This is a challenge, along with the challenge of migration.  While we do not hear as much about the migration challenge in Ireland, dealing with migration is a real challenge for our southern European neighbours as is the contribution to Turkey and dealing with migrants there.  These are pressures on the budget.  The CAP is very important to Ireland but nonetheless the contribution has decreased to just under 40% or 38% from a level of more than 70% many years ago.  These are the challenges facing us.  I am aware that the budget will be on the agenda of the EU Council on 23 February, so I am sure we will hear about whether it will increase.  Ireland is now a net contributor but we gain substantially in our contribution under the CAP.</p><p> I will now give the committee a sense of my own work with the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism, TRAN.  We are very conscious, obviously, of the impact of Brexit on transport issues.  Next week there will be a hearing on what Brexit will mean for maritime issues and if we should be developing our short sea shipping routes.  We have already had a hearing on road transport and the implications for European consumers and for Ireland; how are we going to get across the UK and what that means if the EU has invested in road projects across the UK, how does the investment continue and how do we benefit Ireland.  Ireland does a lot of trade with the UK but we also do a substantial amount with the EU mainland.  The fastest way to the Continent is across the UK and through its very busy Dover-Calais route, which is the shortest and most efficient route.  Where do we stand on that? There is particular concern around aviation because the UK is so close to Ireland geographically.  If there is a cliff edge scenario and if the UK leaves the European Union without an aviation agreement in place we are in trouble because there is no alternative arrangement to fall back to without an European aviation agreement.  There is nothing in the World Trade Organization, WTO, guidelines that would facilitate that.  We really would need some form of arrangement in place to facilitate aviation because European airspace is supervised by the European Air Safety Agency and every EU country abides by its rules, regulations and supervision.  If the UK is no longer part of the European Union, then there will be a problem for those who cross UK airspace.  These are the kinds of issues that the TRAN committee focuses on.  We are moving forward now we are into the second phase of negotiations in terms of what will the future arrangements be and focusing on the real difficult issues relating to transport.  This gives the members a sense of the work we do.</p><p> The European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, EMPL, is also looking at the issues.  I am aware other contributors want to speak but I am happy to discuss this and to elaborate on my work in that area for the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liadh N&iacute; Riada" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#C00200"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I am sorry that I will not be able to stay for the whole meeting.  It is very important that we have a cohesive approach when we are dealing with Brexit from the national Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and from an EU perspective.  I sit on the European Parliament Committee on Budgets, BUDG, as a co-ordinator and the picture for the future is not looking good at all.  We are currently discussing the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  Commissioner Oettinger said this morning that they are looking at a 15% cut to the CAP.  This is not a big surprise but in real terms it is a cut of &euro;60 billion.  How will we shore up that gap when the cut is actually implemented?  They are also talking about cuts to cohesion policy or aid to more developed countries, of which Ireland was a beneficiary.  This cut will be about &euro;95 billion.  It seems to be cuts right across the board due to the debts we now see because of the British going out.  How are we going to shore this up?  I spoke with representatives from the European Investment Bank yesterday and they spoke of having a &euro;300 million reserve fund in place as a measure to protect us against Brexit.  I do not believe it is enough.  It is a start and it may be a step in the right direction but we need to be more creative in how we are going to use more strategically the funds that are there to help those who are most vulnerable; those in the agriculture and fisheries sector.  Fisheries seems to be very much an industry that is not being talked about.  Ireland will be providing most of the waters when the British waters are out of the equation.  Those displaced boats will be coming in to fish from Irish waters and Ireland will still be dealing with the same quota.  There are huge challenges for the fishing industry, which is already on its knees, and I do not believe it is going to improve after Brexit - not by a long shot.  We have to put absolute safeguards in place to protect and sustain our fishing industry.  The MFF is a huge worry.  Given that we will have less money, the bottom line is that we will do more, or the same, with less money or that member states will be asked to contribute more.  It is as simple as that.  These are the two options.  We must be very robust in how we deal with the MFF, particularly at Council level and with regard to Ireland's representation there so we do not suffer hugely when we see the CAP.  I am aware that Ms Anderson and Mr. Carthy will probably speak more about trade and other issues but I just wanted to give the committee a heads up from the budget perspective.  F&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; mar sin &eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#C00300"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to address the committee today.  I sit on three EU Parliament committees; the constitutional affairs committee, the civil liberties committee and the regional development committee.  Each committee deals primarily with the Brexit files, as do other committees.  All of us have read, line by line the joint report of 8 December.  The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council have stated that the commitments given had to be faithfully and fully implemented and brought into legal texts.  This legal text is currently being worked on.  Sinn F&eacute;in had advocated caution on the 8 December because we did not accept the assessment given to us that these were cast iron guarantees.  What has played out this week is proof positive that they were not cast iron guarantees.  We advocated caution because nobody knows better than us the British in the context of negotiations.  We know how duplicitous they can be and we know they will roll back from negotiation.  Once one decides and declares a bottom line, the next stage for the British is to negotiate downwards.  Some of the reports we have heard from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today clearly shows that this is exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  Without a doubt it is fundamentally better that we do not have any barriers North-South or east-west.  There is nothing wrong with trying to explore all that but because Theresa May is always questioned on this, she has repeatedly and categorically said that the entire territory is leaving the Single Market and the customs union.  If this is the case then we have to ensure the draft treaty, which is currently being worked on, incudes binding terms, called the back-stop option No. 3.  For example, if there is no agreement, then we would have a situation of full alignment in the North.  Some people make reference to the full alignment only in the context of North South co-operation but as the committee will be aware, having read the text, it includes North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, which is crucially important.</p> <p>  Today and yesterday we have heard reports that contingency planning is taking place in the State for a hard border.  A report came out yesterday or today around the Dublin docklands and its terminal in the context of planning for border controls.  Ms McGuinness referred to the Copenhagen report and the damage that it has outlined for the State and how growth will be affected, going down by 7%.  We are also aware that the UK's Department for Exiting the European Union has produced a report.</p><p>Mr. Chris Hazzard is a Member of Parliament.  Every MP has to go into a locked room without a phone, a pen or a pencil to see the report.  He is in it today to examine the details of that report as the British Government does not want that report out there.  We have heard information that it will result in a 12% drop in gross domestic product, GDP, for the North and we know 10% of the North's GDP comes from European funding.  We can see that 54 weeks into the process, there is infighting in the British Cabinet.  Mr. Boris Johnson is trying today to give some measure of assurance for those of us who voted to remain but he is certainly not speaking to the people of Ireland, never mind the people of the North.  We know from Mr. Barnier's comments in Europe that there is a chaotic Brexit negotiation taking place.</p><p> The European Union and the British Government knows this and I am inclined to agree with Ms McGuinness's assessment of the British Government's efforts around Brexit.  It has not left any country without leaving it in a mess.  This will come to the cliff-edge scenario and it will go over a cliff.  Britain will try to create as much damage as it can, particularly for the people of Ireland, including those North, South, east and west.  Mr. Barnier, Commissioner Hogan and others have said that if we are out of the customs union and Single Market in the North, there will be barriers, friction and borders.  That is something that the contingency planning taking place needs to apply for the island in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  The only way to secure that is a process, whether it is what is known as designated special status for the North to remain in the EU, or as An Taoiseach called it when he was in Strasbourg, special arrangements for the North to remain in the EU.  Whatever one calls it is irrelevant so long as the ingredients are the same.  That means there must be a role for the European Court of Justice.  There has been much talk of trade, barriers and all that is important.</p><p> I was thinking today and I remind everyone that I was born into a gerrymandered state 50 years ago.  Only this week we have had a report from the British Government that it intends to reintroduce gerrymandering in the North.  We can see that in the context of the Westminster elections and the report that has come from that.  Esteemed academics like Professor McCrudden, Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Mr. Colm Harvey have said that rights are only genuine if they are reinforced.  In this State there was the opportunity to hear from a senior judge in the European Court of Justice only last week, Mr. Anthony Collins.  He spoke of the first right that will be lost for the people of the North, the right to representative democracy and the right to be represented in the European Parliament.  The voice of the people of the North will be lost.  He said it is not just unsatisfactory but it is illegal.  Paragraph 53 of the joint report agreed in December indicates there were cast-iron guarantees, and it states the rights, entitlements, identity and the opportunity of the people of the North would not be lost as a consequence of the Article 50 agreement.  We must be able to exercise those rights.</p><p> Whatever about the seats being allocated - I welcome two have been allocated to this State - this is about the entitlement of the people of Ireland.  Three additional seats should be allocated to the people in the North of Ireland.  The only way to secure that is the Irish Government in Council ensuring there is a greater allocation of the seats.  The 14 seats mean a seat is lost to Ireland as an island.  As we all know, the Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, so what it has said to the people about cast-iron guarantees must be implemented in this phase and before negotiations are allowed into the second phase.  As the European Parliament and Council indicates, these must be fully and faithfully implemented.  We hope this committee will ensure the commitments given in the joint report of December 8 will be followed through so the island, North and South, east and west, can be protected from the chaos and madness that Brexit will bring to this entire Ireland, whether one is from Derry or Kerry.  We will all be damaged by it unless we come together and ensure the island can be protected.</p></speech>

It is an important facet of our work, identified earlier as something we needed to improve.  The committee has taken that on board and improved the communication.  I thank the clerk and Ms C&aacute;it Hayes, the Oireachtas representative in Brussels, who keeps us informed on key debates.  I also thank the staff of the European Parliament office in Brussels, who also ensure we are aware of the legislative developments happening in Ireland when we deal with some very similar files at a European level.  Ms Anderson and others have spoken about the Brexit position and I will not elaborate greatly on that, except to be positive where I can.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Carthy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#D00400"><p>The last time I attended this committee I was very critical of the Government's position on Brexit.  I was critical of what I considered to be a weakness of language and a commitment to protect the entire Ireland.  That changed considerably in the meantime and the Government's position improved.  It is important to note that and give credit.  We must also tell the Government and representatives in this House that this process must continue and we must remain vigilant.  The work did not stop on 8 December, when the communiqu&eacute; was agreed, and in many ways the work only started then.  What we got then was not the solution to the problems Ireland is facing as a result of Brexit but we potentially got the capacity to achieve the solution.  It will only happen, as Ms Anderson notes, if we are determined to ensure no part of our country is sacrificed.</p> <p>  We must recognise that every part of our country is threatened with economic, political and social upheaval, if the current British Government's position on Brexit and the North of Ireland.  Everybody looking at this objectively at a European level that I am aware of and internationally, including in Britain, has not found a solution to the issues pertaining to our Ireland with respect to Brexit that does not include the North of Ireland remaining as part of the customs union and Single Market.  Mr. Barnier put that very clearly in his most recent remarks.  It needs to be the stated position, in my view, of this committee, all Irish MEPs and particularly the Irish Government.</p> <p>  I will touch on the future of the EU discussions that are ongoing.  The Minister has organised consultation meetings but the entire project of discussion at an EU level may be a wasted opportunity.  Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker effectively usurped discussions before they were even started in his so-called state of the EU address.  He outlined his own position quite emphatically.  It can be described as a cursory nod towards Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and other major political upheavals, with the position of the EU doing what it always intended to only, only more quickly than originally envisaged and with less democratic oversight.  That can be clearly seen with the move towards Permanent Structure Co-operation, PESCO, and a so-called European defence.  The vote in these Houses was rushed through with zero public debate and members might ask their constituents if they are even aware of PESCO.  It is a major move with respect to Irish neutrality and it is a step away from what the EU should be doing at this time and in current political circumstances.</p><p> In my view, it should be moving towards more democracy, more accountability and more devolution to the national parliaments and not the opposite.  I believe the move towards a militaristic agenda is the exact opposite of what the EU should be doing.  It is the opposite of what the vast majority of EU citizens want to see happening.</p><p> The transnational lists proposal was part of that and shows a completely oblivious attitude to what citizens are looking for.  They are not looking for representatives to represent 27 member states all at once.  I and others present represent a constituency of 15 Irish counties.  It is very hard to remain connected and engaged with the communities I am supposed to represent despite the huge amount of effort we put in to ensure we do.  It is impossible to fathom a scenario where somebody could legitimately argue to represent people in eastern Germany or Latvia while at the same time representing the voters in Connemara, Inishowen or Carrickmacross.</p><p> Regarding PESCO and the EU budget, if we want to prevent the potential CAP cuts that the Commissioner has indicated may be coming down the line, an easy place to start would be to remove what is being proposed for the EU defence fund and ring-fence it for CAP and rural development.</p><p> Some of the important work taking place at European Parliament level, in which many members here have an interest, is the issue of corporate tax avoidance, tax evasion and money laundering.  The European Parliament is in the process of setting up another committee following on from the committee that was established on the Panama papers, called the paradise papers committee.  As Irish representatives, we need to engage on this at a number of levels.  Irrespective of whether members like it, we need to acknowledge that at an EU level and internationally Ireland has gained a reputation as a facilitator of corporate tax avoidance.</p><p> We need to address two areas.  One is the issue of tax sovereignty.  Our party and all MEPs are on record as saying we will defend to the hilt the right of national parliaments to put in place their own tax rates and policies.  The other is the issue of tax transparency and public country-by-country reporting.  The two things are not the same.  Sometimes Irish commentators argue that they are.  It is possible to have maximum tax transparency while at the same time defending tax sovereignty.</p><p> I realise that I have gone on for longer than the Chairman might have wanted.  I know there have been many debates at this committee, at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the House about the Mercosur trade agreement.  Members need to be aware that Irish farmers - and I would argue the Irish domestic economy - are on the verge of being sold out by the European Commission which has already reportedly increased the offer on beef, for example, to 99,000 tonnes.  The Mercosur countries are looking for 200,000 tonnes.  We could, should and must now demand that the Mercosur negotiations be brought to a close.  I say this as a citizen more than anything else: we have already been treated abysmally in the way the Government has dealt with the CETA trade agreement and other trade agreements.  However, the Mercosur deal is the most immediate threat.  We should be united in calling for those negotiations to be stopped immediately on the basis that the Commission has advised us that there will be no Mercosur trade agreement without a significant offer of beef being on the table.  With the damage that will cause to Irish agriculture along with the uncertainty as a result of Brexit, that alone is a basis for us to demand that the negotiations are brought to an end.</p><p> The Irish people have repeatedly let it be known that they want to be part of the European Union.  Most recently we saw that in the vote in the North where they voted to remain.  I also believe the Irish people have given plenty of messages that they want the EU to change.  The two things are not contradictory.  I hope we can work together to ensure that all of Ireland remains part of the European Union, but that we work together to ensure it is a better and more democratic European Union.</p></speech>

I managed to follow the earlier speakers thanks to technology.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms McGuinness, MEP, that engagement between MEPs and Oireachtas Members is essential.  I have asked for this for some time.  Perhaps it could be facilitated during green week because we get enough time off.  I am delighted to see that is the case and I would like to see it happen more regularly.  There is always something happening in what we do and it directly impacts on the citizens of the country, people whom the members of the committee also represent.</p> <p>  I work on the agriculture and rural affairs committee, which is very relevant to the constituency I represent covering the midlands and the north west.  I am also on the budget control committee and am a substitute on the environment committee.  The budget control committee is a bit of bean-counter committee but it is probably the most interesting committee when one gets into it because we go through every last cent of the people's money that is spent and Ireland is a net contributor.  Given the enormity of the CAP budget and the agriculture and rural affairs budget, it is all the more important.  We are now entering into the beginning of a debate as to how this money will be divided up.</p> <p>  I am a townie and have never lived on a farm in my life but bit by bit, the penny has dropped as to why the place where I live exists; it exists because we have farmers living outside the town.  They are farmers who down the years paid people like my father to put in fitted cupboards.  They paid painters in the town to come out and paint their houses.  Those farmers and their wives went in and got haircuts.  The money was spread around.  I know how important this is.  At the moment we are talking about a development plan for Ireland and a development plan for rural Ireland; this is integral to it.</p> <p>  We are also talking about how Border areas will struggle because of Brexit.  This is also integral to that debate because if we had listened the last time to the then Commissioner Ciolo and had the deal that was done on CAP not been warped and twisted by our Government at the time, people in Leitrim would have got &euro;11 million more per year from CAP and there would have been &euro;29 million more per year for Donegal.  There would have been less for the Queen and less for Larry Goodman, but we can get over that.  We are now deciding whether we will make that same mistake again or whether we will, in the case of Leitrim, put &euro;3,000 into the pockets of every man, woman and child over the course of the next CAP deal or whether we put it into the wrong people's hands.</p> <p>  People talk about pressure on the budget - there is particular pressure on the CAP budget.  One obvious reason is Brexit because the UK is a massive net contributor.  There is another reason for pressure on the CAP budget.  The penny has dropped among many MEPs that it is going to the wrong people.  Rather than arguing that it should go to the right people, many of these people are now saying we need to cut it.  MEPs who represent urban areas come in and say this was meant to go to small farmers and was meant to make rural areas vibrant but it is not doing that.  They are talking about cutting it on that basis.  If it is cut - we will fight to ensure it is not cut - we know who to look at.  We need to look at the people who have twisted and turned what was meant to be a payment for small farmers to keep people in family farms and instead left it in the hands of ranchers.  We will do our best to ensure it is not cut.</p> <p>  When I went out there I thought I might have had a radical point of view that this money should be redistributed to small farmers.  The good news is that even the people in Fine Gael's group, the EPP, agree hook, line and sinker that the money needs to go to the small farmer.  Mr. Zeller, who is in the same group as Fine Gael, is on the budgetary control committee.  He constantly harps on about how this must change.  I am fairly definite that we will get a good deal for small farmers.  At one of the last meetings I attended, Marian Harkin made the point that we did not really succeed in the previous CAP negotiations.  I am afraid she did not give herself and the MEPs who got the good deal the credit they deserved.  The problem was that when it was brought home it was twisted and turned so that it ended up in the wrong hands.  We need to ensure that does not happen again if we want rural Ireland to survive.</p><p> Another point of great importance - Mr. Carthy and others have mentioned it - is the Mercosur deal.  We are apparently going to trade off our suckler farmers and beef industry so that our car industry can thrive.  I am sorry, but where is our car industry?  We do not have one.  We are trading off something we have for something that we will never have and something we are not going to get.  If the deal goes through, we will expect our farmers to compete.  Our farmers have to explain the origin of their produce and where exactly it has been from the moment the sperm is delivered until a consumer eats the meat on his plate.  Now, potentially, we will have to compete with people who farm on the basis that it is sufficient to know where the produce has been for the past three months.  Obviously, traceability comes with costs.  Costs reduce profitability and make it less feasible for people to farm where we come from.  We have to stop this deal.  As Mr. Carthy has said, they need beef on the table for this deal to go through.  We need to say "No more" to this deal.</p><p> I wish to comment positively on the White Paper on the future of Europe.  We are now, finally, debating it, but one would have to be concerned.  When one sets up a timetable for something, one should stick to it.  When the GAA sets up a timetable for the All-Ireland competition, it takes place when it is meant to take place.  It does not take place six months later.  GAA officials do not come along and say that they did not have to bother telling those involved that it was not going to take place for six months.  We were told in March last year by Jean-Claude Juncker that there would be a series of future of Europe debates throughout Europe between March and December and that the matter would brought to the Council and to us for discussion.  He claimed there were thousands of debates but there were not.  I looked and searched for them.  I was obsessed looking for them because I know my future and the future of my children are at stake.</p><p> Now, finally, we are having the debates and that is good.  As was said already however, we were meant to be debating five options.  However, before we got to debate them or before most people even knew there was a debate ongoing, the man who is meant to be leading us, Jean-Claude Juncker, had made up his mind already about a sixth option.</p><p> Obviously, there are some brilliant things done within Europe.  I may be a sceptic in many areas but when it comes to agriculture I am not.  Other important areas include full fiscal union, which potentially we could face and an end to our choice or ability to choose our corporation tax rate - that could be gone.  We need a proper debate on that and we need to look at it.</p><p> We certainly need to look at defence.  At the moment we are being railroaded down the road of something that is described by Federica Mogherini not as a European army but something even more ambitious.  We now have socialists standing up in the European Parliament saying this should become our most important project.  Food security is our most important project and it has to stay that way but we are pushing in the opposite direction.  The Commissioner, Ms Federica Mogherini, continuously cites opinion polls in Europe suggesting support for going further into a European army-type system.  If one looks for the information on the matter - at the same meetings where she talks about being open and transparent - one cannot find out what the results were for Ireland even though Ms Mogherini and the Commission have claimed we are all supportive of it.  Maybe we are or maybe we are not.  Certainly, I am not and I would like to know what the answer to that question is but we cannot find it.  Earlier, I said that I am sceptical in certain areas.  If we ask a question of the European Commission on agriculture, we get an answer.  If we ask a question of Federica Mogherini, we do not get an answer.</p><p> We now have a high-level committee on fake news in the European Union.  MEPs have a right to find out how the process is organised and how the appointments to these committees take place.  I have a serious problem with the person appointed from Ireland.  Committee members can find out for themselves who the person appointed from Ireland is - the information is publically available.  I have attempted to find out how this process took place with the relevant Commissioner and Commission office.  I have looked for an opportunity to express concern over who was appointed.  We have not even got an answer.  That is what I am at in the European Union and there is far more of it.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

We will now go to our members.  I know our members will keep it as concise as possible &ndash; we are over-running our time a little.  I call Deputy Durkan.  During your contribution, Deputy Durkan, we will change over in the Chair, as I explained.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#F00300"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their dissertation.  It is an interesting exchange of views at an interesting time.  As we know, Europe is inhaling at the moment.  We have to wait for it to exhale and we do not know what the outcome will be.  We do not know whether Brexit will lead to the destruction of Europe.  It could, in that it could undermine the whole structure of Europe.  The UK could be the first of others to go.  I strongly advise all and sundry that such an outcome would not be in the interests of this country, Europe, Britain, ironically, or the globe.</p> <p>  We should all recognise that those present are totally committed to the Irish economic entity on the island of Ireland.  We have set that down from the beginning and there will be no watering down of that.  It is injudicious to suggest from time to time that we do not believe what people say.  If a person does not believe what another says to him, presumably, the person is expecting the comment to become a self-fulfilling prophesy and, as a result, there is no use having negotiations.</p> <p>  It is of the utmost importance that we maintain the stance we have had from the beginning, that is to say, the question as set down by the European negotiators and the Government at the beginning of the year and that we maintain it without variation.  Of course, people will decide from time to time that we have reason not to believe it.  If we sow that into the ether, then it becomes part of what the defence will use, the defence being the UK authorities.  They will say the people did not believe them and will ask what one would expect.  Then they will row away from it so they do not have to achieve any agreement.</p> <p>  The Single Market and customs union are of the utmost importance.  We are operating as an island nation and that is the way the European negotiators have stated it will be.  That is the way the British Government negotiators reluctantly admitted that it would be or how they hoped it would be but they then cast doubts upon the water, throwing bread upon the water, as it were, to try to undermine it.  Of course they are going to do that - that is their negotiating position.  Anyway, they must remember one thing: they decided to leave the European Union.  They did not seek approval from anyone else.  We, they and everyone else in the European Union are part of the Union.  We all agreed to it.  Several treaties were entered into incorporating what we have now as the European Union.  We have a commitment to it.</p></speech>

Nigel Farage is known for many things but being a supporter of the European Union is not one of them.  By his own admission, he spent 18 years working to undermine it.  Interestingly - and it is symbolic of what has happened thus far - at the end of the day, when he was asked what would happen and what would replace what he had undermined, he did not know.  None of the Brexiteers at the time or since has known either.  They have shown no indication that they knew anything or had any alternative in mind.  They had not and that is sad.  It is easy to knock down something in place.  It is easy to wreck and destroy.  It is not so easy to come up with the alternatives.  It is always easy to throw away something but to put it together again and restructure it is not so easy.</p> <p>  We need to reiterate emphatically again and again that we stand for what we have said.  We need to stand over the interdependence of North and South on the island.  The Single Market and the single entity must remain.  Acting to the contrary will do irreparable economic damage to Northern Ireland and the South and, ultimately, to the European Union and the UK as well.

Regardless of politics, we have to be strongly supportive of that stance.  If we move away from it, we are in serious trouble.</p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the situation of Irish fishing.  There will be a problem in that sector and with the Common Agricultural Policy as well.  They will be resolved.  The CAP problem has to be resolved.  There is a big population in Europe amounting to 500 million people and they have to eat.</p><p>If somebody decides to trade that off against a car, people cannot eat the car no matter how hungry they are.  That should not be done.</p><p> The security issue needs to be dealt with.  We have become more dependent on our neighbours for security as time has passed and we cannot have it both ways.  We need to enable our Defence Forces to be upgraded and trained in line with the best available in Europe, which would not be a breach of our neutrality.  Alternatively, will we rely on the British Government to come to our aid in the case of a terrorist attack?  I would not be happy about that.  We need to recognise that, unfortunately, for security reasons, we need to upgrade our Defence Forces in order that they can understand their colleagues in Europe in the event of a security breach.</p><p> The stance adopted by the Taoiseach and Mr. Barnier in respect of the Border still stands and we should not presume that there will be any backing off from that.  If we do back away from it, we will have made a serious negotiating error.</p><p> On the urban-rural divide, people tend to support their own bailiwicks.  As matters progress, there is a great need for all European politicians to represent the people of Europe and not one sector against another, one village against the next or one country against another.  They need to provide universal representation.  We are either a European Union or we are not.  If we want to go in different directions, we can do that but it will be at our own cost.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G00900"><p>I will be as brief as possible because we do not want to keep the European Ombudsman waiting.  We are anxious to hear what she has to say.  I thank the MEPs for attending.  We will not get to have an exchange of views because we have had a series of statements.  The committee needs to work on that for the future.</p> <p>  I will not address Brexit because it was dealt with by previous speakers.  The committee has considered the future of Europe.  We had a series of meetings and we are finalising a report.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, has conducted a public consultation process.  While something is happening, we all have to make a greater effort to engage with citizens regarding the future direction of Europe.  Many politicians have made statements.  President Macron and Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker have outlined their visions and the European Commission has put forward a series of options.  From the point of view of balance, the EU is either a union of sovereign nation states or a federal united states of Europe.  That covers a wide spectrum and we need to be tuned in to that debate.  Most Irish people see it as a union of sovereign nation states but there is a move towards more integration.  The Franco-German axis is reappearing, which is a threat to smaller nation states.  These are fundamental issues about which we need to be conscious.</p> <p>  I have a question but the MEPs will not have an opportunity to answer it.   The UK is leaving, regrettably.  It was an ally on many of the key issues that Ireland faces in the EU, including the CAP, tax sovereignty, corporation tax rates, immigration and mandatory quotas, security and defence, Cohesion Funds, and the principle of subsidiarity.  Cohesion Funds are important for central and eastern European member states and, therefore, we need to forge new alliances on theses issues now that the UK is going.  I will not get a response to that but I have no doubt that our MEPs will take up the challenge in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1420" speakername="Paul Coghlan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G01000"><p>I thank the MEPs for their interesting commentaries.  The previous speaker did not want discuss Brexit but it is dominating all our thoughts, regardless whether we like it.  I cannot fathom that Britain would countenance leaving the Union and a market of 500 million people without wanting what has become known as option A.  While its representatives say that Britain will leave the customs union and the Single Market, something similar will have to be negotiated, whatever it is called.  Phase 1 of the negotiations has concluded and we will not let them off the hook on that.  They signed up to all the rules, regulations, treaties and so on and legal obligations have to be met on leaving the Union as well as acceding to it.  They will, presumably, have to be observed and complied with.  What do the MEPs think is the bottom line?  As Ms Clune, said, Ireland does not want to give up the short sea route between Dover and Calais because it is essential to us.  Whatever happens, there will have to be regulatory alignment, no matter what it is called.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G01100"><p>I thank the MEPs for attending.  There is a huge opportunity cost for them to spend time here in light of their massive constituencies.  I am sure they have plenty of work to do.  It is good that everybody is wearing the same green jersey on Brexit as our Government, which has done a tremendous job so far.  The representation we have in Europe has been excellent across the board.</p> <p>  On the future of Europe, the conversation that has begun, with public meetings being held throughout the country, is good.  It is good to bring Europe to the people for good or bad.  Whatever comes out of the process, let us hear it.  Like Deputy Haughey, I would be interested in Ms McGuinness telling us about new allies as we move towards a new Europe.  Clearly, we are losing a major ally and, therefore, we will have to sectionalise our allies with different allies on finance, agriculture, etc.</p> <p>   Ms Clune mentioned transport, which is a serious concern.  A number of haulage companies have mentioned to me that they have will difficulty crossing a third country in a post-Brexit world.  I refer to the requirement on the European Investment Bank to support Ireland as new super highways to Europe will have to be developed to avoid crossing the UK.  I do not know if I will get a response to that but I would be interested in hearing it.</p> <p>  Fisheries are extremely important.  I will not discuss agriculture because, like Mr. Luke "Ming" Flanagan, I think milk comes in cartons and that is all I know about it.</p> <p>  The issue of Northern Ireland with respect to Brexit comes up all the time and we constantly hear that 56% of those in Northern Ireland who voted in the referendum opposed leaving the Union.  On the one hand, we cannot talk about democracy while, on the other, rejecting it.  Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.  As long as that remains the case, there is no way there will be a border in the Irish Sea.  This will be a major problem because unionists will not accept it.  It should be borne in mind that they sit in Westminster, a forum where nationalists have no voice.</p><p>We cannot negotiate where we do not have a voice.  It is as simple as that.  I am sorry to bring it up because I have tremendous respect for the work that has been done by the nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland over the last 20 years or so to make the country as safe as it is and to make it so welcoming for anybody who wants to travel there from abroad.  The truth is that unless people get up off their bums and start giving Northern Ireland a voice - outside, that is, of those of us in the Republic of Ireland who have been screaming to the high heavens - it will be hard to make progress.  I know Mr. Carthy does not like hearing this but unless somebody goes to Westminster and starts representing the republican side of Ireland, we will end up with a hard border.  I predicted that in June 2016 and people laughed at me but there is nobody laughing now.  We are coming ever closer to a hard border on this island and that would be detrimental to the people of Northern Ireland.  It is they who will suffer.  I asked the unionists and Mr. Carthy knows the answer to this.  At the end of the day, Britain will not provide the level of financial support to Northern Ireland that the European Union has been providing.  We really have to exercise the full democratic imperative in order to protect those citizens of Ireland who are geographically separated from their country by virtue of the fact that they are located in a place that is currently regarded as part of the United Kingdom.  One hopes that will change in time but it is how matters stand.</p><p> PESCO continually comes up along with this nonsense about a European army.  I hear today that perhaps we should be putting the money into the CAP.  The CAP will not be worth a continental damn if we experience a serious cyber attack that grinds this country's information technology system to a halt and leaves us in a situation where we are praying for security.  It is not that long since a major cyber attack in the United Kingdom brought its entire health system down.  That weekend, Ireland did not have anybody on duty in cyber security because we did not have the numbers to do it.  Let us get away from the nonsense of a European army.  PESCO is a menu of choices.  We can pick what we want from it and avoid what we do not want.  There is an article being published this weekend, I understand, that will explore the security of this country and the need for us to modernise our equipment.  Ireland is a small country and, on its own, it cannot have the purchasing power that would be available under PESCO.  If somebody is talking about a European army, I urge them to remember that this country is militarily non-aligned.  It is not a neutral country.  It is militarily non-aligned and we will not be changing our position short of a referendum of the people.  I take grave exception to people trying to pretend that something different is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#H00200"><p>I am not a member of the committee but I always appreciate the opportunity to engage with and hear from MEPs because they are operating at the coalface.  Unfortunately, it seems we are not going to have the opportunity for an engagement today.  I had a number of questions and will put them on record in any event.  Perhaps the witnesses can provide answers at the next session.</p> <p>  I also want to refer to Senator Craughwell's points, for the purposes of balance.  He cannot admire people for pulling on the green jersey and then whip that jersey off in order to have a pop at those who adhere to a democratic imperative not to take their seats in Westminster.  If we are going to talk about democratic imperatives, let us remember that core one.  I will not hang on that issue for too long, however.</p> <p>  Ms Anderson referred to a number of the issues I want to raise.  Other colleagues have mentioned the issue of the Border.  It seems to me that the cast-iron guarantees the Taoiseach may have got from Theresa May are much more precarious than they appeared to be a number of weeks ago.  Do the MEPs want to expand on that?  Is there merit in asking the Taoiseach, publicly and privately, to do more to ensure that those commitments from the British Government are honoured, particularly in light of what Ms Anderson outlined in respect of the previous form of British negotiation teams when it comes to Ireland?</p> <p>  One of the issues I have consistently raised, as my Seanad colleagues will be well aware, is that there are between 800,000 and 900,000 Irish and, therefore, EU citizens in the North.  An Taoiseach has said those citizens will not be abandoned, a position I support fully.  When Mr. Guy Verhofstadt was here, he also said that the EU citizenship of those of us who are going to be held hostage in a post-Brexit scenario will not be undermined or weakened in any way.  Two questions flow from that.  First, should one or more of the two additional MEP seats for Ireland be used to represent Irish citizens in the North, given that we did vote to remain in the EU, as Senator Craughwell said?  Second, I have raised on a number of occasions the potential for the Government to put its money where its mouth is in terms of practical infrastructural service investment in the North, through something like the location of an Irish passport office in the Six Counties, particularly in view of the fact that last year alone there were over 82,000 applications for passports from the North.  I have also proposed the idea of a citizenship hub, a facility that would be dedicated to supporting citizens in the North to engage with the Government and, indeed, the EU structures regarding their rights and entitlements post-Brexit.</p> <p>  My concerns in the context of PESCO are not nonsense.  They are very sincerely and legitimately held.  PESCO moves us onto very unsavoury ground and has the potential to impinge upon Ireland's neutral status.  For example, while we can be very proud of the Defence Forces operations in the Mediterranean, which have a humanitarian focus, PESCO has the potential to shift us towards a much more militarised and, I believe, anti-immigrant and anti-asylum seeker status.  Senator Craughwell is not here any more.  He should not simply dismiss the concerns that we and many other human rights, humanitarian and charitable organisations have in respect of PESCO, just because he disagrees.  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

It is also welcome that the meeting is being broadcast live so that people can watch our deliberations.  I welcome the MEPs and the Vice President of the European Parliament, Ms McGuinness whom I meet regularly at COSAC meetings.  We met recently in Sofia in Bulgaria.  She plays a very important role in respect of liaison with all the parliaments.  It is a very influential role and the more we have those contacts, the better.  The UK was not represented at the last set of meetings in Sofia, which is unfortunate.  It is a pity to see that they are moving out already.</p> <p>  In the context of Brexit, we will have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  That is very evident from the statements today.  It is moving very fast.  The guarantee of free movement of people between North and South and throughout the United Kingdom must be upheld.  Irrespective of what the outcome will be, those are the fundamentals that were discussed at the start.  The Good Friday Agreement, in all its facets, must also be guaranteed and honoured by the United Kingdom.  That is vital.  May I suggest that those extra two seats should, as Ms Anderson said, be located as close as possible to the Border.  I am sure our MEPs from that region will agree with me.</p> <p>  The reality is that the text of December is a fudge and is not being put into law because there is no agreement.  Let us be quite blunt.  It is a most complicated situation whereby the DUP basically has a veto on the British Government.  As long as it has that veto, there will be no great agreement in this regard and the talks are not far from collapse at this stage.  There is certainly potential for destabilisation of the current British Government as well.  The situation is very difficult.  Ireland, North and South, will be the big loser.  All we can say is that we hope for the best and hope there will be an agreement.</p> <p>  This dialogue could go on longer.  I expect that the committee will be with the MEPs in Brussels in due course to follow up.  I will ask Ms Guinness to respond briefly.  I know we are not going to get answers on all of the points raised.  I ask her to keep her response as short as possible.  I am very conscious that the European Ombudsman is also here.</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman said the text was a fudge and that it was not being put into law.  Let me say, on behalf of the European Union, to the citizens who are listening, that it regards the text as an agreement.  It is not a fudge.  We believe it is an agreement which will be put into law.</p></speech>

Every country is watching and if it misbehaves, it will be noted.  Who would conclude a trade agreement with a country the word of which could not be taken as the truth?</p> <p>  I also caution those who are saying the budgetary outlook is bleak for the future.  There is a danger that if we keep repeating that narrative, as Deputy Bernard J. Durkan stated, it will become real.  We have to fight hard and are doing so to achieve an increase in the budget.  Member states will have to put money into the pot.  If we believe there is a future for the European Union, we have to fund it.  I hope Ireland will be part of that battle.</p> <p>  There is democracy in Europe, despite people saying we need more of it.  This is democracy in action.  The proceedings of the committee are being broadcast live.  We meet regularly.  There is no harm in reminding ourselves when we are critical of the European Union, as many of us are, with what are we comparing it.  Where on the globe do citizens have the freedoms that they enjoy, enjoy the rule of law and live a democracy that functions as well, despite its flaws, as the European Union?  If we remember this in the battles about where it is and where it is going, it will at least put us on the one sheet in saying the European Union is worth defending because without it, we would all be much worse off, not only financially.</p></speech>

Durkan asked an important question about whether Brexit could lead to the destruction of the European Union.  Obviously, we all hope it will not.  The answer to the question lies in whether the rest of us will learn the lessons from it.  It is true - it has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>- that in large part the Brexit vote result was caused by a xenophobic negative racist element which was epitomised by the Deputy's good friend who was in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#J01000"><p>Not mine.</p></speech>

We do not know the overall percentage who were disillusioned at the direction the European Union was taking in latter years, but we can assume that it was more than 3%, which was the difference between winning and losing in the referendum.  I argue, therefore, that we need to learn the lessons.</p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan also stated we needed to make a decision on whether we were all moving in the same direction or in different directions on whether we should have European Union representatives across member states.  The secret of the success of the European Union lies in the fact that we have the maturity to agree that there are areas in which we should all move forward together and also areas in which there are national priorities which will trump EU priorities and that national governments should have the ability and the freedom to decide what they shoould do in those instances.  We need to be honest with ourselves in all matters.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's points about PESCO and whether it is a stepping stone to an EU army, almost every other member state that has signed up to it refer to it as a stepping stone to an EU army, yet in Ireland we are supposed to expect that it is something different.  We should be honest and say that is what it has been sold and championed as.  </p> <p>  Obviously, I do not have time to deal with all of the other points made by the Senator, but I suggest that if President Higgins is to seek a second term, he should replay the comments made by the Senator and that he will not face much opposition in the ballot box.</p> <p>  My final statement is on the future of the European Union, the debates on which provide an opportunity.  Thus far, they have not be capitalised.  If they do not include space for critical keynote speeches by those who have a different view on issues of concern to citizens within the European Union such as membership of PESCO and trade, they will have been a missed opportunity.</p> <p>  On a positive note, I can speak on behalf of all Irish MEPs when I say we are in absolute agreement that the next speaker, the European Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly, is doing a magnificent job and that we are very proud of her.  She is not afraid to be critical and stand up to the most powerful interests within the European institutions when required.  That should be noted.</p></speech>

That is part of the problem we have in the North.  It goes back to what Ms McGuinness stated about the reckless behaviour of the British Government on where it may be going and the damage it could do to us all, but I take on board and accept her statement that it will be put into law.  Within it, it states there will be no diminution of rights.  Therefore, it is about ensuring the rights and entitlements of the people of the North will be upheld.  Fifty years after the civil rights campaign, it is the Irish Government that needs to ensure it will stand over those rights.  We have had comments made on the issue of the passports.  It is not just because someone holds an Irish passport.  As a result of the Good Friday Agreement, some 1.8 million of us have been afforded the right to be British or Irish or both.  That means that the rights of the people of the North have to be applied, regardless of whether someone holds an Irish passport.  Without a doubt, we need passport offices in the North, but that is another subject matter.</p> <p>  The principle of consent was built into the Good Friday Agreement.  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell talked about the people of the North being part of the United Kingdom.  For the first time in the North, we have been given an opportunity to identify as Irish, to have our Irish citizenship recognised and to have the aspiration of Irish unity to be taken forward and addressed in a Border poll.  Let us remember that in April the European Council gave a signal to the people of Ireland when it stated that in the event of a Border poll being triggered under the Good Friday Agreement, it would mean that the North of Ireland would rejoin the European Union.  Therefore, what we need is for the Irish Government to become a facilitator.  Perhaps the Senator does not realise - I want everyone to know in case those listening do not realise it - that there is already a border in the Irish Sea.  Animals, animal products, plants and plant produce are all checked at the port and airport in Belfast.  I am not saying that border needs to be enhanced.  I do not want to see a border between the North and the South or east to west, but let people realise that for decades there has been a border.  We were able to tackle bluetongue on the island because we were able to work together on an all-island basis.  One does not have to have new infrastructure put in place, but what can never happen and be accepted by anyone on the island is the re-emergence of a harder border.  That cannot be tolerated.  I accept that is something that is being said by everyone at this committee.</p></speech>

In fact, we, in the European Parliament, had our own resolution, of which the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement formed parts, as well as the fact that there should be no border between the North and South.  That was recognised by the European Parliament which will eventually agree to whatever arrangement is put in place between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.  We take the issue seriously.  I understand the European Commission and Mr. Barnier who is heading its delegation take very seriously the commitments given, to which the United Kingdom will be held.  The groundwork has been done.</p><p>The groundwork will have to be acknowledged and be part of whatever agreement is reached.  We spoke about the budget but did not deal with it enough.  It will be very important.  This debate will dominate our proceedings for the next few months as we decide where the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, from 2020 will go.  Last week, Mario Draghi came to the Parliament.  He said that in December 2016, he had predicted that the European economies would grow by 1.5% but in fact, they grew by 2.5% over 2017.  We are in a positive period in which economies are growing across Europe.  Our country is doing extremely well.  The last time the MFF was put in place there was, unfortunately, a recession and that also should be borne in mind.</p></speech>

We are net contributors and will have to increase our contribution.  One of the factors taken into account in calculating the contribution is the size of our economy and our gross domestic product, GDP.  We must remember that only a couple of years ago, we were described as having a system of leprechaun economics.  While those leprechaun economic growths in GDP may not trickle down to the people, the cost to the State rises because our contribution goes up.  We need to take that into account when we massage our figures on GDP unrealistically.</p> <p>  As far as fudge is concerned, I think the Vice Chairman is suggesting it might be on the British side.  Maybe it would and will be but the idea that someone will be worried about not being able to make future trade agreements because they would not be trusted is complete and utter rubbish.  The European Union and Ireland trade with China, which harvests the organs of people who do not agree with certain people.  Germany sells tanks to Saudi Arabia, not to plough the fields in Yemen and not just for money but in return for votes to host the World Cup.  There are no morals or fairness when it comes to trading or doing deals.  There are more morals in hell.  </p></speech>

I always wonder why the office is not called "ombudsperson".  It should be changed.  I find it uncomfortable, like "chairman".  Maybe it is something else Ms O'Reilly might achieve before the end of her term.</p> <p>  The committee had the opportunity to meet her this time last year in Brussels and it was a very rewarding engagement.  The committee is interested in the work she has been doing on transparency and in particular a case that she opened on transparency in the Council of the European Union, which examines the legislative process.  Separately, the Dutch Parliament has also been considering transparency.  This committee is considering it as well.  Only yesterday, Ms O'Reilly made recommendations following almost a year of work with inquiry and public consultation.  The published recommendations were circulated to all members of the committee yesterday but they may not have had a chance to read them in detail.  The timing of today's engagement is very helpful.  </p> <p>  Most of our engagement today will focus on transparency in the Council but if Ms O'Reilly has the time, the committee will also be interested in other areas of her work.  When the committee was in Brussels the Brexit negotiations were at an early stage and, considering how important they are for citizens, she strongly advocated for transparency.</p><p>Her work has never been so vital as it is with the negotiations that are under way at present.  We are delighted that, as an Irish person, Ms O'Reilly holds that position.  I was there when you were campaigning and successfully won the election.  It is one of the few prestigious positions in the European Union to which a person is elected by the Parliament, not appointed.  It is a great achievement for you and for Ireland.<br/><br/>Before we begin, I must remind everybody of the rules on privilege.  You are all aware of them but for legal purposes it is necessary to read them out.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Ms O'Reilly will be aware of all this so it was probably unnecessary.  I invite her to begin.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be in Leinster House again and to have the opportunity to address members on an issue that goes to the heart of the current challenges facing the EU, which the members have been discussing with the MEPs.  I am aware that the committee has invested a considerable amount of time over the past year to hearing from experts and assessing the current deliberations on the future of Europe.  While they may not feature on the list of more high-profile institutional reforms currently under discussion, it would be a mistake not to consider democratic accountability and transparency reforms as priorities as we seek to respond to the current public uncertainty about the EU.<br/><br/>Laws that affect people&rsquo;s daily lives should be drawn up in a manner that is as transparent as possible.  This is essential for enabling meaningful public scrutiny of, and thus accountability for, those laws.  More transparent lawmaking is central to the democratic legitimacy of our institutions and, at a more fundamental level, to responding to the current crisis of public confidence in democratic institutions whether at EU level or in the member states.  Overall, despite what some may assume, the EU administration has higher ethical and transparency standards than the administrations of most member states.  For example, very few member states have a lobbyist register as the EU does, Ireland being a commendable exception.  Few national Ministers in Europe publish details of their travel expenses, as the European Commission has just recently agreed to do.  The Commission and important EU agencies such as the European Medicines Agency have also made commendable strides in recent years in opening up their processes and practices to public scrutiny.  Matters of great public interest, such as EU trade deals and the results of clinical trials on medicines, are now much more transparent than they were previously.  As I have frequently said, the world has not stopped turning as a result.<br/><br/>That said, it is clear that the Council of the EU, where the national governments are represented, is not a star pupil among the institutions when it comes to transparency and accounting for its decisions.  Given its crucial role in the EU&rsquo;s lawmaking process, I believe this must be addressed.  That is what motivated my decision to launch a strategic inquiry last year into the transparency and accountability of the Council.  On the basis of that inquiry, this week I issued a series of recommendations.<br/><br/>When the Council formally adopts EU laws, meetings and discussions of the Ministers on the draft laws are public.  However, before the Council reaches a formal position, preparatory discussions will have taken place in some of the more than 150 committees and working parties in the Council.  It is at this level that not only do the nuts and bolts of the legislative work take place but it is also where legislative decisions are occasionally made.  Most of the changes to draft laws are proposed and compromises between member states are sought at this stage, before Ministers adopt a final position.  Unlike Council meetings, these preparatory bodies of ambassadors and civil servants do not meet in public.  As such, the only way to follow their discussions on legislation is through whatever records exist of those discussions.  This requires, first, that legislative discussions in preparatory bodies be documented and, second, that such documents are accessible in an easy and timely manner.  Both of these factors are essential for facilitating public scrutiny of the legislative work in these bodies.<br/><br/>The national representatives who sit on these Council bodies are democratically accountable to the national parliaments and to citizens of their member states, in theory.  However, in order for the public to be able to hold governments to account for the decisions they make on EU laws, they need to know how their governments positioned themselves in the legislative process.  This crucial piece of the process is currently generally lacking.  As part of my inquiry, we carried out a public consultation last year.  This consultation yielded some highly relevant responses, including from the Dutch and UK Parliaments, that have helped fine-tune the outstanding issues.  On the basis of this, I have made a series of recommendations and suggestions to the Council.<br/><br/>The Council secretariat is clearly aware of its deficiencies in this area and has certainly made some welcome progress, not least by introducing a new internal recording system in November 2016.  While this is an internal register, the existence of such a system should help provide a greater incentive comprehensively to record and document all legislative discussions in the preparatory bodies.  At present, it appears there is no uniform approach to reporting and documenting the legislative discussions in the preparatory bodies.  The Council also takes a selective approach to how it discloses the documents that do exist.  My recommendations and suggestions to the Council seek to ensure these issues are addressed.<br/><br/>Much of this can seem rather abstract or removed from the stuff of daily political life.  However, all of us are aware of the practice by which member state governments sometimes criticise decisions taken in Brussels to their domestic audience when, very often, during the legislative process in Brussels they had supported or shaped the very decision they then criticise.  Systematically recording the identity of member states expressing positions<b></b>in the preparatory bodies, and proactively disclosing these records, would go some way to addressing this problem.  I am aware of the challenges this may pose when the diplomatic impulse is towards arriving at a consensus with the minimum of fuss but the price of that may be to continue to feed an inaccurate view of how EU lawmaking is actually carried out, and to allow some member state governments to continue to perpetuate the stigmatisation of the so-called faceless Brussels bureaucrat.  My hope is that, by addressing the opaque nature of lawmaking in the Council, my inquiry will help to encourage all EU governments to defend democratically decided EU legislation in the public interest in the future.  As a result, I hope the Council responds positively to the recommendations I set out this week.<br/><br/>Before I conclude, I wish to mention two other pieces of work in which my office is currently engaged.  Brexit<b></b>is a huge issue for this country and for the EU more widely.  Early last year, I wrote to both the European Commission and the Council of the EU encouraging them to be as transparent as possible in the Brexit negotiations.  It is important that citizens and national parliaments can follow this crucial process which will affect the lives of millions, especially on this island.  Thankfully, the EU has adopted a progressive stance to publishing all important documents during the negotiations, including the EU guidelines, negotiating directives and position papers.  Unfortunately, the UK side has not been seen to be as transparent.<br/><br/>Also recently, following a year-long inquiry based on a complaint from Denmark, I made a recommendation to the European Central Bank, ECB, about its involvement with the Washington DC-based so-called Group of Thirty.  Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,  is a member of this group, which is a private group of 30 senior bankers, public officials and academics.  It holds two private meetings per year and includes representatives of some global banks which the ECB supervises as part of its banking supervision mandate.  My main recommendation was that the President, Mr. Draghi, suspend his membership of this group until he leaves office, in order to protect the ECB from any perception that its independence could be compromised.</p><p>I also recommended that no future executive board members become members of the Group of 30.  I expect the response of the ECB in April. </p><p>Finally, I thank the committee for its support in my role as European Ombudsman and also the Irish MEPs who have been consistently supportive of my work in the European Parliament. </p></speech>

I think it was last year that she met members of the committee in Brussels and was very informative about the details of her work then.  I welcome her more recent recommendations which all of us will support.  We live in an age of openness, transparency and accountability.  I will be devil's advocate for a moment.  Through the years, European or even UK diplomacy involved wheeling and dealing and smoke-filled rooms, quiet diplomacy.  Is Ms O'Reilly satisfied that as we move to this more open and transparent system that it will not hinder the objective of getting an outcome in terms of a deal or solution?  It is mostly a philosophical question.  I support the work that Ms O'Reilly does and the objectives she has outlined but will it hinder the Council's work in any way?</p> <p>  Another question which is not entirely related to Ms O'Reilly's work is a general issue in which she will be interested, namely the rise of illiberal tendencies in the European Union, in countries such as Poland, Hungary and so on, in terms of the freedom of the press, the appointment of judges and so forth.  There are threats to European values and democratic norms.  Is Ms O'Reilly concerned about that or does she feel that the EU can deal with that through its rules, mechanisms and so forth?  In the course of her own experience, has Ms O'Reilly noticed a rise of such illiberal tendencies among the people she mixes with in Brussels, for instance?  Is it something that we should be concerned about?</p></speech>

She is doing important work.  She is critical of the Council, probably rightly.  How has she found the Commission and other bodies?  Which of them occupy more of her time or which are slightly more difficult to deal with?  Is there a culture of cover-up, although I hesitate to use that term?  They do not wish to release information.  Perhaps it is natural or is human nature when certain select bodies get together, especially  Mario Draghi has not formally reacted yet but I would be very interested to know if Ms O'Reilly has had any feedback on that recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#M00500"><p>I welcome the Ombudsman and thank her for her presentation.</p> <p>  I agree that transparency is hugely important.  If one is dealing with colleagues on an international or European level, it is always good to know their hidden thoughts, and whether the views they express in one particular arena are the same as those they have expressed secretly or might be influencing things in a different direction at home.  I am particularly interested in the European Medicines Agency.  We have had some grief over the cost of medicines.  I have complained for a long time that Ireland does not seem able to avail of the benefits of a 500 million-people market in relation to the cost of medicines, particularly in relation to trial medicines, new discoveries, orphan medicines, all of which has caused severe problems whereby the manufacturers sell the medicines at an agreed price until they become accepted and established when they then change the pricing structure.  In recent days, the Minister has made arrangements with some of the smaller countries in the EU in an effort to bring about some improvement in the area.  </p> <p>  It is very important for us in Ireland, but it is equally important for every country in the EU.  Every state in the EU, big or small, there is no difference, is entitled to be able to buy their medicines at a price that reflects the type of market in which we live.  After all, if we were not members of the EU, presumably we would not get medicine at all or we would do so at only a particular pricing structure.  There is still a tendency to do that.  I strongly support Ms O'Reilly's activities in that area and hope there will be more of it.  A huge benefit accrues to all member states across the EU from achieving a result where medicines are priced within an acceptable range.  </p> <p>  I wish Ms O'Sullivan well in the area of Brexit.  In the matter of transparency, Ms O'Sullivan will have to get into what people have in their minds as well as their documents and their policies.  I know that she is well capable of doing that.  Any good ombudsman or journalist knows that it is crucially important in current circumstances to know where the other side is coming from in the negotiations that are now taking place.  It is not on this meeting's agenda, but there has been considerable discussion about tax justice recently and the 12.5% corporation tax.  Very powerful people in Europe with powerful associations have concluded that it must be dismantled or else we must collect taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions, some of which are in Europe.  I strongly oppose that.  It has the potential to do us considerable damage.  Last week, an international aid organisation was opining on this along side a major, multi-billion dollar international investment house.  I do not know what the association is between the two, it is somewhere in the back of my mind that they appeared to complement each other in their goal of destroying what is seen as being an advantage to Ireland.  Incidentally, I am in favour of equality of taxation, I have no difficulty whatever with that, where I do have difficulty is if it comes in under a guise of something else, which is to discourage foreign direct investment in this particular country.</p></speech>

I am also delighted to welcome my old sparring partner Mr. Aidan O'Sullivan to the committee.</p> <p>  My colleagues have already mentioned Brexit so I will step away from the issue, for once, but I commend Ms O'Reilly on her efforts to ensure that the European side is as transparent as possible.  It is an issue that she has raised with us in Brussels long before the negotiations.  It has been heartening to see it rolled out.  I wish that the UK side was as transparent, perhaps among each other as well as with the European side.  </p> <p> I want to raise three areas.  The first may link into the future of Europe, but generally feeds into the post-Brexit scenario, with trade negotiations and discussions.  I was an outspoken supporter of both TTIP and CETA, which I felt were both great trade deals.  I think CETA will be excellent for the European Union.  One of the main reasons TTIP stalled, apart from the change in the political direction of the United States, was the mass opposition which was bred by the idea that it was being done in secret.  When I had the trade portfolio in the EU committee of the regions, I looked at the TTIP negotiation documents.  I went to a basement in the Berlaymont and had to surrender my mobile phone.  I was writing a report on that from the EU side.  It set a really bad tone for a process that I thought was very worthwhile.  CETA was exactly the same.  The opposition lobby pushed those arguments.  If we are looking at new trade deals with Malaysia, Vietnam, Australasia, Mercosur is particularly important for this island, I hope that the ombudsman's office is beefed up and is allowed to play the role that it is there to do.</p><p>I really have high hopes for the Office of the European Ombudsman.<br/><br/>An area I would like to discuss is the issue of lobbying.  I have taken a major interest in the lobbyist register and other measures we have taken in the State.  I wonder if there is scope for an EU-wide lobbying register, so that it is not left to the individual member state.  I will be frank, many of my friends are lobbyists.  When one works in politics, lobbying is an industry that one ends up going into.  Who knows, someday I could be forced into it, depending on the will of the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown?  If an Irish MEP is being lobbied in Brussels by a third party from another member state, there is huge confusion on where responsibility for that lies.  Is that lobbying in Belgium, or is it lobbying in Ireland or is it lobbying by a third party lobbyist?  There is a lack of clarity and there are too many discrepancies between the member states to allow it be efficient.  Is there a way to simplify it?  I know I possibly<b></b>may be opening a can of worms.  Brussels, as a city, just short of Washington has the highest number of lobbyists in the world.  It is a difficult area but in order for politics to continue in the best way possible we need the highest level of transparency in our lobbyists.  It should not be a black mark for an individual to say I am lobbyist.  One does not know what an individual lobbying for.  The vast majority of lobbyists are doing it in a very benevolent manner and they are trying to aid the legislative process.  More rules and a clearer process makes it easier not just for the lobbyists but in our parlance, the designated public officeholders and officials, such as all of us who are on this side of the room and indeed Ms O'Reilly as well.<br/><br/>I want to raise the issue of political funding and the role of outside bodies in the domestic affairs of individual member states.  I will give two examples that are unique to Ireland, first our upcoming referendum on whether to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, Article 40. 3. 3<sup>o</sup>.  Both sides of the campaign have raised really valid concerns about outside funding coming into the campaign to support campaign groups, be they NGOs or groups that have been just set up for this campaign.  I raised the matter on the floor of the Seanad in the context that I received ten separate Facebook advertisements from campaigns seeking to retain the eighth amendment, supposedly from ten separate groups, even though their imagery, language and content was identical.  How do we peel that back; what is the single source for that?  Where is the funding coming from?  The exact same applies to those who are seeking to repeal the eighth amendment.  Let me declare publicly I believe in repealing the eighth amendment.  There are legitimate concerns about outside funding from the US or other EU funding of certain bodies in this country.  Does the European Ombudsman have a role in that area to make sure that it is fair and transparent and that the referendum can be held with the highest level of integrity?<br/><br/>My second point relates to direct political funding.  Last week the European grouping for Freedom and Direct Democracy held an event calling for an Irexit, a damp squib in the end.  The EFDD group in the European Parliament has no Irish members.  No Irish political party is a constituent member, either of their European parliamentary group or their European-wide political family.  All of us on this side happen to be members of the Fine Gael Party and we are all members of the European People's Party, EPP.  It states that on our membership card therefore when the EPP holds events in Ireland, such as the study days with our MEPs or any campaigning for example on the Lisbon referendum or the fiscal stability, it does so through its member party and we pay a membership fee.  What distinguishes any EU political family from member state parties or groupings in the European Parliament and what rights or responsibilities do they have if they are going to act in a member state where they do not have actual constituted member parties?  The only member state in which the EPP does not have a member party is the United Kingdom.  Could it have launched a campaign on the referendum on Brexit and run an EPP campaign?  Could we as a member of the EPP have launched a campaign on Brexit during the referendum?  Could we start holding public meetings and using EU funds, which is what the EFDD has, to pursue a political agenda in another member state?  I welcome debate on Ireland's future in the European Union but I question why British MEPs and European funding is going to a group that has no Irish members and being used to stimulate that debate.  Is the EFDD doing so within the rules?  Is it an area in which there needs to be more clarity and what role can the Office of the European Ombudsman take in that? </p></speech>

I would like to tease one point out further.  There is a fundamental difference between a sovereign state and a national parliament legislating in a particular way.  The European Union, which is a confederation of national states, is engaging in the legislative process that it has put together.  I welcome a lot of the work that the Ms O'Reilly has gone into around this because I have always advocated as a passionate pro-European that one of the most significant problems we have is the way in which national governments will consistently blame the European Union or a faceless bureaucrat in the European Commission for some piece of legislation that they do not like, whereas if it is a project that has received funding, it will be the national government's success when the funded project is completed.</p> <p>  What worries me - and I would be interested to learn how the European Ombudsman has looked at this - is that as much failure as there is in the process of a closed door discussion between sovereign governments trying to harmonise their position, it has by and large delivered a lot of things which have significantly benefited Europe and Ireland during our period of membership of the European Union.  If we go down the path of a far more open and transparent process at that stage, has the European Ombudsman considered what the repercussions could be in terms of member states effectively taking the bit of the process that they do not want to be made public outside of that structure, having private sidebar conversations and dealing off the official agenda, so that we actually end up knowing less about what is happening?   I would hope that Ireland would find it perfectly okay to operate in an open and transparent way but I have no doubt that there would be other member states where that would be very alien to their process of operating.  What would worry me is that in adjusting the current process we could end up with a worse process, where more of the actual initial stages of putting together legislation take place in a completely untransparent way.  Has Ms O'Reilly looked at that and how does she think some of the processes she wants to engage in will ensure that does not happen?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#N00800"><p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to welcome the European Ombudsman to this committee.  Interestingly enough I was in the Seanad this morning dealing with the progress of a report called Too Old to be Elderly and the mobility allowance.  I had the support of the Leas-Chathaoirleach who was chairing that session.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey spoke about issues in Hungary, Poland and other countries.  I have a particular interest in people with disabilities of whom there are 80 million across the European Union.  The experiences and expectations are very different in member states.  I am familiar with this from my own work, and I know the European Ombudsman would have some sense of this from her involvement with the various European disability organisations and the European social platform.  There are real concerns about the growth and the development of civil society groups, but my major issue is with the groups related to disability.</p><p> Ms O'Reilly's particular work is about ensuring that European institutions are more effective, transparent and open, as well as protecting people's fundamental rights.  Will she comment on the role that civil society organisations can play in member states given the right environment?  From talking to colleagues in certain member states, I know they feel quite vulnerable trying to do their advocacy work and that they are being watched critically.  A strong civil society movement, where people get organised, involved and criticise their governments, is important as part of one of the bedrocks of developing a strong, cohesive and socially progressive European project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.90" nospeaker="true" time="14:00:00" ><p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae resumed the Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#O00300"><p>I understand the arguments presented by Deputies Haughey and Brophy about how good legislation has been done through a process which is less than transparent or, indeed, accountable at European Council level.  Deputy Haughey asked would we be able to get much of this work done if everything was out there and there was not this room for a diplomatic safe space.  The problem is that the current process does not match the rights in the European treaty for citizens to see how legislation has been processed.  In a way, the problem is that they are using the diplomatic processes we are accustomed to in the areas of defence, foreign affairs or international relations in a legislative process.<br/><br/>The EU cannot have it both ways.  On the one hand, it cannot decry populism, along with those who blame Brussels for everything and give a distorted view of how the EU legislates, while insisting on using a process which does not allow for full transparency or for the sort of accountability one gets in the Oireachtas or other member state parliaments and governments.  When one is trying to get 28 member states to agree on non-sensitive issues, their positions can be recorded and there is not a problem.  On sensitive issues, however, it is a problem and one can understand the impulse of keeping one's hands across one's homework, if one likes, until one gets consensus and the issue across the line.  If the price for that is that Eurosceptics, as well as those who are anti-EU, can claim that proves we are being ruled by undemocratic and faceless bureaucrats and the EU does not afford citizens the right to have full accountability for what is done in their name and for them, then that is a problem.<br/><br/>There is also an issue of political maturity.  Obviously, the impulse in many member states, as well as at EU and Council level, would be to get these things through with the minimum of fuss.  People are accustomed, and therefore expect, there to be argument and debate.  People are also accustomed to political parties and groupings making compromises.  According to the treaty and various rulings made by the European Court of Justice, that is the way it is supposed to happen at EU level, even though the difficulties which the Deputies spoke about can arise.  There was an interesting court case in 2012, when a transparency NGO, Access Info Europe, sought to get records of member state positions on, curiously enough, the EU transparency regulation.  The European Court of Justice agreed that records of member state positions should be made publicly available and as soon as possible.  What happened then?  The Council accepted this, meaning any member state positions which were actually recorded would be released.  However, they now simply do not record them in many instances.  There is a consensus, nod of the head or an informal agreement on a particular matter.  If a record does not exist, then it cannot be accessed.<br/><br/>The Council has three months to deliberate on my proposals.  Obviously, I will be interested, and I am sure other member state parliaments will be interested, in what position it takes.  As an ombudsman, if I have difficult recommendations to get across the line, it can be hard to do so if mine is the only voice.  All members of the committee will have observed, however, a head of steam is building up around this.  There have been calls from certain member states, the Dutch in particular, as well as civil society and the European Parliament, for the Council to become more open.  As we move towards the 2019 European Parliament elections, and as the debate on the future of Europe becomes more intense, this will be an issue.<br/><br/>On the comments I made in my investigation and here earlier, blaming Brussels has led to many bad things.  We might as well try something else.<br/><br/>Hungary and Poland are difficult issues for the EU.  The EU has soft power and has been trying to use initiatives and dialogue to have certain member states, which seem to be rolling back democratic norms and the rule of law, to heed what it is saying and bring their value systems in line with what they are supposed to accept by virtue of being members of the Union.  It is difficult.  We have seen what has happened in Poland.  The European Commission's First Vice President, Frans Timmermans, has done much negotiating with the Polish Government and we will see what happens.  People are not as engaged with this as much as they might be about Brexit or migration.  However, it goes to the core of what the EU is meant to be about.  If certain member states are not accepting the foundational basis of the EU, then that is a big problem.  I do not believe any of us have the answers to that.  We have to continue to support the ombudsmen in those countries, as well as civil society groups as much as we can.<br/><br/>On Senator Coghlan's question on the culture of cover-up, I do not find one.  All of the institutions and agencies have become much more transparent over the past several years.  Curiously enough, social media has played a large part in that, plus a generation growing up with high expectations of transparency.  I do not believe they can resist that.<br/><br/>The President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, will respond to me in April on whether he will suspend his membership of the G30 until he leaves office in October 2019.  I am hoping he will respond positively.  I have had several cases with the European Central Bank.  It has always collaborated well and has made all of its processes much more open as a result.  I am hoping for a positive response.<br/><br/>On Deputy Durkan's questions about the European Medicines Agency, I remember back in 1982, when I was working in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, doing a two-page article on drugs pricing and generic drugs.  It is still a significant problem.  Being home over the past few days, I have listened to the conversation taking place on the Joe Duffy radio programme about the withdrawal of a certain drug.  Whatever the ins and outs of it, I was struck by the human stories, the suffering the people affected are going through and their belief that this particular drug was helping them to tolerate almost intolerable situations.</p><p>The issue of pricing is also important because a number of people who spoke were able to point to the price of that drug in Northern Ireland but also in the US.  A lot of work is being done at European level in the context of harmonising these issues.  That is important because if the EU is to be for citizens, I cannot think of any more important areas in respect of which it should for the citizens than those of health and, as Senator Dolan mentioned, disability.</p><p> Regarding the trade negotiations and TTIP, as members are aware, we did a lot of work with the Commission regarding making the talks far more open.  In fairness to the Commission, it has really transformed its transparency policy on that.  I think the Commission was quite stunned by the level of engagement regarding the TTIP negotiations and realised that times have moved on, the rules of the game have changed and it could no longer do things behind closed doors and had to transform the way in which it did business.  As was rightly noted, the TTIP talks are stalled at the moment but last year, the Commission set out its five principles of trade negotiations and for the first time, one of them was transparency.  It is true even in the way it has conducted itself with regard to Brexit.  I know there are political reasons behind the transparency as well but an awful lot is out there.  It is still early days.  When we really get down to the hard negotiation about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, we will see the limits of transparency.</p><p> I forgot to mention a point about Council transparency.  If we look hard enough, we will be able to track a particular regulation or a particular player who is putting down amendments and so on.  A lot of it is down there.  If one knows the right people within a particular working group or a particular ambassador, one can get the information.  In a sense, that creates a playing field that is not level because a well-resourced lobbyist or global corporation in Brussels will be able to afford to send people out to do nothing but track the trajectory of a particular regulation 24-7.  In a sense, this gives privileged access to people while not allowing ordinary members of the public or civil society who would not be as well resourced to have their say.</p><p> With regard to the lobbying register, I agree that there is huge unevenness across member states.  Ireland is very often talked about as a model in the context of its lobbying register.  When people are speculating or talking about the improvements that could be made at EU level or within member states, they often point to the Irish register.  I have tried to interest my member state colleagues in the issue of lobbying transparency.  Some are very engaged with it because they recognise it as an issue and recognise the role lobbying can play in the making of legislation.  Obviously, a piece of legislation is the sum total of every influence brought to bear on it.  Other countries do not think it is a big deal and have a system of revolving doors where people move very rapidly from public service or politics to big industry and often back again.  Some member states do not see that there is a problem with this.  If one examines the Volkswagen scandal, the role lobbying played in that and the revolving door issue, one can see that people are increasingly waking up to why this is important.  I think we will see developments in this area.  I try to raise awareness of this issue at every opportunity, whether it be by dint of a complaint or through an investigation on my own initiative.</p><p> On disability rights, I think the Senator and I were both at the meeting at the European Parliament where people with disabilities from across member states came together in plenary.  It was quite a remarkable session.  I had been to one or two of those previously.  What I found really interesting, not just as European Ombudsman but as a citizen and human being, is that when one is in a room where everybody present has some kind of disability, be it visual or a physical incapacity, and is attempting to do what all of us take for granted every day of the week.  When one sees the challenges they face, even in a very well-resourced place like the European Parliament building, it really does bring home to one the challenges that remain.  I think Ireland is about to ratify the convention, or we hope it will, which is very good.  It has been delayed.  I think we are only one of two countries that has not ratified it.  Are we the last country?</p></speech>

Obviously, civil society has a huge role to play in this.  There is no doubt about that.  One of the more disturbing things about Hungary and Poland has been the attacks on civil society.  It is classic stuff.  Anybody who tries to challenge any part of the ruling orthodoxy is seen and depicted as an enemy of the people.  This has particularly affected civil society groupings.</p> <p>  I am certainly not going to give my tuppence worth regarding the referendum on repealing the eighth amendment - been there, done that.  Obviously, as a citizen and a woman, I look at it very carefully.  I wrote extensively on the subject as a journalist in the 1980s when the original referendum took place.  I also wrote a book about what had happened.  It is very interesting for me to see the debate for a new generation.  Some things have not changed while others have.  It is a referendum and everybody will have their say.  With regard to outside funding, I did follow a debate - not one relating to this referendum but one relating to the marriage equality referendum when there was an argument between Amnesty International and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO with regard to money received by Amnesty International.  If there is an element to it involving an EU body, conceivably, there may be some role for me.  I cannot see it at the moment.  Unless I am mistaken, SIPO would deal with those matters.  The rules are there.  Obviously, decisions will be made - whether by SIPO or through the courts - as to what is legitimate.</p> <p>  Regarding the questions about politicians from other countries coming in and they may not be members of a grouping that has Irish members, I assume it is valid for anybody to come in and be able to speak.  I think Senator Richmond was referring to Nigel Farage and some people who came here the past week or two weeks ago.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Leyden, our Vice Chairman, for taking over.  It is like the MEPs coming here earlier today.  In respect of any time Ms O'Reilly takes time out of her busy schedule to come before the committee to hear the concerns members have and get a feeling for what is happening on the ground and the issues of concern we face on a daily basis as politicians, I know she is very much in tune with what is happening here all the time politically, nationally and internationally.  She is really on top of her game, which is very important because we are the voice from the ground up.</p><p>Many of the issues that reach the ombudsman's desk have come to us through our constituencies and work already.  I gave five years here, on the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  Many of those cases, over the years, had been to the ombudsman.  It is important that we work together because, at the end of the day, it is like the matter of the Versatis patches over the last weeks.  The agony that people are going through is a matter that I raised in the D&aacute;il today during Leaders' Questions because issues like that affect people.  At the end of the day, with the ombudsman in her role and us in our role, we help people, organisations, groups and individuals.  Some people look down their noses at politicians when they see and hear them talking about and raising individual cases.  There is nothing wrong with that and no need to be ashamed about dealing with an individual and his or her problem if one is elected or is in the role of someone such as Ms Emily O'Reilly.  That is what we are supposed to do.  We are advocates.  We are there to speak for people who cannot speak for themselves.  One thing I get great satisfaction from, which I presume the ombudsman would be interested in hearing, is that late on a Monday night, I can be in a quiet country pub, meeting people, or in a cold community centre, talking to people about a particular issue.  The following day, I can stand up in the D&aacute;il and face a Minister who might have direct responsibility for that issue, or the Taoiseach, say that I met an individual somewhere last night and raise that person's problem.  That is what democracy is about.  Sometimes, journalists in particular have a hang-up about that.  They call it clientelism, parochial or parish-pump politics.  We have to listen to all this nonsense but, in the end, that is what we are supposed to do.  We are national politicians who are elected locally.  We have to start somewhere and that is where we start.  I look forward, for as long as we are there, to working with the ombudsman and her office.  We all seek to do our best for people.</p><p> I thank the ombudsman.  I will be looking back on the proceedings because I will be able to read the questions that were asked.  I thank Senator Terry Leyden and all members for their contributions.  Does Senator Dolan want to come back in?  We are wrapping up, so he can speak now.</p></speech>

I had the honour of leading an 11-strong Irish delegation.  One was from Kerry, so that is parish-pump at its best.  The Chairman might consider inviting some of those people to listen to what they have to say about their experiences.  In fairness to Ireland, the European Down's syndrome delegation was made up entirely of Irish people.  There was an Irish woman on the European Alzheimer's disease group.  There was a fine presentation of people from Ireland.  That makes the point that Irish groups, whether disability-related or otherwise, want to participate and have an interest in participating in matters at a European level.  The ombudsman mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Government committed two weeks ago to having it ratified by the end of next month.  We have got a lot of slagging internationally for being the last country in Europe to do so but I am convinced that Ireland can come out strongly over the next years and show what it can do.  The ombudsman mentioned big, multi-national agencies, including the European Disability Forum, the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities, and the Social Platform.  They do not have three dozen staff between them and are trying to work for people with disabilities and others.  There are real issues between who has the money to get selective knowledge and insider information.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and tolerance.</p></speech>

I presume all members of the committee have received it.  Some committee members might be familiar with Migrant Rights Centre Ireland.  We are a national organisation, which was established in 2001.  We have approximately 17 years' experience working with migrants and their families in Ireland.  Often we describe our work as being at the intersection of precarious employment and precarious immigration status.  We work with many migrants who work in low-paid occupations as well as with migrants who are most at risk of vulnerability associated with legal status or lack of legal status.</p><p>As such, ours is the principal organisation working with undocumented migrants in the State.  That is how we mainly would have engaged with communities in the past.  We have a focus on economic migrants, but we represent people on all issues that affect all categories of migrants.</p><p> We are not a service provider in mental health service terms, but we provide employment and immigration law services.  As indicated in my submission, we are associated with M&eacute;decins du Monde or Doctors of the World in a health-related project that particularly examines the socioeconomic determinants of health outcomes.  It considers both physical and mental health.  As such, we have been developing materials and gathering data in that regard.  I also make reference to the work of Cairde, a health advocacy organisation.  Members are probably familiar with its report on the mental health of minority ethnic groups.  I also refer to the work of Mental Health Reform, a coalition of organisations, of which MRCI and others have been part, that considers mental health needs of migrant communities in Ireland.</p><p> I will outline the matters of concern to us but, first, I refer to the data collected as part of our project with M&eacute;decins du Monde.  It highlights that the prevalence of negative mental health is similar to that among the overall population.  Among migrants reporting negative mental health there is an increased sense of isolation and a lack of support.  Among those who describe themselves as having very bad or bad mental health, 66% indicate a lack of support and say they do not have anyone on whom they can rely, or they have a limited number of people on whom to rely for support.  As members know, mental health issues affect everyone in the population.  It is important that people have access to support networks and services.  Particular categories of migrants have limited access to both services and support.  We cannot talk about causation, but there is a correlation between lack of support, lack of access to services and isolation and poor mental health outcomes.  With migrants who declared positive mental health outcomes, the level of network support was twice as good as among other populations.</p><p> I have divided issues of concern into three categories.  The first is the provision of mental health services for the broad immigrant population.  It arises mainly from the report published by Cairde in 2015 which identified the following key barriers to accessing mental health services.  This relates to experiences of racism and discrimination that people face when trying to access services.  There are certain difficulties in terms of entitlements and financial barriers.  Access to mental health services very much depends on entitlement to access HSE services.  This is a function of the type of legal status a person has.  Persons with precarious legal status cannot rely on services provided by the State, while undocumented persons may not access mental health services.</p><p> There are also barriers arising from language and the provision of culturally appropriate services.  We have identified a lack of interpretation services and intercultural training as a barrier in accessing mental health services.  This amplifies the sense of stigma and shame which might be linked with poor mental health outcomes and having the need for mental health services.  This is prevalent in all cultures, but in certain ones it is more relevant.</p><p> The other points relate to specific categories of migrant with which we work.  The first is the victims of human trafficking.  MRCI specialises in the provision of services and representation for victims of trafficking for forced labour, although we can relate it to other forms of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation.  Victims of trafficking have often experienced different traumas and may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.  When referred to our national referral mechanism, they are provided with a health programme that is limited to physical health.  There is a dedicated anti-human trafficking service within the HSE, but it does not offer counselling services or more specialised mental health services.  Among the victims we support, we noted their need for mental health services.  They requested such services on a number of occasions, but they were not provided with them.  On a number of occasions they were referred to mainstream mental health services, which have long waiting periods which leads to re-traumatisation while they are involved in a process of reflection and recovery.  On a number of occasions the lack of immigration status or financial means presented a barrier and, more often than not, their needs were not met.  The mental health needs of victims of human trafficking are quite specific because of the experience of trauma and violence that could be associated with it.  Certain needs are akin or similar to the needs of those who experience torture.  We need to look at the provision of special counselling services for those who have undergone the experience of human trafficking.</p><p> I will ask Ms Rashimi to speak about the mental health needs of undocumented migrants.  For those not familiar with the issue of irregular migration in Ireland, the MRCI survey, Ireland is Home, estimates that there are between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented migrants in the State.  There are up to a further 6,000 undocumented children.  In MRCI we have developed support networks for both undocumented adults and young people.</p></speech>

Growing up is hard on everyone.  Particular challenges come from being from an immigrant background and being different.  Growing up undocumented brings its own set of challenges to a sense of self and well-being.  My fellow members of Young, Paperless and Powerful, a youth group set up by MRCI for undocumented young people, agree that there are challenges in accessing mental health care about which practitioners and policy makers need to know.  I am sure the committee agrees that no young person should have to grow up with the weight of the world on his or her shoulders, a reality that hangs over someone's head every day in every relationship.  Growing up undocumented means that fear becomes part and parcel of a person's daily life in dealings with the State, health care services and schools.  If someone finds the resources to be able to sit down in front of a mental health care practitioner, he or she cannot mention his or her legal status because of a fear about the consequences.  This undermines the healing process and the positive impact counselling and therapy could have.  Growing up undocumented means that it is impossible to plan for the future and live the life we want.  From the youngest age, the future is deeply uncertain.  Progressing to third level education is unlikely because of the fees and paperwork barriers involved.  Employment options are very limited and someone must settle for the work he or she can manage to find.  That is a far cry from young people's aspirations and capabilities.</p><p>This has a hugely negative effect on a person's well-being, sense of self-worth, self-esteem and confidence.  It is also a huge loss in human potential.</p></speech>

We cluster our recommendations in four groups.  The list has been given to the committee.  The first looks at building the capacity of migrant minority ethnic groups by implementing specific programmes addressing stigma but it also looks at awareness raising and specific training for health providers to work with minority ethnic groups and migrants.  I refer also to improving access to mental health services by ensuring cost is not a barrier, particularly at the intersection of low pay and migration.</p> <p>  Providing interpretation services and cultural mediation programmes is another of our recommendations, as is increasing the accreditation of mental health practitioners from other countries and minority ethnic groups.  We also looked at introducing specialised services for victims of human trafficking.  This is also applicable to undocumented migrants to ensure legal status is not a barrier for anyone needing to access services, be it young people or adults.</p> <p>  As cross-committee recommendations,  we would like to see a recognition that irregular status can produce poor mental health outcomes.  There is a recommendation for the Government to implement the recommendation of the Committee on Justice and Equality for the introduction of a regularisation scheme for undocumented migrants, as well as the recommendation from the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for the introduction of a regularisation scheme for undocumented children, young people and their families.</p></speech>

I have been there for two years.  I have also been a member of the Government's task force on youth mental health and I am on the oversight of the Government's LGBTI+ youth strategy.  Much of my work over the past two years has been focused on the mental health and well-being of LGBTI young people in Ireland.  Dylan Donohue is with me today.  He is a 16 year old person from IndividualiTy, which is our Dublin-based transgender youth group.  He has a particular interest in the mental health and well-being of young transgender people in Ireland, and has recently won a prize at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition for his work in this area.</p> <p>  BeLonG To works with about 150 young people over a fortnight through our Dublin flagship service.  We also support a network of more than 30 LGBTI youth groups throughout the country, co-hosted with some of the national youth groups such as For&oacute;ige, Crosscare and Youth Work Ireland.  We run anti-bullying campaigns like Stand Up, which is the largest anti-bullying in secondary schools in Ireland.  It addresses some of the root causes of the harm done to young people's mental health and well-being in schools. </p> <p>  Our services are holistic.  We recognise LGBTI is just one part of a young person's identity.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland and Pavee Point because our LGBTI young migrants, immigrants and Travellers experience sometimes double or triple stigma because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  We provide an array of services.  Youth work is very important for LGBTI young people, as is peer-to-peer support.  Our Monday chat service is a one-to-one non-counselling support service for young people.  We are running a pilot with Pieta House where counselling is provided free of charge to young people who are self-harming or experiencing suicidal ideation.  Another aspect of our role is running mental health training courses for mental health professionals in partnership with Jigsaw.</p> <p>  In our youth groups, mental health workshops for young people are mandatory.  We run them in each quarter throughout the year.  To give the committee some context, since the marriage equality referendum, we have seen over a 100% increase in the number of young people coming into our service.  I think that is because they feel accepted and recognised.  However, many of the young people coming to us come because they are experiencing a crisis.  Many LGBTI young people will never come into our service because, thankfully, they have loving supportive families and communities.  They have come out and are happy in themselves.  However, for those who do come into our service, very often they require a good deal of support to come to terms with who they are and to come out to their parents and in their schools.</p> <p>  We have also surveyed the young people who use our services regularly on a needs analysis.  Mental health issues come up repeatedly as the number one issue.  That is not surprising.  Many in the room already know about the LGBTI Ireland report published last year.  It was paid for by the National Office of Suicide Prevention, which generously supports us, especially our mental health work and the work we do throughout the national network.  It found that, in comparison with the My World national youth mental health study, LGBTI young people have three times the level of self-harm, experienced three times the level of attempted suicide and are four times more likely to experience severe or extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression.</p> <p>  Among LGBTI young people aged between 14 and 18, 56% have self-harmed and 70% have had suicidal thoughts.  One in three has attempted suicide.  That is something our youth workers are dealing with on the front line every day in our youth groups.  A very strong link was found between a young person having experienced LGBTI-based bullying and serious mental health difficulties.  We knew this anecdotally but the report was able to prove the link.  One in four have missed or skipped school to avoid negative treatment due to being LGBTI.  Those who have experienced this bullying have much higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol and drugs misuse.  They are also more likely to self-harm and have suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>  Some of the challenges we recognise belong to them.  The usual problems accessing mental health services for young people in Ireland such as waiting lists and gaps in primary health care affect LGBTI young people throughout the country as well.  However, the added barriers and challenges are the lack of awareness or understanding or capacity among some mental health care professionals who have not had the training or are not aware of the particular needs or situations experienced by LGBTI young people in Ireland.</p> <p>  We have a particular problem with transgender young people accessing mental health services, and Dylan may speak more about this, but this is something that is urgent.  To access health care and legal gender recognition, transgender young people must get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.  In practice, because there is no one else in the country able to do this at the moment, this means they are pushed into the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, pipeline.  They are sometimes waiting 18 months to two years to access that service depending on where they are living in the country.  The CAMHS service is one for acutely unwell young people.  Some of these transgender young people are not experiencing acute mental health illnesses.  However, this is the only pathway they have to get this diagnosis so they can access health care or legal gender recognition.  The stress of waiting, as can be imagined, can mean that if they did not have mental health problems at the beginning of the process, they may end up having them after such a wait.</p><p>Young people in BeLongG To have told us how, even after accessing CAMHS, that health professionals ask them what they are doing accessing the service.  They tell them that they are not suicidal or self-harming, and then send them back out without the diagnosis that they need.  Sometimes the professionals do not have the capacity or the training and the young person never receives the health care they need.  It is very urgent.  I understand that the HSE is looking into developing a specialist unit in Ireland that could provide a wrap-around psychosocial service to young transgender people that would provide them with all the services they need in their health care, mental health care and so on.  It is urgent that this would be made available to them as soon as possible.</p><p> We know that the causes of mental ill health among LGBTI young people are not because they are LGBTI.  We know from the report that this is related to stigma, which unfortunately remains in Ireland despite the significant progress in areas such as marriage equality and gender recognition.  We know it relates to fear of rejection, social exclusion and bullying.  We know that this is happening in our schools, communities and even in some of our homes, despite significant progress being made recently.  We also know that there is not enough resourcing or investment in early intervention and prevention or primary care that would deal with some of the speed bumps in the road that LGBTI young people encounter and that may have an adverse affect on their mental well-being.  If those are not in place early enough, by the time that they come into us they are already in crisis, and we must refer them on to an already overburdened system where sometimes they cannot access the care that they require.</p><p> One major barrier to young LGBTI people accessing mental health care is the requirement for parental consent for 16 and 17 year olds.  This affects all young people, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.  In the case of LGBTI people who are not out to their parents because they are unready or because their parents may not be supportive of their sexual orientation or gender identity, this could pose significant harm to their mental health and well-being if they come out.  We see this very much as a barrier.  I know it is being looked at in the review of the Mental Health Act.  It is something we see as a significant barrier for young LGBTI people.</p><p> Among the things we suggest might help the mental health and well-being of LGBTI young people are the removal of the requirement of consent for 16 and 17 year olds and the introduction of the UK-style Gillick principles whereby when a young person wants to access mental health care supports and treatment, the health care professional can deem whether he or she has the capacity to consent to that treatment.  We also suggest LGBTI-proofing policies, procedures and practices within the mental health care system.  Information and awareness training should be increased so that there is increased capacity among mental health care professionals to provide the supports and services that are required to meet the specific needs of LGBTI young people.  Funding should also be increased to youth organisations which undertake this often life-saving LGBTI youth work at the early intervention and prevention stage.</p><p> I will now hand over to Dylan in case there is anything he wishes to add.</p></speech>

A trans-specific clinic must be established in Ireland for transpeople across the country.  CAMHS does not have the space for transpeople to go through its system and it does not have the specialists.  Psychologists in mental health services need to be aware of how to handle having a transperson using their services.  For instance, when I went to CAMHS I was called by the wrong name and pronouns the whole time and staff continued to do so when they referred me on to the gender identity clinic.  Waiting lists for CAMHS and other mental health services are really wrong, and having waited, many people are then told that CAMHS cannot do anything for them, that they do not know how to handle a transperson.  Many transpersons are under the impression that going to CAMHS and similar places will give a gender dysphoria diagnosis which will allow them to go on and get treatment and so on.  That is not how it works but they are not told that they need to go further than CAMHS to get a gender dysphoria diagnosis.  Transpeople are thrown around the system until someone decides finally to deal with us.</p></speech>

I am also an Irish Traveller.  Pavee Point Traveller and Roma centre has been working to challenge racism and promote Traveller and Roma inclusion in Ireland since 1985.  The organisation works from a community development perspective and promotes the realisation of human rights and equality for Travellers and Roma in Ireland.  The organisation is comprised of Travellers, Roma and members of the majority population who work together in partnership to address the needs of Travellers and Roma as minority ethnic groups experiencing exclusion, marginalisation and racism.  Working for social justice, solidarity and human rights, the central aim of Pavee Point is to contribute to improvement in the quality of life and living circumstances of Travellers and Roma.  This includes targeted resources and recruitment to ensure access to effective, equitable and respectful quality mental health care and services.<br/><br/>I and my colleague, Ms Brigid Quirke, are delighted to have the opportunity to make this presentation to the committee.  While we thank the committee for including Travellers and Roma in its discussion today, we would like to note that we have been invisible thus far.  We urge the committee to take our recommendations on board and ensure that we are explicitly included in the committee's final report.<br/><br/>We welcome the commitment of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to re-establishing the Traveller health advisory committee and the development of the new Traveller health action plan based on the findings of the all-Ireland Traveller health study.  We urge the committee to prioritise these actions and ring-fence a budget for their implementation as a matter of urgency.<br/><br/>Given the limited time and the complexities of the issues we wish to highlight, we will focus explicitly on Travellers today.  However, we would encourage the committee to examine the mental health needs of the Roma community at a later stage in its deliberations.  We have copies of the national Roma needs assessment for members' consideration and our Roma colleagues would welcome further discussion on the mental health findings and key recommendations.<br/><br/>There are approximately 40,000 Travellers in Ireland, accounting for less than 1% of the total population.  Were the entire population of Travellers to sit in Croke Park, it would fill less than half the stadium.  Our recommendations here are practical, feasible and, if implemented, could have a real impact on Traveller's health.  Last year Traveller ethnicity was officially acknowledged by the State.  Travellers throughout the country celebrated and welcomed this announcement.  However, the harsh reality is that Travellers still experience challenges which include discrimination, exclusion, poverty, poor quality of education, lack of employment opportunities, and lack of accommodation which leads to overcrowding which is seven times higher than the settled population.  Added to this, there are approximately 2,000 Travellers on the roadside without basic facilities, which means no toilets, running water or electricity.  These are members' constituents and the people that they represent.  In 2018, this is something that we expect in a developing country, not a rich, developed nation like our country.  Traveller health inequalities are well-documented, with the all-Ireland Traveller health study findings indicating that Traveller health is comparable with the levels found in the settled population of the 1940s.  This means that Traveller men are living 15 years less than settled men and Traveller women are living 11 years less than settled women.  The mortality rates among Traveller men is four times higher.</p><p>The rate of mortality of Traveller women is three times higher than that of women in the settled community, and that of infants, or children under one year of age, is four times higher.  The evidence indicates that Travellers are dying at much higher rates at all ages and across genders, with 97% of Travellers not living to their 65th birthday.  Coupled with the experience of discrimination on a daily basis, this leads to poor mental health.  Travellers have worse mental health outcomes than any other group in the country, which is why they have been prioritised in policy documents such as Connecting for Life and A Vision For Change.  However, they have experienced no change on the ground.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study found that 60% of Travellers reported their mental health in the preceding 30 days as not good, compared with 20% of the settled population.</p><p> The rate of suicide among Travellers is six times higher than among the settled population and accounts for approximately 11% of all Traveller deaths.  Last year, I attended the funeral of a Traveller man who had committed suicide and there spoke to another Traveller who pointed out that we no longer make any wonder of it when a Traveller commits suicide because it is so common in our community.  That would rightly be totally unacceptable in any other community and mine should be no different.  If we had access to the same resources and services as the settled population, the outcomes would be better.  We can do better for Travellers and they deserve that.</p><p> To do so, we must address the issues experienced by Travellers when engaging with services, including acknowledging that they are sometimes treated with a lack of respect and dignity, by which over 40% of Travellers were concerned.  Over 50% of Travellers worried about experiencing unfair treatment and had concerns about the quality of care they received, and 40% of Travellers experienced direct discrimination in accessing health services.  Some 70% of service providers agreed with those findings and suggested that Travellers receive substandard services because of their ethnicity.  We are not making this up.  These are findings from the all-Ireland Traveller health study.</p><p> As noted in our submission, Traveller health has not received any new moneys since 2008.  We welcome the launch of the current policy on Travellers, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy 2017-2021.  It was developed by Traveller organisations in partnership with the Department of Justice and Equality and we have widely endorsed it.  However, no recommendations can be implemented without a budget and there is no budget attached to the strategy, which adds to the ongoing frustration for Travellers as there is little evidence of progress.  The Traveller primary health care projects funded by the HSE are of benefit to Travellers.  The study states that 83% of Travellers receive their health information from these projects, which are a lifeline for my community.  They must be resourced and seen as an investment by the State.</p><p> Active Traveller consultation, participation and proofing of any further development of services, policies and strategies is required, and this must be must be resourced, monitored and evaluated.  The committee has received our detailed submission which includes clear recommendations regarding access, recruitment and funding.  However, in the interests of brevity, we wish to highlight two overarching recommendations.  In terms of ensuring a robust, evidence-informed service, we must prioritise the implementation of the ethnic identifier across all primary mental health services to monitor equality of access, participation and outcomes to suicide prevention and mental health services for Travellers, Roma and other priority groups.  As regards working in partnership with Travellers, nothing should be done about us without us.  There must be an engagement and effort to work in partnership with Traveller organisations and primary health care Traveller projects comprising peer-led, culturally appropriate projects to develop and deliver a positive mental health awareness and suicide prevention campaign.  These structures have existed for at least 15 years, with 30 projects operating nationally.  Ten such projects are ongoing in community health care organisation, CHO, areas 6, 7, and 9, in which I work, and I was disappointed to be in the Gallery a few weeks ago while the chief officers giving evidence failed to acknowledge Travellers and-or the work of these projects which they fund and operate in partnership with us.</p><p> We urge the committee to recommend strongly the implementation and resourcing of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy without delay.  The re-establishment of the Traveller health advisory committee is crucial and must be implemented as a matter of urgency.  Travellers are dying and we cannot understand the lack of progress on the ground.  The question that must be addressed is whether the reason for the lack of progress is political.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend and for listening to our presentation.

I will ask my questions quickly in order that the witnesses have time to respond.  I thank them for their presentations and commend them on the valuable work they do.  I offer Dylan my congratulations on his recent success in the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.</p> <p>  As the Chair stated, we have heard further regrettable evidence of how the poor and marginalised are last in the queue for crucial services, which is shameful for us as a country.</p> <p>  My first questions are to Mr. Rojas Coppari or Ms Rashmi.  A Vision For Change states that no one can achieve true mental heath recovery without having a meaning to life and access to employment.  What has been the toll or impact of the years that so many in direct provision centres have been deprived of the right to work and the dignity of earning an independent income?  Has there been an increase in mental illness among those who have been deprived of that right or are there any data in that regard?  Those who have managed to make their way from war-torn countries are highly likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Are any mental health providers given specific treatment to support such people or specific training to support victims of human trafficking?</p> <p>  What is being done in regard to language barriers?  There have been reports of children interpreting for migrant parents who present for medical attention.  Is that happening in respect of mental health services?  If so, that is highly inappropriate and would cause huge stress for the child and for the parent who requires the child to interpret.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Coppari or Mr. Reilly know if training workshops are available for psychologists and psychotherapists to acquaint them with the unique and intrinsic cultures of minority groups whose members may seek therapy?  What culturally inclusive training is being delivered to mental health providers?</p> <p>  The 2012 HSE intercultural strategy stated the need for an ethnic identifier for service users, but Mr. Reilly in his submission highlighted that is still not standard, which I presume makes managing or determining outcomes very difficult.  Without knowing those outcomes, how difficult is it to tailor supports for people from the Traveller community or minority backgrounds and to ensure that staff are trained to meet their specific needs?  What funding is allocated to mental health supports for the Traveller community, migrant groups and LGBTI groups on an annual basis?  Do we have data outlining the exact funding in that regard?</p> <p>  I recently spoke to Ms Geraldine Dunne, the managing director of Southside Travellers Action Group in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, to ask her about the needs of the community in that area.  She mentioned the lack of supports for teenagers and youths, which, unsurprisingly and regrettably, is an issue of huge concern.  In the opinion of Mr. Reilly or Ms Quirke, how could that best be addressed?</p><p>I do not understand why a representative of the Traveller community was not on the youth mental health task force.  The witness said that this was sought on several occasions.  Therefore, what reason was given?  It beggars belief.  I do not understand why there was no representative and would like to know the exact reason given.  How was that explained?</p><p> Many of my questions arise from Dylan's and Ms Griffith's project.  As a former teacher, I am wondering what training for teachers is in place with regard to gender and LGBTI sensitivities.  Dylan's project refers to a number of surveys but one shows that 20% of the 277 people surveyed stated that their teachers did not use the correct name or pronoun.  Was that a case of the teacher choosing not to use it?  Was it that the teacher said that he or she would not use the preferred pronoun?  If so, it needs to be addressed.  Have the witnesses any ideas on how it can be addressed?  It is not acceptable.</p><p> Has BelongTo approached the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals on how schools can develop policies relating to LGBTI students for staff?  What has been the response?  Is anything being developed?</p><p> Am I doing okay with the clock?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Quirke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018021400002#G00300"><p>I will recap to ensure that we have them all.  There was a question on the ethnic identifier.  It is true that there was a national Traveller health strategy for 2002 to 2005.  The inclusion of the ethnic identifier was recommended and we piloted it at that stage.  From 2002 to 2018, it has been 16 years.  Following a successful pilot with a 100% response rate, it was to be mainstreamed but we are still waiting for it to be mainstreamed.  With the arrival of new communities, the ethnic identifiers are really more urgent.  The Deputy is correct that we cannot disaggregate data or identify where are the gaps, particularly on quality of access, participation and outcome.  It is clear that minority communities need additional inputs in terms of positive duty and ensuring the same outcomes to services.  We are not all born equal, starting at an equal point, so we need that affirmative action.  Subgroups have been established and it has been reinforced in the national Traveller and Roma strategy.  We have been involved ourselves.  The NGOs have taken on its piloting and the rolling out because the State was not doing it.  We now work with Pobal, the prison service and some of the hospitals.  We go out and do the training and the identification.  We encourage them that it is possible and can be done.  The NGOs have been driving it and we are now hoping that it will be mainstreamed.</p> <p>  In its absence, we have the all-Ireland Traveller health study which is an extensive study done over three years.  A total of &euro;1.5 million was spent by the Department of Health to find out the exact needs of Travellers.  It has very specific detail and there are four reports and five volumes of data which still have not been accessed or utilised.  We were given to understand that it would be turned into a Traveller health strategy.  The previous one was not implemented because there was no data.  Now we have data and they tell us there are no resources.  It is, therefore, a very frustrating experience on the ground.</p> <p>  On infrastructure, the 30 Traveller primary health care projects are really good.  We set out our own health data collection system.  We try to document where there are barriers to services.  In lieu of official data being collected, we collect data at local level to try to ensure that we maintain that knowledge.  It is urgent and critical because only then can we see the barriers.  We can see if there has been an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of services.  In terms of resources, we can also see whether money is being spent in the right places, having an impact and creating the outcomes that would benefit everyone.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about youth in terms of speaking to our colleagues in Southside Travellers Action Group.  The youth programme at Pavee Point has been closed down.  The funding was cut back.  During the recession, as the committee will be aware, a lot of Traveller organisations, NGOs and community organisations disproportionately lost a lot more resources.  For example, education was a priority.  I was part of the study team in UCD and the study stated that, if there was only one recommendation to address Travellers' health, it would be to invest all our money in education because improving opportunities for people is the key to creating change.  The study was launched in September but 85% of the Traveller budget was cut in the budget and we have yet to get it back.  Therefore, the home work clubs, visiting teachers and all the things that were helping to retain Travellers in school in terms of progression to secondary school were gone.  Again, that is critical.  The Deputy is right that there are social determinants to mental health and health inequalities and we have to address those, including accommodation and education.  </p> <p>  I do not have figures on the specific budget on mental health.  It is done through the primary health care projects.  Each of them would have mental health initiatives.  There is one new initiative to be considered through the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, which was employing nine Traveller-specific mental health workers.  I think they are doing interviews this week.  We are not too sure that that is the panacea.  Our issue is that the projects on the ground are recognising people but the issue is the mapping.  That has come up in a lot of services and was often raised during the committee's deliberations when I was reading over them.  People do not know where to go and where are the services.  In particular, suicide is falling between the two.  The mental health services say it is nothing to do with them because it is not a mental health problem as the people are not diagnosed with a mental health problem and that it is the responsibility of primary care.  Primary care does not have the capacity to deal with it, however.  We have written case studies on this.  We spent a whole weekend telephoning 30 NGOs and the National Office for Suicide Prevention but no one was available.  I was with a person who was suicidal and, when I asked if we could go to accident and emergency, I was asked by the people there if she had cut her wrists.  I was told that she needs to have done something.  I asked if we could go in if I asked her to cut her wrists.  It is a ridiculous system. </p> <p>  We have applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, and safeTALK and it is fine to train people but they have nowhere to refer people to.  Mr. Reilly is chair of the mental health subgroup and we have been trying for the past eight years to do mapping and signposting so that we could find out.  Even people within the service, however, do not know where one is supposed to go.  To me, it is an urgent matter that the committee might consider further.  I understand it was raised earlier.</p> <p>  We do not have a specific budget as part of others.  Other work is about us going into a service telling it to be more Traveller-specific.  In terms of training, we run culturally appropriate training such as workshops that are Traveller-specific on culture and how services can be proofed and made more appropriate.  We offer this to services but we cannot make them take the training.  We cannot go to psychologists or psychiatrists and say they need training.  They come and say they need training.  We can suggest that it is needed by all providers.  That is one of our recommendations on training.  We are prepared to deliver-----</p></speech>

For us to go around and make the whole country anti-racist is impossible.  It would go on forever.  The positive duty that has been introduced switched the burden of responsibility from NGOs trying to prove inequality and discrimination to the State trying to prove that it is providing equitable and fair services.

That is the only one that examines the issue specifically.  Barriers in accessing employment and services will certainly have an impact on the mental health outcomes of different migrant communities.  The right to work for asylum seekers and their experience of direct provision will have an impact on asylum seekers and direct provision residents.  The MRCI does not work directly with asylum seekers and those in the asylum system.  There are strong parallels in the experiences of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers.</p><p>The point is not to compare groups but to draw parallels.  We know that undocumented migrants do not have the right to work.  There are 4,500 residents in direct provision but the number of undocumented migrants ranges from 20,000 to 26,000.  They do not have the right to work, housing is not provided for them and they do not have access to any services, such as medical services.</p><p> What undocumented migrants lack is visibility.  People do not know the extent of undocumented migrants, because there are no dedicated reception centres for undocumented migrants.  There is no champion for undocumented migrants and they are completely invisible in both policy and political rhetoric.  There is no politician championing the issue of undocumented migrants.  That is borne out in what Rashmi said.  Isolation and lack of visibility increases the problem of access to employment, services and poverty, together with other migrant communities.</p><p> There are dedicated services for people who experience torture and who are in the asylum system.  Spirasi is the main provider of training and services for those who have experienced torture.  I am not able to say how much that is in the mainstream of the health service, but there is no similar dedicated service for those who are victims of human trafficking.  Obviously sexual trauma can be related to those who experience torture and other forms of exploitation but there are also differences between one and the other.  That is something that can be modelled in a training programme.  </p><p> There is a problem with interpreting foreign languages across services, not just in the provision of health services.  The Health Service Executive has a clear policy on interpreting services but the implementation of that policy is still failing.  Examples of children interpreting what their parents are saying is probably true when the parent is at the doctor but it is certainly true for people going to the social welfare office or in the school system.  The positive element is that the integration strategy acknowledges there is an obligation on the different Departments that provide services to migrant communities to signpost what type of interpreter is available and how people can access that service.  If we live up to the standards of the integration strategy, this will improve.  There is certainly a gap in that at present.  </p><p> Last week we heard about a victim of trafficking who has very poor English.  When he accessed services, he was told he did not belong because he still cannot speak English having been in the country for 12 years.  Not only is there a lack of services, but people experience racism and discrimination and do not always have access to the services of an interpreter when seeking to have their needs met.</p></speech>

From speaking to other transgender people, I would say that in nine out of ten cases, teachers refusing to call them the correct name or use the correct pronoun just do not understand how detrimental it can be to the students' mental health to call them by the wrong name or use the wrong pronoun.</p></speech>

I welcome the visitors in the Gallery.  Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari mentioned stigma in his presentation.  While it may be thought that stigma is diminishing, I have always said that stigma has been attached to mental health and suicide since day one.  When Rashmi was speaking I could hear his life experience and the battles in his voice.  I commend him for that.</p> <p>  Ms Griffith referred to wrap around services, but she will have a very long wait because the services in the country are deplorable at present.  We have looked at the staffing issues, but the system is not working.  As a committee our role is to improve services but I fear that there are no services in the middle.</p> <p>  I love Dylan's frankness and I commend him for his honesty.  I remember watching a documentary in which Dylan appeared with his mother.  It is the witnesses who have the life experience and information to inspire the members of the committee.  We need to learn from them to try to facilitate everybody.</p> <p>  It is great to be invited into somebody's back garden and I thank Mr. Reilly for that invitation.  I would love to visit that health care project and see the bottom up approach to services.  We have been speaking about services being provided from the bottom up not from the top down.  We need to listen to the people who have experience of the service.</p> <p>  Stigma is a recurring theme, with bullying and discrimination.  Today it was reported in the British media that a nine year old boy died by suicide from intensive bullying in school.  We have brought this to the attention of the committee.  I was a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  This is about education.  We need to educate people from their youth to middle age.  If we listen to the older people, they will educate us.  I congratulate the witness and say well done to them.</p></speech>

It is hard to quantify stigma; it is intangible.  That is the major difficulty with stigma.  It is hard to write about the scale of stigma.  Much work has been done and it has been talked about, yet it is still prevalent.  We need to be mindful of that.  I picked up on it in Dylan's contribution.  Does he believe that the stigma he experiences is the result of the specific case he brought or does he feel that in his age group the stigma of mental health issues exists across the board?  Does he think the stigma that he experienced and spoke about is equal to or greater than the stigma attaching to mental health?</p></speech>

We are talking about stigma, discrimination and so on.  As a matter of fact, it is not only minority groups that face such difficulties; there are professions within every sector - the education sector and whatever else - in which people with jobs come to bad periods in life, put up their hands and are then punished for telling the truth.  That must also be noted.  I have come even across such cases involving people working in the education sector.</p></speech>

As there is a specialist service that can deal with the matter, it is less that people are pathologised for being trans.  I do not think it is about that; it is just that there is no service available.  Therefore, what the HSE is looking at and what we are calling for to be prioritised is the provision of such a service that could be provided in a hospital, for example, the children's hospital in Crumlin which has a small clinic, to which people from the Tavistock clinic come.  It is now under threat because of Brexit, which is another urgent reason we need an indigenous clinic in Ireland that can work with transgender young people in order that they will not have to visit acute mental health care services.  Some of the children involved do not have mental health issues; they just need access to the clinic to be able to receive treatment, perhaps hormone blockers or whatever it is that they require, and in order that they will not be taking up spaces in the system and will have quicker access to services, including the health care services they need.  Furthermore, the reason this is so urgent is that young people can come to us at or before puberty and may have socially transitioned, been living in their preferred gender for a number of years and may want to prevent puberty from happening.  If they have already been living socially transitioned, going through puberty can have a devastating impact on their mental health and well-being.  They cannot access the hormone blockers they need until they have gone through this system with CAMHS; therefore, they could be waiting two years.</p></speech>

I will give the figures and Mr. Reilly will then say something.  </p> <p>  The all-Ireland Traveller health study asked whether people had issues in accessing services.  The figures relate to utilisation of all health services.  A total of 40% which is quite significant were not always treated with respect or dignity; 50% had concerns about the quality of care provided, while over 40% faced direct discrimination.  These compare with figures in international studies of 17% for black Americans and 14% for Latin Americans; therefore, they are incredibly high.</p></speech>

When it comes to accessing services, what I hear is that they are not meeting Travellers where they are at.  Travellers have low levels of educational attainment; things like filling in forms and reading and writing can be enough to make them walk away.  We must be respectful and mindful that what might work for one community might not work for another.  As the primary health care and mental health care workers throughout Ireland, these are the things we are trying to do to work with the services to help them to identify this.  I will give a brief example.  I know a Traveller man whose postman had issues in entering his site.  As a result, he was missing hospital appointments.  As far as the hospital was concerned, he was not turning up.  It is these things that are missed and we are there to highlight them.  It was not the case that the Traveller man had not bothered to turn up; it was just that the postman would not enter the site because there were too many dogs or he did not want to do so.  We are still living with that experience today.  There are sites all across Ireland that still have it today and we are trying to highlight it for services.</p></speech>

I have two specific questions, one of which is for Ms Griffith.  </p> <p>  On the age of consent, someone must be 18 years to facilitate the relevant mental health services.  If it were 16 years, what difference would it make?  Has legislation been tabled in this D&aacute;il in that regard?  I am not sure whether it has been.</p> <p>  My other question is for Mr. Reilly and concerns the incidence of suicide among Travellers.  I heard the statistic referred to last year and it is beyond shocking.  Sometimes words do not say enough.  It is a black and white issue and has a real impact on the reality for the Traveller community.  This is probably a simplification, but if there was one thing that could challenge what is going on in the Traveller community, particularly the incidence of suicide, what would it be?  What would Mr. Reilly try to change?</p></speech>

As I said, they would be unacceptable among any other community.  To answer the question, there is not just one thing I would change.  Looking at the range of social determinants, if someone has a poor education, he or she will have poor work.  If someone has no work and no money coming in, he or she will have a poor lifestyle.  We really must look across the board.  All of the determinants play a part and link with one another.  We see families who are living from week to week on their budgets.  They are only trying to survive on what they have.  It is not just one issue; it is a matter of looking across the board at accommodation, education, employment and health which all play a significant part in the incidence of suicide among Travellers.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Quirke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018021400002#J02300"><p>Discrimination is also a factor.  It takes many forms - direct, indirect and institutional.  Again, as Mr. Reilly said, services are designed for the majority population and assume a level of literacy, education, income capacity and transport which excludes people at the margins.  However, this is done without intent.  That is where one needs to develop proper proofing mechanisms to Traveller-proof services and policies to make them inclusive.  Discrimination is insidious and impacting on young people.  We have a very high suicide rate among youth.  One can imagine the level of self-esteem of young people if they are called names and not recognised and their culture is not supported or endorsed.  We learn to be confident of our history as Irish people in going through school, but if someone goes through school without being acknowledged, he or she is made to feel he or she has to deny his or her identity, as many Travellers do.  This has an effect.  Traveller culture is in transition.  This puts a lot of pressure on young people.  Discrimination is across the board and part of the social determinants.</p></speech>

Will she talk us through, literally step by step, what someone with a mental health issue and who is undocumented does?  Does he or she go to a GP or what happens?</p><p>I cannot speak for everyone but it would be the normal process of going to a GP and being referred on to a counsellor or a mental health care practitioner.  It is an issue, however, that at every single point - no matter where - a person cannot disclose his or her illegal status.  A person cannot disclose it to his or her doctor or to the counsellor.</p></speech>

It is something we feel that we cannot share with someone.  If an undocumented person is in the sort of space where he or she might want to open up to another person there is this thing over his or her head.  It affects us because we cannot talk about it and it undermines the whole process of being there.</p></speech>

This is determined by the HSE by the type of legal status that a person has in the country.  Whereas mental health and physical health providers have the discretion to overlook the fact that a person does not have legal status in the country and to continue providing health services - and luckily a lot of them still do - they can refuse.  There are certain services where the discretion can no longer be applied and people can no longer be referred in to the service because they do not have the correct immigration status and so on.  There is also the risk of incurring extra costs because if one does not have full access to the health system, as would a full resident, then a person could end up getting billed.  As Ms. Rashimi has said, a lot of people do not disclose their undocumented status and a proper diagnosis cannot be ascertained.</p></speech>

In theory one can consent to having plastic surgery but not consent to accessing a counsellor or mental health treatment.  This is a huge disparity.  If access was standardised it would benefit young people and health care professionals.  If everyone knew that at 16 years old a young person can consent to whatever health care they need, that would help.</p> <p>  It would make a big difference in the case of young LGBTI people because there are very young people who are being prevented from accessing mental health care services, some of which are youth friendly, free and open to other young people, such as Jigsaw and Pieta House.  These facilities still cannot open up their services to young people under the age of 18 without parental consent.  Some of these young people are most vulnerable because they are not out to their parents or the parents themselves have mental health issues, addiction problems or are not available to give the consent.  Standardising the age of consent for mental health services to the age of 16 would make it easier for these very vulnerable young people to access health care.  It would also clear up this vagueness and grey area for health care professionals.</p></speech>

I believe this makes absolute sense because health care professionals will say that some 14 year olds have much more capacity and are way more mature than some 19 year olds.  It is quite artificial having an age as a limit and indicator of a person's capacity to consent to treatment.  It is really about the individual and should be determined case by case.</p></speech>

The purpose of this committee is to look at the challenges of mental health in Ireland.  It is clear that some groups have many more challenges than others and are suffering and experiencing mental health issues disproportionately.  The representatives today have spelled it out, in particular the striking presentation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, about the situation of people who have been subjected to human trafficking.  The representatives have noted that the HSE team does not have the capacity to provide mental health services and that victims face difficulties in accessing mainstream services.  The committee could make the specific recommendation very clearly that those teams supporting people experiencing human trafficking should have access to mental health services as a right.</p> <p>  Rashimi spoke very eloquently about the issues facing people because of the undocumented status, and for the committee to support recommendations from other committees and from the UN to regularise people's situations.</p> <p>  The BeLonG To report was also very striking.  It compared the wider population of young people in Ireland and LGBTI young people had two times the level of self-harm, three times the level of attempted suicide and four times the level of severe or extremely severe stress, anxiety or depression.  These are very arresting statistics and we as a committee must pay attention to them when making our recommendations.</p> <p>  I congratulate Dylan.  I have met him before when we spoke in the Seanad, along with his mother Kirsty.  I thank him for the very eloquent performance.</p> <p>  The Traveller suicide and mental health statistics continue to shock.  We read them over and over again and nothing seems to be happening.  In the committee's recommendations and reports we have to send a very strong message about this.  I shall read them in to the record again because I believe it is really important: the Traveller suicide rate is six times higher than the settled population and suicide is seven times higher for Traveller men and five times higher for Traveller women than in the wider population.  Another shocking statistic is that 97% of Travellers die before their 65th birthday.  This being tolerated in a country as prosperous as Ireland is nothing short of shameful.  There are only 40,000 Travellers in the State.  This is not a problem, an issue or a challenge that we should not be able to reach.</p> <p>  I am also struck by the links with education.  I recently submitted a Commencement Matter to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Only 167 people from the Traveller community have ever gone to third level education.  All of these things are interconnected.  I am especially interested in the Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre's advocacy for the primary health care Traveller projects and how important they have been.  This committee can make sure that its recommendations puts those projects on a secure footing.  I am aware, for example, that every year the project in Cork lurches from one financial crisis to another and is dependent on what is left over in the social inclusion budget.  This was not mentioned by any of the community health care organisations when they came in, yet this is a critical lifeline to a community that is dying on its feet in every which way - mental health and otherwise.</p> <p>  We hear you.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris will appear before the committee in a couple of weeks.  If there is anything that I have not said, or if there is anything the representatives would like us to say to the Minister, will they please put it on the record before they leave the committee today?</p></speech>

We had 40 primary health care projects; ten have closed down due to lack of funding.  One issue is that a lot of the women work part-time because the projects engage many of them.  Now, because of the changes in the minimum wage, the hours are being reduced.  We are trying to see if their roles could be protected because they are making a contribution to the State.</p><p>We would appreciate some support around those issues.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has agreed to re-establish the national Traveller health advisory committee, which produced the strategy.  The new action plan for the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, NTRIS, is obviously very important, but plans like this must be resourced.  The Traveller health strategy, which was produced in 2002, had no resources.  The recommendations there are still valid but were never implemented.  We want an assurance that there will be implementation of strategies and an appropriate budget attached.</p></speech>

They will be very helpful to us when we are drafting our report.  I have a couple of questions for each group.</p> <p>  I will begin with the representative Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI.  Senator Kelleher touched on this question.  Have the witnesses drilled down into specifics of what specialised services would be needed to address the type of trauma that victims of human trafficking experience?  I noticed the phrase "THB victims".  Could the witness explain that term to me?  Moreover, does the MRCI have evidence that some people who have been trafficked into Ireland are in prison, perhaps for crimes that they were forced to commit?  If so, do they have any access in prison to the type of services that the MRCI would recommend for them specifically as trafficked people?</p> <p>  Does the MRCI have any experience of the appropriate treatment for women and girls people who have experienced female genital mutilation, FGM?  Is that coming up as an issue?  I know that several women who have migrated here have been affected.  I am not sure if I should use the word "victim".  Certainly, I would see them as victims, but the culture from which they come does not see it that way.  Is a specific type of treatment required in those cases?  Is there a pipeline to which they can go if they happen to be in a direct provision centre?  Are there avenues for them to access the type of help they need?</p> <p>  I also have questions for the representatives of BeLonG To.  They mentioned a communications plan their organisation has in mind, intended to raise awareness among parents of the resources that are available to them.  What do the witnesses have in mind?  How would they reach this audience?  I find that as a politician, there are lots of things about which I want to tell people.  Sometimes I wonder why people are not aware, because I keep trying to reach them in so many different ways but I cannot seem to hit the target of getting the information out as much as I want.  What are the witnesses' plans in that regard?</p> <p>  I thank Dylan for his presentation.  It is wonderful that he has such confidence.  I am not sure that at 16 years of age I had the confidence to speak in front of a crowd of politicians.  I have read his report.  It is a marvellous survey in which he goes into tremendous detail.  It will be enormously helpful to anybody grappling with policy to have something like that available.  It is a great resource.  Did Dylan find any resistance when he produced his survey?  I notice that he got quite a lot of support from his school and from BeLonG To, but did he find any resistance anywhere else?  I ask more out of curiosity than anything else. </p> <p>  I also thank Pavee Point's representatives for their submission.  They mentioned being invisible.  Were they referring to the fact that Travellers are not categorised separately in the national figures?  Do the witnesses think that would be helpful?  I refer also to the political question.  I am trying to get my head around what is meant there.  Do the witnesses mean that the political system is not supportive of what they are trying to achieve? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pablo Rojas Coppari" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018021400002#L00500"><p>To clarify, THB means "traffic in human beings".  I apologise for using the acronym.  In answer to the question about what services we are asking for, I note that victims of human trafficking are not homogenous in their categories nor in their experiences.  As such, the type of services which are needed will be very different for those who are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation than for those who are victims of trafficking for labour exploitation.  Not only will the experiences of the victims differ, so will the type of reaction.  We very often see trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  They are more or less the most well-known effects.  I am not a mental health expert.</p> <p>  There are no such services in the country, so setting them up would require looking at other jurisdictions where these types of services are already in place.  I am sure there are people in Ireland who have the expertise, but on top of clinical expertise they would need an understanding of the phenomenon of human trafficking and the cultural sensitivities around providing services to people who are from different countries and different cultural and religious backgrounds.  Furthermore, they will need to understand the physical phenomena that intersect, such as torture and the physical violence that arise in trafficking.</p> <p>  I am not necessarily saying that this expertise is not already in the country.  However, it is about putting together a programme that delivers mental health for victims of human trafficking as part of our national referral mechanism, which is the mechanism set up by the State to provide services, including accommodation, legal counselling, and physical health.  Mental health must be added as one of the key parts of the service provision.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about victims of human trafficking in the prison system.  Yes, this is one of the areas in which we work with victims of trafficking and forced criminality.  We have worked a lot with people who were trafficked for the purposes of cannabis cultivation.  I sincerely doubt that they are being provided with a mental health service, either because they are not offered one, or because it is not available to them.  I say that because I would have done much of the assessment.  I have gone into prisons across the country and met with them, and I know that basic interpretation services are not there for them.  The legal services available to them are extremely limited.  Moreover, accessing victims of human trafficking in prison is very hard for agencies like us that have the expertise, because we can only go there if we are invited by a solicitor.  If solicitors do not recognise us as being experts, or simply do not want to engage with us, then we cannot approach these people.  There are certainly no specialised services in prison for victims of human trafficking.  I cannot attest to the quality of the services available to the mainstream prison population. </p> <p>  FGM is obviously not only linked to victims of trafficking.  It is a broader cultural phenomenon.  There is an organisation called Akidwa that does a lot of advocacy on the issue.  If people have experienced female genital mutilation, there are certain health providers and health specialists who can address that.  I do not know to what level that is mainstreamed in the health services.  I imagine that victims have to be referred to people who have the expertise to address that from a physical point of view and from a mental health point of view.  I think that covers the Deputy's questions. </p></speech>

I know that I have probably spoken too much about this, but I feel it has to be said.</p><p>I sat here a couple of weeks ago with the CHOs for almost three and a half hours and there was no mention of Travellers in that context.  Decisions are made for Travellers and they do not have a voice in it.  The lack of a voice has a bad impact on ground, and we see that.  If ten men are making decisions for women with no women present it is not going lead to a good decision.  That is what we mean by invisible.  I do not mind if it is me at the table or someone else.  Once there is a Traveller voice there I will be happy.  Who knows Travellers better than Travellers?  I hope that answers the question. </p></speech>

The first report on Travellers was carried out in 1965.  The first Traveller health study was carried out in 1986.  Since then the gap in life expectancy for Traveller men has gone from ten times the differential with the general population to 15 times.  Things are deteriorating.  That is also indicative of the improvement within the settled community, but the gap is widening.  The Traveller situation has been under discussion.  There have been policy documents and discussions, but over 50 years later we are no further on.  Indeed, we are in a worse situation.  Do people not want this to happen?  We have all the reports, the evidence and the actions.  We write submissions every day on policy documents.  We lobby and we try to make sure that the Traveller voice is heard, but as Mr. Reilly said, if Travellers are not actually at the table it is as if they do not exist.  It is not appropriate to have someone sitting at every table, but that is what it seems to require.</p> <p>  We had a person who tried to get elected as a Senator.  That person sought to apply through the Taoiseach's panel.  They then tried the university panel.  There were four unsuccessful attempts to try to get a Traveller elected to the Seanad via the Trinity panel.  We have one councillor in Tuam because there is a very large population of Travellers there.  That is about the only political representation we have.  We looked at models in other countries, in terms of the Traveller health study, and found that 40,000 people actually makes up a constituency.  Is there a rationale for saying that Travellers should be allowed representation when the totality of their population is taken into consideration?</p></speech>

We are not in every county, I am afraid.  Some of these groups are very small.  The funding is through the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, which provides funding so that a youth worker has four hours to run a weekly or fortnightly youth group.  It is patchy, but the young people themselves talk about how important it is and what a lifeline it is to have access to peers and to support.</p> <p>  There are two different communications plans.  One is targeted at young people, because it came to our attention that even young people who were self-harming were not accessing services.  We have good relationships with mental health services, but when we explored it we discovered that there was a double stigma and that they almost expected to have really bad mental health because they are LGBT.  At the moment we are working together with some of our partners in the mental health area.  Spun Out, Pieta House, NOSP and Jigsaw have all come together with Thinkhouse PR, which is a youth PR company, and we are carrying out in-depth focus groups with young people to get to the bottom of this problem.  We will then look for a further investment so that we can start communicating outwards and telling young people that this is not okay and that they do not have to suffer like this.  Services exist, and we can provide access to them for these young people.  That is one of the communication plans.</p> <p>  The other plan relates to parents.  Our experience is that LGBT young people are coming out at a progressively younger age, especially trans young people.  For parents in Ireland, it can be very difficult and very challenging, so we are trying to access those parents at the moment to make sure that they know about our services and our partners who work with us.  Anyone on Facebook at the moment will see that we have a big advertisement which targets parents.  Facebook partnered with us on this project.  There is a bot and a video, and parents can be brought in so that they can access the information.  Further down the road we hope to work with family resource centres, FRCs, nationally so that we can get that information out there about the services that are available locally and nationally so that young people and their parents know that they do not have to go through this alone and that the supports and services are available.</p></speech>

I am here in my capacity as senior research officer at the ESRI.  I am joined by my colleague Dr. Conor Keegan, research officer at the ESRI.  We are both health economists and are the leading authors of the ESRI research series report, Projections of Demand for Healthcare in Ireland, 2015-2030, which was published last October and which the Chairman, Deputy Michael Harty, has invited us to discuss with the committee.</p> <p>  This report provides annual projections of demand for public and private health and social care services in Ireland for the years 2015 to 2030.  These projections are based on new ESRI projections for population growth, the first projections to be published based on the 2016 census of population.  The report contains the most comprehensive mapping of public and private activity in the Irish health care system to have been published.  The main findings are that, over the years 2015 to 2030, the population of Ireland is projected to grow by between 14% to 23%, adding 640,000 to 1.1 million people; the share of population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from one in eight to one in six; the numbers of people aged 85 and over are projected to almost double; demand for health and social care is projected to increase across all sectors, with the greatest increases for services for older people; demand for home help care and for residential and intermediate care places in nursing homes and other settings is projected to increase by up to 54%; demand for public hospital services is projected to increase by up to 37% for inpatient bed days and by up to 30% for inpatient cases; and demand for GP visits is projected to increase by up to 27% while demand for practice nurse visits is projected to increase by up to 32%.</p> <p>  New analysis in the report of the mix of public and private provision in 2015, which is our base year, finds that public hospitals delivered approximately 85% of total inpatient bed days and private hospitals delivered 15%, public hospitals delivered approximately 69% of day patient cases and private hospitals delivered 31%, and people paid privately for 27% of total home help hours.</p> <p>  The report also provides projections of demand for inpatient and day cases in public and private hospitals, maternity services, public hospital emergency department and outpatient services, pharmaceuticals, pharmacy consultations, home care packages, public health nursing and public community therapy services.  The report includes the effects of unmet need and demand where possible.</p> <p>  There are important policy implications from this report&rsquo;s findings of substantial projected demand increases for health and social care in the years to 2030 due to projected population growth and ageing.  These projected increases in population and demand come after two decades of rapid population growth, a decade of cutbacks in the public provision of care, and a consequent build-up of unmet need and demand for care.  The additional demand projected in this report for the years to 2030 will give rise to demand for additional expenditure, capital investment and expanded staffing and will have major implications for capacity planning, workforce planning and training.</p><p>Additional investment will be required in most forms of care to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and ageing population.  The projected population growth will, however, also lead to an increase in the numbers at work and contribute to national income and the revenue base.</p><p> In future analysis the ESRI will examine the expenditure implications of the report&rsquo;s demand projections.  While it assumes no change in models of care, further research is examining the potential effects of policy developments which could reduce projected increases in demand and capacity need in some sectors but increase projected demand and capacity need in others.</p><p> This is the first report to be published which applies the Hippocrates projection model of Irish health care demand and expenditure which has been developed at the ESRI in a programme of research funded by the Department of Health.  The programme applies economic analysis to explore issues related to health services, health expenditure and population health, to inform the development of health policy and the Government&rsquo;s health care reform agenda.  It is overseen by a steering group which comprises nominees of the ESRI and the Department which agrees its annual work programme.  Research studies produced under the programme are public goods which are published following national and international peer reviews.</p><p> The full report has been circulated to the committee and is available on the ESRI's website.</p></speech>

Lest it go unmarked, it is nice to spend part of St. Valentine's Day with all of them.  Members may be punch drunk on figures at the end of this, but I will try to keep them as straightforward as possible.  I have just circulated the report to them and it is also available on the websites of the HSE and Trinity College Dublin.  It was commissioned by the HSE with the involvement of the Department of Health to review how primary care systems operated internationally.  It includes a big chunk of patient consumer research about general practice and also targeted interviews with key individuals in the wider health service.<br/><br/>Reform of the primary care system has been on the agenda for years.  I have attended many meetings at which a Minister said, &quot;Yes; this is the way it's going to be.&quot;  However, the current system remains fragmented, poorly developed and unfair.  Achieving reform in the health service requires a decisive shift towards general practice.  For this shift to occur, it needs a change in the contractual arrangements with general practitioners.  I would be misleading the committee if I did not convey the sense of brittleness in general practice.  I have spent many winters in general practice and this one has been very difficult.  Many of my colleagues reflect the instability that is emerging in general practice.<br/><br/>The overall spend on general practice in Ireland in 2014 was &euro;858 million, the same as the amount spent on running St. James's Hospital.  Approximately 42% of the population is covered by the GMS.  The vast majority of GPs' income, 63%, comes from the GMS, with the other 37% coming from private practice, but that figure covers nearly 60% of the population.  On average, GMS patients consult 5.63 times year, which is more than the figure for private patients.  Although they are more ill, the divide is not great and it is much more of a spectrum than we realise.  In compiling the report which took us a year we estimated that 4.5% of the entire budget was spent on payments to GPs.  This is the lowest percentage in all of the comparable countries we studied.  The role of private health insurers is underdeveloped in Irish general practice and almost non-existent.  It is a secondary care resourced system.<br/><br/>On the number of GPs per 10,000 population, the number in Ireland is broadly similar to that in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands but significantly lower than that in Scotland.  One would not think that if one were in Scotland, but it is lower.  Countries that are rated highly on access and services have higher numbers of practice-based staff.  The key seems to be having practice-based staff, including practice nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists.  However, Ireland has the lowest number of practice-based staff in the countries at which we looked.<br/><br/>We are focusing - I think the State is also doing so - on chronic disease management, for which a better term is long-term illness.  Anyone who has just had a single disease at any of our ages will have lived a pretty charmed life.  Most people will have more than one and they are not diseases that can be managed by the same drug.  They need a variety of medications.  Most people over 60 years have two or more diseases which, unfortunately are well advanced.  There is good evidence that seeing the same doctor regularly results in significantly fewer admissions for patients.  That is an important finding which was published last year in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>.  Seeing the same doctor on eight or more occasions in the year resulted in 12.5% fewer admissions.  That monetary value can be attached to it, but, of course, it takes time.<br/><br/>The survey of patient satisfaction levels was carried out online and by telephoning patients who had recently visited the GP.  The satisfaction rates astonished all of the GPs who were very defensive about satisfaction surveys being carried out at the time.  More than 90% of patients were satisfied with their last visit to the GP and prepared to go on a waiting list for a recommended GP.  Word of mouth is very important in Ireland.  Ease of access to appointments was also rated highly, with most parents of children being given priority.  The comments were very positive.  People said they had gone along without an appointment but were fitted in.  Therefore, there is a child-focused approach adopted by GPs.  Based on research in which others and I have been involved, we know that the cost of seeing a GP deters one in three patients.  The figure is highest among those paying for the service and younger patients.<br/><br/>One of the big successes in the past decade has to be the out-of-hours services.  Over 1 million out-of-hours consultations are provided per year.  Out-of-hours work is not easy; it is the mucky end of the stick.  It occurs after a day's work and late into the night, yet it has been hugely successful.  Accessibility has also been seen as successful, although all of the co-operatives found it very difficult in the Christmas 2017 period.<br/><br/>GPs have been early adopters of information technology.  We use it for the recording of administrative, clinical and prescribing details and screening programmes.  We are beginning to make electronic referrals to hospitals, particularly for cancer patients, but the links are a source of concern for GPs.  The lab results are quite good and now received electronically. <br/><br/>Diagnostics, in particular, have got worse.  For the past 30 years I have been involved in a longitudinal research study of general practitioners.</p><p>The last time we did it, which was approximately five years ago, access to diagnostics had actually deteriorated.  It is not possible to run modern medicine without access to diagnostics, by which I mean X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans and so on.  Access has actually decreased for public patients.  In fairness, the cost of MRI scans has come down but families still often have to club together to pay for a scan.</p><p> When we did focus groups with our general practitioners in training, one reason they said they would not stay as general practitioners was the clinical disrespect they felt from being unable to have access to diagnostics.  We cannot underestimate that.  We train GPs first as doctors and then as GPs.  If they say they are going to go to psychiatry or clinical medicine or whatever because they cannot practice as a doctor, then there is major waste in our system.</p><p> GPs in training do not see themselves as single-handed practitioners.  The number of single-handed practitioners is reducing.  When I started in practice, it was the norm that a person set up in practice.  The numbers for single-handed practitioner are coming out at approximately 18% and they have fallen considerably.  Yet people are fond of a single-handed practitioner who knows them.  Anyway, younger doctors do not see themselves in this light.  The job has become too complex and they want colleagues.</p><p> Many are unwilling to take on a General Medical Services contract because it is so complex.  It requires a great deal of attention to detail.  There are risks to being an employer as well.  I am an employer of staff and I worry about keeping them afloat.  Income is tight and the past ten years have impacted on sole traders and small practices.  Many of our younger GPs say they do not want it.  They have said to us that they are interested in being salaried GPs when they come out and then would like to move into partnership before becoming managing partners.  It is a little like the law firms, which have a similar model.</p><p> The heroes in the consumer studies were undoubtedly the nurses.  Practice nurses rated highly.  They are seen as central to developing high-quality services.  They are great consumers of further education.  They see themselves playing a role in long-term illnesses.  They are a great source of security to the patients, especially those with chronic illness.  We have had a great deal of representation from the pharmacists.  Pharmacists see themselves as being able to share some of the aspects of chronic disease management with GPs.  As it is, community pharmacists play an important role in medicine safety and preventing drug interactions.  The most common interaction I have as a general practitioner is with my local community pharmacist, who looks out for me and for the patients.</p><p> Clinical pharmacy is being developed in the National Health Service.  It really is an important adjunct and ingredient in the management of chronic illness.  The professionals are employed by the practices.  They are not involved in the retail end but in the management and provision of medications.  Medications have become more complex.  This allows the GP to focus more on the medical aspects.  It is not uncommon for patients to be on ten medications.  That can happen easily and many of these medications interact.</p><p> I wish to comment on allied health professionals.  It is interesting to read the literature and to interact with physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists.  They want far more interaction with patients in primary care.  They realise that by the time patients get into the hospital sector it is too late, especially for intervention by allied health professionals.  Behaviours are set.  Diseases have advanced, even diseases that can be prevented.  They are open to working in primary care, which is the pattern internationally with these professions.</p><p> Inevitably, every time anyone appears in this room they are asking for more money.  That seems to be the modern way.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  People see the health budget as a fairly sealed entity.  I believe we have to look at transferring funds.  In providing long-term illness and improved diagnostic services, practice-based staff and information technology all require funding.  Some of this would be once-off funding.  IT funding is very much once-off funding, as is funding for diagnostic services especially for equipment.  The equipment has fallen in price.  The other side relates to primary care as structured.  I listened to Dr. Wren's statement.  As general practice is structured now, it simply would be unable to cope with that workload.  It is only hanging in there at the moment.  I would be misleading committee members if I did not highlight that it is no more than hanging in there at the moment.</p> <p>  Transitional funding could be spread over several years.  It needs to be strengthened to international standards.  There are quick wins.  We studied the situation in Vermont, where they transitioned the system from a hospital-based system to a system based far more on primary care.  Those involved reduced the spend on health, often by providing allied health professionals, having some transitional funding, and it gave them considerable longer-term gains.</p> <p>  At this stage of my career, it is frustrating to see that many of the pieces are available but not joined up.  This is frustrating in our system.  We have very good people working in the system but they are not joined up.  This includes, at my end of the profession, a well-trained cohort of GPs and an entrepreneurial GP workforce.  The medical profession can be snide about entrepreneurship but it is important.  If we want to keep a general practice system going on 4.5% of the health budget, then we need a lot of business smarts to keep it going.  Premises have to be modernised.  The Chairman, Deputy Harty, and I will remember the time when a GP bought the garage in a corner house to set up a practice.  Those days are long gone.  We have an active college of general practitioners with a large membership and we have a referral system that works through the efforts of the Medical Council.  There was a time, when I went into practice, when patients could refer themselves directly into secondary care and never see a GP.  That has gone so the gatekeeper effect is far more important.  All our doctors are registered and indemnified.</p> <p>  The evidence supports a decisive shift to primary care.  This is central to the transformation of the health services.  I believe there is an unusual consensus now among politicians, including those present, who are leaders in our State, policy makers and clinicians that this is the way to go.  Although it is the way to go, it will not be easy.  We are a conservative country.  Our patients do not like change.  Our system does not like that change.  It will require much courage and leadership to make it happen.</p> <p>  At the moment we need a shift from an institutional and inappropriate and expensive method of care.  Our private health insurers have not played a role.  They have a distorting effect on health care in Ireland.  They are hiding in plain view.  The income for a GMS patient for a GP is approximately &euro;280 per year.</p><p>For a private patient, it is approximately &euro;116.  This private practice has leached into private clinics that are funded or reimbursed by private health insurers and this is having a distorting affect on the provision of health care.  This is a legitimate area of concern for legislators.  Moving from the current system we have to a primary care led system will be a philosophical, political and financial journey.  I do not know anybody who is against it, but I think it requires political leadership at this stage.</p></speech>

It is obvious it was written by a general practitioner, GP.  None of us can deny that the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, had a very serious impact on this sector over ten years, as they did on the pharmacy sector and on services for patients, which we have all tried to mitigate as much as possible.  Professor O'Dowd mentioned that GPs want to be salaried GPs in the earlier phase of their lives, which is understandable.  Nobody who has undertaken seven years studying to obtain a degree would be want to end up in precarious employment.</p> <p>  Based on my first reading of the report, I have concerns relating to the clinical pharmacist element of it.  I worked as clinical pharmacist in the NHS for a number of years.  I note there is to be a distinction between pharmacist and clinical pharmacist.  I also worked for ten years as a community pharmacist, to which I brought the skills I had obtained at undergraduate level and intern level and the experience I gained in the NHS.  Most community pharmacists, in particular those who have come through the modern system of training, would consider themselves to be clinical pharmacists.  I would be opposed to the concept of a two-tier pharmacist.  Many of my pharmacist colleagues work in the hospital sector and they do a certain amount of training in CPD through their jobs to upskill them in the areas of oncology and so on.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that a pharmacist's role is in the area of drug safety and drug interaction.  I believe a pharmacist's role in the community is far greater.  Throughout the recession we all took on roles that were not our natural roles.  I believe the relationship between the community pharmacist and his or her patient cohort is unique.  That said, I believe that the general practitioner should be the anchor for people in the community.  In other words, the person to whom the patient should go in the community is the person, the GP, who knows all about him or her.  I am delighted to hear that the practice of self-referrals has ended, which addresses the concern regarding who reads results, etc.</p> <p>  It is shocking that only 4.5% of the overall health budget goes to GPs.  We seem to be getting very good bang for our buck from that 4.5% given the number of people who go through the GP setting.  On the proposal regarding the clinical pharmacist role, which is to be based on the NHS model, I am very much against us copying the NHS in any regard, apart from its ideology with regard to universal health care.  The NHS system does not seem to work.  Based on the population of Ireland, a community pharmacist would have a very close relationship with approximately 2,000 patients.  The proposal to bring community pharmacists into a primary care setting under the employment of the GP for one day per week-----</p></speech>

It is not a solution.  A more appropriate solution would be a collaboration between the GP practice and the community pharmacist in the community setting.  If, as a pharmacist, I am employed by a GP to scrutinise his or her prescribing and he or she is a bad prescriber but is paying my salary I might not be open to telling him or her that I do not agree with his or her prescribing or that it is not in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines.  There would be an automatic conflict there.  In my experience patients have different relationships with their pharmacists to those they have with their GPs.  Often the information that pharmacists get versus what GPs get is different, so when pharmacists have conversations with GPs we improve outcomes for patients.  I would be concerned about that proposal and about the proposed new role of clinical pharmacist and what that means.  We do not have clinical GPs.  Rather, we have GPs who are on the specialist register and trained to a high level.</p> <p>  I welcome the statistics which show that when patients have a regular GP and they see him or her eight times per year it leads to a reduction in hospital admissions, which is something that anyone who works in the community knows without having to look at the statistics.  We know that when people have a go-to gatekeeper they have better outcomes.</p> <p>  Access to diagnostics was considered in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I am concerned that we have not seen any move in this regard.  One of the main concerns of GPs was getting access to diagnostics for patients.  I may have missed reference to this in the ESRI report.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended stand-alone diagnostic units for GP referrals.  Do the witnesses agree with that concept and, if not, what in their view is the solution, bearing in mind that we cannot have MRI machines in every GP practice?</p> <p>  It was mentioned that cost in terms of visiting a GP is a deterrent to one in three private patients.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare report, any barrier to access was seen as a negative.  Are the witnesses saying that we should be looking at universal free access to a GP and, if not, what would they suggest to mitigate the cost deterrent?  People who need to see a doctor but cannot do so owing to cost usually end up in a far more serious situation in our acute hospital setting.  I have to leave the meeting at 10.30 a.m. as I have another appointment.  If the witnesses do not get an opportunity to answer my questions before I leave, I will follow up on them when the transcript of the meeting is available.</p></speech>

I want to address a few issues, the first of which is workforce planning.  Similarly to Deputy O'Connell and others here, I was a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  Workforce planning formed a considerable part of our discussions.  Looking at the future, we have general practitioner, GP, practices that are full.  In Fingal, we have the youngest and fastest-growing population in the State.  There are now GP practices that are full for kids, which is causing a huge problem.  On workforce planning, while serving on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, it became apparent that workforce planning was not something the HSE was on top of.  I had experience of workforce planning units being disbanded and people being moved to other duties when staffing levels were cut.  The witnesses might be able to comment on what we need to do with regard to workforce planning.  It strikes me that we may not be prepared.  We seem to arrive at situations that are very easy to plan for, especially relating to the age of the population, which is probably one of the easiest things to plan for, before even considering illness profiles, yet successive Ministers seem to be shocked that people get older as the days go by.  The witnesses might enlighten us as to what we could recommend for workforce planning.</p> <p>  On practice nurses, the unsung heroes of the GP world, do the witnesses see scope for practice nurses being able to expand their role?  Will they comment on the method for payment?  Some GPs have said to me that the mechanism by which one runs a GP practice, which will bring me to my next point, is quite cumbersome and complicated.  There is a huge amount of paperwork.  Can we fix that by simply putting in place salaried GPs alongside salaried allied health professionals and salaried nurses working directly for the HSE?  Would the witnesses see it only as a model whereby salaried GPs would be there for the start of their career but would then move into their own practice - entrepreneurial was the word used - and run that?  Do the witnesses have specific recommendations about the expanded role for the practice nurse with regard to what the nurse could be doing?  We have had the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and SIPTU, here on several occasions.  They are never shy about saying that their members are up for change and embracing new roles.  There are obviously industrial relations issues that will arise from that but there does not seem to be unwillingness on the part of nurses to take on an expanded role.  Do the witnesses see that as part of future expansion?</p> <p>  I have questions about IT equipment, specifically the availability of diagnostics.  The average person would say that if there was a scanner in the doctor's surgery, he or she would not have to go to hospital and that would be marvellous.  What type of equipment are we looking at putting into GP surgeries to facilitate hospital avoidance?  It does not seem sensible for one to have to go to a GP to be told by the GP to go to hospital to get a scan.  There obviously cannot be an MRI machine in every GP surgery but is there some scope there?  I had discussions with companies involved in equipment for near-patient testing, infection control and so on, so that people are not sent to hospital.</p> <p>  On e-health and hospital referrals, if one goes out to Merrion Square, one will see women coming out of Holles Street hospital with big paper files.  If one talks to people, particularly those involved in the health area, from anywhere outside of the State, they would be shocked at how dependent we are on paper files.  It strikes me that there is not a huge focus by the Department on rolling out the e-health strategy.  I know that one key member of staff was lost to that project.  What will it take to get us to the level where we can see the elimination of as much paper as is reasonable and practical?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#J00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  We have had many reports and observations from professional bodies and research groups about the demands that will be placed on the health service because of demographic changes, the ageing profile and the complexities in society with regard to illnesses, diseases and the levels of and increased sophistication of prevention that allow people to live longer.  We all know that huge demands will be placed on health services in the coming years.  The key question from our perspective is how we plan for that, how we implement the plan itself and the costs of it.  On Deputy O'Reilly's question, it is often the case that we can, with some degree of accuracy, predict what we require in capital development projects, including how many beds we need, how many hospitals or how many kilometres of road or whatever other infrastructure capital is required for.  We seem to have an inability to assess our human capital requirements, primarily the skill sets required for the economy and, in this context, the health services too.  I assume that because of the research done by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, by Dr. Wren, as well as by Professor O'Dowd, that we should have some window into the future showing what specialties we most need in the years ahead.  I assume geriatricians and similar specialties would be a key component in any future planning but we do not seem to be doing that in advance.  I find that we consistently wake up with skill shortages on a continual basis.  Do we need to do more work on that or is there enough evidence to tell us exactly what we should be doing as policy makers with professional bodies and oversight bodies to establish additional capacity in training and changing existing training programmes and regimes to allow for that projected change in demand in the health service in the years ahead?</p> <p>  Everybody has accepted that we should move from hospital-centric care to primary care and community care.  It is a huge leap of faith because we will have a major problem if it does not work.  We will have spent a lot of money to develop primary care but if we still end up with a huge drag into the hospital system, then we will have the worst of both worlds since our primary care and community care system will not be stopping the flow of patients into the hospital system.  Has any country moved from the disparate, broken type of system that we have with primary care and community care, with no joined-up thinking or interconnecting, to having a very successful system?  Is there any country of comparable size or geographic make-up that has successfully made or at least started the journey to success in developing a proper primary care and community care infrastructure?</p> <p>  With regard to diagnostics, we have to accept that the idea that a GP has to refer a person to an emergency department to get an X-ray or MRI scan is just bizarre.  I cannot understand why it happens frequently.  It happens all the time in Cork, where one sees people going to emergency departments with their letters and it is primarily because a doctor cannot get a diagnosis in a reasonable time and so refers a patient to the emergency department.</p><p>That is a huge waste of resources and an imposition not alone on patients but also on emergency departments, which are the sections of the hospital system that are under the most stress.</p><p> Where should diagnostics be located and what should be available to general practitioners, GPs, in terms of being able to refer diagnostics directly?  I note that there is strong collaboration between GPs and consultants in areas such as cardiology, but it does not seem to be as effective in other specialties.  Is there any blueprint in that regard or what should be done to allow and facilitate GPs to refer for diagnostics directly?  What increase in infrastructural capacity would be needed?  Must such facilities be attached to hospitals, could they be stand-alone units or at what level and where should they be provided?</p><p> As regard nurses and nurse specialists, there is no doubt we are moving to subspecialties in all key areas, including nursing.  Nurses have been underutilised and much abused in Irish health care systems in the sense that they are highly skilled, very flexible and, as was pointed out, consistently strive to professionalise themselves further in terms of education.  Although they are at the centre of delivery of care, that is not the case in regard to the decision-making process, and that should be looked at.</p><p> I do not raise this point because a pharmacist is a member of the committee.  I do not understand why highly qualified pharmacists leave college after seven years but are given no key role in the health services in terms of the professionalism they bring to it.  There is a pharmacy in almost every town, village and street in the country, but GP services are bursting at the seams and are unable to see patients on a same day basis.  The role of community pharmacists is not fully utilised and could complement GPs and GP services.  Pharmacists cannot diagnose continually but could do so for minor ailments.  That people have to go to GPs regularly and have to do so consistently to renew prescriptions should be looked at.  In my six or seven years observing the situation in terms of health care as a spokesperson for health, I note a continuing huge resistance to change by professionals in respect of matters that may lead to others encroaching upon their areas.  I invite observations in that regard.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being present at the start of the presentation.  I wish to focus on sustainability and development.  My interest in the area comes about from my involvement in the disability movement.  I have a personal interest in several chronic conditions and know that ground quite well.  Professor O'Dowd mentioned that many of the pieces of the puzzle are there but there is frustration that they are not joined up.  What could be done to help to join up those pieces?  Primary and secondary care and hospitals and so on have been mentioned but I am conscious of and very familiar with the work done by many support organisations or patient groups, those being organisations set up to support those with particular conditions such as post-polio syndrome, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease and epilepsy.  Could there be a better role for those groups, which are close to people and families and some of which are involved with clinicians in certain areas?  Could they be part of joining up some of the pieces?</p> <p>  Professor O'Dowd mentioned that 8.5 GP visits per year is optimal in terms of best supporting people.  Could the service sustain 8.5 visits per year or would it crack open?  In several respects, it is very clear that the current system is vulnerable and not very healthy in terms of sustainability.</p> <p>  Professor O'Dowd mentioned private health insurers not in the primary area.  Towards the end of his presentation he discussed a shift from the institutional model of care and said that a bias exists which is pushing things away from the primary area.</p> <p>  It registers very strongly with me that he stated that, at the hospital level, behaviours are set and diseases are at an advanced stage, which is obvious.  He stated that many health professionals want to be in front of and support people earlier on.  There is no doubt that developments in recent decades have meant that many permanent, chronic and long-term conditions can be diagnosed far earlier, and thus earlier intervention is possible.  There may be other views on that point.  Thirty years ago there was not the same awareness of patients' conditions.  There is now a greater opportunity for early intervention than was previously the case.  If I am not present for the replies to my queries, I will check the record in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Tom O'Dowd" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#K00500"><p>The report concerns more than clinical pharmacy.  I presume Deputy O'Connell addressed clinical pharmacy because of her background.  "Clinical pharmacy" is a bad term.  The report deals with community pharmacists but, in hindsight, practice-based pharmacy should probably have been included.</p> <p>  I take Deputy Kelleher's point about people going to pharmacists in regard to minor illnesses, many of which can be treated with very cheap medication.  However, if a pharmacist stocks a medication that he or she wishes to sell or on which there is a good margin and so on, that introduces conflicts of interest.  Retail pharmacists have to face such conflicts of interest, which is why the NHS has moved towards practice-based pharmacists who are not involved in the retail end of the business.  This cannot be dismissed as only occurring within the NHS.  In my practice, we have appointed a clinical pharmacist whose first role is to conduct a brown bag review.  The patient brings in his or her medication in a brown bag and the pharmacist goes through that medication.  This takes time but is very important because there are some medications of which people are very fond, such as sleeping tablets, and others that they do not take, such as diuretics, perhaps because they are going into town and do not want to have to rush to a toilet.</p><p>There are many kinds of sophisticated, yet quite simple, approaches to doing that.  There is also the fact that many patients are on ten or more medications.</p><p> The most dangerous work that I do as a GP is repeat prescribing.  It is an absolute burden and a medical and legal minefield.  I sign these things at speed, yet there are medications that interact.  We have disabled the interaction alert on the computer because it says that everything interacts.  Some sort of common-sense approach to this issue is necessary.  We should ask the patient if they are coughing or falling over when taking these medications.  That takes time, and it cannot be done in a retail pharmacy.  It is confidential work, particularly when it comes to older people.  They do not want to be standing in a shop with a queue of three or four people behind them and telling people that they are having various side effects from medicines.  It cannot be dismissed just like that.  The safety issue with medications is now quite important.  One in three people has a reaction to a medication.  It could be anyone.  As people get older, clearly the number increases.</p><p> Access to diagnostics was brought up by a number of members of the committee.  This is a real problem.  I am better qualified medically than some of the people to whom I refer patients, but I cannot get access to diagnostics.  It is bad medicine if I cannot access diagnostics.  The situation is poor.  Deputy Kelleher asked where diagnostics should be located.  We have developed a new centre in Tallaght with a 5,000 sq. ft area into which we are going to put diagnostic equipment.  In choosing what diagnostic equipment to install, we have stayed away from radiology because it requires so many health and safety precautions, including lead lining.  We are installing ultrasound, DEXA scanning and MRI equipment.  There is a lot of footfall in this area.  The ideal situation for us would be if some of the radiologists from a local hospital would take an interest in it and take it over, and if extra resources are required they should get them.  There is no doubt that patients, especially as they get older, find hospital access and traversing the hospital system very difficult.  There is also no doubt that once our hospital colleagues come out into the community, it rearranges their heads and they begin to see people who are dressed like normal people, who have views and opinions, talking about politics or the price of things.  It humanises them, whereas many of our hospital systems, sadly, dehumanise people.  Diagnostics should be located in an area which serves a number of practices, not just one.  It is a community approach which stays away from the dangerous stuff, such as radiation.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly asked a number of questions.  I must say that workforce planning is what I would call a dark art.  I am quite sure that there are many management consultants who have made a fortune out of workforce planning, but it seems that everybody gets it wrong.  We can only plan ahead for four or five years.  We cannot plan ahead for a large number of years.</p><p> The Deputy asked what we should do about our current GP primary care problems where practices are full.  It is not in the nature of sole traders to turn down business, but this is what is happening.  GPs are saying that they are full and cannot take on any more patients.  People such as myself can stay on until we turn 72.  That has been an improvement.  I believe we have to expand allied health professionals - a terrible name, but that is the name we use - so that, for example, a physiotherapist with a patient presenting with back pain could certify a patient as fit or unfit for work, as is the case in the NHS and in some of the American centres.  There are many little changes that could be made.  It is the same situation in our clinical or practice-based pharmacies.  There are a number of things we can do in that area.</p><p> Expanding the role of the practice nurse is important too.  To expand on Deputy Kelleher's point, there is no doubt that the systems that work well, where there is good patient satisfaction, a better range of clinical services and more fairness, are the systems that have many extra staff.  Practice nurses are key to this.  The practice nurses at the moment are nurses who have left the hospital sector and who perhaps have gone part-time or left to have a family and then come into practice.  General practice is one of the areas that hugely values people who have been mothers and who have looked after sick children in the night.  Patients value them as well because they have street credibility.  The practice nurse in my practice spends a lot of time doing phlebotomy, which is taking blood.  It is a very expensive way of taking blood.  Part of the rigidity of the current contract is that it does not resource us to employ somebody like a technician, a medical attendant or a phlebotomist at a lower rate.  That is a very important area of the contract.  In my own practice we have taken on a phlebotomist to free up the practice nurse to do more work in the area of chronic disease.  Our practice nurses initially came in to work in women's health when that was underutilised and underprovided, and they have upskilled themselves.  They now see that they need to specialise in long-term illness.</p><p> On the question of electronic referrals, we still have a fax machine in my practice.  People are shocked to hear that in this day and age.  We could not do without it.  That is the level of technical advancement we are working at.  We have a lot of IT as well.  When I carried out this report I spoke to a man called John Macaskill-Smith, from Hamilton, on the North Island of New Zealand.  He told me that they have developed their primary care IT hugely and the hospitals have developed their own IT systems.  However, the two IT systems do not talk to each other.  The idea of interoperability, where the two systems work together, is now being discussed.  The company Mr. Macaskill-Smith was talking to is a group that works in Nutgrove in Rathfarnham.  This company is providing interoperability for New Zealand while we are still relying on our fax machines.  The expertise is there.</p></speech>

The model that the ESRI has developed was designed with a view to informing planning, including planning for capacity, staffing and spending when we develop the expenditure phase.  In this country we tend to do these things as once-off exercises.  We look at a particular specialty, a particular professional, and we look at demands at a moment in time.  One of the things we need to be doing is repeatedly reiterating these exercises and updating them with the latest population projections.  This brings us to the need to collect data routinely.  One of the questions to which there are many answers is how many GPs there are in Ireland.  This is not a routinely collected piece of administrative data.  The HSE produces a personnel census every month for all the employees of the HSE, right across all of the programme areas, by grade and specialty, etc.  General practice is developed within a private market and routine administrative data for general practice have not been collected.</p><p>In response to Deputy Kelleher's question about what policymakers can do, if we want to have primary care expansion, it would be of assistance if routine collection of data in this area were required.  The comparison between health and education comes to mind when I reflect on what we might aim for.  In education, we know in any given year what the pupil-teacher ratio will be and we know in any given school or area what the pupil-teacher ratio will be.  It is not unreasonable to expect that we would in any given year know what the GP to population ratio or the GP to young children ratio will be in Fingal, for instance.  That requires routine collection of data.</p><p> The ESRI has looked at the role of practice nurses in this report and in some of its other work.  I concur with Dr. O'Dowd that the evidence shows that there is a great deal of scope for increasing the amount of care that is delivered by practice nurses in primary care in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, or indeed in the UK in general, the ratio of visits to nurses to visits to GPs is quite different.  Much more care is delivered by nurses there.  At a time when we are talking about primary care expansion and when there are concerns about the availability and supply of GPs, I suggest this is a really important part of the answer for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Keegan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#M00200"><p>I would like to respond to Deputy Kelleher's comments about the demands that are being placed on services due to population growth and ageing.  He spoke in that context about where we plan to invest.  At a broad level, the overarching findings of our report are that due to population growth, where an increase of between 14% and 23% in the population is expected, and population ageing, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected to increase dramatically.  It is important to note that we are speaking on the basis of no change in the models of care when we say we envisage that there will be increases in demand for health and social care services across the board, particularly services predominantly used by the older population, such as home care services and long-term care services.  We are seeing increases of 54% or 55% in such services.  This gives a broad idea of where investment may need to be allocated.</p> <p>  I will speak about the skill sets that will be required in primary care as we move forward.  Our results suggest that by 2030, general practice visits will increase by between 20% and 27% and practice nurse visits will increase by between 26% to 32%.  All of our projections factor in the relationship between increased life expectancy and health.  In primary care and general practice, we adopt quite a pessimistic view of the relationship between ageing and health.  This ties in with the whole notion of what is known in academic circles as the epidemiological transition.  Fifty or 100 years ago, people were not living that long and were dying of infectious diseases.  Nowadays, people are living a lot longer and the mix of reasons for death has changed.  People are living longer and often die with a number of chronic diseases.  It is important to appreciate that as we move forward, we will need primary care workers who are able to deal with individuals who present with a number of co-morbidities or who are on a number of different medications.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on what Dr. Wren said in response to Deputy O'Reilly's question about the expanded role for public health nurses.  In our projections, we have not looked at changes in the models of care.  This is a very important issue as we decide how best we can allocate resources as the level of demand for primary care increases and as we consider the expenditure implications of this.  There is work to be done on substitutability, not just between acute and non-acute services but within primary care as well.  We hope to do this work in the future.  The Hippocrates model we have developed has the capability to look at these questions.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for Dr. Wren.  How will the demographic changes predicted by the ESRI be reflected in the demand for care?  We all see such changes happening at the moment.  It is almost an actuarial equation.  Given a certain population and a certain age profile within that population, we know that there will be a certain number of strokes, hip replacements, heart attacks and predictable illnesses.  We do not know who will get those illnesses, but we can predict within 1% or 2% the percentage of people who are likely to present with them.  That must be a source of important information when determining what is needed to meet the level of demand that is going to come down the line.  It seems that we never actually supply the service that we are predicting is going to be required.  We are always chasing, which means there is always an unmet need.  How does the ESRI envisage that the health service will respond to the predictable nature of what is coming down the line, in light of the failure to provide the infrastructure to deal with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maev-Ann Wren" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#M00400"><p>If we had consistently planned for the past 15 years, we would be in a very different position from where we are now.  The history of health care expenditure in Ireland shows that expenditure tends to follow the electoral cycle.  It tends to increase coming up to elections, with cutbacks in intervening periods when Governments want to reduce tax.  For that reason and for other reasons that need no explanation, we substantially reduced the public service workforce during the period of austerity at a time when our population was still growing.  We substantially reduced the number of people working in our hospitals and across our health care system.  We incentivised retirement and carried a pension cost for that.  If we were to acknowledge and regularly update our demographic projections, look at our current use, as we have done, and project the implications of that use into the future, it would represent a considerable advance on the way in which the Irish health care system has historically been run.  This has been done at an earlier point in other countries.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly or Deputy Kelleher asked about countries that have provided better primary care.  There are countries which have placed a deliberate focus on targeting the provision of more care in the community than in hospitals.  Sweden, for example, has changed its whole system of financial incentives for hospitals and for local government, which supplies community care, in an incredibly effective way.  I think planning can be quite effective in this area.  I emphasise that there is still uncertainty about population projections.  That is why we are providing a range.  As my colleague has mentioned, there is uncertainty about the evolution of health as life expectancy extends.  That also affects the range of our projections.  There has been a welcome development in recent months.  Since we published our report and since the Department published its other work, there has been a recognition that we need to respond to population growth and ageing and increase capacity across the health care system.  I think that is really a sea change in health policy in Ireland.</p></speech>

We adopted that approach initially because when one is building a model, one has to start from the <i>status quo</i>.  Although we can now apply the model to an examination of the effects of changes, that requires having evidence about substitution.  If we are modelling an increase in primary care, we need to apply evidence of how that might affect acute care.  The capacity review that was published by the Department of Health recently acknowledges that there is a paucity of quantifiable evidence in this area.  We are working very closely on this issue.  Another ESRI study, which is funded by the Health Research Board, is looking at the effects of non-acute supply on the use of acute hospitals by region throughout Ireland.</p><p>It is our hope and plan to apply the findings, within the model, to looking at the substitution effects and changes in models of care.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare proposes a separation of private care in public hospitals.  Dr. Wren refers in her opening statement to the mix of private and public care.  Sl&aacute;intecare sees the mix of private care in public hospitals as an inhibitor of change and believes it has a negative effect on the provision of care.  Does Dr. Wren have an opinion on how one might separate private care from public hospitals or does she think it is possible or beneficial to do so?</p></speech>

We have not looked at the specific way in which it is proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Much has been written and researched at the ESRI about the effects of the co-existence of public and private care within public hospitals.  Clearly, private practice in public hospitals has an effect on public waiting lists and there is a body of research that supports that view.  However, we have not looked specifically at what the consequences would be of implementing the policy in that way.</p></speech>

It it appreciated.</p> <p>  My first question is about care of the elderly.  The report states there are now approximately 640,000 people over 66 years of age and that the figure will be 1.1 million by 2030.  The current ratio of people in nursing homes and community hospitals - there are approximately 23,500 under the fair deal scheme - is 27,000.  That figure might be wrong, but that is the one I have worked out.  On that basis, if by 2030 there will be 1.1 million people over 66 years of age, 46,000 nursing home or community hospital beds will be required.  There must be a better way of dealing with this issue.  Obviously, the way to deal with it is by expanding home care services.  There is an urgent need to fast-track their expansion.  That ties into the workload of GPs.  If one expands home care services, one will also expand the amount of work GPs must do.  Has there been consideration of how we should deal with that challenge?  There would be a huge cost involved.  The fair deal scheme costs approximately &euro;1 billion per annum.  If the number is increased to 46,000 by 2030, it will probably cost &euro;2.5 billion or even &euro;3 billion to fund it.  There is also the issue of value for money.  Is there a better way of doing it through home care provision?  How does one improve it?  That is an issue we must examine.</p> <p>  My second question is for Dr. O'Dowd.  It concerns the lack of a connection between GPs and the hospital system.  I recently spoke to somebody who works in Canada as a GP.  If a patient is pregnant, the GP can go to the hospital and carry out the delivery.  We seem to have a system under which GPs cannot even make a telephone call to consultants.  I am not blaming any single group for this.  I am not blaming consultants as they will say they are extremely busy and that it is not easy to set time aside do do it.  However, we have a problem in training hospital doctors.  Many are dropping out of the system, particularly out of obstetrics and gynaecology.  I met two people recently who had spent six years training in that area and dropped out because of the stress levels and demands made.  I met another person who had trained for nine years but who was going on to general practice training to become a GP.  The people referred have huge skills, but there is no opportunity for them to do some hours in the local hospital in the area in which they live.  There does not appear to be the same apparent disconnect in other countries.  Has that issue been examined?</p> <p>  I was speaking to members of the National Association of General Practitioners and met some of the young doctors in the association, every one of whom was afraid of setting up practice on his or her own.  They were afraid they would not have sufficient income.  I put forward the idea of four three-hour sessions per week in a hospital, which would mean that they would know that they would definitely be paid.  They were quite enthusiastic about that suggestion, but there is no system in place to allow it, even to allow them to work in emergency departments and establish that connection with the hospital.  We do not appear to have done this.  Should we consider it and look at how other countries do it, where there is a direct link between hospitals and general practitioners?  That is one of the problems.</p> <p>  The other issue is that the composition of the GP cohort has changed substantially in the past ten or 15 years.  There are many young GPs who have young families and are trying to achieve a work-life balance between working and caring for their young family.  Does Dr. O'Dowd envisage a change in that cohort in the next ten or 20 years and, if so, how do we plan for it?</p> <p>  The next issue ties into that matter and relates to a GP working from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.  As a large percentage of the population find it difficult to get time off work to go to their GP, they tend to visit their GP after 6 p.m.  Do we need to examine the hours GPs are available?  I accept that they are available under the out-of-hours service contract, but the problem is that one will not see the same doctor each time.  If one visits a doctor on a Tuesday, the same doctor will not be there if one returns on Thursday night.  Do we need to examine that issue?  How do we incentivise GPs to be available on a reasonably regular basis after 6 p.m?  In fairness, some practices operate after 6 p.m., but many find it difficult to do so because of the demands on GPs.  It is something we must consider.</p> <p>  The final issue relates to the roll-out of the scheme for children under six years of age.  The big complaint among GPs is about how the scheme has increased the demands on them.  They say that in many cases people are calling unnecessarily.  If we are considering rolling out a free GP scheme for children under the ages of 12 and 18 years, what changes should be made to ensure there will be a balance between people who really need to see a GP and the overuse of a free service?  It appears that if we roll out a free scheme for those under 12 years of age, it will create such a demand on the GPs that they will be unable to cope.  For example, I heard from one GP that a family had called 19 times in a very short period.  There was nothing wrong with the child, but there was obviously a concern on the part of the parent.  It might well have been a genuine concern, but the GP felt the scheme for the under six year olds had created its own pressures and that GPs were finding it difficult.  If we wish to extend the scheme to children under 12 and 18 years old, what changes should be made?</p> <p>  I again thank the delegates for the research they have carried out and the contributions they have made.</p></speech>

I believe the last one which was called the fire brigade model was drawn up in 1970, but things have moved on very much since.  Mr. Keegan alluded to the fact that people were living longer with chronic illnesses.</p> <p>  The idea has been expressed that in the future there will be no health insurance and that people will be seen on the basis of need rather than money.  Do the delegates think this is possible, viable and realistic?  I note their comments on technology.  At this committee last week I brought up a technological matter with the Minister which had to do with the very poor broadband service in Bantry General Hospital.  It is having a detrimental effect on the services the very good doctors there can offer.  Do the delegates often come across similar issues?  There is not only a question about the technology but also the lack of broadband, particularly in rural hospitals.</p></speech>

We are underselling ourselves.</p> <p>  The statistics which have been presented by the delegates are very interesting.  I note the anticipated increase in the size of the population.  Are there ways to update the data on a regular basis?  They are three years out of date if the base year was 2015.  To what extent can they be updated to give a snapshot on a regular or annual basis?</p> <p>  The very sizeable projected increase in the population will depend, of course, on economic progress.  Are there projections for the increase in demand under the various headings, for example, paediatrics, maternity services and home care services?  We have received some information in that regard, but can the delegates update it for us?</p> <p>  I note the reference to public hospitals accounting for 85% of the total number of inpatient bed days and private hospitals accounting for 15%.  Do the delegates have suggestions for how, in the short term, the private hospitals could assist where there are particular bottlenecks at specific times?</p> <p>  I am sorry about the questions which I am formulating as they come into my mind.  </p> <p>  On the rapidly ageing population, I get a little sensitive, as one does and as the Chairman knows.  With the very large expected increase in the size of the population, what age group is expected to be the most demanding?  Obviously, there will be a cohort of young people.  There must be a huge counterbalance in the form of the younger generation, including children and young professionals coming into the country.  To what extent have the delegates incorporated it into their findings?</p> <p>  Traditional GP practices have changed.  That is correct.  I remember that in my county once upon a time we had the third or fourth generation GPs in the one hospital, the old district hospital, who took great pride in their role.  They were traditional, committed to their vocation and their word was the rule.  There was a huge degree of patient satisfaction and it was very seldom that things went wrong, including in maternity wings, in the old hospitals.  Is there anything we should learn from it?  Can we learn from the traditional GP practice where a son or a daughter entered the practice which was carried on in the particular area, leading to huge patient satisfaction and their reliance on the GPs?  Has that practice ceased?  Has the chain or link been broken and, if so, to what extent?</p> <p>  A question comes to mind about the new services coming onstream.  My colleague referred to the under-sixes scheme, which does place a demand on services.  What has the benefit been?  Has there been a diagnosis of issues in particular areas that would not have come to the attention of the practices otherwise?  Of what consequent benefit has it been in streamlining services?</p> <p>  The Chairman will be glad to know that I will come to an abrupt halt in a minute.  </p> <p>  There was a question about the out-of-hours service.  It is a good service, but there have been some issues with it such as the lack of continuity, the lack of knowledge of the patient and so on.  Sometimes that can be good as a new or second opinion can pick up on something that was not noticed previously.  Do the delegates have any comment to make in that regard?</p> <p>  I do not think the running of a business should be part and parcel of the burden of running a medical practice.  A way or means has to be found to deal with that issue.  Running a business can be a stressful activity.  As we all know, it can divert attention to a huge extent, particularly during an economic downturn, which can sap the energy of all those involved to an extent that outweighs the benefit of having this model of the GP being the employer, etc.  There are far too many more urgent issues to which they should be able to attend.  I know that GPs have mixed views on this issue, but it looks to me as though some element of a salaried system will have to be introduced, for some GPs or a period of time, initially at least.  It is hugely beneficial for practices to have people with experience who built a practice over a number of years.  That means building a business also, but that is neither here nor there.  The point is that they have dedicated themselves to it.  There are surgeries at 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. and they also make house calls.  That did not come easy and it entailed a huge commitment, with time being taken out of their lives.  How do we reward that commitment?  What model do the delegates have in mind to possibly recognise the input and contribution made and the loss of time incurred in family life and so on?  We want to provide the best possible service for the general public which, as we all know, can be demanding, but we live in competitive and demanding times and it now expects the highest possible quality of service.</p> <p>  Back in the old days, pharmacists had a different role.  They were effectively GPs and regarded as such.  Over time that has changed and they are now dispensing drugs on prescription and so on.  Is there a need for a re-evaluation of their role to give them an opportunity to participate more actively in the delivery of services to the community?</p></speech>

We project that demand will increase from approximately 29,000 residents now - we are including not only people in the fair deal scheme but people in short-stay beds, transitional care beds, palliative care beds and so on - to a range from 40,700 to 44,600, depending on our assumptions about population and about the evolution of health and disability as people age.  We adopt a pretty optimistic view of the evolution of disability in line with recent trends in Ireland.  These projections see the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in residential long-term care dropping from 4.5% of the population in 2015  to between 3.9% and 4.4%.  What that underlines is that we have quite a challenge in meeting the demand for residential long-term care, even at our most optimistic.  The additional places would range between somewhere over 11,000 to over 15,000 at our highest projection.  That is based on optimistic assumptions about people living longer, healthier and less disabled lives.</p> <p>  The Senator alluded to home care demand.  We see that in parallel with there being a very considerable increase in demand for home care of a similar proportion, 40% to 50% or over 50%, which would mean an addition of some 5.4 million to 7.7 million home help hours over those years by 2030.  There is a substantial challenge in terms of both of those.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Keegan, will address some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Keegan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#P00600"><p>I will address some of Deputy Durkan's questions, particularly his first one on updating data on a regular basis.  That is a good point.  It is something we have considered and that we hope to do, particularly in light of the uncertainties of these projection models in terms of where there will be population growth, changes in activity rates and so on.</p> <p>  We have a huge number of data agreements with both public and private providers because of the fragmented nature of the system for our base year 2015 and our activity data on which these models are predicated for 2015.  Those data agreements are largely rolling and, therefore, we can update them to access more up to date data.  An issue is that there will always be a lag between the availability of data and our ability to run projections.  For example, by the time 2017-18 data are available and have been provided by our data providers, it could be 2021 by the time we get that 2017-18 data.  There are those types of lags in place between when data become available and running our projections but as the research progresses, we hope to continually update and validate our models.</p></speech>

Therefore, it will be possible to show the sensitivity of our projections to any different view about population.  In some areas our data will be updated more rapidly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Keegan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#P00800"><p>On the question on demand increases for particular types of care, for example, for paediatrics and maternity care, in our acute analysis of public hospital care, given the scope of this report, we have not focused on particular areas such as paediatrics, rather we have focused on demand increases, for example, for day patients cases, inpatient discharges, inpatient bed days and so on.  We focus on maternity services as a separate area of activity, the reason being it involves all women, they are in a particular age range, they report particular diagnoses and they generally have a lower average length of stay than the rest of those reporting to hospital in terms of discharges.  Maternity services is an interesting case as it is one of the areas of activity under one of our assumptions where we see a reduction in demand by 2030.  The reason for that is that in one of our population scenarios there is an absolute reduction in the number of women aged 30 to 39, who also have the highest specific fertility rate, which leads to lower births over time, although the positive effect of migration helps dampen that effect.  When we model higher population growth through time, we see an increase in demand for maternity services, but it is in an interesting area in that in one of our main projections we see a decrease in demand.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan had another question related to the age groups that experience most demand for health care services.  That will differ across our different activities and in all our different sectoral chapters in the report we provide graphs of activity rate distributions across the age distribution.  The Deputy can note that relationship between age and activity or demand.  In general, as most of the members of the committee can probably guess, as individuals age, there is an increase in the intensity of use of most services.  That is particularly strong if we consider examples of measures such as inpatient bed days where much of that activity in captured among older ages, partly because that is a combination of both older people reporting to hospital more often and they stay longer in hospital.  There is quite a amount of activity located among older age groups.  Also, in terms of services used mainly by people such as home care services and long-term care services, much of that activity is concentrated among those in older age groups.</p> <p>  Regarding general practitioner, GP, services, we see an increase across age distribution but also in the middle of the age distribution there is quite a high level of activity.  That would also come across for emergency department care, where we see activity increasing as individuals get older but there is quite a relatively large bulk of activity in the middle of the age distribution.</p> <p>  In terms of these projections, as a general rule, the more activity tends to be concentrated in those in older age groups, all else being equal, the larger we are seeing projected demand increases as the population grows and ages through our projection horizon.</p></speech>

Capital development is easier, of that there is no doubt.  There is also the matter of human capital.  As regards what specialties we need in the future, we need a workforce that takes on board ongoing training and that must be adaptable.</p><p>If we appoint a number of cardiothoracic consultants and cardiologists get on with stenting people, so that there are no more bypass operations, we will have a problem so there has to be flexibility in the system.</p><p> Managers have improved in the use of the data.  They used to be administrators but are now involved in management and data cannot be left just to doctors.  Policy makers, politicians and managers have to be involved.</p><p> If something does not work and we are left on a mountain without any trousers, we are in a very difficult position.  All systems are on a journey and all are orientating themselves towards primary care.  I have divided the systems into new and old.  The old systems, such as ours and those of the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand and Scotland, provide a really good service and a broad range of trusted services to patients.  The new systems provide a lot of data and include Vermont, which has legislated primary care into its system.  The governor recently ran for election and was re-elected on health care, even though health care usually takes a back seat to economics in elections.  He ran for election on a programme of reorientating the system towards primary care.  His rationale was essentially economic because for every dollar he put into primary care he saved $5.  Dr. Craig Jones headed up the policy and published the results.  Nobody is visiting Ireland to say they want to see our wonderful health care system and replicate it.  Even the countries of the Middle East do not come here and they have lots of money to spend on American-style hospitals.</p><p> The point about nurses is right.  I come from a family of nurses and they bend my ear regularly about how badly they have been treated.  We need to look at practices and at having nurses as partners so that they are involved in the decision making.</p><p> There has been a lot of talk about pharmacies.  I would like it if we could send prescriptions online to the local pharmacist as it would make my life, and that of patients, a lot easier.  There are regulatory issues in respect of this, about which the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, have to get together but pharmacists would be able to reorientate their IT systems very quickly.  It may limit patient choice but it would increase patient safety.</p><p> Senator Dolan's questions go to the core of the issue.  Things are not joined up and the GP-hospital interaction is often poor or non-existent.  The IT systems are completely different and if they change their IT in my hospital they never even tell us, even though we are the people who refer patients.  It is poor.  There was a question on access to procedures and I do not see why I cannot refer patients indirectly to the room where they carry out gastroscopies or colonoscopies.</p><p> The other area where we have to join things up is the local community.  In my own, we have nearly 300 self-help organisations, many funded by the State, and we now have a member of staff who keeps a library of these organisations, to whom we now refer patients.  Our consulting rate and our prescribing of psychotropics has gone down for those patients, whom we have entered into the social prescribing module.  This is a very interesting area and is something we have stolen from the US, where there is a lot of volunteer activity.</p><p> I am always asked if the system can cope.  The system analysis is predicated on things not coping and if these do not change they become unaffordable.  We have an American-style system of inappropriate secondary care built on an old British-style system of general practice, as Deputy Durkan described it.  The two do not mix and there is a systematic bias, which is driven increasingly by private health insurers.  We all have private health insurance and when I came back to Ireland I was told to make sure to get my VHI in line because, if anything happened, I would not be able to afford it.  People took out insurance unquestioningly and it is rising in price, incentivising inappropriate and secondary care.</p><p> Senator Burke spoke about the lack of connection between GP and hospital, which I have dealt with.  Many people get years of training and people often say we "end up in general practice" which upsets us because we do not want to think of ourselves as ending up anywhere.  The system has become very inflexible and rigid.  One of my colleagues, who is very well trained in dermatology, does a session in the local hospital on dermatology but is not paid much for it.  She does it because she is interested and because it is a skill and an area of medicine she loves.  Many of my colleagues are getting involved in teaching because medical schools are expanding teaching in general practice, though it is not as well remunerated.  There will be more than 200 GP trainees this year and they all need mentors and teachers.  There was a good question on the GP cohort over the next ten years and there are interviews today for new GPs to start in July.  Between 70% and 80% of those will be female and this is a factor in workforce planning, to which Deputy O'Reilly referred.  Both males and females are working less but this is true to a lesser extent in the case of females, who also retire earlier.  This would not have happened 20 years ago so we need to build it into workforce planning.</p><p> There is a huge conflict between dedication and availability.  GPs are like everybody else and at every meeting to which I go there is a module on self-care, because the job is so stressful.  They say we should not be available all the time but should look after ourselves but that leads to a conflict.  On the other hand, it is good for the GP and for the system if a patient sees the same GP all the time.  Incentives work and if one incentivises the availability of GPs after 6 p.m. it will work, even if they are not available at 9 p.m.  Young people take their children from the cr&egrave;che and bring them to the out-of-hours service when it opens, which has driven demand in that sector.</p><p> I was also asked about changes in respect of under sixes and I believe a report on the out-of-hours service is coming out shortly.  I think it may be quite imaginative in its approach.  We will need to tell people about managing minor illness.</p><p>I think we have overdone it on meningitis.  Everyone who comes in with a snotty-nosed child with a rash thinks it is meningitis.  We have got that message through but now everyone is fearful about it, rather than having heard a complex message.  Online stuff works with young parents as does telemedicine, which is to say telephone conversations over FaceTime or the old-fashioned way.  We had a meeting with the CEO of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which looks after 9 million US veterans who can be quite damaged people.  She told us that from a primary care point of view, 50% of the administration's consultations are by telephone.  People are willing to use the telephone albeit one has to develop new skills and there is clearly a risk.</p><p> Moving on to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question on thoughts about the new contract, to call it a "fire brigade contract" was a good way to put it.  The problem is that with modern contracts, people are moving the dial, as the Americans say.  They move the dial every five years.  The idea that a contract will see out several generations is bad management.  We need a contract for five years so that in five years time when behaviour has improved or set, or things, including diseases, change, one changes the contract.  One has that expectation.  Our negotiators need to be in permanent negotiation.  Things change and people take on new stuff and it needs to be much more flexible than it is.  It needs also to be based on incentives.  Sole traders respond to incentives.  That is very unfashionable to say in some quarters but it is how things work.  When they brought in the National Health Service in the UK in 1948, it almost led to the abolition of general practice.  That almost died off because of the demand.  If one brings in a sudden change at the interface between general practice and the public without some expansion in GPs and allied health professionals, including nurses, the system will collapse.  It is very fragile at the moment, following a long, miserable winter.</p><p> I cannot comment on the lack of broadband for the Deputy, although my family in the west complain about it a lot.  That is their worry-----</p></speech>

That is a blast from the past.  The system I entered was a family business and all kinds of changes have occurred, although one of the practices in Rialto is now in its third generation.  People like that.  A lack of continuity with the out-of-hours service is inevitable.  In my own out-of-hours system, there were 50 doctors.  As such, it is inevitable where one is on once every 50 sessions.  The other thing is that the IT system we use in the out-of-hours service is not linked with the IT system we use in practice.  As such, there is quite a bit of development to be done there.</p> <p>  As to introducing a salaried system, GPs are big employers of other GPs.  As such, there is already a salaried system.  It is not an exploitative relationship, but there are set rules.  GPs employ other GPs as assistants on a salaried or sessional basis.  It is not a new system.</p></speech>

Parents come home after the cr&egrave;che has phoned to say that little Johnny needs to see the doctor.  I have no evidence for the following so I have to be careful about it.  From my own work, the prescribing of antibiotics may have fallen because we can now say to a parent that if an under six child does not get better within three or four days, he or she can bring the child back to the surgery.  Usually, as is the nature of minor illness, it is a bit better in three or four days.  That is an important advantage.</p></speech>

Our problem here is that we have something like 1,700 different computer systems in our health service currently.  In Denmark, they have 25 and are working down towards five.  I understand that in Denmark there is a patient medication card.  If one is in hospital or with a doctor, it is possible to get one's file up from the card and to put the prescription on it.  One gets the card back and brings it to the pharmacy which can get the prescription from its computer rather than to have it hand-written.  Has that been looked at from an Irish point of view?</p></speech>

I am aware of it.  One can never get around the fact that talking about the Irish health service is a misnomer; they are Irish health services.  People have voted to have a private and a public system.  Even if one brings that in, one is bringing it in for less than 42% of the population.  One is always dancing around this kind of thing.  If one has a universal system - and I do not think it matters whether private insurers or a state pays for it - one can bring in things like that with less cost and more utilisation.  At the moment, however, people mention it, but they do not mention the downstream effects of having this kind of system that people seem to want.</p></speech>

We can all disagree about elements of how one gets there, but the reality is that it is the norm throughout Europe and, therefore, possible and realistic in all neighbouring countries and many other parts of the world.  Universal health coverage is a World Health Organization objective and one it is promoting strongly.  That should tell us that we are playing catch up here.  Of course, it should be possible and realistic.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare promoted universal care delivered on the basis of need not the ability to pay.  That was its founding principle.  One of the principal recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, as with many others, is that there must be a fundamental shift from hospital care to primary, community and social care.  I think that is accepted.  Another major chapter in Sl&aacute;intecare related to integrating primary and secondary care.  They are currently fragmented.  There is a huge financial loss in the failure to integrate.  If one integrates services, there will undoubtedly be savings.  That is not to say the health service will be cheaper, but one will get better value for money if the service is integrated.  Does the ESRI have the capacity to project the cost of adopting the Sl&aacute;intecare reform plan?  How long would that take?</p><p>One of the objections we hear from Government is it is a costly process.  The first question we were asked is how much it will cost and when we said &euro;5 .8 billion, which was our projected cost, the Government said it did not agree with our costings and would do its own.  During the deliberations of the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, the Minister said we would have to wait until the Sl&aacute;intecare report came out before we talk about health reform.  The report has come out; it is now nine months since it was published and the Minister has not produced his response to the report.  There is a huge delay in implementing reform.  One of those is as a result of costings.  If the ESRI could project costings, it would be an advantage.</p><p> Can the ESRI project the number of GPs that will be needed should a universal system come into play in which there is universal coverage in primary care?  How many GPs would be needed to deliver that, given the changing demographics and the unmet need we have at the moment?</p><p> The question for Professor O'Dowd is on the fact we are in the middle of a manpower crisis.  It is not coming; it is here already.  We have 660 GPs over the age of 60.  Our younger GPs are looking at our GMS contract and saying it is a 24-7, 365 days a year contract in which the doctor pays for everything and takes on all the responsibility.  I have a feeling the GP negotiations are not producing a new GP contract; they are producing chronic care on the back of the existing contract.  That will not attract our young GPs in.  Will Professor O'Dowd speak about that?  </p><p> There is a difficulty with the visitation rates.  The visitation rate mentioned was 5.63, but many people feel it is far more likely to be 8.  If one is going to develop costings on developing general practice and one is out by 33% or 40%, it will lead to difficulties in costings.  Will Professor O'Dowd refer to visitation rates, which refer to how often one has visited one's GP in the past year?  It is an interesting question to ask patients because they cannot remember.  If one asks a person how often he or she has visited his or her GP in the past two weeks or past four weeks, one will get an accurate answer which might produce more accurate visitation rates.  Visitation rates to general practice refer to face-to-face contact with one's GP.  If a GP sees 40 patients in a day, his practice nurse may have seen 20 or 25 patients that day.  He may have made 20 phone calls which make material difference to the care of a patient.  Combined, that amounts to 80 interactions.  The nurse may have had ten or 12 interactions which affect patients' care.  In that case, a practice has only seen 40 patients face-to-face but has generated 100 consultations.  They are not picked up in any of the data but are a huge part of practice work.  </p><p> Will Professor O'Dowd comment on the morale of general practice which is a serious issue at the moment and is inhibiting younger GPs coming into the profession?  </p></speech>

The development of the model came from previous work the ESRI did which was costing a previous proposal for universal health insurance based on the 2014 White Paper.  When we developed the model, we did it very much with a view to being able to cost future such reform proposals.  Having said that, we still have to develop the expenditure phase.  The committee is very conscious of time and delay but realistically it will be at least another year before we have the expenditure phase fully developed.  It will probably be somewhat longer than that but then the ESRI should be very well placed to cost reforms like Sl&aacute;intecare.  Based on our earlier work looking at the cost of universal health insurance, we have some forthcoming work looking at the cost of free GP care alone on various assumptions.  It is possible with the data and knowledge available to us to look at discrete components of the reform in that way.  What the Chairman said about visiting rates and their pertinence to cost is very much on point.  We based the work we did recently on the Healthy Ireland survey, which uses four-week recall and includes phone consultations and separately records practice nurse visits.  We feel we have a much better base now so in our recent costing, we looked at both the 12-month recall and four-week recall periods for GP visiting.</p></speech>

We will send the committee the data we have on Healthy Ireland visiting rates.  It is a survey that was established and administered by the Department of Health.  In terms of projecting the number of GPs that would be needed with universal coverage in primary care, we have done two separate exercises.  We looked at the potential for increased visiting as a result of universal access to primary care and universal health insurance.  Our finding was that visiting by people who did not previously hold a medical card or GP visit card would in aggregate increase by about 49%.  That translated into an 18% increase in visiting as a whole across the entire population.  If the same proportion of care was delivered by GPs on the same model of care, we could translate that into a <i>pro rata</i>figure of an 18% increase.  In addition, we have projected the effects of population growth and ageing.  Clearly there is a substantial demand coming down the track.  In the work we have done, we have looked at ways in which that could be met and the cost could be reduced by changing the skill mix between general practitioners and practice nurses.</p></speech>

It has been in the media and has filtered through to people so patients now think things are better because they are hearing about it.  The hospitals drive GPs mad saying the patient needs a particular test and asking the GP to organise it because they believe he or she has better access than the hospital.  It drives GPs mad because we do not have that access.  As a result of all the talk going on, the sense on the street is that things have changed and that GPs are better resourced than they were.  All it has been is talk; there have been no resources.  It has impacted very much on our young colleagues.  We spoke to them in this report.  I would be very sad if the contract amounted to chronic care bolted on to what we are doing at the moment.  They talk about wanting to build a team, better support for patient care and a new career structure.  It is a new contract they want, not a revised one.  Morale is very brittle.  February is resignation month in general practice.  One thinks one has gotten over the winter and then something else comes along so it is always a difficult time.</p> <p>  I am more worried about the business basis of general practice.  It is unstable.  This morning while I am attending at the committee, I put in a locum who will make more than I will for the morning.  That is a zombie business.  It is what the BMA calls a zombie business.  It is not a stable business on which to build anything.  Deputy Kelleher is right.  It is a paradox that we are trying to develop a new system based on our weakest link.  It presents political, medical and other kinds of risk.  There is a thing called the primary care paradox, which exists internationally.  In order to change the system of care, people are looking at something that is probably the weakest link in the system.  It is a profound question. </p></speech>

Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to it - GP lists are closed.  There is the growing entity of walk-in GP clinics.  A GP sets up on a street corner and anyone can just walk in.  There is no continuity of care.  It is a one-off consultation.  It is easily accessible by the public.  It is probably cheaper but it does not give the quality of care that we know comes with the continuity of care of an established general practice.</p> <p>  The other development is, because GPs are disillusioned with the present contractual arrangements which have decimated by the FEMPI application to GP funding, GPs are looking for a way out of practice and are now becoming corporatised.  There are corporate entities coming into general practice which are taking over practices.  GPs see it as a retirement package.  It is an exit strategy for them.  It makes sense.  However, for the patient to be looked after by a corporate entity rather than by a practice entity will not be good for the patient or the population in the long run.  Professor O'Dowd might comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Tom O'Dowd" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018021400002#T00200"><p>On the walk-in, we cannot be overly romantic about general practice.  No doubt my children, who are young adults, and others are not terribly interested in having a relationship with a GP because they want to go in for what they want, they want to be seen on time, they want it to be reasonable and they want to leave.  However, that is the demographic that suits the walk-in.  Many of the walk-in clinics are based on that business.</p> <p>  Once people start having children themselves or once they start developing illnesses, they want a trusted person who, as the Law Society says, is in their corner.  They very much need that.  Because the hospitals have become so difficult, one needs somebody who is able to advocate on one's behalf for the local hospital.  Sad and all as it is, one needs that.</p> <p>  On corporatisation, I have seen some of my colleagues who have been corporatised and I must say they looked much better than I did when they had done the deal.  However, I cannot say that it is good for general practice because the very nature of a corporation is that one can be bought and sold.  If one is sold on to another corporation which wants the practice done differently and always cheaper, and it will have shareholders, it takes stuff out of the system.  It is a tricky area.  Corporatisation is small at present.  We measured it in our last survey of general practice.  It is growing because I see it growing on the ground.</p> <p>  There are strong defenders of the corporate system.  I have read what some of those who are employed by the corporates say.  I am also aware of somebody who has left a corporate system because she did not like it.  It is not for everybody.  The big issue is it introduces another instability into the business model of general practice.</p> <p>  For the rural areas, it is only a matter of time from what I can see, if we are having difficulty appointing rural doctors, until there is a corporate response with GPs moving in for particular times during the day and moving out.  People will want doctors in rural areas but if our current GP registrars and trainees do not want to work in single-handed practices, we cannot square that circle.  It leaves patients vulnerable.  If corporatisation gets a view on it and if they copy, say, an Australian model that works, then it introduces yet another vulnerability.</p></speech>

One would put two GPs in a practice and they would work 60% opposite each other so that each would be there three days a week, they would overlap one day a week and the rest of their commitment would be to the university or to a hospital department.  One would have an academic career, a service career and a hospital career rolled into a package.  One might sign up for a two-year contract on this and then the training scheme or the university would roll that over.  One could have at least a supply of service to practices which were unsuccessful in attracting a doctor but here one would have GPs rotating through that practice, providing a service but also giving the doctor the opportunity to expand his or her career.</p></speech>

The universities, as they have gone, and the medical schools that I can talk more knowledgeably about, have reneged on their social contract with society.  The pressure is on to publish, get research grants, etc., but medical schools have an important local leadership.  What the Chairman described is a local leadership model that has no teaching without service, which is an excellent model.  We do not have the universities honouring the social contract that they have with society and they have gone down a North American model.  The model to which the Chairman refers is a particularly nice one.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to just put a phone on silent mode, as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>Today we are considering the reports, Finding a Home - Families' Journeys out of Homelessness, and Keeping a Home - Preventing Families from Becoming Homeless.  On behalf of the committee I welcome, from Focus Ireland, Mr. Mike Allen and Ms Sarah Sheridan, and also Dr. Kathy Walsh, Mr. Brian Harvey and Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Siochr&uacute; who are independent research consultants of social issues.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the witnesses attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The opening statements of today's meeting will be shared by Mr. Allen and the authors of the reports.  I call on Mr. Allen to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The main business is to hear from the researchers but I just want to make a couple of introductory remarks.</p> <p>  People will know Focus Ireland because of the work we do, namely, our services providing support to prevent homelessness or support people out of homelessness right across Ireland.  Last year, we worked with more than 14,000 people, to prevent them from becoming homeless or sort them out, or provide them with housing - we are one of the largest approved housing bodies in the country.  Right from the beginning, Focus Ireland has argued that we need to understand homelessness better.  We cannot just assume we know what it is and what works to solve it.  We have an ambitious research programme in recent years which shines a light on our own services to learn what works but also gives wider information to help public and policy understanding of what types of interventions work to end homelessness.  That is very much the context in which these reports were commissioned.</p> <p>  At one level, the reports reflect areas of work which Focus Ireland is very proud of and successful in.  Last year alone, we supported more than 700 families who were in homeless services into secure housing.  That is the highest ever, and is probably the largest single contribution of any organisation to that goal of moving people out of homelessness, and similar effectiveness in terms of the prevention work which will emerge in the two pieces of research.</p> <p>  The main conclusions we would draw the committee's attention to are as follows.  First, prevention works.  It is meaningful and important to prevent people from becoming homeless and we should be doing much more of that.  The sort of prevention work which people may be more familiar with is the advice and information.  What comes from this piece of work is the role of case management in preventative work.  Really intense human-to-human interaction is important.</p> <p>  It is also important to look at the way in which these services and the research reports were funded.  More than half of Focus Ireland's funding comes from State contracts, but it is important to see in these pieces of work the role of corporate sponsors and partners.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy funded the prevention programme that is being looked at here and part-funded its evaluation while in the area of exits from homelessness, the main funder of services is the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive but also, particularly in the area of the child support work, Tusla and the HSE.</p> <p>  In the area of supporting families out of homelessness, we are saying prevention works even when there is huge pressure on housing.  It is also possible to move families and individual households out of homelessness even when there is insufficient affordable housing.  Obviously, the ultimate answer to the problem we are facing involves a significant increase in the amount of affordable secure housing that is available to everybody but there is meaningful work we can be doing in the right policy context, even in the current context.</p> <p>  Those are the main points that we are drawing to the committee's attention.  We also circulated our research strategy to the committee to show the broad range of research interests that we have and we would be happy to discuss that further with any Deputy or Senator who wishes to ask.</p></speech>

Its defining feature is that it looks at those who were at risk of homelessness and managed to avoid it.  The main reasons for that risk fall into two primary categories.  The first is notice to quit, of which landlords selling property accounted for 40%.</p><p>Family members moving in accounted for nearly half of all notices to quit.  Then there were those who could not pay their rent, either because of arrears or rent increases.  Some 14% of people had to move out because of direct rent increases.  Overall, approximately 80% had experienced notices to quit or simply could not pay for where they were living, which does not come as a surprise but does say a lot.</p><p> A number of Focus Ireland's strategies worked and helped people to avoid homelessness.  First was building families' awareness of their rights and entitlements and providing clear directions to them.  Understandably, most did not know what these were.  Many had never experienced anything like this before.  A second strategy was assisting families to navigate the State systems, which enabled them to access their rights and entitlements by going to meetings, advocating with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, writing letters to State agencies, etc.  A third strategy was coaching families on how to find properties.  Many needed this help, particularly because they were in vulnerable situations dealing with agents and landlords and overcoming or getting around the latter's prejudices.  A fourth strategy was supporting families to access financial assistance when they found somewhere.  In particular, the housing assistance payment, HAP, was just coming into being and was a major factor for families, but many landlords did not want to engage with it at that point.  A fifth strategy was bringing prevention services together in an integrated package and adding to them the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, counselling and other services that were available.</p><p> It was this combination of supports that worked, and we know that it worked because, between three and 15 months afterwards, 34 of the 35 families interviewed had succeeded in avoiding homelessness.  They told us which supports had worked and how they had worked.  That is our evidence.  It is not just a question of what worked, but also how - the "how" of prevention - it worked when dealing with each family's complex circumstances.</p><p> Any family from any background, economic status, ethnicity or culture can be at risk of homelessness.  When approaching services and others, prejudice can put families that are already under stress under even greater stress and reduce their resilience and motivation.  Being non-judgmental does the opposite and builds their motivation.  The case management approach is effective.  Families need personalised, timely, flexible and hands-on support.  They also require integrated and varied packages of support that are tailored to their needs.</p><p> Regarding short-term versus medium-term solutions, prevention services can only hope to achieve short-term solutions.  We can see that with many people returning to homelessness after a period of being able to avoid it.  While these solutions support families in crisis, they cannot address the structural causes.  Alongside the evidence, the interviewees propose that long-term and medium-term solutions involve an effective implementation of HAP - they did not find it effective at that time, although matters have improved - improved regulation of the private rental sector and an increased supply of social housing.  These are the interviewees' own views.  They are quite well informed about what needs to be done after their experiences with Focus Ireland.</p></speech>

It involved interviews with a cross-section of 25 families across the four Dublin local authority areas.  I will cover three findings: what enabled people to exit homelessness; what inhibited people from exiting it; and what were the factors that helped people to sustain their tenancies.  Mr. Harvey will present on the conclusions and recommendations.</p> <p>  We identified three exit enablers, the first of which was the availability of support, specifically information and case management support from Focus Ireland workers; support from child support workers where available; and support from family and friends.  The second enabler was the capacity and tenacity of parents to engage with local authorities and private rental landlords.  This linked to their time spent in homelessness.  The longer they were in homelessness, the less able they appeared to be to engage with those different structures.  The third enabler was the particular family circumstances.  Some families had certain reasons for trying to get out of emergency accommodation, for example, an unplanned pregnancy, someone was unwell or claustrophobia was an issue.  These were drivers.</p> <p>  Of the inhibitors from exiting homelessness, the first was the high stress levels and negative emotions linked to living in emergency accommodation.  The consequences include relationship breakdown, addiction, behavioural problems in children and poor performance in school.  The second was the lack of suitable affordable accommodation in general and in preferred areas of Dublin, specifically near family supports and schools.  The third was the lack of case management and child support work.  Families often had to wait a long time before being allocated a key worker.  The fourth was the practical difficulties associated with finding the necessary child care to enable parents to attend accommodation viewings and secure accommodation.</p> <p>  In contrast, the five factors that helped sustain new tenancies were: affordable rent, ideally deducted at source, with a sense of security for families lucky enough to have been allocated local authority or approved housing body, AHB, accommodation, which was a game changer; the quality, suitability and location of accommodation where it was close to families, friends and schools that made life much easier; the availability of the exceptional needs payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which was a considerable support in fitting out accommodation and enabling families to avoid falling into unnecessary debt; where families had previous experience of living independently, matters moved more quickly, but where families had not lived independently previously, it was a significant challenge; and the shorter the length of time a family spent in homelessness, the quicker the parents and the children were able to adjust to independent living.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Harvey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#D00400"><p>Our first finding was that panic and high stress levels were families' first issue on becoming homeless, followed by a long period of less intense but accumulating stress with boredom and poor conditions.  School was a key stress point.  Many families lose all their possessions at the point of homelessness.  While we need long-term solutions to family homelessness, alleviating stress while homeless is equally important.</p> <p>  Families strongly favoured local authority accommodation because of its security, affordability, standard and location in communities that they knew.  They liked AHBs.  The HAP system was affordable, but not secure.  They did not favour private renting because of its insecurity, high rents and bad conditions.</p> <p>  A key finding was that the construction programme must be weighted heavily in favour of local authority accommodation.  We must accentuate good practices that enable exits from homelessness and address bad practices that inhibit them.  Many of these are low-cost changes to procedures.  In terms of prevention, we must change the system.  When people first approach local authorities to say that they are about to be made homeless, the authorities tell them to return after they have actually become homeless.  That is not a preventative practice.</p> <p>  There must be an end to the practice of self-accommodation.  It is not in accordance with the law, does not work and causes extreme stress.  There must be an end to substandard and overcrowded emergency accommodation where there is a lack of cooking facilities and play areas for children, some of which we have encountered.  There must be an end to the daily practice of signing in in person or by phone, to be replaced by an electronic or text system, given that this is another significant stress point.  There must be an end to the practice of removing families from the housing waiting list without their knowledge or consent, as it means that they return to the bottom of the list, sometimes after spending many years on it.  Systems of scanning, quality control and independent appeals must be applied.  There must be an end to local authorities' "two strikes and out" policy, to be replaced by a test of what is a reasonable offer or refusal and an independent appeals system.</p> <p>  When homeless people finally move into accommodation, it is important that it be furnished and floored.  Many places people moved to had no floors, so they had to handle that themselves.  There must be improved treatment of homeless people in some of the local authority offices where it is poor currently, with dialogue between local authorities and homeless people and training for local authority staff.  There must be some kind of depot or place where people who have become homeless can leave their possessions and reclaim them afterwards.</p></speech>

These are two really important reports, which is one of the reasons we agreed to bring the witnesses before the committee today to discuss them.  It is not just important to give the witnesses the opportunity to put them on the record, but that after this meeting the committee would write to the Minister specifically requesting him to respond to the recommendations that have been set out in the report because we would like to hear what he has to say.  It is very nice to be having an evidence-based discussion on family homelessness, unlike in one of our previous sessions and it is incumbent on us that we listen to the evidence in that respect.</p> <p>  I wish to make a couple of points, primarily to pick up on some of the points Mr. Harvey's made at the end.  One of the things that has happened since the research has been done is that some local authorities have now changed their procedures for what happens when a family presents before the notice-to-quit period expires.  For example, in South Dublin County Council it now gives families access to homeless HAP rates of payment, probably about two months out from the notice-to-quit date.  It would be better if it did it from an earlier period but that is clearly something that should be standardised across all local authorities because it would give people another tool.</p> <p>  The recommendation on self-accommodation is one of the most important elements in the report, given the additional stress it adds to families.  I do not mean just in terms of financing if one is low on credit but the huge efforts people have to go to.</p> <p>  It is important to state that last year South Dublin County Council made a change to how it treats housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants, partly because it realised, rightly, that families in emergency accommodation who had been on the housing list for a long term had a disincentive to go into HAP accommodation.  What South Dublin County Council has now done is ensured that while one is still put on a HAP transfer list, one still has access to choice-based letting on the same terms as one had prior to opting for HAP.  Essentially, it means that while one is not counted in the top line housing list figures one has access to the primary housing list exactly as one would have done previously, which is a very significant change.  Again, we have raised it with the Minister to say that should be rolled out across all local authorities because, essentially, it means that one's access to council housing and the period of time one waits does not change by going into HAP.  It creates a problem in terms of counting the figures but we can just add the HAP figures to the housing list figures and get over that.</p> <p>  On two strikes and out, where a local authority is using choice-based letting for the majority of its lettings then nobody gets an offer and therefore nobody has to refuse it because one applies for it.  Obviously it is different with emergency accommodation.  I strongly support the recommendation that has been made.  There must be some other way of introducing not an element of choice, because that makes it sound like people are choosing properties willy-nilly, but something that gives the applicant or the family in emergency accommodation some degree of decision-making over it.  I have dealt with offers where, for example, families in emergency accommodation who have children with severe special needs were being offered accommodation directly in front of a canal.  When I say directly, I mean outside the gate of the house with no barrier.  In that case there was a severely autistic 18-year old young man.  On the basis of the information alone one can see how it is inappropriate.  In that particular instance it took us some months of fighting with the local authority to withdraw the offer but one should not have to fight in that way.  The independent appeals process is important.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses had any response from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, the Minister or the Department on the recommendations?  The report is important but unless we get a response from them it will not make a difference.  I am interested to hear about that.  I was at the launch of the report.  I genuinely support the recommendations which tally not only with the research but the experience of many of us who are working with lots of families who are presenting as homeless in emergency accommodation.  It confirms what we already know, anecdotally, in the constituency office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#E00200"><p>We have not had a formal response from either the Department or the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  We would welcome if the committee were to ask for a formal response.  On a day-to-day basis our services would be talking about those issues with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and elsewhere.  A formal response from that quarter is probably less appropriate.</p> <p>  The self-accommodation issue continues to be an enormous problem.  To be clear, what is involved in that is once a family has been assessed as homeless under the legislation by the local authority, the local authority believes that it fulfils its statutory obligation by saying "Go and find yourself somewhere to stay tonight and we will pay for it."  We share the view expressed by Mr. Harvey that it is not a correct interpretation of the intention of the Oireachtas when it passed that legislation or of the people when they changed the Constitution to protect the rights of children.  It is hard to get the number but there are more than 250 families who are still self-accommodating so the concentration in Rebuilding Ireland is whether they are in commercial hotels or in hubs and that is where all this debate has been, but we believe what is equally important is the question of the big difference between being in a commercial hotel and knowing one will be there for six months, and being in a commercial hotel and going to be out tomorrow night and having to look for another place.</p> <p>  There are more than 250 families who have no case manager working with them and they may be waiting for several months.  They complained strongly in the course of the research that they were waiting for a case manager.  There have been several occasions when the homeless executive has funded an additional cohort of case managers in Focus Ireland and we very much welcome and appreciate that expenditure.  The case management ratio is about 20 families to one case worker who is skilled and has a degree in social care and other areas.  What has happened is that every time an additional cohort of case managers has been recruited the total number of homeless families has gone up and therefore recreated a waiting list.</p> <p>  The waiting list for children is even greater.  When a family becomes homeless its needs are assessed when it gets a case manager but our trained staff also assess whether there are particular needs for the children, not just a problem arising from the fact that the family is homeless, which is a problem in itself.  We have a number of child support workers funded by the HSE and Tusla but there is a waiting list for that.  In a situation of a family being homeless where it does not have a case manager and it has been assessed as having additional needs for a child there is a waiting list.  The overall problem of homelessness is so large that people are beginning to have to stand back from it but within the reports certain key things have been identified which could make a substantial difference to the experience of families and children who are homeless and the likelihood of them moving out.  We know from our own work that a family which has a case manager is four times more likely to move out of homelessness than a family which is left to its own devices.  From every point of view it makes sense to invest in an adequate number of case managers.</p></speech>

Even the name is indicative of the exceptionally good job it does.  Everything Deputy &Oacute; Broin said is spot on.  He has hit the nail on the head.  What struck me is all the recurring themes.  I served on a council for more than 20 years so none of this is new to me.</p> <p>  What is really scary is that only two weeks ago I had someone in here who was homeless in another county, not where I was involved, and we made representations to Tusla, the Minister and the local authority and we are still waiting for a response.  I refer to a crisis situation.  I am a Member of the Oireachtas and that is the experience I receive as a public representative.  When one rings up local authorities on a regular basis, which I do, the response I get is that the people whom I represent are not homeless yet.  In one case there was an 80-year old woman living in Dundrum who was being put out of her home.  The local authority said it needed evidence.  I said the woman is vulnerable, she is 80 years of age.  She is in a three-bedroom house that is falling down.  I agreed that it was beyond her needs and capacity but she needs something else.  I was asked whether she was on the homeless list because if not, the local authority was not really interested in talking to her.  I asked if the woman could meet somebody to talk to them but there was no interest in that.</p> <p>  Everything the witnesses said is clear.  I thank them for the evidence based on the personal journeys and experiences they have shared with us through the research.  That makes the result even more profound.  I agree with what was said about taking a non-judgmental approach.  It is about dignity and respect for people in those situations.  That is not the experience of people dealing with local authorities.</p><p>I want to hone in on local authorities because they are the housing authorities.  People are being told to self-refer and get out on the road and get their own place.  I live in south County Dublin, where property is very expensive and it is not possible to rent accommodation, even for many who are employed.  I am glad this report is evidence-based.  There is a need for standard practice across all local authority areas because there is an inconsistency in personnel, staff and approach.  I agree about the need for case managers to be personal advocates, mentors or supporters.  Housing is complex and there are many reasons why people are homeless besides affordability.  It needs a case response, a bigger plan, particularly because many children and vulnerable people with mental health problems and a whole range of issues are affected.</p><p> The witnesses say some local authority practices have been identified as the cause of significant stress to homeless families.  We have talked about some of them here.  Can they share some of that with us?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point that there are strong recommendations here and I do not think anyone on this committee would doubt that we should be pursuing them.  We should bring the Minister back in, get an official response and get timelines for rolling it out.  What are the witnesses recommending in terms of an overall charter of rights for people who are homeless? </p><p> Families favour local authority accommodation over other accommodation.  Why cannot HAP, or some other model, provide the same assurances in respect of affordability, security and choice?  HAP is everywhere and there is not enough social housing.  Location is a priority and Mr. Harvey stated "Families very much favoured local authority accommodation because of its security, affordability, standard and location."  People have said that to me too.  I can see why it is the case.  The gap between HAP and affordability and security and so on is a challenge for all of us.  It strikes me that we need a charter of rights and standard practice across all local authority areas for dealing with people who present as homeless.</p></speech>

They could be put out again quite quickly.  They could not do anything to that home.  If they were in a local authority home, in most cases having a good relationship with local authorities when they were tenants, they felt they could reasonably call it their home.  Legally, they had no long-term rights to be in HAP accommodation.  Generally a person in a local authority home will not be put out unless they are responsible for gravely serious anti-social behaviour.  There is a strong sense of security in local authority accommodation which is not the case in the HAP system.</p> <p>  In respect of the local authority practices, the problem is that the local authorities tend to contest that these problems happen.  There is no point of dialogue between homeless people or organisations working with the homeless and the local authorities to address, name and sort out these issues.  We know of some homeless people who complained about the way they were treated and those complaints went nowhere.  Many of these people were in a state of fear about the local authorities.  We have recorded the processes here such as "come back when you are really homeless"; "go and self-accommodate yourself"; "sign in daily".  In one extreme case, a woman in emergency accommodation was going into town every day from the airport, with two children in a buggy, to sign in in person and meet three members of staff: a garda, a person who then signed her in and a case worker.  Each of them went through her file, even though it had not changed since the previous day.  Then she walked back out to the airport and had to do the same thing again the next day.  Others had a car and were driving from distant parts of the city to sign in in person.  This causes intense stress to homeless people.  We recorded instances of homeless people breaking down in tears in offices and of children wetting themselves.  One more sympathetic staff member said "I'm tired of you breaking down in tears in my office, go home, don't come back to me again.  You can sign in by phone instead."  We do have mobile phones and text messaging so why are those systems not used?  There is also a practice of taking homeless people off the housing list when they do not know about it.  The local authority says it tried to contact the people but these people genuinely have no knowledge of such contact ever having happened.  They took the view that if the Revenue Commissioners or the social welfare office were looking for them they would have found them.</p></speech>

It might seem that if a person turns down a first offer they should take the second one.  The problem is that the first offer is often not in a place that the person applied for.  I can think of a father in one case and a mother in another who said they could not bring their children there because the place was in very bad condition and, more important, it was surrounded by drug pushers, people shooting up and needles.  They said they would not attempt to rear their children in those conditions.  That is why they said no and took the risk of a second offer.  The second offer is normally a lot better.  There is a sense among some homeless people that a really bad first offer is being cynically offered so that they will feel under much greater pressure to accept the second offer.<br/><br/>Private accommodation should be furnished but often is not.  Local authority accommodation should be furnished but not only is it not furnished but it is often not floored either.  The people then have to find money from their own resources, if they still have it, or go to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which generally does provide it.  The way in which that is done was one of the strong good points in the report.<br/><br/>The poor treatment in local authority offices needs to be recognised and accepted, not denied.  We have suggested dialogue but while local authorities by definition have authority, it strikes me that there is scope for the Minister to issue guidelines to them as to what is a reasonable standard of behaviour and to say there should be an independent appeals system and scanning of the removal of people from the local authority list.  Instructions, guidelines or a <i>desiderata</i>of what they should do could issue from the Minister.  That should be treated seriously by the local authorities but it would also mean that the advocates and the Focus Ireland case workers could go to local authorities and say that what they are doing is not in line with what the Minister has said should be the normal practice.  Yes, there could be a charter of rights provided there is a mechanism to implement it, complain and work through it but the Minister should also say that the standard in respect of the points we have highlighted here in local authorities should be much better.</p></speech>

In our examination of how people avoided becoming homeless they found the single most important thing they got from Focus Ireland was being treated properly.  That built their confidence.  They realised it was not their fault and it motivated them to persist, work and pursue this.  That was the single major factor that enabled them to avoid homelessness.  It is important and it is a practical point because otherwise motivation is lost, people become depressed and are unable to act to solve their own problems.  Then they find themselves victimised even more because they are accused of being unable to solve their own problems.  It helps to avoid homelessness, as well as to deal with being homeless.  Some kind of training and capacity building for local authority and other staff would have to be added to guidelines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#F00600"><p>The reservations that families have about HAP - I am sure this is true for individuals too - are based on objective facts, which are a result of specific public policies.  Therefore, the way to deal with their reservations is not to put more pressure on them to take offers they do not want to take but to change the public policies which make that form of housing insecure.</p><p>The big answer is more social housing, but there are smaller answers immediately available.  The first, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has mentioned, is the policy used in south County Dublin to integrate the HAP transfer list with the housing list.  This would make a huge difference to the reality of people accepting HAP offers.  If one has been on the housing list for ten years and takes a HAP offer and knows that is it and that one is now back to the bottom of the housing list, it is a huge disincentive.  There is absolutely no reason why what was introduced in south Dublin could not be introduced everywhere else and made policy rather than just an individual positive measure.</p><p> The second answer concerns security.  People, if they move into private rented accommodation, get a Part 4 tenancy for six years but they know that if the landlord is going to sell up or renovate the property, he can terminate the tenancy at any point.  Again, as Focus Ireland has argued, these loopholes which allow landlords to evict tenants at will when they want to sell up, or say they want to sell up, should be removed for all private sector combination buy-to-lets.  This would make HAP more attractive.</p><p> Someone on a HAP tenancy pays the differential rent but when the rent goes up, as it is allowed to by 4%, very often the amount that the local authority will pay under HAP does not go up.  There is very little discussion of this.  There seems to be no policy to ensure that that follows.  The State says the landlord can put up the rent by 4% but takes no responsibility to pay that, so people in HAP premises are finding themselves paying the differential rent and making up a gap between the rent and the actual amount being paid.  Under rent supplement this was illegal.  It was widespread but at least it was acknowledged publicly as wrong and illegal.  Under HAP, it appears to be treated as if it is perfectly okay.  This drives people into much deeper poverty and below their minimum threshold of income and makes HAP less attractive because they know they will be squeezed.  That is the issue with HAP.</p><p> Regarding what has been said about the local authorities, the stories the families tell need to be listened to.  As Mr. Harvey correctly says, local authority staff have a different perspective.  Most local authority staff are courteous and hard-working, and we recognise the huge pressure they are under, but the absence of guidelines and training for front-line staff in dealing with these hugely pressured situations is sadly missing.</p><p> Finally, if the public discourse about homelessness presents people who are homeless as gamers and scammers who are essentially trying to cheat the system, the front-line staff inevitably respond by trying to catch them out.  If the relationship between a public servant and a citizen needing support is one in which the public servant feels he or she is being cheated, if that is the public discourse, it is very hard to make that a supportive and human relationship.  This is why we so strongly reacted to the comments of the chair of the Housing Agency and why we do not think he is suitable to hold that post.</p></speech>

I have had dealings with the local authorities and some of the staff of Focus Ireland, who have been doing an excellent job but the problem is that the system is wrong.  Mr. Allen brought up HAP, for example.  I will give the committee two recent examples of my representations in this regard.  One took place on Monday, the other on Friday, when I met a lady who was in arrears and whose son had moved back into the family house.  Her rent had doubled and, because she had not cleared the associated arrears, her HAP payment was cut from the end of December.  We are now into February and she is still paying off whatever the sum is weekly to HAP.  Unless she clears her arrears, which she has 12 weeks to do, those administering HAP will not put her back on the system.  She is therefore getting no HAP and is also clearing her rent arrears.  It just does not make sense.  I said to those administering HAP that there must be an appeals process in place to give her that extra little time.  They refused.  HAP will only allow a tenant 12 weeks to clear his or her arrears.  If he or she does not do so within 12 weeks, they do not want to know and they cut the tenant off.</p> <p>  Another experience I had was through working through the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  These are people who come to my clinics on foot of a referral from the society and have just become homeless.  There is no help out there for them.  It is the system that is wrong.  I met a lady who, through no fault of her own - I know the family well - handed back her house eight years ago to the local authority.  I will correct Mr. Harvey on local authorities.  The reason she left was anti-social behaviour, of which she was a victim.  There was nothing the local authority could do for her.  Tenants who do not pay their rent to the local authorities are evicted.  A local authority tenant is not evicted, however, if he or she causes anti-social behaviour - there is no such legislation - yet tenants who do not pay their rent to the local authorities will be brought to court by them for the rent.  This seems to be the way in which HAP is administered too.  It is all about arrears.  The lady to whom I refer is off the housing list.  Naturally, when one hands back a key, one is off it for five years.  This was agreed, and there was no problem.  She had been off the list for five years - she has been off it for eight years now - and had a small amount of arrears of &euro;800.  She qualified to go back on the housing list, but until she clears her &euro;800 arrears, those administering HAP will not put her back on the payment.  Therefore, she is now paying out &euro;1,000 a month on rent and does not qualify to go on HAP because she has arrears of a few hundred euro.  I suggested that she would pay it in instalments but they did not want to know.</p> <p>  It is the system that is wrong.  I see this with Focus Ireland.  I know it is going around working with people, but what can it do if the system cannot be beaten?  We were talking about rent recently.  Rent increases have become humongous.  I see this in Carlow, my area, where rent has increased from &euro;700 a month to &euro;1,000 a month.  Then one fights with those administering HAP to get the extra increase.  In fairness, if a tenant has a good case, they will give him or her the extra bit but there is no wider help there.  The rent pressure zones are not working, as the witnesses know from the report.  The landlords are increasing the rent and the people cannot afford to come up with it.  We now have soup kitchens.  In my constituency we have set up what we would know as a soup kitchen.  This is the era we are living in.  It does not make sense.</p> <p>  What do we do?  I know Focus Ireland's role is to speak to those involved but what can all of us do?  We need to give those affected information and tell them their entitlements but this can only happen if the system is changed and everyone works together.  I have noticed lately that if I make representations about a case in which I know the person will become homeless again, it is the same situation: I am told to come back when they are homeless.  Then the person rings Focus Ireland, which, by the way, does a great job.  I am not giving out about it.  However, what do we do?  I had representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in with me again the other day to try to help the woman to whom I referred earlier to clear her arrears.  As those administering HAP will not look at the case, what role are we all going to play?  The biggest issue facing us is lack of housing, including apartments.  Unless the system is changed, the suggested solutions will not work.  Focus Ireland plays a very positive role.  We seem to be knocking the county councils here.  As Mr. Allen said, county councils are going with what they are told to do.  They are implementing legislation.  That is what I was told yesterday and that is fine.</p> <p>  Does Focus Ireland buy houses?  When it meets a family that is homeless - and it is great that it does so - and sits down with them and helps them with awareness of their rights and entitlements, does it follow up on this through the local authorities?  I know the local authorities ring Focus Ireland and tell its staff when they have cases of people who are ready to become homeless.  What exactly is Focus Ireland's role in this regard?  Does Focus Ireland follow up on this?  Does it go back and work with the local authority?  Does it go back to the family?  Does it keep in contact with the families until they are sorted?  I could outline to the witnesses five or six cases I know of that need help from Focus Ireland.  I acknowledge it helps such cases and does a great job but unless it looks at the system, it will not work.  Focus Ireland's biggest problem is HAP.  HAP is only what is called rent allowance, and I think that is people's confusion.  That is exactly what it is; it is no different.  One gets one's form, fills it in and stays on the housing list.  One can stay on the housing list while on HAP.  One only comes off the housing list through RAS, and there is massive confusion over RAS and HAP.</p></speech>

There is not one I would fail to support.  A few themes shine through from what has been written and said.  The success of the Focus Ireland policy of appointing case managers is striking, as they deal with people on a one to one basis, are non-judgmental and understand the nuances and individual circumstances of each person facing or in homelessness while providing assistance.  Being in someone's corner makes a huge difference, as evidenced by the fact that there was a result in 34 out of 35 cases, which is positive.</p><p>Another theme that emerges strongly is the position in which the system puts people when they become homeless.  Is there anything more stressful in people's lives than facing homelessness?  Perhaps divorce or the death of a spouse, while some surveys have shown that going to war is up there, but it is one of the three or four most stressful life events a human could face, yet the system says people have to provide their own accommodation and sign in on a daily basis when there are clear alternatives such as texting.  An issue that is constantly raised with me but which has not been mentioned in this discussion is the lack of storage facilities in which people can store their worldly goods.  The provision of such facilities is recommended in the report.  This is perhaps the most stressful situation someone will face, yet the system forces him or her to jump through a series of petty and humiliating hoops as though they are being punished for the crime of being homeless.  This highlighted in the report which calls for a complete reversal of culture, which is entirely what is needed.</p><p>I read with interest the survey of the primary reasons people face homelessness.  It is overwhelmingly down to issues in the private rented sector such as notice to quit to allow the sale of property.  Mr. Harvey has mentioned that rent arrears and rent increases account for approximately 80% of cases.  The interviewees picked three issues thated need to be addressed, one of which was regulation of the private rented sector.  Clearly, that is an issue to be addressed in this discussion.  I was a wee bit surprised that none of the 35 cases that were managed referred to notice to quit on the grounds of substantial refurbishment or renovation because my experience is that the number of so-called renovictions is on the increase.  It is the excuse <i>du jour</i>for landlords who are moving away from the sale of property to substantial refurbishment when issuing notices to quit.  Will the delegates comment on this?  For example, I am dealing with a case in Cork city which involves a block of apartments, Leeside Apartments, which was purchased last year by a vulture fund.  The prospectus issued by Sherry Fitzgerald when it was being sold referred to the opportunity to refurbish and significantly increase rents to yield more than &euro;1 million a year from the building.  A fresh batch of notices to quit have just been issued because the fund did not do its homework in the first batch.  More than 25 households face homelessness, many of which are families with young children.  The residents have written to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who is a local representative asking for a face to face meeting.  They will ask for the loophole in the law in that regard to be closed entirely and for a ban on economic evictions or, at the very least, a moratorium.  I support the imposition of a full ban in that regard.  Will Mr. Allen comment on the phenomenon of the rise the number of of renovictions?  Is it on Focus Ireland's radar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#H00300"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I agree with almost everything that has been said.  I am a public representative for 43 years and have long experience of working on housing issues which have always been on my doorstep.  I agree, in particular, with the points made about how local authorities deal with applicants when they first present.  I have always objected to the hatch or counter mentality, particularly where individuals have to discuss personal matters with a queue of people behind them.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  Local authority officials should be instructed to automatically direct people who say they wish to discuss a private or housing matter to a private interview room or a comfortable space in which nobody else can hear what is being discussed.  If that costs money, let it cost money and if councils have to rent other accommodation, that should be done.  Respect for the individual should have primacy.  I commend those in County Louth who work on housing issues, as they do a fantastic job, but when they do not have the facilities or provide the privacy the client needs, that is unacceptable.</p> <p>  Mr. Allen raised the issue of being an advocate for the client.  Many families are able to make a good case, but others are not.  They may have difficulties in communicating because of their educational background or they may not be used to dealing with officialdom and are intimidated by the process.  An advocacy service is important to allow an advocate to accompany the client to the interview and present the case on his or her behalf.  Attending the interview should be a professional service that is provided.  People who are homeless or in acute housing difficulty may not know what the best case scenario is for them.  Sometimes when talking to affected constituents, they mention casually that there is a serious medical problem in the family arising from caring for a child with a disability or someone being treated for cancer and so on.</p><p>Being able to articulate the best case for them is hugely important.  We do it as elected representatives by listening and speaking to them.  Quite often people do not put their best case forward and this is the other role of the advocate or council official.  This is where the training issue comes in.  There should be a national training course and a national standard that everybody must meet.  Universally applied protocols must be in place and it should not be acceptable if they are not applied.<br/><br/>The advocacy bodies for housing are very strong and I welcome them.  In many ways I do not suggest they should be the invigilators of the standard, but we need an independent look at how people are treated and dealt with by local authorities.  This should be somebody outside the local government box.  I would not have a problem if it was carried out collectively.  It would be a professional service by an outside agency and it could be supported in providing it.  We would have the same standards everywhere, we would have qualified people trained to listen and the best case would be put forward for people.<br/><br/>I am quite sure other members and the witnesses also come across people who had been on the housing list for eight years, then left an address but did not tell the local authority where they went and now find themselves cut off the housing list.  If these people can prove they have been living in the community I do not have a problem with sustaining continuation of their housing timeline.  If they leave the jurisdiction that is a different matter.  This is a serious problem I come across it and it needs to be dealt with.<br/><br/>My next problem is on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  My experience of it in Louth is completely the opposite to what we have heard, but that is the personal nature of the service.  More than 2,000 people are in receipt of the HAP in Louth and it is a professional and focused top-class service.  I cannot praise it enough.  If and when I am in contact with the HAP service about a family the staff are fully versed with that family's needs.  They are really on top of their game.  I am sorry this is not happening in every area but I have no doubt it ought to be.<br/><br/>The issue of being non-judgmental has been mentioned.  It does not matter who people are or what their background is, whatever it is no judgment should be made on them.  This is critically important.  Sometimes this is the case.  People <i>in extremis</i>who are homeless might ring me at 5 p.m. telling me the office is closed and asking what they will do, and I will phone the officer.  They are in a dreadful situation.  When people go looking for accommodation even with the HAP, if they are poor or unemployed they may feel inadequate because they are not dressed properly or they cannot speak with the same accent as other people because of where they come from.  They feel absolutely discriminated against.  I have discussed this with a housing body nationally and it funds applicants going for an interview for accommodation by giving them money.  It is not a begging process, but if it feels it can help it will give the person a couple of hundred euro to buy a shirt and tie or a suit so that person presents as well as anybody else.<br/><br/>When landlords are deciding between applicants obviously they are subjective and perhaps they do not like somebody and one does not know why.  The council could be the advocate whereby the HAP officer views a property for rent and asks to take it.  I do not know whether this makes sense, but the council could be an agent that fills the property with its clients.  In other words, the landlord would effectively let to the local authority.  I know this is not a strictly legal case.  This would take away discrimination by landlords who can and do discriminate against families who come from poor backgrounds.  I do not have to spell it out.  These are the types of changes that are needed.<br/><br/>I agree with the main point that has been made on evictions.  I have heard about many of them.  The number of people who come to me with their notice to get out has increased exponentially in the past year.  I challenge the person and I ask to see the letter.  I then telephone the landlord involved to see whether he or she does have a sister living in England.  In many cases what the landlords say is not true, but they use it to get the person out.<br/><br/>This has been a very helpful debate and I thank the witnesses.  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak.  This is positive determined collective progress that will articulate the change needed in officialdom and in how people are approached.  Above all there should be respect for everybody and the words I want to hear are support, help, advocacy and empathy.  We know when somebody who comes to us is not getting this.  We know when they are angry and when nobody is listening to them.  We need a sea change, and I recommend the Louth staff with whom I deal.  We must have best practice, and nothing less than that will do or will be acceptable.  The louder the witnesses shout at us the more we must get on with fixing the problem and ensure people are respected and treated fairly and properly.</p></speech>

One was on advocacy and having an advocate to put the case.  We asked all of the families whether they feel more confident now and whether, if they were confronted by this again, they could handle it themselves and manage it.  Not all, but almost all, said they could, but they would want and need an advocate with them.  They stated they understand their rights much better but they are not confident they could meet the Residential Tenancies Board or the agencies involved.  The day that people feel they do not need an advocate with them when going to these offices, and feel they will be fairly treated and will be able to respond in a comfortable manner is the day we should all look forward to.</p> <p>  On the issue of renovictions, in a way the Deputy answered the question himself.  The people we were looking at had avoided homelessness and their experience came from 18 months to nine months ago.  At that period, the situations mostly involved landlords with one or two properties who were going the simple route and thought they would get away with it.  Committee members might be amazed by how many of them got the letters wrong and, of course, they were spotted immediately.  Support in this regard gave tenants another three months to stay in their housing.  If anybody is playing the system now it is landlords, because we are seeing far more corporate vulture funds and corporate landlords.  The professionalisation of the landlord system is going in the wrong direction.  It is going corporate professional and vulture fund professional.  They are the ones playing the system and this is the effect we are seeing.</p></speech>

A year ago, my colleague, Dr. Cathy Walsh, and I did a study for the Housing Agency on why families were becoming homeless.  The question has a certain artificiality for many homeless people.  In some cases landlords said they wanted to increase the rent and they knew the tenants could not afford it.  In other cases they stated they needed the property for a relative or that they wanted to renovate the property.  The point is the tenants do not know.  In some renovation cases the tenants have said they went past the house and it was not being renovated.  In these cases even though renovation may be the stated reason a rent increase and a desire to get in a higher paying tenant may actually be the reason.</p> <p>  The reason tenants feel so powerless in this situation is a critical one that is not often mentioned.  The most important thing a leaving tenant needs from a former landlord is a letter of reference.  If tenants argue they will not get a letter of reference.  Arguing about why they are being put out is not something tenants want to do because a letter of reference for their next potential landlord is absolutely the most precious thing they can get.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any local authority that has a system for checking this information.  There is an obvious feedback system which would enable local authorities to become part of policing this.  When people inform the local authority that they have received a notice of termination because their accommodation is being put up for sale, the local authorities should automatically verify whether this is true.  Currently, if anyone wishes to contest the reasons given by the landlord, he or she can go to the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p> The State must police its own laws.  While we recognise that successive Governmen</p><p>ts have recently introduced a number of additional rights for private rental tenants, for instance, the rent control systems and additional requirements on people choosing to sell up, it has not done anything to police these rights.  We hear people make the case that rent control is not working.  A system that pushes against the market, is not policed and does not have penalties will not work.</p><p> Landlords have an major economic interest in doing exactly what the previous speaker described.  If we are to prevent them from doing this, we need not only legislation but systems for checking up on what is being done.  I find it incredible that local authorities put so many questions to families and spend public money on hotel rooms, family hubs and so forth, yet they do not have a system for checking whether an eviction is being carried out for the reasons given.  They should do this as a means of protecting public funds. </p></speech>

It is very useful to have an evidence based report and I note also that we are already discussing what we, as legislators, can do to advance some of the issues under discussion.</p> <p>  Does Focus Ireland intend carrying out an analysis in other counties?  Can the findings of the report be extrapolated nationwide or are there likely to be differences in other counties?  I am a Green Party Senator from Waterford.  I met Mr. David Niblock, Focus Ireland's south east co-ordinator, about a year ago when we visited some of the housing the organisation provides.  I am concerned about the energy standards that apply when renovations are being carried out.  We need to provide cosy homes for tenants.  The Government should provide additional funding to ensure the accommodation offered by Focus Ireland to people who need housing is of good quality in terms of energy efficiency.</p> <p>  I have some concerns.  The witnesses spoke about systems change and a change in culture.  How will this come about?  Members have been given some tasks that would help change the system.  I am concerned because the cost of living is increasing.  Will the gap between the haves and haves-not increase in the next three years?  We have a problem with supply and homelessness has become a concern.  The word "resilience" and the actions being taken to build resilience jumped out of the reports.  It is extremely important that the Government recognises the importance of the educational aspect to avoid the crisis that people are experiencing. </p> <p>  The Acting Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, spoke about strike-off.  In County Waterford people who refuse accommodation based on their personal circumstances, for example, because a child has a disability, are being struck off.  Some of these cases are complex.  What can be done to ensure local authorities recognise that people presenting as homeless are not just a number in their little red books but individuals with complex cases who need to be shown respect on that basis?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which have given members some clear direction.  What more can the Government do to support Focus Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in light of the importance of the work they do?</p></speech>

Every time the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government appears before the joint committee, I speak about the housing assistance payment and the system but I do not believe he is listening.  Have the witnesses met the Minister to discuss their reports?  What has been the Minister's feedback with regard to the system and the possibility of introducing an additional appeals mechanism as a temporary measure?  We have a housing crisis which I hope will be resolved in the next year or two.  I have asked the Minister to introduce some form of appeals mechanism.  Have the witnesses discussed the matter with the Minister?</p></speech>

During Senator Murnane O'Connor's contribution, I was struck by something which I would like to share because it illustrates the extent of the problem.  A number of county councillors have made representations to Wicklow County Council on this issue.  I have received in writing a clear policy statement from the county council, which has had a number of chief executives, including acting chief executives, in the past year or two.  No one in the Customs House seems to be interested in addressing this issue.  I refer to the refusal on the part of Wicklow County Council to allow public representatives to advocate or accompany people affected by the homeless crisis.  When I sought to make representations on behalf of a woman I met, the executive of the council refused to meet me.  I forced the issue by insisting on having the reasons for the county council's refusal to meet me set out in writing.</p> <p>  I was contacted by a woman with literacy and mental health problems who has been in and out of Newcastle hospital.  The county council refused to allow county councillors, Deputies or Senators to accompany her to meet officials.  This is a measure of the difficulties being experienced by public representatives. </p> <p>  The witnesses made a number of recommendations and members will not fall short in terms of pursuing them, whether through legislation or guidelines. </p></speech>

The research carried out by Dr. Walsh and Mr. Harvey is focused on Dublin only because it essentially studied the family action team, which is funded by the four local authorities in Dublin.  In general, when carrying out research, we try to look outside Dublin.  An increasing proportion of homelessness is in Dublin but we need to be clear about what is happening elsewhere.  We also have a greater capacity in Dublin to understand what is happening from where we are sitting because of the range of services we run.  There tends to be a slightly greater level of fragmentation outside Dublin and Focus Ireland is not necessarily in a position to do the research.  It is not right that the largest research budget in homelessness is being provided by a voluntary sector organisation and funded by individual donations and corporate support.  The State should allocate a percentage of the money it is spending on homelessness for the type of research work Focus Ireland and others are doing.  It is in a much better position to do this work and it should then publish the findings because many of the reports carried out by the State are not published.</p> <p>  Focus Ireland does not operate in all counties, specifically in the west and midlands where we work with partners.  Our services are different in different counties, depending on history, our relationships with the relevant local authority and so forth. </p> <p>  We meed the Minister reasonably regularly and we will meet the new principal officer on housing, Mr. David Kelly, later this morning when he visits Focus Ireland's offices.  These meetings are constructive in broad terms, although we have a fundamental disagreement with the Department.  Nevertheless, we also recognise the progress being made and work being done.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what will happen in the next three years.  Housing is being delivered in the private sector, through new social housing units and, I understand, through an increase in rented accommodation.</p><p>The demand for housing is growing faster than the supply.  That means the problem is going to get worse, which inevitably will squeeze some people out and into homelessness.  There is a lack of acknowledgment of those facts both in terms of the aspirations or targets to deliver housing and planning to deal with the scale of the problem we will continue to face for the next three years.  This is the first time in my experience of working in homelessness where the Government is not saying it intends to end homelessness and outlining a timescale.  There has been a lot of sneering at the attempts to do that before but we achieved an enormous amount in the run up to 2010, with which Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others will be familiar.  The fact that we failed does not mean we should give up on our aspiration to end homelessness.  It would be much easier, more motivating and meaningful for everybody involved if we identified a period where we acknowledge that the situation will get worse, when we genuinely expect it to turn a corner and what we will do then.  Our fear is that as soon as that corner is turned public attention will move away from these issues and these families and single people will be left in hubs or in emergency accommodation.  Our fear is that we will get used to this high level of homelessness and it will become normalised.  To avoid that situation we need the sort of plan that the Oireachtas laid out.  We would say that the work that was done by the last committee, or the committee that existed in the period before this Government was formed, set out an agenda.  For example, Sl&aacute;intecare is constantly referred to, although people will argue about the extent to which the policy has framed the response to the health issue, and is acknowledged as the framework.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case with housing and homelessness.  The targets that were set have not been adopted and we are still using the targets from before.  We could list many things that the Government needs to do.  We do not need to make up a new list because the committee has already done a lot of that work and the Government should revert back to that report as a framework in terms of its ambition.  </p></speech>

First, the big picture is about the issues that Mr. Allen has described.  Second, we must increase the supply of local authority accommodation because that will take the pressure out of the system and, in terms of our concern in particular, the measure will ensure that homeless people get housed quicker, better, more affordably and in more secure ways.  I would like to stress that our report has laid out short-term and procedural actions that can be changed quite quickly and are not costly.</p> <p>  The real problem is that many local authorities are in denial about this issue around treatment and the procedures that cause great stress, humiliation and so on.  There are two parts to this matter.  First, as has already been identified, it is important that all homeless people get caseworkers and advocacy workers.  Second, there should be no waiting list for them while their vulnerability increases.  In an ideal world they should not need caseworkers and advocacy workers if the system worked well but I digress.</p> <p>  In terms of who can do what regarding these changes, whether it is from storage depots, two strikes and out, prevention, signing in and so on, there is a sense in which local authorities will deny that.  They may well regard Focus Ireland and ourselves, as researchers, as a nuisance to whom one does not need to pay an awful lot of attention.  The Minister and his Department should send out clear and unambiguous signals about what Deputy O'Dowd spoke about, which is the need for respect, better treatment, better procedures and revising, considering, changing and improving them from top to bottom.  I can assure members that they would be much more likely to listen to the Minister than to us.  I also suspect they would be much more likely to listen to members than to us.  Naming the issue, identifying it and bringing this measure up to ministerial and departmental levels to ensure the practical changes are made and signals are sent to the local authorities about what is appropriate and what is not would help.  That is the small but absolutely vital picture that will improve exits from homelessness over the next number of years.    </p></speech>

I understand his funeral takes place this morning which is why the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, cannot be with us.  Our thoughts are with Mr. Fox's family and his colleagues, including those here, and his friends at this very sad time.<br/><br/>Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name, in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I will pass on his sentiments to my colleagues and to the family of our late colleague.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the investigation of each and every suspicious death very seriously.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand completely that any death regardless of whether it is ultimately deemed to be from natural causes, accidental or premeditated brings significant pain for the deceased&rsquo;s loved ones and, as such, it is vital that they are investigated fully and professionally so families can be provided with answers.  It is also important that each death is recorded accurately on PULSE to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our stakeholders and society at large has the most up-to-date information available on natural, accidental and suspicious deaths recorded in Ireland at any particular time.  It was in this light that, in July 2016, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau asked the Garda analysis service to conduct a comprehensive analysis of homicides with a domestic motive in the Republic of Ireland over a ten-year period from 2007 to 2016.  The purpose of this analysis was to identify any trends and patterns in homicides recorded in Ireland where domestic abuse may have been a motive.  This data could then be used to inform the development of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's domestic abuse policy and interventions.<br/><br/>In furtherance of this review, cases dealt with by the Office of the State Pathologist, OSP, during 2013, 2014 and 2015 were initially examined by the Garda analysis service.  This examination was carried out to ensure that every case that had a suspicious circumstance or cause of death, which would be pathologically considered to be a homicide, was compared with the PULSE incident classification.  This review identified 41 deaths where, on initial examination, the related PULSE incidents required further analysis from either a PULSE incident classification or data quality perspective.  In January 2017, a working group was established under a chief superintendent that included senior staff from the Garda analysis service to review the PULSE incidents concerned and identify the rational for the PULSE classification and the data quality relating to the 41 deaths.  The review identified a necessity for clarity and consistency regarding the application of the crime-counting rules in the context of the PULSE classification of homicide incidents.  This review found that each of the 41 deaths were investigated.<br/><br/>In September 2017, guidance for classification rules for homicides were agreed upon in order to assist the correct classification of homicide incidents.  Of the 41 deaths, it was identified that 12 deaths required reclassification.  In each of those 12 deaths, family members of the deceased were contacted to inform them of the change in the incident classification and to offer them advice and information on victim support organisations that may be of help to them.  I am conscious of the need to protect the identify of victims and victims&rsquo; families and I am sure the committee will appreciate this concern.  I am also conscious that a number of the 12 cases are before the courts or currently under investigation and may be subject to further classification changes on PULSE.  In order to provide assurance on the validity of PULSE classification, it was decided in consultation with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to extend the review to all homicides back to 2003.  The data for the period 2003 to the present is utilised by the CSO to prepare the publication of crime statistics.  The Policing Authority requested an independent peer review of the quality of the investigations carried out in respect of the 41 cases.  This is now being carried out by the recently established working group.  <br/><br/>As a result of interactions with the CSO and the Policing Authority, the terms of reference for a working group under assistant commissioner, executive support and corporate services were agreed.  The working group has been tasked with undertaking the following: an independent peer review of the quality of the investigations carried out in respect of the 41 cases for which investigations have not yet concluded or reached the courts; dip sampling to establish the degree to which PULSE is updated in a timely manner with outcomes from the higher courts; and all homicide cases from 2003 to 2017 to be reviewed including fatal road traffic collisions.  The working group will also monitor PULSE to identify any new homicide incidents from 1 January 2018 to ensure that they are appropriately classified.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very conscious of the need to ensure we have a high quality data across all crime areas to assist us in preventing and detecting crime to protect and support communities and victims of crime.  We have introduced a number of measures in this regard and more are planned.  It is also vital that there is a culture throughout the organisation of correctly recording data.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully recognises the need to provide the public and our other stakeholders with correct data so that issues affecting policing are based on accurate information.  That is why we are continually examining our processes and have expended so much time and effort to ensure our data in respect of crimes, including homicides, is accurate.<br/><br/>I fully accept that the review process could have been quicker.  However, this is a highly complex area - often of a very complicated, fluid<b></b>and sensitive nature, relating to case files, and each and every case being analysed and reviewed.  Given the seriousness of the crimes involved, it is important that this process is thorough, detailed and robust.  Any issues identified from this further review will be comprehensively addressed.<br/><br/>This matter was discovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The process to date has identified issues that we are addressing so they cannot happen again.  I can assure the committee that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken this matter very seriously and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

When I looked at the incident classification and some of the surrounding information, I could not square how an incident had been classified in the way that it had, given the information available.  I felt some contradicted our own crime counting rules on the basis of the information available.  For example, I was looking at incidents in which an injured party was deceased and the offence was down as an assault causing harm.  Our own crime recording rules state an assault causing harm where subsequently someone dies because of the assault should be upgraded to a homicide.  We had such examples on the system.  There were sudden deaths which looked as if they were being investigated as homicides.  As a sudden death is seen as non-crime, there were times when I could not reconcile what had been included.  </p> <p>  The other concern I had was about the methodology used.  There were views that the methodology used and approach members of my team took were limited.  I felt that was incorrect.  The limiting factor suggested we were reliant on only two sources.  We always said we would be reliant on only two sources - PULSE and the State Pathologist's reports.  We always said that to get a more rounded view of the classification, we needed to go to the case files.  That is what we were arguing for.</p></speech>

Again, the homicide review was raised.  In fairness to Dr. Singh, it was in the context of issues related to dangerous driving causing death.  However, I think he did say the database had been rectified.  In that reference was he trying to indicate that the homicide review issue had been resolved at that stage?</p></speech>

When they were raised, we did have a look at the internal system and began to identify some of the problems on the system.  To me, the roads policing side of the issue has always been slightly different from the homicide aspect.  Many of the homicides were already on the system.  It is not that they were misclassified <i>per se</i>but how they had been classified.  They were being obscured and we began to identify them.  I went into the meeting on that date with the assumption that the database had been rectified.  However, I was notified subsequently that some of the changes still had to be made.  In the process of the making the changes some other issues began to rise.  Therefore, we needed to ensure the changes were made subsequently.</p></speech>

I also congratulate the Garda on the quite considerable recent success in tackling the distribution of child abuse material.  It was a considerable success in combatting a heinous crime.  That is worth noting.  I have a number of questions, some of which arise from Deputy O'Callaghan's questions and the first of which is addressed to Assistant Commissioner Finn.  Does he agree it would be a cause of grave public concern and would be very serious if it was the case that any unlawful deaths were not properly investigated?</p></speech>

How did this issue first arise?  How did it come to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there was a discrepancy or that there might be any issue regarding the recording of homicides?</p></speech>

This process started in July and the end of the year had been reached before that three-year period was completed.  I say that to demonstrate that a significant amount of work would be required to go back to 2013, given how long it took to analyse that segment alone.  That was an internal review instigated by the Garda.  As each of the cases was examined, issues relating to classification did arise.  That was the context in which Dr. Singh and his people said to us that 41 homicides from that batch required examination, because there were concerns around classification.  That is how the process started.  It started internally, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carrying out its own review and unearthing these issues, which we determined would require further analysis.</p></speech>

However, when we looked on the PULSE system, such an incident might not be recorded there as a homicide.  It was often recorded in a lesser group - a non-crime group, such as sudden death.  Alternatively, it might be recorded as an assault.  The report that we had from the Office of the State Pathologist did not correspond to what was recorded on PULSE.  That said, there was always a missing piece of information, namely, the investigation file.  The investigation file may have recorded some other issues which led to the incident's classification.  That is why, when the issue was initially raised with me in discussion with the analysts, I decided to raise this problem with the executive.  It was about November when we raised the problem.  I felt that we needed to have a look at this, but we needed to review the case files in order to get a fuller picture.</p></speech>

My next question concerns the review.  I do not refer to the independent peer review that has been announced, but the review of the initial group of cases.  My understanding is that the Garda data analysts checked how deaths were classified in the crime records but did not have sight of the full case files.  It was therefore not possible to check if homicide investigations were conducted in all cases that warranted a homicide investigation.  Further, it is my understanding that where analysts found problems with the classification of some homicides, the people who were contacted to clarify any queries were the superintendents in charge of the initial investigation.  Is that an accurate reflection of that review and the way it was conducted?</p></speech>

Initially, that examination was done in the context of the classification issue.  As part of that process, the group spoke to the district officers concerned.  They raised the query around classification and inquired about the investigation file.  That liaison took place with the investigating members of various districts to see what happened to those particular investigations.  Following that interaction, the team that was looking at the examination was able to confirm that each of those 41 cases had been investigated.   However, the analysts did have some concerns about the way they were classified, because the classifications of the cases on PULSE did not tally with what Dr. Singh and his people were finding at the Office of the State Pathologist.  This was where the synchronisation of the two had to take place.</p></speech>

As such, there was not really any independent oversight.</p><p>They confirmed that they were satisfied that these investigations were carried out to the adequate standard for a homicide investigation but, of course, that is what one would expect them to do, given that they had carried out these investigations in the first place.</p></speech>

The Policing Authority asked would it not be prudent to get a peer review done of these investigations in order that everyone would be satisfied.  Therefore, we brought forward Mr. Sutton and his team to get in someone independent to do that reassessment in order that we could reassure everyone for once and for all that these investigations were carried out and were compliant with Article 2 and that we now have them classified in the correct order so that the CSO, when it publishes its homicides statistics, can state with confidence it has all these homicides correctly recorded and can publish those statistics.  That is the process that is taking place at present.</p></speech>

We flagged these up with a view to looking at them.  The initial review did go out and ask those who had conducted the investigations about the questions asked.  My understanding was that subsequently the investigation files were sought and drawn back in centrally for review.  Again, this review process was separate to the analysis.  I think the Policing Authority then raised the issue with us to ask, again, whether we should have this peer-reviewed with a senior investigating officer, which is sensible enough and a fair enough suggestion.  This was then agreed to, and those are the beginnings of this new process.</p></speech>

We must understand and accept that some of these investigations are live, still ongoing, so their statuses will change as the investigations proceed.

One of the issues that I think is causing concern is the fact that we do not have even an indicative timeline.

We have very little sense of when it will be complete, and the public and the committee deserve a date.  What is the longest period it might take?</p></speech>

First, there are two bodies of work that need to be done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first is the classification and whether the files were correctly or incorrectly classified and, if they were not classified, the reasons for that.  The second is the investigation.  Was the investigation carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights?  I will talk the committee through the process.  It can happen, and has happened on numerous occasions, in respect of the 41 cases that have been highlighted in 2013, 2014 and 2015, that someone is assaulted in one district, is brought to hospital and dies two months later and this is recorded in that hospital as a sudden death.  Then an investigation is conducted and someone is arrested, prosecuted, charged - let us say with murder - and convicted of manslaughter.  It still stays on PULSE as a sudden death.  The work done by the analysis service looked at the results of the State Pathologist's office and saw blunt force trauma to the head was the cause of death and then looked at the corresponding incidents on PULSE and it went down as a sudden death, not a homicide, so there was a fault there.  This concerns the 41 cases.  We will look at them, their classification and the reasons they were not updated.  There is now a process in place to ensure this does not happen again.</p> <p>  The second part of this is, in compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to look at the investigation.  Of the 41 cases, a number are before the courts and have been dealt with before the courts, a number have been dealt with by the coroner's courts and a number are still live investigations.  In compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, my team will look at the investigations into these cases to see whether they are compliant and whether they are correctly or incorrectly classified.  Does that address the Deputy's issues?</p></speech>

I appreciate the explanation and I am better enlightened but there was a specific question.  When one is putting together a group such as this, there must be some sense of how long the process will take.  If Mr. Sutton could offer either a minimum or a maximum, I think it would improve our confidence and the public confidence in this process.  This cannot be an indefinite process.</p></speech>

The review will be done in a thematic fashion whereby various aspects of the investigation will be looked at.  It is not possible for me to say it will take six months or nine months.  I am just not able to say that.  I have prioritised the 41 cases for years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  However, the analysis service has also been tasked with looking at 2017, 2016 and right back to 2003 and, if there are issues with those cases, to send them over to the review team for us to look at.</p></speech>

We must be mindful that not everything is in our control here.  For example, we are reliant on access to the State Pathologist's lab and so are reliant on their goodwill.  We have only one person who is very expert in this area to whom we are assigning this job, so I would say about five to six months.  I refer to the review of those pathological reports and looking at the comparison with PULSE.  Then there is the question of the investigations.  They froze up, so I cannot comment on how long that part of the review would take.</p></speech>

For example, the incidents related to fatal collisions, dangerous driving causing death, that type of information will be extrapolated from our IT system in a much quicker way.  We can therefore get that aspect of the work done quickly.  Dr. Singh's work on the homicides, the murders and the manslaughters, will take more time, but we will be able to get the traffic work done quickly and out of the way in order that when Dr. Singh's people come with the analysis from their consultation with the State Pathologist, we will be able to conclude that much more quickly.</p></speech>

I found the description of the events during Deputy O'Callaghan's questioning quite extraordinary.  I find it remarkable that there was to be a discussion at the Policing Authority on 27 April and a report was furnished to the Policing Authority specifically on these matters and that Dr. Singh and his team did not have sight of it.  I find this almost impossible to comprehend.  Would the assistant commissioner agree that this is comparable to a discussion taking place at the Policing Authority involving significant drugs issues and the Garda national drugs and serious crime unit not having sight of the report?</p></speech>

The error, however, was made in that we did not sit down with the analysts and raise or surface the issue of whether the investigations had all been properly classified.  That was probably one of the most significant issues with which we had to deal initially.  From that engagement we discovered that there had been inconsistencies in the manner in which 108 district officers across the State had interpreted our crime counting rules.  They had been done in a slightly different way but none was incorrect.  They had taken a slightly different interpretation of them.  It is important that during the work we did between April and September we sat down with the analysts and worked out the criteria, on which we all agreed, for measuring and classifying all of the incidents.  That is the piece of work that took us from April to September.  We did not just sit down with the analysts; we also sat down with staff from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which has a particular interest as it is tasked with producing statistics for homicides for Ireland and the European Union.  A lot of work was going on behind the scenes on issues the CSO had brought to the table with the classifications.  Once the issue of homicides classification had been raised with the Policing Authority, the CSO looked at its figures and raised some other issues for us with the classifications.  We worked with it on all of the issues it had raised with how incidents had been classified.  This work was ongoing in tandem with the review of the 41 incidents.  It was not just a case of sitting down and not progressing the issue between April and September; a lot of work was ongoing.  There is the broader picture on all of the data available, not just the homicides, on which we are focusing in the 41 cases.  As I said in my opening statement, it is important to have all of the data correct.</p></speech>

My final question is for Dr. Singh.  This process had its roots in the process described in July 2016.   At what stage between July 2016 and 27 April 2017 did it come to light internally that there were discrepancies?  Can Dr. Singh put a date on when the discrepancies became apparent in the documents from the State Pathologist and the PULSE system?</p></speech>

With regard to one of my recommendations at that stage, I said we had two pieces of information, the PULSE record and the State Pathologist's reports, but we were missing a very important element  - the investigation file.  The investigation file can help us to begin to understand the classification.  We needed three bits of information to be assured that what we had on the PULSE system was correct.  It was at that stage that I made a suggestion that we review the cases to satisfy ourselves that the classification was correct.  At that stage it was agreed that a group would be put together to do this.</p></speech>

We had conducted an internal review of the investigations.  We did not go back to the analysts.  That is where the issue arose, as raised by the Policing Authority.  We went back and sat down with the analysts and agreed on how we would classify and how the crime counting rules would be interpreted in the 41 incidents.  The initial review had focused on the investigations and whether an investigation had been carried out.  It looked at the information gathered on the post mortems, the covering note on the files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, at whether directions had come back from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the verdicts of the courts or the Coroner's Court.  That was the type of information we had gathered on the investigations, but the analysts still had concerns that we had not looked at the classifications.  That is why we went back to review them again.</p></speech>

I want to come back to Dr. Singh on the matter.

Was Dr. Singh frustrated by this?</p></speech>

First, one must be mindful that when we raised this issue in November, part of the purpose was to say we had concerns.  That is important.  We wanted to actually have this exercise and run it by the review group to see if the concerns were real.  That was the purpose.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we got to see the final report, I have already said we did not get an opportunity to sign off on the final report, for whatever reason.  When we did review it, there were elements with which clearly we could not agree.</p></speech>

I thought this was important because the review team had contained analysts and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If we were to argue that it was to be a joint approach, it was really important that I be able to say I had confidence in it also.  I wrote to the management team which was there on the day.  That letter was subsequently leaked after which - I am sure people were organising in the background - we were to have a look at the review again to highlight our concerns to see if we could address them.</p></speech>

I had taken time to reflect on the meeting and wrote my note.  My concern was that we had not had a full opportunity to review the final document.  We asked that the classifications be looked at again in order that we could all have confidence in them and sign off on them.  It has taken a little time because there has been some debate, but I am happy enough that our concerns have been addressed with the classifications.</p></speech>

I offer my sympathy to the family of the late Detective Superintendent Colm Fox and his colleagues.</p> <p>  I do not want to repeat points made by others, but there are two issues, the first of which is the recording and classification of homicides, while the second is the internal review.  There is no doubt that the misclassification of a homicide is probably one of the worst things that could be envisaged for the people affected.</p><p>We have met them over the years.  There are plenty of them and they formed the background of the cases which went to the independent review mechanism which the previous Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, established.  They were people who have lived for decades with dissatisfaction around investigations into homicide matters where they never received closure.  That the most serious crime imaginable could be misclassified and, potentially, not investigated properly is a hugely traumatic experience for people who have lost loved ones.</p><p> In April 2017 when the story initially raised its head, Deputy Commissioner Twomey said there were some minor issues as to the classification of some homicides.  We learned in February this year that 89 road deaths over 14 years were not classified on PULSE and had to be reclassified while 12 cases of domestic homicide over a two-year period had to be reclassified.  Does senior Garda management continue to stand over the comment that these issues are minor?</p></speech>

That does not reflect what we do on the ground.  In fact, the review of the investigations we looked at did not find that cases were not properly investigated.  While, as my colleague outlined, they were not recorded with the correct classification on our IT system, when one delves into the investigation files, one finds they were investigated.  There are investigation files to go to.  On road traffic collisions, there were fatal collisions which were investigated and directions came back subsequently to charge someone with dangerous driving causing death, the garda created the charge and it went to court.  However, having regard to crime counting rules, he or she should have created a separate incident of dangerous driving causing death so that when the CSO looked at our figures, it would have seen a fatal collision and the charge which it would then have recorded as a homicide.</p></speech>

There are linked areas around that which I want to feed into.  The 2014 report suggested that all crimes of domestic violence and incidents of dispute should be recorded on PULSE irrespective of the willingness of a victim to make a complaint.  When was that implemented?  Has it been implemented?  Is it the subject of ongoing review?  The reason I ask is that there is a link.  What assurance can the acting Commissioner give us about domestic abuse incidents which were misclassified, having been reported as a tension or complaint rather than as the serious assault which actually occurred?  I am asking about where the signs were not recognised and that subsequently became a domestic homicide.  Does the acting Commissioner know what point I am making?  There is a potential link between the early classification of the original domestic violence and a failure to follow the signs in those early investigations.  If the signs were not followed and a case was not investigated properly, something may have ended up as a homicide which should not have.  That might not have happened if the investigation of the earlier domestic incident had been treated properly.</p></speech>

Every incident recorded on our systems goes through a process whereby a review takes place the following morning by the district officer of the incidents which took place the night before.  Those incidents will not be closed out on our system until we are satisfied that the investigation has been completed.  The process is that those investigations are put back until the district officer is satisfied that we have fully and properly investigated that incident.  That process came in tandem with the EU directive on victims, which we embraced even before the legislation came in at all.  We started that process in 2015.</p></speech>

Was a final domestic homicide not classified as such to cover up for that?  Can the acting Commissioner assure us that did not take place?  I am mindful of a case in my area, the very tragic murder of one of my constituents which was very much in the public domain.  Ms Baiba Saulite, who was murdered, was the mother of two young children and the life of a solicitor in the area was put in peril.  The garda&iacute; who originally investigated the abduction of that woman's children have subsequently and to this day maintained that the improper investigation of the abduction of the children and earlier incidents which were not heeded by senior management resulted in the unnecessary death of that woman later on.  That is the angle I am coming from in this line of questioning.</p></speech>

As I was trying to explain, with some of the processes we have put in place, it will be evident to the member creating the record that a person has been involved in a previous incident.  When I record that a person is the victim of a particular crime, our system will flag the fact that he or she has previously been the subject of an incident where there is a previous investigation.  We will be alerted straight away if there was a previous domestic violence incident relating to that person.  That history is now populated and fed to the member when he or she creates the incident.  The awareness is there and one can see from the outset that there is a history and that we need to monitor the case.</p></speech>

In fact, we have done a lot of work to ensure we classify our incidents properly.</p><p>We have a new system where all our incidents are being classified centrally at our Garda information services centre, GISC, in Castlebar.  We have rolled this out in two regions, so that if a Garda wanted to create an incident, he goes through one centralised process where we have our staff equipped and trained.  We make sure there is consistency across the country.  Looking back at the issues relating to our data the challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trying to get a level of consistency across the organisation.  The new systems will ensure that the quality of our data will be accurate in the future.  For example, when Dr. Singh and his team look at the data on domestic violence, they will find that the crimes have been correctly classified from the start.  It also ensures the victim of a crime will get the services that he or she should from the State.

I refer to the lack of seriousness in some instances where the view taken in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault is summarised by the attitude that it is a personal matter, time consuming and problematic and that people will sort it out between themselves.  I was a bit shocked during the week when I surveyed the proceedings of the Charleton tribunal when two senior officers, albeit one retired now, referred to what was deemed by Mr. Justice O'Higgins as a serious sexual assault as the Kingscourt bus incident where a woman was groped and violated and that superintendent Cunningham and former chief superintendent Rooney did not recognise this as a sexual assault.  If one senior officer said it, it might be one thing, but two senior officers saying it is a problem, particularly in view of Mr. Justice O'Higgins adjudication and the fact Mr. Justice Charleton had to pipe up and say that this incident has been established and there is no exaggeration.  This reminded me of the Byrne and McGinn report where Maurice McCabe was accused of gross exaggeration by calling that a sexual assault but his analysis was upheld by Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  Now even as late as last week we have two senior officers saying that was not a sexual assault at all.  Mr. Finn is painting a picture that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is addressing the issues but it strikes me that we have a very long way to go in terms of understanding this.  If we do not understand it, it is not going to be classified properly.</p></speech>

Dr. Singh and his team go to the Garda College and the CSO personnel come to us and give us the same message, so that we understand the importance of our data.  We had issues in the past with breath tests.  It is important we educate our staff and make the changes so that we start off on the correct course from the first day the new students come into the Garda College and they get an appreciation of, and an understanding, that it is not just about recording data in that data means something in terms of the quality of the service we give to the victim of crime and that we must categorise data properly.  Data are important in terms of giving information to the Road Safety Authority and in how we plan events to try to prevent collisions occurring.  We need to educate and that is part of the process we are undertaking.  It is not all about systems; we need also to convince and change the hearts and minds of our people.  Data are important and we need to make sure we gather data properly and accurately and that we give the people the service they deserve.</p></speech>

Mr. Finn mentioned 1 million breath tests but I would say the 60 to 80 homicides each year are not on the same level as 1 million breath tests so those cases should be capable of being classified and analysed appropriately.  What strikes me as odd, and I will raise some points on the internal review, is that while the spotlight was on, in terms of the inaccuracy and problems of classification of data around other issues, this was also going on.  In his opening remark, Mr. Finn said that he had asked the Garda analysis service to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the homicides.  We know the Policing Authority was not satisfied that this is what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did because it said the internal review was not sufficiently robust.  We know that what the Garda analysis unit did was to compare the pathology reports with the PULSE files, but it was not given access to the case files.  How in God's name could that be called a comprehensive analysis if the people who were asked to analyse the data did not get access to the data?</p></speech>

That was a specific piece of work, an analysis of data.  From that piece of work they were doing, they highlighted a number of incidents and investigations where they saw a discrepancy.  They brought that separate piece of work to the deputy commissioner and said that they had unearthed some issues in relation to the classification, separate from the main piece of work they were doing, and stated they needed to look at it.  The deputy commissioner agreed that there were issues; that the Garda needed to sit down as the analysts had brought the information to them, but they needed operational people to interpret it and address whether what the analysts were highlighting was correct or whether there were other issues.</p></speech>

Who examined the files?  Were all the files examined in detail?  My impression of what the Policing Authority was told was that, in response to the analysts asking whether the investigation had been done properly and requesting to examine the files, senior Garda management telephoned the superintendents who had conducted the investigations in the first place and asked them whether they had been conducted well, to which all those officers surprisingly said that they had been.  All the investigations were deemed to be grand.  That is the impression that has been given.</p></speech>

When the analysts brought the 41 cases to the team that was initially set up to examine those investigations, the team considered what information had been recorded on PULSE, which was the information that was causing the issue for analysts.  That team told the investigating teams that what had been recorded on PULSE did not make sense in light of what the analysts had shown, asked whether the cases in question had been investigated and asked how the investigations had turned out.  As my colleague, Mr. Sutton, mentioned, an investigation can start off when, for an example, an ambulance is called to pick someone up at the side of the street.  We do not know how that person died, but we are called by the hospital about the death and garda&iacute; go along and investigate.  During the course of that investigation, we might discover that the person was assaulted.</p></speech>

I wish to express my condolences to the family of and all belonging to the garda.</p> <p>  Many of the issues in question have been raised by various members.  Mr. Finn stated that data were important and the Garda needed to record them properly, but the PULSE system seems to be unfit for purpose.  As far back as January 2015, a chief inspector, Mr. Robert Olson, said that the system was not fit for purpose, that it was 1990s technology and that it was time to be retired.  The special rapporteur for children, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, also stated that it was not fit for purpose from a child protection point of view.</p> <p>  A couple of weeks ago in the D&aacute;il, I raised with the Taoiseach some issues surrounding Accenture, which designed the PULSE system.  Accenture has received a great deal of money for Garda work and procurement guidelines have been ignored.  When it was put to Mr. Michael Culhane, head of finance in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that 73 contracts in 2015 with a value of more than &euro;11 million had breached procurement guidelines, he said that he accepted that 73 was high but that the Garda was actively addressing all those issues and that it Garda was working with its colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement to that end.  In 2016, 94 contracts breached guidelines.</p><p> In respect of the issues to which Deputy Clare Daly alluded, are things getting any better?  I tabled a parliamentary question about Accenture and this matter in June of last year.  It took six months to get the information back.  Perhaps the assistant commissioner might be able to clarify something.  I was told that Accenture was paid more than &euro;16.5 million in 2016 but the internal audit published in August 2017, which I also raised in the D&aacute;il, said that Accenture was paid &euro;26.5 million in 2016 - some &euro;10 million more.  Perhaps there is a technical reason for that in respect of how payments are made.  Can the assistant commissioner shed any light on that issue?</p></speech>

I did not bring any material in respect of Accenture or the contracts.  We were here on another date and information on those contracts and payments made to Accenture was provided, but I have not brought anything with me today.  Perhaps I can help the committee by providing supplementary information later.</p></speech>

Many discrepancies have been highlighted by different Deputies.  Garda management has had trouble getting breath test figures, juvenile crime statistics and checkpoint numbers correct.  Now we cannot get the homicide figures right.  Does the assistant commissioner not accept that there has been serious failure at management level in the Garda?  We have been very heavily criticised for it, but Deputy Clare Daly and I have been saying for a long time that the problems in how we deliver policing are unlikely to improve dramatically until a different hierarchy is in place.  The current hierarchy has proved itself unfit for purpose in several areas.  Does the assistant commissioner think that we are exaggerating when we say that having a police force with which the Irish people will be 100% happy and getting to a new place in terms of how we do policing cannot be done with the existing hierarchy?  Does he think it can be done?</p></speech>

We have an IT system that is 20 years old and not fit for purpose.  It is at the root of many of the issues we are discussing in respect of data, the classification of homicides, how breath tests are recorded and so on.  Technology has moved on massively in 20 years.  Last week, I read in the Government's development plan for the future that one of the areas in which significant amounts of money will be invested is a new IT system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need that, but we cannot deliver it overnight.  Even if the Government was to give us all the money we needed tomorrow morning it would take time to deliver it.  We have to get from where we are right now to the point when that new system will kick into place.  We are tweaking something which is 20 years old and which was not designed for what we have achieved with it.   It is causing us difficulties and challenges.  We have to do our best with what we have in order to make it fit and to get us through until that new era when that money and new IT project will be delivered.</p> <p>  In my opinion, in which I may be a bit biased, changing management will not solve all those problems overnight.  That is my opinion.  As I said, perhaps I am biased.  The Deputy already touched on our IT system having caused us massive problems in recent times.  It is not fit for purpose.  We know that.  That has been articulated by the inspectorate and others.  However, we have to live with it until such time as that new project is delivered.  I am delighted to see that funding is being made available because we all share the view that we need a new IT system in order to be able to give the type of information that Dr. Singh needs to inform our policing plans and the way in which we patrol and look after the victims of crime.  All of those things are important.  Changing the management today will not solve all those problems.</p></speech>

When I first raised that matter the witnesses did not want me to talk about it.  Given that the assistant commissioner is now admitting that there are serious problems with the IT system, is there any way to explain why we have been giving work to Accenture and Vantage Resources without even getting them to tender for it?  Some of the contracts are being paid in advance.  Some of them date back to 2009.  Some people working for the companies supplying the IT services about which the assistant commissioner is complaining do not even have to clock in.  It is costing a fortune.  Accenture has been paid more than &euro;90 million over these few years.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that a lot of work is being done, much of it relating to IT, in respect of our modernisation and renewal programme.  In terms of new systems, we have a new investigation management system which will be in place by the end of this year.  It is based on the current PULSE architecture.  It will be able to work with our new system when it is in place.  Putting all that together is expensive and involves a lot of work.  In fairness to the Government, it has given us the funding to start off that modernisation and renewal programme in order that, when we get our new system, the new systems which we are developing right now or which have developed in the last two or three years will be able to fit into it and will not be a waste of money.  I mentioned one new system introduced in 2015 which helps us track our incidents to make sure that every one is followed up on.  I did not bring any specific information in respect of who gets what.</p><p>A new contract is being worked on.

I do not think that I was ever asked to intervene during the process.  I recollect saying to the members of my staff that if they wanted me to step in that I would step in.</p></speech>

I know our discussions are on data, key performance indicators, KPIs, and multiple other crime statistics and elements.  When will the witnesses be confident that the CSO can properly verify the data that is produced?  That is a confidence issue for data collection generally.  Perhaps Dr. Singh can answer my question too.  When does Dr. Singh feel the data his unit produces will be verifiable by the CSO?  When it is, we can move on from what has been two years of repeated issues with data collection or controversies.  It is important that we see a timeline or a proposed process the witnesses can stand over in the context of when verification can be stood over and there is no repeat of this controversy.</p></speech>

Certainly when we have our six-month review completed, and we estimate that the review will take six months, and the issues that have arisen or may arise are resolved, the CSO will then be in a position to sit down with us and we can see if it is happy that all of the issues that have surfaced have been dealt with.</p> <p>  We have done a lot of work with the CSO.  We have regular meetings with the CSO so that issues relating to data, whether it is homicides, domestic abuse or whatever, can be surfaced and dealt with to give the CSO reassurances.  We are working very closely with the CSO.  As I mentioned earlier, the CSO staff come to our call centre in Castlebar to educate our people about the need for good quality data, which enables them to stand over their statistics not just in this country but in Europe.  Our reputation is at stake, in that respect.  The CSO has been very helpful whether, it is going to the Garda College and talking to our students with Dr. Singh, or going to our call centres in the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  We understand, as I mentioned earlier, that there is probably a cultural issue that we need to address within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make sure we treat data with the respect they deserve and understand the bigger picture, which was highlighted in the Crowe Horwath report.  I mean that we understand it does not just mean filling out something on the side of the road but there must a greater realisation that what we do has an impact on people's lives and on the quality of the service we give to victims of crime or the Road Safety Authority.  That cultural change has to take place and it is not just about changing the systems.  It is about educating the people too, within the organisation, on the need to treat these data seriously.  That is a wider piece of work. </p></speech>

Then, within three years, he or she passed away due to head injuries secondary to the assault or suffered a stroke or something.  What is the reclassification process if someone has already been convicted of a crime but there is a subsequent consequence under the Criminal Justice Acts?  If the crime has subsequently caused the death of the person, how is that information converted in the context of an investigation?  Will subsequent criminal proceedings take place?</p></speech>

Let us say somebody was prosecuted for the assault and the injured party subsequently passed away after the conviction, then a separate file would be produced for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with medical evidence to be able to prove that the assault was the cause of death.  Even though initially it was a section 3 or section 4 assault for which the perpetrator was convicted, one can bounce it on then and make a recommendation for a charge of manslaughter, a homicide or a murder.</p></speech>

When we do look for evidence from medical people, casualty people or from doctors, we get great assistance from them.  Very often, in some of the cases, we must go outside the jurisdiction for some of the more complex cases involving toxicology or poisoning.

I am not sure whether the witnesses think there should be an obligation, not on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but on the flipside such as the public health system, whereby if people there believe a previous incident was the cause of a changed pathological event, they then should have a mandatory reporting mechanism back to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I express my sympathies to the Fox family and the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the death of Detective Superintendent Colm Fox.</p> <p>  There is a limited amount I am going to go into here because a lot has been gone through, in some very good detail, by my colleagues.  Some of what I have to say are just observations, having listened to the debate today.  I must stress that my following observation gives me absolutely no pleasure.</p><p>Mr. Finn's concluding remarks of his opening statement reads: </p><blockquote>I fully accept Chair that the review process could have been quicker. ...<br /><br />Given the seriousness of the crimes ... <br /><br />Any issues identified ... <br /><br />In  conclusion Chair ...<br /><br />I can assure you Chair that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken this matter very seriously and will continue to do so.</blockquote><p>That could almost be said on every occasion.  Mr. Finn could lift that text as a block and drop it into almost every opening remarks An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had to make to this committee since Mr. Finn began to appear before it in the time I have been a member of it.  That speaks volumes as to how disappointing it is in terms of where we are at.  There have been so many incidents, questions and investigations all following a very similar pattern that it takes longer, it takes time, there is a great seriousness to the matter and that they cannot supply us with the information.  It says something about the whole process in which we as a committee are having to engage in dealing with some issues.  <br/><br/>I do not want to be flippant about this, and &quot;flippant might be the wrong word to use, but I have a problem with the 20-year old IT system.  What part of the 20-year old IT system told senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to consult Dr. Singh regarding the report?  Which bit of the IT system did that?</p></speech>

If we were to separate the investigators from the analysts, the investigators did their piece of work in regard to giving reassurance that yes an investigation was carried out into each of the 41 homicides.  That was probably the initial piece of work that was done, and that was responded to the Policing Authority in April and an assurance was given.  We are happy that an investigation was carried out in regard to each of those 41 homicides, that they went through either the courts system or the coroner's system, or that some of them were currently still live investigations.  That was the reassurance given, and the context in which that reassurance was given to the Policing Authority.  There were issues in that.  If the analysts had raised this issue in regard to data quality, it would have been prudent that we would have gone back to the analysts to ask if they were happy that we had addressed their issues.  In hindsight, looking back, that is where we should have done it differently in my opinion.</p></speech>

He had people on the working group, did he not, so he was effectively involved in a process in making an input?  Unless I am being completely illogical, it seems that the process of Dr. Singh asking for the report was to make sure that he could have an input into it.  He asked for the report and therefore wanted to have an input into it before the meeting with the Policing Authority,  would that be correct?</p></speech>

First, there is a joint review team, as far as I was concerned.  It was important that all members of that review team had the opportunity to look at the final report and say " Yes, we are confident.  We are happy.  This actually represents our joint views."  Second, part of the reason I felt I needed to write arose at the Policing Authority meeting when the suggestion was made that this had been signed off or had been agreed with the analysis service.  At that point I was thinking I have neither seen it nor agreed it.</p></speech>

My concern, and I believe it is one shared by other members of the committee, is that there was a deliberate attempt to exclude the analysis section of the working group in the lead up to the meeting with the Policing Authority in April 2017.  I also have a concern that there was a deliberate attempt to push through the report that was referred to at the meeting of the Policing Authority in April 2017 in the hope that this would be a line drawn in the sand under the homicide review.  At its worst, I have a concern that there was an attempt to hoodwink the Policing Authority at the meeting of April 2017.  I wish to ask Dr. Singh two questions in respect of this.  We know from what he has said that there were two analysts on the working group.  What did they say to him in respect of their response to the fact that this report was being produced without them being involved in it?</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Brophy.  It is important to say that it gives us no satisfaction at all to find ourselves in repeat engagements regarding matters such as this.  Our primary role is as legislators and we have a backlog of legislation that no other committee has to contend with, so it is hugely frustrating.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feels this, it is not unique.  I can say that I found it incredible.</p> <p>  On the PULSE system not being fit for purpose, we have had a number of engagements regarding PULSE, particularly with regard to the false breath test recording.  That was very serious given what the whole business of breath testing is about.  Lives are at stake.  Here we are dealing with a situation relating to homicides - murders - being misrecorded or not being updated in terms of the detail recorded on the PULSE system.  I have no doubt that there is a very serious level of public disquiet about all of this.  Public confidence has been seriously impacted upon.  I repeat what I have said previously, namely, that public confidence in our policing service - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - is imperative to ensure that Mr. Finn and his colleagues can do the best job possible.  We are here in the hope of being able to help in some regard to reach that point.  Mr. Finn's point about the PULSE system not being fit for purpose may very well be true but, as Deputy Brophy highlighted and I am now reiterating, it was not the PULSE system that activated 1 million plus false recordings.  One changes the system but it is the practice and the people that are at issue.  The regularity of false recording, misrecording and not updating suggests a cavalier attitude within the service to the PULSE system.  It suggests a less than serious acceptance of the important role and function it can play.  Otherwise, why in heaven's name would members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participate in false recording, misrecording and not updating records?  I cannot think of any other comparable situation where that would be tolerated and accepted.  I find it incredible.  Yes, it is great to see a new system introduced.  I am not going to ask Mr. Finn to respond to this one question.  I will put a couple.  What is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na doing to arrest this attitude and behaviour within the force?  That must happen in tandem with any equipment updating.</p> <p>  Mr. Finn referred to the 41 cases.  I welcome what was said but I have a question to pose.  Mr. Finn indicated that these cases were investigated.  I accept that they were investigated but would a particular classification alter the course of the investigation employed?  I do not for a moment suggest any lack of thoroughness.  An investigation could be because these are the steps one takes.  Chief Superintendent Sutton outlined the different steps that can present.  Does a situation arise where because of something being mis-recorded or not being updated, a certain level of investigation and attention to detail were not employed?  How would Mr. Finn respond to each of those points?</p></speech>

Even this morning, I was talking to one of my colleagues about an investigation into a death.  Significant work was done pursuing that investigation involving following every line of inquiry.  What if that investigation turns out to be a homicide or an accidental death?  We will not know until we conclude that process, which is ongoing.  From my experience of working as an operational chief superintendent and superintendent, every one of the investigations in which I was involved was done thoroughly and every line of inquiry was pursued.  Could I honestly say that the PULSE incident reflected every one of those?  That has been our weakness.  PULSE started out as a system for recording crimes.  Twenty years later, we have asked it to be something totally different in terms of being a tool to record everything we do.  Given the way technology has evolved, PULSE is outdated.  We are talking about technology from a different era.  That does not mean that our investigations were not done.  I would be 100% confident that we do investigate every one of those incidents.  Every one with which I was involved was thoroughly investigated.  Did the PULSE incident reflect the final status of that investigation?  I think that is where we have let ourselves down in terms of our data and what we recorded on PULSE.  Just because something starts out as an assault does not mean it will not end up in the courts as murder.  Did we always go back and update the incident?  That is where we let ourselves down and that is where we need to change the culture.  The Chairman is right.  I have gone out and spoken to every chief superintendent and superintendent across the country regarding data, its importance and how it is impacting negatively in terms of breath tests when we did not do them right and record them accurately.  The same is true of homicides.  I have gone out and spoken to every chief superintendent and superintendent across the country saying that we must do it right.  Public confidence is eroded when we do not do it right.  Today is an example with regard to homicides.  I can assure members that the investigations were done and for each of the 41 investigations we are discussing, the operational end of them was done.  Yes, the Policing Authority would like us to come back and give it a belt-and-braces reassurance that they were done in a way that was compliant with Article 2.  Can it come out and say with confidence that it has reviewed every one of those investigations and that they were done properly?  That is what we are going to do because the public and the Policing Authority demand it.  I hope that when we return in six months' time, the committee will confident enough to say that it is happy we have carried out that investigation and have put this to bed in terms of any issues regarding the quality of our data.</p></speech>

People from our IT department will make data transfers to the CSO regularly.  Where there are IT issues, it will be resolved at that level.</p> <p>  On the question of giving the CSO any additional information, there is a group at senior level - I was on it with Dr. Singh - which would work with the CSO if it was looking for some additional information or data fields or had queries about data given to it.  The CSO is independent in what it does.  Any interaction we would have with it would be in the context of facilitating it and giving it additional information or data.</p></speech>

For families who lost loved ones in such circumstances, it is bound to have caused some concern and, perhaps for others, some distress.  The review of the period 2013 to 2015 identified 41 cases.  Now, however, the period from 2003 to 2017 is to be reviewed.  That is a considerable body of work and it will take five or six months to respond.  Is there any way of dealing with it more speedily?  I know there is a further outworking on cases identified.  Initially, the process of establishing the statistics would bring us out of this maelstrom, first and foremost, and then there is other work to be done subsequently.</p> <p>  Is there any way this can be expedited?  Is there an understanding of how important it is to have the CSO situation resolved?  I know that, next week, Garda management must meet the Policing Authority to discuss this issue.  A public engagement such as this will not reimbue confidence among the wider public.  This matter needs to be addressed substantively and speedily.  Is there anything Garda management can do to help reach that point?</p></speech>

It can be done in blocks on a year-by-year basis.  As we get information from the State Pathologist, it can then be fed back to the chief superintendent and his team to ensure they can be working on that aspect of it.</p> <p>  The mistake we made in the past was to rush it and do it piecemeal.  We then ended up having to do parts of it again.  If we are to learn a lesson from the past, we need to integrate and verify the information in the data fields.  Then we can come back with the reassurance the material is correct.  The mistake we made last year was we did it piecemeal and not in a wholesome way.</p> <p>  We will certainly put in whatever resources we need.  The only restriction will be the number of people in the analysis service who have the knowledge to integrate the State Pathologist's database.  We only have one person with the knowledge and experience to do that for us.  That is the stumbling block.</p></speech>

He also spoke about the lack of co-operation that he would have quite rightly expected when he sought a copy of the said report.  As a civilian member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or from the experience of any others working in his service, is there a them-and-us attitude in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between ranked members and civilian staff?</p></speech>

However, the people who work in my service have had an excellent working relationship with operational officers in terms of bringing forward cases, investigations and developing operational work.  Externally, people have pointed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service as a great example of civilianisation because it provides a unique function in supporting operational garda&iacute; like Colm Fox, whose funeral I would have loved to have been at today.</p><p>We have a very good connection with the operational side.</p></speech>

Is that experience universal in the context of bringing information to the attention of the Garda?  Is such information taken on board, acted upon and respected?</p></speech>

As part of that process, my members of staff became very frustrated.  If the Chairman is asking whether it reflects the generality, I will come back to my earlier point that I see variance.  We have great working relationships with investigators, and we have done great work to support the development of national operations, but there are variations in this.  Whether it is unique to civilian status, I do not know.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is as simple as that , to be perfectly honest.  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan referred to the worst-case scenario, namely, that there was a deliberate attempt not to give the Policing Authority the full impression.  This may not be the case.  However, the fact Dr. Singh was not given this report is of great seriousness, particularly in the context of what we are discussing.  We are discussing cases of the greatest seriousness that include the loss of life.  The analysis service had knowledge of this for months in advance of the meeting and it flagged its interest in this on a number of occasions before the meeting.  In this context, it is very difficult to imagine how a decision could have been reached or how the report was not provided to Dr. Singh for sign-off, particularly in light of its significance and the inevitable considerable public commentary at the Policing Authority meeting and in the aftermath thereof.  I find that difficult to credit.</p> <p>  My question relates to the fact the Garda Inspectorate report on changing policing in Ireland recommended putting in place the position of a director of data quality.  Am I correct in stating this has not yet been done?</p></speech>

I do not intend to make a Second Stage speech except to say that this is a short piece of legislation that supports the thriving craft brewing industry in Ireland.  The legislation also helps out a number of other producers of various different forms of beverage whether it is cider or perry distilleries.  There are two winemakers in Ireland, which was news to me.</p><p>I was motivated to draft this legislation because the brewing industry is thriving and growing all of the time.  It can be found in the four corners of Ireland and in various rural areas, which brings employment.  There is an anomaly in the licensing laws whereby brewers cannot sell their produce on site unless they have a wholesale licence where they can sell on a large scale.  They cannot sell on site.  They cannot have visitors, give them tours of their breweries and allow visitors to buy their products.  I felt that the anomaly is holding back the industry and the industry approached me about the matter.  I have spoken in depth with tourism authorities.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland wants to create a branded product and cater for visitors to Ireland who are interested in this topic.  My Bill deals with the anomaly.  My Bill proposes to create a licence where a person can go to the District Court or Circuit Court in order to sell on-sales and off-sales, depending on which one wants, but a person could sell both.  The legislation also proposes that if there is a tour, the brewer can have on-sales in the brewery.  It is also my intention that anyone who visits a brewery can take away off-sales.  Parts of my legislation are very important and we will tease out any issues.</p><p>I thank the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, in particular Mr. Seamus Carroll, for working very closely with me on this matter for more than a year.  I also thank everyone who spoke on Second Stage because we had unanimous support in the House.  My legislation will not create new pubs or off-licences and is restricted to the actual products that are brewed on site.  Let us imagine how it would feel if one could not purchase products on site having visited a vineyard in Italy, Spain, France or, indeed, the west coast of the United States where there are many craft breweries.  The industry employs nearly 500 people at present and enactment of my legislation will allow a fledgling industry to flourish.  I hope that we can deal with the Bill quickly and it will move on to Report Stage, and then through the Seanad because many of the craft brewers are waiting to expand their premises and create visitor centres, etc.  All they need is for the legislation to be passed.</p></speech>

It was made clear that, in particular, the granting of a licence by the Revenue Commissioners would be conditional upon the presentation of a court certificate, which members will be aware is the normal procedure applicable to retail sales.</p><p>I am very keen to ensure that we can advance this piece of legislation this morning and, as Deputy Kelly has said, that we can proceed to the appropriate next Stages with an objective in mind that we would have matters completed over the next few weeks, which would facilitate an early commencement.  </p><p>Amendment No. 1 contains the Government's principal proposals.<font color="#FFFFFF">End of Take</font></p><p>It will replace section 1 of the original Bill in its entirety.  Subsection (1) provides for the granting of a court certificate to an applicant who is the holder of a manufacturer's licence in respect of manufacturing premises to which persons are admitted for the purposes of a guided tour of the premises.</p><p> The court will grant a certificate to the applicant in respect of the premises on being satisfied of a number of things.  First, the court will need to be satisfied of an appropriate manufacturing licence being in force in respect of the premises.  Second, a system will need to be in place to restrict retail sales to those who have visited the premises and to those who have participated in a guided tour of the premises unless it prohibits the issuing of the licence on a number of other grounds, which are already known in legislation, being the character, the misconduct or the unfitness of the applicant, the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises in issue or the unsuitability of the premises for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood.  This provision, which will be known to members, is based on section 28 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 which governs the grant of retail licences.  I draw members' attention to the fact that, unlike section 18, there is no need to extinguish an existing licence for the purposes of obtaining a licence under this legislation.</p><p> Subsection (2) provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall, on presentation of the court's certificate, issue the licence in respect of the premises concerned while subsection (3) provides for the renewal of the licence.  All retail licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor of any description are subject to an annual renewal process.</p><p> Subsection (4) provides that where a retail licence is issued in respect of the premises any other licence, apart from the manufacturer's licence, shall be extinguished.  This corresponds with section 1(4) of the original text of the Bill, the view being that this will discourage holders of public house licences that may have an on-site brewery from applying for the licence or feeling that they have the need to apply for the licence, as they will have a public house licence in any event.</p><p> Subsection (5)  provides that the licence issued under this section will permit the sale of intoxicating liquor products manufactured on the premises between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day of the year, and this has regard to recently passed legislation.  It also provides that the supply of the products will be for visitors who have participated in a tour of the premises.  Where the court certificate has been granted by the Circuit Court, the products may be sold for consumption on or off the premises and where granted by the District Court, the products must be consumed off the premises.</p><p> Subsection (6) provides for excise duty of &euro;500 at the request of the Revenue Commissioners, which is in line with other excise licences, and subsection (7) imposes the standard requirement for the applicant for a retail licence to have a current up-to-date tax clearance certificate.</p><p> Subsections (8) and (9) make provision for the offences.  In subsection (8), it shall be an offence for a person to sell intoxicating liquor, for the sale of which a licence is required, without such a licence and subsection (9) corresponds with the original text.  Subsection (10) contains the required definitions and I draw attention to the definition of the court.  It means the Circuit Court if the applicant intends to sell products produced on the premises for consumption on or off the premises.  If the intention is to sell products for consumption off the premises, an application may be made to the District Court.</p><p> I will deal with the other amendments when Deputy Wallace moves his amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.747" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#B00200"><p>I commend Deputy Alan Kelly on bringing this forward as it is a good idea and makes sense.  It addresses an area which has been ignored.  The development of small craft breweries is a new phenomenon in Ireland, though not so new in Europe, and it is good that we address it.</p> <p>  I have a vested interest.  First, Wallace wine bars only sell craft beer.  At the beginning we imported beers from Italy but we now use a lot of Irish beer because they are getting better and better and brewers in Ireland are getting better at what they are doing all the time, which is brilliant.  My son, Fionn, is also building a brewery so it would be remiss not to declare my interest in this topic.</p> <p>  The Bill is a little bit fuzzy and we need to clean it up a bit.  I am aware that there have been challenges in bringing the Bill forward but I prefer Deputy Kelly's initial Bill to the one with the amendments.  I am not suggesting massive changes but I hope that, on Report Stage, we might address some anomalies.  The Government amendments would effectively replace the Bill as initiated, and, at the same time, if accepted would make my amendments null and void.  It would make for legislation that would only serve a few large breweries and not give a financial boost to many of the microbreweries getting on their feet in this country in recent times.</p> <p>  I have four amendments to the Bill as initiated, namely, amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive.  Amendment No. 2 is addressed in the Government amendments in that winemakers would also be included in the new licence.  The intention of amendment No. 3 is to do away with the necessity to have a guided tour in order to obtain this licence.  I understand the Government's thinking on this matter but this provision is expanded and strengthened in the Government amendments, which would be to the detriment of microbreweries.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 4 would serve to extend the hours of the operation of this licence by one hour in order to allow for people to call by after work to buy beer from their local brewery, and also in order to allow the breweries to complete the brew in the morning on weekend days as this will most commonly be the time microbreweries have the opportunity to open up the brewery to the public while still having time to set up for visitors and get in a few hours of tasting for the beer tourists they attract.  Is the Minister being a bit cynical?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.749" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#B00400"><p>Amendment No. 5 covers some of the same areas covered in the Government amendments, namely, addressing the recent change to the legislation around the closure of bars on Good Friday.  It also includes winemakers in the list of those who can avail of this licence.  In effect, the Government amendment No. 1 runs counter to my amendments Nos. 3 and 4 in that it keeps the hours for operating this licence at between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. each day, and it doubles down on the necessity of the tour provision.</p> <p>  I will explain why these two elements of the Government amendments should not be accepted.  The hours question follows on from the arguments around the tour requirement, so that can be discussed afterwards.  Government amendment No. 1 invents two licences, one for on and off sales, for which one needs to apply to the Circuit Court, and one for off sales only, for which one applies to the District Court.</p><p>With the provisions in subsection (1) of the proposed new section 1, both licences could only be attained if the applicant could prove to the court that he or she is fit to hold the licences and of decent character, that the premises is convenient and fit - for tours and the consumption of alcohol on the premises, one guesses, although the legislation is not clear on this point - and that having tours and possible consumption inside the premises would not be inconvenient for neighbours.  The legislation is not clear on how these conditions will be proven.  Must the applicant get a certificate from some Government body to prove his or her suitability in all these areas?  Is there a public consultation process and timeframe for complaints against the application for the licences?  Either way, hurdles are being erected and, where the applicant is out of favour with the local authorities, the local publicans or the locals generally, there is plenty for them to go on to halt this process.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is a contradiction in the proposed Government amendment.  For an applicant to qualify for an off-sales licence, or off and on-sales licences, he or she must show that guided tours can be held on the premises and that the premises is suitable for guided tours in the first place.  This automatically rules out a great number of the microbreweries in Ireland from qualifying for these licences.  Many microbreweries are packed to the rafters with fermenters, pipework and brewing and packaging materials as many producers start out with small enough kits and, as they see increasing demand, purchase more fermentation and storage vessels until they have no more room to move in their workspaces.  These breweries which are doing a lot in a small space, generally due to lack of investment and available funds to expand to bigger premises, are both precisely those who need the help this Bill could offer them financially and, because of the way in which the Government amendments are crafted, those who will not benefit from the Bill.  These overcrowded breweries will not have the space to have guided tours or on-sales consumption either.  They will not qualify past requirement (ii) in subsection (1) of the Government amendment, that is, &quot;the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises&quot;.<br/><br/>The most pernicious part of the legislation is that if one cannot prove one's suitability to operate a tour, not only can one not have on-sales consumption of the products one makes, but one is also prohibited from off-sales.  The Government amendment is very clear in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) that the sale of alcohol is restricted to persons who have completed a tour of the premises.  Nowhere else do the Government amendments make a special provision for off-sales, or those who do not have the space to have a tour.  This makes a mockery of the invention of the second licence.  If one does not have the space to satisfy the suitability criteria for a tour, one cannot have off-sales anyway, so why do we need a special off-sales-only licence?  If one had the space for the tour, presumably one would have the space for on-site consumption too, the ability to clear an area for a group of people to sit down and have a tasting experience.  There does not seem to be much reason to apply for the off-sales-only licence if one qualified for any licence in the first place.<br/><br/>What is proposed here is legislation designed to benefit the bigger breweries, that is, those that are on their second expansion and have some extra space on their new premises.  The smaller breweries trying to get off the ground, if the Government amendments are passed, will not even be able to sell six-packs to their next-door neighbours because they do not have breweries with enough space for tours.  Add to this the ridiculousness of the requirement to provide a tour to every person who wants to buy a can of beer or bottle of wine - and to be able to prove that one has given a tour to the person who buys the six-pack or whatever else.  How will this be enforced?  The amendment states in the proposed subsection (1)(b) &quot;an appropriate mechanism is in place to restrict the sale pursuant to a licence granted under this section of intoxicating liquor on the premises to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises&quot;.  It is difficult not to read this as saying the Government is not mad about the Bill in the first place.<br/><br/>In the UK, at weekends, some breweries do their work in the morning, clean up and then open up an entrance at one end of the brewery, cordoning off access to the nuts and bolts of the brewery and setting up a tasting facility whereby they get to sell directly to their customers and get instant feedback on new brews that perhaps one can only taste on these days.  In some states in the US there are breweries that only sell their beers directly from the breweries.  People travel from far and wide for a chance to purchase some special edition brews that are only available on that day at that place.  This is beer tourism.  It is not about the setting up of a pub scenario; it is about people who are passionate about these products travelling to places to have experiences they cannot get anywhere else.  It is great for the finances of the brewery as it means that on a small percentage of its production it can get margins that usually go to others along the chain and it can have a better chance of survival.  Four microbreweries have closed down in Ireland in the past year.  The people travelling to have these experiences inject money into the local economies surrounding the places of alcohol production that otherwise would not come to those areas.  In the long run Ireland can become the proper drinks tourism destination that it is not quite at present.<br/><br/>Regarding the issue of opening hours, the reality is that breweries are usually staffed with just enough people to do what is necessary and these people all multitask.  It is a hard graft, especially at the start, when it is difficult to afford to employ many people given the tight margins when production is small.  This means that for smaller breweries the weekend would probably be the only suitable time to have tours, tastings and off sales - and tours for every person who buys a beer.  The Government amendment sets up a very busy time for those working to make this licence work for them financially - that is, if they were able to qualify for the licence in the first place, taking into account how the amendment is stacked against smaller producers.  The requirement of a tour for every off-sale and the requirement of a guided tour for every on-sale means in reality that smaller breweries will not be able to avail of the licence while producing their product.  During the week, from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m., the vast majority of Irish people will be at work.  This, coupled with the guided tour requirements in the amendment, is designed to stop local people from buying alcohol products from their local producers.  The Bill will give with one hand and take away with the other.  The Government amendment will make the Bill less fit for purpose except for the bigger breweries that have extra staff and extra space.  If the operation of the licence were extended to 7 p.m., local people could drop by to buy some products after work and producers could get their everyday work out of the way on weekends and get some use out of the licence, with a couple of hours for the tastings.  In short, there must be some differentiation between this licence and a normal pub licence.  The fact that the hours are so short and will be over before most people even go to the pub and that one can only drink or buy the products made at these places is a pretty big difference already, but the amendment hangs all that difference on the requirement to provide a tour.  In the process the Government amendment sets up a situation in which many of those that need the benefits of the legislation the most, namely, the smaller breweries, will not get licences in the first place.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelly and I are probably the only two members present who have been in the breweries in Ireland.  They can be a little all over the shop.  Of course, for health and safety reasons, tours cannot be allowed in places that cannot meet health and safety standards.  Anyone visiting these breweries will see that having tours in some of them just would not be practical, and I assure the Minister that he can completely forget about tours taking place while they are brewing.  This would not be possible.  Italy started this 20 years before us and is well ahead of us, but even in the Italian breweries, which are fantastic to walk around, and where one can see tours work really well, one could not have a tour while brewing is taking place.  It is out of the question.  There is just too much stuff such as pipes all over the place and too much activity.<br/><br/>I look forward to the enactment of the legislation.  I just ask that we think a little more about the smaller guy whom we need to help get off the ground.  This is indigenous industry, and the Government does not need me to tell it that Ireland has been very weak in supporting indigenous industry for as long as we can remember.  We are so dependent on foreign direct investment.  Of course we are delighted that foreign direct investment provides so many jobs in Ireland, but it is becoming more and more obvious, especially in rural areas of the country, that any new foreign direct investment coming to Ireland, if it does not involve extensions to places in Cork, Limerick or Galway, is coming to the Dublin hub because that is where all the action is and everyone wants to be near Dublin now.</p><p>It is becoming even more difficult to get those involved in foreign direct investment to start something new away from the Dublin hub.  That further emphasises the need for us to be more supportive of indigenous industry. </p><p> The craft brewing industry can be powerful and will help small distillers.  Wine and other drinks are being made.  It is a win-win for the country.  Approximately 365 craft breweries open in Italy every year.  They are small in nature and often expand when they find their feet and are then more sensible and economic to run.  If 365 breweries open in Italy every year, one can imagine that they cannot possibly become large breweries.  That would not make sense because the market would not be there.</p><p> In Ireland we have an opportunity to help the industry grow.  People already recognise that Ireland has gained a powerful reputation for distilling whiskey.  We are becoming renowned worldwide for it and can do the same with craft beer.  I hope that we can improve the anomalies in the Bill and make it better on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We said on Second Stage that we would support it and will support it on Committee Stage.  We would like to see it passed.</p> <p>  Any time a Bill with the words "intoxicating liquor" in it goes through the Oireachtas, it should be said that we have an extremely troubled and complicated relationship with alcohol in this country.  The graveyards and hospitals of the country are full of people whose lives were destroyed by alcohol.  It shows that we need to develop a more mature attitude to how we consume and our relationship with alcohol.  The Bill will probably be helpful in developing a more mature attitude to alcohol.  The craft breweries which are being developed encourage people to be more interested in the taste of alcohol rather than its effects and will assist in making the country more mature about its relationship with alcohol.</p> <p>  I listened to what Deputy Wallace had to say about his amendments.  I will wait to hear what the Minister and Deputy Kelly have to say in reply.  I noted the amendments put forward by the Minister and Deputy Wallace have references to something called "perry".

I do not have a vested interest, as it happens.  In terms of competing amendments, I have different views on them and there is value in both.  I disagree with Deputy Wallace on some areas.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, no matter the circumstances, we have to take intoxicating liquor seriously.  There is sense in having criteria in respect of the suitability of a premises.  One has to take into account proximity to schools and all of that.  That is relevant.  Having said that, the case has been well made in respect of small microbreweries where it would be neither suitable nor workable to provide a tour.  Whatever about on-sales, in terms of off-sales, there is an obvious logic in people being in a position to travel to microbreweries and purchase directly.  I would be interested in listening to the Minister and Deputy Kelly.  The case has been well made about the ability to purchase on site in very small microbreweries.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace mentioned that the &euro;500 fee will be prohibitive for some of the smaller start-up breweries.  Is there any flexibility around the amendment he has proposed?</p> <p>  I refer to the guided tour obligation.  What oversight does the Minister propose for that?  In terms of people who purchase a guided tour, how will completion be assessed in the context of the licence?  Is it unnecessarily difficult in the context of the Bill?  Will a licence provider sell a particular tour with an option for completion?  Perhaps the Minister could explain how completion will be assessed in the context of the licence being proposed.  While I understand the reasons behind it, I am not sure how State oversight can be provided for in the legislative criteria in the context of the licence.  It could easily be circumvented by particular microbreweries if a tour is not possible, as Deputy Wallace said.  How does the Minister see the amendment being adhered to in the context of what he is proposing?</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge that Deputy Kelly has produced a very good piece of legislation.  From my perspective, there are two aspects on which I would like to comment.  The first is the issue of tours.  I can understand the reservations being expressed about it and they are fair.  At the end of the day, if one takes out the tour element, one effectively transfers this from what I understood it to be, which was the development of legislation to enable a tourism promoted sector and the ability of people to access a tour and purchase alcohol to, in effect, a licence for a commercial premises to sell its products to manufacturers and retail stores.  They are two different things.  I can understand why any small microbrewery or manufacturer would want to have a retail operation for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Wallace, such as margin and everything else.  It is something which is inherently different from the notion of facilitating a process like a tour which is designed to have a very different element.</p> <p>  In respect of the 6 p.m. cut-off, an extra hour would be very beneficial because if tours are being conducted and there is an access point, the cut-off will be 4 p.m., 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m. depending on the length of the tour.  The proposal for an extra hour has some validity.  I would be cautious about moving to remove the tour element completely because it would turn this into a licence for a manufacturer's retail store.  We need to examine that carefully in terms of the other aspects of what we are trying to do around alcohol in the country.  </p></speech>

I believe 64 new micro-breweries have been set up in the country in recent years which have created almost 500 jobs.  That is a massive plus.  However, I do have a concern about the sale of alcohol and I must disagree with my colleague here.  I believe the opening hours, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., are a good start.  The last thing I want to do is to encourage people to go to these breweries just to buy drink and take drink home.</p> <p>  Tours of these facilities is a good idea.  I have been regularly lobbied in County Louth because a few of the new breweries are located there.  I visited one or two of them myself and they have fantastic set ups.  Instead of changing everything in one go, I believe we should wait and see what happens over the next couple of years.  I would be delighted if jobs were created and if it encourages tourism in different areas, that would be a major plus.  As a non-drinker, a pioneer, I was very impressed with the set-up in these breweries.  I know that Deputy Wallace has much more experience than I do in going to Italy and having a look at such places.  Italy might have a 20-year head start on us, but we should be taking our time with this anyway.  It is something that could really kick off in this country.  I spoke last week in the debate on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, and there was debate on Irish whiskeys and different types of labels.  I would hate to see a stigma attached to this.  Ireland is known as a country that manufactures good alcoholic products.  I believe we have an opportunity of increasing tourism with these micro-breweries but we should take one step at a time.  Let us work with the Minister.  It could be something good and could lead to employment opportunities.  It might also help to educate young people about what actually goes into their drinks.  </p> <p>  Tours would be a massive plus, especially for schools.  Many people do not know what actually goes into the manufacturing of alcohol or about all the different contributors, such as local farmers, who get involved in the process.  A tour would be a fantastic way to get young people to understand the manufacturing process of the drinks.  </p> <p>  We are talking about increasing the opening hours from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  I believe that would give the wrong impression.</p></speech>

It might be as well for the Minister to also hear Deputy Kelly's response to the various contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.766" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#E00300"><p>I thank members of the committee for their contributions and the general support for this measure.</p> <p>  Ultimately, what we are doing is supporting a fledgling industry that is growing all the time.  It is an industry that has probably reached capacity in terms of how much it can grow and expand under the current legislation.  I do not believe it can grow much more.  It has probably reached its peak.  It is possible that we can create a scenario whereby we can educate more people around the country, and particularly internationally, about the brand of Irish craft beer.  That is what this is about.  It has knock-on effects for the agriculture industry, the servicing industry, the transport industry and a whole range of other things as well.  It could grow exponentially.  </p> <p>  In terms of education on alcohol and its misuse, this is a very positive step because this shows what brewers are doing at a local level, how beer is made, what ingredients go into it and the culture and the history of many of these breweries.  There is a whole process.  One can go to Tipperary and see White Gypsy or to Laois to see 12 Acres, to west Kerry and see the breweries down there or those in Carlingford in Louth.  Each area has its own beer.  There is an education process around that.  Each beer has a different taste and can complement different types of food.  It is like wine tasting; an educational process which is not all about young people getting as much beer into themselves as possible.  There are different experiences available when one drinks beer sensibly and socialises in the proper manner.  Statistics have shown that people who drink craft beer actually drink less because it is a whole experience, rather than just the consumption of alcohol for the sake of it.  That has been shown by international and local studies.  That is a good thing.</p> <p>  As to where we go from here, the Minister is generally very supportive and has said so himself.  The Department also has been quite supportive.  This Bill seeks to address anomalies and to provide some practical legislation to allow this industry to move forward.  </p> <p>  On the amendments which have been put forward, I agree that wine should be brought in.  I have no issue with the time change at all, because it will allow people to clean up after their day.  The issue of the suitability of premises is something of which many of the craft brewers I have visited - and I know a huge number of them at this stage - are aware.  These people know that they are going to have to invest, but they will not invest in the clean-up and reorientation to meet with health and safety standards unless this legislation is passed in the first place.  We are in a chicken-and-egg scenario.  Some of these breweries are quite small but there is still the capacity to do tours.  I have been in a number of such breweries which have had visitors.  It basically involves ring-fencing a certain area.  They still need to invest in that.  </p> <p>  I do not particularly have an issue with the idea of licences put forward by the Minister.  In fairness to the Minister and his Department they are obliged to work through earlier legislation and to try to make it fit here.  I appreciate that.  The proposed licence is restrictive in that it applies only to the produce that is sold on-site.  We met the Department to ensure this would be a distinguished licence and the issue of the tour arose.  I believe that a tour, in terms of on-sales and supporting the craft brewers in that area, is the way to go.  I have gone through this idea with the craft brewers and their association.  It creates a distinction in terms of the type of licence that will be in place for them.  </p> <p>  We need to distinguish off-sales to a degree.  I was educated about off-sales during this process.  I believe one is allowed to sell 17 l.  These craft brewers can sell kegs for parties and things like that.  That is permitted at the moment.  The issue, which I believe we will sort out through Report Stage, is to ensure that a craft brewer will also be able to sell off-licence to local people at smaller amounts than that.  For example, if a person in Templemore is holding and event, he or she should be able to go to White Gypsy in Templemore, or if in Laois people can go to 12 Acres, and purchase a small amount of bottles or cans for that purpose.  It would be very unusual and would not make sense if a craft brewer was not able to do that.  </p> <p>  On the amendments - and I know the committee is under pressure in terms of timelines today - I am willing to work with the Minister and the Department, and indeed Deputy Wallace and others who have an interest in this.  We can support the amendment that has been put forward by the Government with a view to making alterations on Report Stage based on Deputy Wallace's amendments, and based on dealing with the issue of small amounts of off-sales under such a licence, which is an anomaly which has to be dealt with.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#F00100"><p>I am sure people are all mindful that we are dealing with a complex area of law, on which the legal texts date back to the 6th century.  It is against that background that we are now expanding and developing further the sale and distribution of a product that has been a highly restricted substance in Irish law for centuries.  I am not sure if it is ironic but we need to be mindful that, as we debate this matter in the bowels of our Parliament, there is a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the course of passage through the Houses and that changes which specifically govern the relationship between transport and intoxicating liquor have recently been introduced.</p> <p>  I am pleased that Deputy Wallace, when moving the amendments, declared a vested interest.  That is the context in which he is proposing the amendments.  If this committee were to regard the Bill as the great liberalisation of our licensing laws whereby, at the stroke of a pen, we would introduce in the region of a further 200 public houses - or perhaps many more - throughout the country, then I would be concerned.  Having regard to the proliferation of microbreweries and the importance of breweries and distilleries to the industry, this figure is likely to increase.  It was against this background that Deputy Kelly introduced the Bill, which would facilitate these breweries and distilleries in the supply of their products in small quantities to persons visiting their premises or, as Deputy Wallace stated, beer tourists.  I am supportive of this legislation, as is Government.  It is important that we recognise the points that Deputy Kelly put forward.  I would be very concerned if, as Deputy Wallace said, we were legislating for the larger breweries and were not helping microbreweries.  It is important that we acknowledge the importance of the industry.  Some of the breweries I have visited are very much on the micro in scale, they are small and it was never intended that they become international breweries or distilleries of huge size.  I want to assist them along the lines that Deputy Kelly has suggested.  In doing so, however, I want to recognise that we are dealing with something which these Houses have always regarded as a restricted sales product.  That is the balance we need to achieve.</p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers raised the issue of a fee.  That is the standard Revenue fee for governing the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor.  I do not intend to introduce a new scale of fees or have exemptions for people in some parts of the country.  The Deputy highlighted an important issue when he spoke about the tours or guided tours and what they entail.  That will be a challenge, as Deputy Wallace observed, in areas of restricted size and space.  We will probably need to establish what exactly we are talking about.  Perhaps between now and Report Stage we could work on defining the guided tour.  I have visited many of these establishments and it would seem that an office operative, a worker or a guide would take people around the premises in order that they might have the opportunity to see the vats in operation, witness the brewing process and then return to the lobby where they might be entitled to sample the product if they wish.  They could then be in a position whereby they could take away a memory of their visit in the form of a small supply.  That is restricted under law to an amount that someone mentioned as being quite restrictive, but it is actually 18 l.  Reasonably good parties have been held with 18 l of beer.  I do not think this law is unduly restrictive nor do I accept that the Government's amendments are unduly restrictive.  I want to support the legislation in a way that supports the industry but not in such as way that has no regard for health and safety or for the restricted nature what is being produced on these premises.  We must do this in a way that has regard the existing law.  That is why the status of the applicant for the licence and the premises are based along existing legal requirements.  I believe that is both important and appropriate.</p> <p>  Deputy Wallace spoke of the manner in which an applicant might show that he or she is of fit character.  That is enshrined in law in the manner in which a publican or retailer applies for his or her licence on an annual basis.  A public notice is placed in the newspaper and it is open to any member of the public who may have an objection to have it aired in open court annually.  Similarly, the granting of this certificate will be based on that level of local consultation which, in effect, is an entitlement on the part of any member of the public to raise an objection or otherwise on an annual basis and whereby the court will, on the hearing of evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or from any interested party, judge the character, misconduct, unfitness or otherwise of the individual and also the suitability or otherwise of the premises.  It is very important that we give due and appropriate consideration to the suitability of a premises for persons coming onto that premises in the context of health and safety and environmental health regulations and legislation.  This cannot be seen as stand-alone legislation.  Rather, it should be seen by way of reference to a whole body of legislation across various Departments dealing with public entry onto premises or the manner in which these tours can be structured.  Despite what Deputy Wallace said, space is essential.</p> <p>  I contend that amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Wallace is not required in light of the definition of relevant licence contained in the proposed new section 1(10).  Makers of wine are already covered in paragraph (d) of the definition.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 proposes to permit the granting of licences to nominees of the holders of manufacturing licences.</p><p>I am not in favour of the amendment because it would change the responsibility and, in effect, sever the responsibility for compliance with conditions attaching to the retail licence from the holder of the manufacturing licence, which I am not sure is wise at this stage.  It would also mean that although the applicant for the licence would have to be tax compliant, there would be no necessity for the nominee to be so, which is an important aspect of holding of an intoxicating liquor licence having regard to the fact that one of the requirements on an annual basis for a licence to be granted or renewed is that the holder be tax compliant.  This is not the only legislation whereby such a certificate is required in order to obtain a licence to trade.  I cannot, therefore, accept amendment No. 3.</p><p> Amendment No. 4 seeks to extend the trading hour by a further hour, until 7 p.m.  I must remind members that during the Second Stage debate, to which there were many contributions, there was support for Deputy Kelly's proposal that the trading hours be from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  I have listened to what members have said on the issue and am disinclined to extend that any further.  That was more or less what was agreed on Second Stage.  I again make the point in the context of dealing with other amendments, in particular those of Deputy Wallace, that if we are to depart from the initial intent and import of the Bill as brought forward by Deputy Kelly, then we may be changing the law to a greater extent than was understood by many of our colleagues who spoke on Second Stage and agreed to allow the legislation progress to Committee Stage.  I am not sure if they intended there to be a change to the substance of the legislation and I say that with particular reference to the trading hours, which are important.  Deputy Wallace and those who might be exercised by a closing time of 6 p.m. have raised the issue of the 30 minutes drinking-up time traditional to other aspects of intoxicating liquor legislation.  However, I am unsure if that is appropriate to a tasting endeavour rather than a more consumption-oriented experience after the guided tour.  I am minded to retain the 6 p.m. closing time, having regard to the usual latitude.</p><p> Amendment No. 5 seeks a fundamental change to the purpose and entire scope of the Bill.  Deputy Wallace seeks to dispense with the Bill's focus on visitors who have participated in a tour of the premises.  I made reference to it earlier and am conscious of the point made by Deputy Jack Chambers in this regard but it is important that we retain the visitor experience.  Deputy Wallace referred to bus tours of beer tourists and breweries must be concerned about the suitability of the premises.  However, if such visitors are to have a rounded experience, in addition to sampling the produce they must be able to go behind the scenes and look at the nuts and bolts of the operation, which I understand is the basis of beer tourism in the United Kingdom as specifically referred to by Deputy Wallace.  I cannot accept changes to the legislation that would create a completely new type of licensed premises or depart radically from the sensible and reasonable suggestion of Deputy Kelly at the outset of the legislation.  I acknowledge Deputy Kelly's experience in this area and his expertise having regard to the close relationship he has with persons directly involved in the sector.  That is not to in any way denigrate or take away from the experience of Deputy Wallace in that regard.  I cannot accept any amendment to completely change the legislation and introduce a new type of licensed premises operating on the basis of restricted hours.</p></speech>

I am not saying that the premises should not be fit for purpose but, rather, I fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in that regard.  My amendments do not challenge the fact that premises must be fit for purpose.</p> <p>  The Minister discussed health and safety and I fully agree that there must be health and safety measures in such premises.  That is all the more reason why it might not be a good idea to allow a tour through some very small breweries where it can be a bit mad in terms of how the plant is organised.  It would be challenging from a health and safety point of view to allow tours of such premises.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that alcohol has always been a restricted product in Ireland.  He probably does not need me to tell him that the time at which the most alcohol was sold in the United States was during prohibition.  He is correct that we have an odd and restrictive approach to alcohol in Ireland but we have more problems with alcohol than any country in Europe where the laws are far more flexible.  We need to take an educated approach to the consumption of alcohol and part of the Bill brought forward by Deputy Kelly would constitute an improvement in how we relate to alcohol.  The Bill would definitely bring about an improvement in how we relate to alcohol because in 2015, the last year for which there are official figures, alcohol abuse in Ireland cost the State &euro;3.6 billion.  I do not understand why the Government is not more proactive in dealing with this problem.  Why do we still allow alcohol to be advertised through sport?  If we really care about addressing the alcohol problem, why does the State not replace the &euro;36 million a year that sporting organisations currently get from the alcohol industry?  That lack of action is beyond my understanding because using sport to promote the consumption of alcohol is the best way to get young people involved in alcohol consumption.  However, the Government is not tackling it because of lobbying and vested interests.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers discussed how to monitor and provide oversight for tours, which is a huge challenge.  I would like the legislation to be stronger in that regard.  The Bill is not restrictive but it could be more practical.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point that craft breweries are encouraging people to be more interested in the taste of alcohol.  In terms of tourism, one can complete a tour in most breweries in Ireland in a matter of minutes, and sometimes only one minute.</p><p>The tasting of the craft beer is a significant element of the tourism offering.  Deputy Kelly made the point, and he is absolutely correct, that one cannot drink a craft beer in the same way as one drinks chemical beers in the pub.  It it would not be possible.

It is a different product.  As it is made in a natural fashion, it is better for one's health.</p> <p>  The tasting of craft beer will take time and will be a larger part of the tourism offering but I welcome Deputy Brophy's support for the extended closing time of 7 p.m.  I think the vast majority of craft breweries would be happy to shorten the opening hours and open from 12 noon until 7 p.m. instead of 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.  That would be an hour less, but the hour between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. would be of significant benefit.  I would be very surprised if the craft breweries were not more comfortable with opening hours from 12 noon until 7 p.m. </p> <p>  I am from the countryside in Wexford and I go to the pubs in rural areas and there is nobody, or one could count the number on one hand, in a pub at 7 p.m.  People do not drink beer in country pubs in Ireland in a serious way at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.  Most of the pubs do not get busy until after 9 p.m.  I do not think that extending the opening hour to 7 p.m. will make the craft breweries more like a pub.  The offering is not remotely like a pub.  The craft breweries can only sell their own product, a pub can sell 100 different products and more.  A craft brewery has not a prayer of getting anywhere near what a pub is like.  </p></speech>

If a premises is too small to conduct a tour because it is not safe to do so for health and safety reasons, I do not think that brewery should be allowed to sell beer to consume on the premises.  However, I think - and Deputy Kelly raised this point - we should allow every unit to make off-sales to local people, regardless of whether they can conduct a tour.  I have no problem in agreeing to the principle of a tour for breweries that can facilitate the tour and allowing the clients to taste the craft beer in the on-site tap room.  In other words, tasting can only take place when one does a tour.  It is irrational not to allow the off-sale of quantities of craft beer to local people.  It is not practical.  Such a provision will have to be incorporated into the Bill.</p></speech>

My colleague and deputy CEO, Ms Arlene Forster, will say a little about the role of the council and proceed to outline developments in curriculum provision which may contribute to the discussion.</p> <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is a statutory body, the role of which is to advise the Minister for Education and Skills on the curriculum and assessment in early childhood in primary and post-primary education.  As well as advising on the curriculum, the NCCA has a role in advising on and supporting its implementation, but it is important to note that it is not directly involved in the implementation of curriculum change in schools and other settings.  </p> <p>  Education in the arts is critical to the education project.  We know that one cannot separate the arts from the human journey and condition.  We rely on them to bring out the fullness of our humanity.  Knowing and practicing the arts are foundational to the full and healthy development of the minds and spirits of children and young people.  That is why, ultimately, the arts are not separable from what it means to be educated in the first place.  They have always been viewed by the NCCA as an essential curriculum area in early childhood in primary and post-primary education.  For example, the newly introduced Framework for Junior Cycle includes "creativity and innovation"&rsquo; as one of the eight guiding principles of junior cycle programmes in all schools.  Among the framework's 24 statements on what learning at junior cycle must encompass are the following examples: the student creates and presents artistic works and appreciates the process and skills involved; the student values local, national and international heritage; and the student brings an idea from conception to realisation.  These are only some of the statements on learning at junior cycle.  These are all aspects of learning that, among many others, are underscored by the arts in education.  If anything, the relevance and importance of the arts have increased in recent years as curriculum developments internationally underscore the importance of generic key skills, alongside deeper subject knowledge, in 21st century learning.  To which of the key skills at junior cycle &ndash; being literate, managing myself, staying well, being creative, working with others and communicating - does education about and in the practice of the arts not contribute?  This view of the arts as fundamental to the educated young child and young person is reflected racross our curriculum development activity at all levels.  </p> <p>  My colleague will now discuss some of these developments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Arlene Forster" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018021400002#B01300"><p>I will look, first, at curriculum provisions in early childhood.  Aistear which was developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is the early childhood curriculum for children from birth to six years.  The framework describes early learning and development using four interconnected themes - well-being, identity and belonging, communicating and exploring and thinking.  Through these themes, children have an opportunity to express themselves creatively and imaginatively, to explore ways to represent ideas, feelings, thoughts, objects and actions through symbols and to develop positive attitudes towards learning and dispositions such as curiosity, playfulness, resourcefulness and risk-taking.  Aistear provides practical examples of experiences and activities through which children's creative expression can happen such as through story, song, sculpture, rhyme, play, music, dance, drawing and painting.</p> <p>  In more recent years, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Afairs and supported by the Department of Education and Skills, the NCCA has developed the Aistear S&iacute;olta Practice Guide which includes a variety of practical resources such as videos and podcasts on supporting the arts within the early years curriculum.</p><p>This year marks the 19th birthday of the primary school curriculum which aims to develop each child&rsquo;s potential to the full, including his or her creative and artistic ability.  In supporting children&rsquo;s sense of wonder and natural curiosity the curriculum promotes guided discovery and active learning in all seven areas, including the arts.  Comprising the visual arts, music and drama, the primary arts curriculum enables children to see and solve problems creatively through imaginative thinking and the development of their abilities.  It strikes a balance between children having opportunities to explore and express ideas and experiences and having opportunities to experience and respond to music, drama and the visual arts.  For example, the music curriculum focuses on listening and responding, performing and composing. <br/><br/>An interesting development in recent years in primary schools has been the further integration of education with the arts across the curriculum at infant level.  Play and playful approaches to teaching and learning are now more prevalent, increasing children&rsquo;s opportunities to engage in the creative and artistic activity referred to in Aistear and the primary school curriculum.  For example, teachers use junk art, construction play and socio-dramatic play to support concepts that we find in the visual arts curriculum such as form, shape and texture or elements from the drama curriculum such as role, character, belief and tension.  <br/><br/>In the post-primary curriculum education in the arts features across a wide range of subjects, including English, Irish, modern foreign languages, history and the new area of well-being.  Creativity and problem solving also feature strongly in new short courses and subjects such as coding and computer science.  <br/><br/>The arts also feature strongly in the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied programme in many schools.  For the purposes of this discussion we are looking, in particular, at the areas of art, music and the performing arts.  <br/><br/>The arts have always been a subject included in the post-primary curriculum.  Since September 2017, a new junior cycle visual arts specification has been introduced.  A new leaving certificate programme specification for the arts will be ready by September this year.  One of the interesting features of the new course is that it has been aligned with the common European framework of reference for visual literacy which has been of great benefit in designing and working on the specification. <br/><br/>Like art, music has also always been a subject included in the post-primary curriculum.  A new<i></i>junior cycle music<i></i>specification will be introduced in schools in September.  The course has three elements: creating and exploring; participating and music-making; and appraising and responding. <br/><br/>An interesting development in recent years has been the provision of short courses at junior cycle.  Schools can design their own short course.  Organisations and bodies such as those in the arts sector can develop a short course for take-up in schools.  The NCCA has developed a short course on artistic performance which has been available to schools since 2016.  It also collaborates with a range of arts and culture bodies and agencies.  We work the IMMA and the RIAI to produce examples of student work.<br/><br/>On visual thinking strategies, we have<i></i>collaborated with Dublin City Council's Arts Office and the organisation Visual Thinking Strategies, VTS, in the United States in researching and adopting the VTS methodology and curriculum.  The NCCA is an associate partner with Dublin City Council for the Erasmus plus project entitled, Permission to Wonder.</p></speech>

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment<b>, </b>NCCA, is conducting a review of the primary curriculum and a review of the senior cycle education programme will also commence this month.<br/><br/>Last year the NCCA oversaw an extensive consultation process on the structure of the primary curriculum and how time was used within it.  Work this year involves a further teasing out of what a redeveloped curriculum might look like and what it might include and say about teaching and learning in the years to come.  As part of this process, we will be exploring the purpose of a primary curriculum, its values and priorities, its underpinning philosophy and principles, its pedagogical approaches and the various curriculum themes, areas and subjects that should comprise the primary curriculum.  The redevelopment of the curriculum also provides exciting opportunities to consider new aspects to children&rsquo;s learning, for example, computational thinking and coding and their potential to further promote and support education on the arts. <br/><br/>The review of the senior cycle education programme will be significant and exciting for the NCCA in 2018.  It can build on existing developments at junior cycle.  It is timely because the last significant changes to the structure of the senior cycle programme took place over 20 ago.  It will, among other things, raise questions for discussion in areas such as core experiences at senior cycle, key skills for senior cycle, flexible curriculum programmes and pathways for learning, the balance we should be trying to achieve between school autonomy and prescription in the curriculum at senior cycle, and the sites for learning at senior cycle.  These are all areas in which those committed to the arts in education will have an interest.  The review offers everybody an opportunity to generate a shared vision for the senior cycle programme and a strong base from which to shape a curriculum that will genuinely meet the needs of all learners for years to come.<br/><br/>From an NCCA perspective, there is an ongoing commitment to the arts as a central area of education for the 21st century learner.  Recent curriculum developments and collaborations provide evidence of that continuing commitment.  Ongoing and future curriculum review offers everyone the opportunity to advocate for further innovation and improvement in provision for education in the arts.  The NCCA encourages all involved to participate fully in the ongoing and forthcoming reviews.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for inviting us to appear before it to outline the role of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, in the development of the arts in education programme during the past few years and offer our views on the arts programme in post-primary schools.</p> <p>  In 1987 there were six organisations in Ireland representing principals and deputy principals.  In 1989 the idea of one organisation representing everybody took root very quickly and was received enthusiastically.  In 1989 the NAPD was officially launched by the leader of the Fine F&aacute;il Party, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  The organisation has gone from strength to strength.  We have more than 1,000 members, principals and deputy principals, a 22-strong executive committee and a network of nine regional branches.  The presidents represent all three sectors - voluntary secondary schools, ETB and further education and comprehensive and secondary schools.  We have an annual conference which is usually attended by more than 500 delegates who are school leaders.  I am delighted to say this year we heard a fantastic and passionate presentation on the arts in education by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  We have a very cordial and constructive relationship with the Department of Education and Skills.  We also have consultative status with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and representation on a wide range of social and cultural organisations. </p> <p>  Since 2000 the NAPD has had an arts, culture and heritage sub-committee.  It has worked towards the development of the arts and creativity in education ever since and helped to inform and support many arts initiatives in education.  In the wake of the Benson report, The Place of the Arts in Irish Education, in 2000-01 the NAPD conducted a major survey of arts provision in second level schools.  It was followed in 2001 by the publication of a policy paper, The Arts in Our Schools.  The NAPD had a vision for a countrywide arts in education programme and in 2005 successfully lobbied the then Department of Education and Science and Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism to co-fund a programme entitled, Creative Engagement, in second level schools which was co-launched by the then Minister for Education and Science, Mary Hanafin; the then Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Mr. John O Donoghue, and the then Arts Council chairperson, Ms Olive Braiden.  It has since gone from strength to strength.</p><p>We appreciate the continued support of both Departments and the Heritage Council in our ongoing project work.  </p><p> NAPD continued its work on arts in schools by working on the development of the artists-schools guidelines 2006 which were published by the Arts Council.  In 2008 NAPD participated in the preparation and publication of Points of Alignment, an important policy document published by the Arts Council, which paved the way for the 2013 arts in education charter.  NAPD wholeheartedly welcomed the arts in education charter and participated in a number of initiatives overseen by the charter high level implementation group, with Professor John Coolahan as chairperson, including the arts-rich school scheme and the Arts in Education portal.  NAPD contributed to the development and launch of the Arts in Education portal and is a participant on its editorial board.  NAPD supported and joined the effort to create Encountering the Arts Ireland Company Limited and has taken part in the development of the new junior certificate including short courses.</p><p> NAPD envisions an education system in which schools are energised through the arts and which liberate and enthuse young people through arts and culture.  It envisions an education system in which all students have access and engagement in the arts; in which creativity is a core activity in the post-primary curriculum; and in which the arts is a priority with principals and deputy principals as instructional leaders.  </p><p> The aims and objectives of NAPD are to gain recognition of the centrality of the arts in education within the formal curriculum and as a co-curricular activity.  NAPD aims to work towards the establishment of a national strategy for the arts in post-primary education and through the implementation of the arts in education charter; to seek full Government support for our continued leadership in the schools in efforts to promote the centrality of creativity in education; to ensure NAPD representation on all bodies charged with the development of the arts in education; and to continue the development of the creative engagement project as a flagship arts in education programme in our schools.</p><p> Through its own initiatives over the past 18 years and with the support of the NAPD director and national executive, the NAPD arts and culture committee continues to advocate for the greater inclusion of the arts in education.  The NAPD sees as essential the following institutions for the promotion and development of the arts: the Department of Education and Skills; the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; the Heritage Council; the Arts Council; the high level implementation group of the arts in education charter; arts officers of the local authorities; teacher training departments in universities and colleges; teacher education centres; and education training boards.  Dialogue and co-operation with organisations that share the same or similar objectives are also essential for building partnerships and promoting culture in our schools.  These include the Poetry Ireland writers in schools scheme; the Arts in Education Portal committee; Encountering the Arts Ireland; Young Social Innovators; and also the national cultural institutions, including IMMA, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, the national theatre and Ballet Ireland.</p><p> Two of the main objectives of NAPD are to provide a united voice on issues of common concern for school leaders and to endeavour to ensure school leaders are consulted on all relevant matters and, in particular, on new initiatives that impact on their role.  </p></speech>

It is now in its 13th year.  It is the longest running multi-arts programme in second level education in Ireland.  It is administered by the NAPD, the arts, cultural and heritage committee and me.  The committee consists of the chairperson, Kay O'Brien, Anthony Condron, Mick Daly, Dr. Brendan Flynn of the Clifden Arts Festival, Mary Hanley, Patricia Hayden, Dave MacPherson, Paddy O'Connor and Michael Parsons, who is the chairperson of the Heritage Council.  The key feature of the committee is that the members who are or have been in leadership roles do the work involved on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>  Creative engagement is an arts in education programme.  Arts in education is different from just arts education.  It describes a situation in which an artist or arts group comes into a school to work with students.  Students sometimes go to the artist's place of work or to a cultural institution.  The interaction between the students and the artists is called a creative engagement.  Work produced throughout the country includes projects in visual art, poetry, prose, music, dance, theatre, heritage and film.  It is very broad.  In the creative engagement scheme the work of students in the school is enhanced by the involvement of the local artists and arts practitioners who are often chosen because they have different specialties from the teacher in a subject area.  Many of the arts practitioners are affiliated to the Arts Council.  We have the involvement of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which has a role in supporting professional artists and heritage professionals on the ground, working in tandem with the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  Through the creative engagement programme NAPD wants to encourage creativity and well-being; complement curricular learning; encourage the building of sustainable partnerships between the school community, artists, arts organisations and cultural institutions; and to provide students with opportunities to express their experiences through varied arts practices including visual arts, drama, music, dance, film and literature.  Through the creative engagement programme, NAPD hopes to create a body of work across a wide range of creative forms, including exhibitions, performances, videos, films, publications and so on, that can be widely shared and to showcase this work through NAPD and our other partners.  We also hope to link with and build on existing arts provision at local level.  </p> <p>  An application form for creative engagement funding of a proposed project is completed by interested schools before the end of October each year.  It is signed by the principal of the school and sent to NAPD.  The NAPD arts, culture and heritage committee then meets to consider applications for the project.  For the 2017-18 school year, we received 95 applications and the year before we received 113 applications.  That number has grown from 57 applications six years ago.  The selection criteria for funding is a clear indication of student engagement in and ownership of the creative activity; evidence of a partnership between the student, teacher and artist; the originality of the proposal; a clear plan of action; the process of the project is emphasised as much as the final product; and there is a potential for collaboration with and replication in other schools.</p> <p>  The creative engagement project is based initially on grants from the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Heritage Council.  It is administered through NAPD's head office.  The amount of the grant given to an application is determined by the proposal and the availability of funds.  We are always looking for more.  Applicants provide detailed projected costings on application.  Schools are encouraged to provide some form of additional funding at local level.  Schools are visited by NAPD arts committee members, who do so voluntarily, during the year and encouragement and support is given to teachers, students and artists involved.  Each is required to complete an evaluation form at the end of the school year.</p> <p>  Over the past 12 years, NAPD has been actively encouraging schools to develop their arts plan.  This anticipated the ideas contained in the arts in education charter and placed an emphasis on the role of the arts within schools.  All creative engagement schools have to initiate or produce an arts policy as part of their application for funding.</p><p>The inspectorate has taken over that role in schools as part of a wider remit but it has been and continues to be an aspect of creative engagement that has added to the quality of the arts in second level schools.  The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, will be working with the Charter High Level Implementation Group to support further support developments in school arts policies.</p><p> An annual Creative Engagement exhibition is held each year to celebrate and display the project work of the schools.  During the last two years it has been held in the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, and allows schools to show their work and share their experiences with others.  In the past we have worked with the National Museum in Collins Barracks.  We are looking for a venue for this year and, hopefully, we will be back in IMMA at some point</p></speech>

The exhibition has gone from strength to strength and is attended by a wide number of schools, educators, artists and visitors.  The accounts of the grant funding are audited annually and returns are made to the Departments involved.  To date more than 600 arts in education projects have been completed since the programme began.  The school leaders, teachers, artists and the students have made Creative Engagement what it is, an extremely popular programme which, given sufficient funding, could expand even further.<br/><br/><b></b>With respect to the new junior certificate, within the curriculum the NAPD continues to support positive change in the arts in schools.As part of the new art syllabus there is an opportunity for students to develop their abilities through the programmes being envisaged.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has mentioned some of these.  There is even a wider significance in that all students can now have some contact with the arts through the 100-hour short courses.  The NAPD was involved in creating and developing the short course on performance art among others.  It welcomes the new junior cycle programme as this offers greater flexibility and autonomy to schools to design their own courses.  Schools have a wonderful opportunity to develop ways of involving the whole school community with this new structured exposure of students to the arts.<br/><br/>The six key skills, which probably have been mentioned previously, are being creative, managing information and thinking, working with others, managing myself, staying well and communicating.  These are all central elements to life in arts education and are reflected both in the new junior certificate curriculum and the extra curricular Creative Engagement programme.<br/><br/>Much of the approach to the new junior cycle involves changing traditional teaching methods.  The teacher prepares the classes, organises the materials, the media resources and is in control but the students are expected to make their own learning within the parameters set by the teacher.  Students have to be creative.  They have to visualise.  They have to link research to their creations.  They have to collaborate and they have to manage their time. <br/><br/>As an association representing the leaders of second level schools, the NAPD has a great deal to contribute to pillar 1 of the Creative Ireland programme.  This is an exciting programme and is welcomed by the NAPD.  It is a five-year programme beginning this year and ending in 2022 and one that involves the co-operation of two or more Departments for its funding.  The NAPD not only has vast experience in arts in education programmes in schools but it has worked with both those Departments for many years.  Creative Ireland is designed to bring creativity to a wider range of people in Ireland beginning with young people.  The NAPD looks forward to making itself available to help and support Creative Ireland in achieving its aims.<br/><br/>The arts rich school as a concept was written into the 2013 Arts in Education Charter.  The NAPD members have been leading on the arts rich school for many years.  It welcomed the charter's recognition of the concept and the work that can be done in schools.  The arts rich school is currently called &quot;the creative school&quot;.The NAPD again supports efforts to enhance the role of the arts in the school.  School leaders are crucial, as Ms Kay O'Brien said, to the success of arts programmes in schools and the NAPD looks forward to offering its experience and its network to all efforts to embed the concept of  the creative school.<br/><br/>Looking to the future, applications to Creative Engagement have doubled in the past six year.  With increased financial support, the programme can continue to expand.  The NAPD looks forward to the reform of the leaving certificate syllabus, which is happening.  It looks forward to the reform of the assessment of the leaving certificate examination.  It will continue to place creativity and the arts at the centre of their schools and, as such, add to the well-being of all of our students in post-primary schools.  It will work with the high level implementation group to achieve the aims of the 2013 Arts in Education Charter.  It will work and collaborate with Creative Ireland to achieve its aims.  <br/><br/>The arts are at the heart of the nation.  They unlock the imagination.  They open up minds and hearts to new ideas.  They help us understand ourselves.  They enhance life.  We in the NAPD thank the committee for the opportunity to address its members today and we wish them every good fortune in all their work.</p></speech>

My statement is based on the progress on the implementation of the objectives of the Arts in Education Charter.  I am a member of the Arts in Education Charter implementation group since November 2013.  I represent the Department of Education and Skills on that group.  I am accompanied today by Ms Leona De Khors, assistant principal officer in the curriculum and assessment policy unit in the Department of Education and Skills.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for inviting us here to discuss the implementation of the objectives of the Arts in Education Charter.  The charter, launched in 2013, is an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, underpinned by a signed memorandum of agreement and understanding between those two Departments working in association with the Arts Council.  It has been a landmark development in the integration of the arts in education. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Professor John Coolahan was jointly appointed by both Ministers in 2013 as chair of the charter high level implementation group, HLIG, until he retired in March 2017.<br/><br/>A key feature of the work of the charter is the extent of co-operation, collaboration, networking and partnership of involved agencies which resulted.  If I were to pick out the key characteristic, that was it.  There was not a great deal of money available at the time but every organisation and entity involved in arts in education worked collaboratively together.  This co-operation is indicated by the voluntary engagement of expert personnel from a wide range of arts and education agencies on advisory committees for the promotion of the charter objectives.  The charter sets out 19 objectives and many of these are reflected in the Action Plan for Education 2016 -2019.<br/><br/>The Creative Ireland programme, which was launched by the Government in December 2016, states that the Arts in Education Charter will be embraced, fast-tracked and resourced.  The Department of Education and Skills is working closely with colleagues in the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Arts Council and the Creative Ireland team on implementing a number of exciting measures in that programme, several of which originated and are contained in the Arts in Education Charter.  <br/><br/>I will highlight a number of the initiatives and the way in which they have developed.  Ireland's Arts in Education portal, the key national digital recourse for arts in education in Ireland, was built as a result of the Arts in Education Charter and was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch there have been more than 125,000 visitors to the portal with more than 36,500 ongoing users comprising artists, teachers, schools, various stakeholders and communities.  The charter was about building communities of practice and the portal supports that.  There have been 4,236 video views today and 742 newsletter subscribers and participants in the newsletter.  The portal allows for two-way involvement, as contributors and receivers, with a focus on quality.</p><p>That has been a critical development.</p><p> As a result of that the arts in education national day has now developed into a celebration and demonstration of the success of the Arts in Education portal and is now a feature of an annual celebration, the arts in education national day.  The first one was held in the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  Last year it was held in DCU at St. Patrick's Institute of Education and this year's event, the 2018 national day of celebration will take place in Froebel Institute of Education in NUI Maynooth on 21 April.  It was always an objective of Professor Coolahan and the implementation group that everything would not be Dublin centred so we are moving out gradually.  We are getting as far as Maynooth in 2018.  It is anticipated that more than 200 participants will attend a range of presentations, workshops, demonstrations and discussion sessions at the 2018 national day.  This year, for example, after an open call, 61 submissions were received from both national and international practitioners submitting presentations or workshops with the hope of being included in the 2018 event.  We have come a long way since the launch in 2015.</p><p> Another initiative that was established in 2014 was exploring teacher-artist partnership as a model of CPD for supporting and enhancing arts education.  Many artists have gone into schools and done great work through the years but one needs to empower teachers through continuing professional development where the artist and the teacher work in partnership and then have an opportunity to engage in a residency afterwards.  That was a feature of the charter work.  Exploring teacher-artist partnerships was one of the initiatives.  The initiative is led by the Department of Education and Skills, via the Association of Teachers'/Education Centres in Ireland, ATECI, in partnership with Encountering the Arts Ireland, ETAI, which is represented here today, and the Association for Creativity in Arts Education, ACAE, representing individual teachers and support service personnel with a particular interest in the arts and arts education, and is now supported by the Creative Ireland programme.  That is an example of an initiative that had developed.  In fact, teacher-artist partnership CPD was one of its first initiatives in pillar 1 in the first year of Creative Ireland 2017.  It was delivered nationwide across the network of education centres.  It works on the structure of the teacher summer course programme that always existed.  Teachers and artists take part in those initiatives and work in partnership and then go back to a residency opportunity in a school.</p><p> Artists and teachers are trained to work in partnership in the domain of formal primary education.  It consists of summer courses where artists and teachers participate together followed by in-school residencies.  In 2017, 302 teachers and 80 artists were trained in 21 education centres.  With the funding and support of Creative Ireland the strategic plan outlines that it is hoped to train 3,260 teachers and 652 artists in teacher-artist partnership by 2022 across the 21 full-time education centre areas.  That is at primary level.</p><p> From the start of the development of the initiative in 2014 and aligned with it, we carried out evidence-based research.  Research was integral to the teacher-artist partnership initiative from its inception.  Formal research was carried out by Dr. Dorothy Morrissey and Dr. Ailbhe Kenny of the University of Limerick and was officially launched by Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, on 8 March 2017.  The learning presented in the research report was intended to inform the design of future partnership initiatives and to contribute to the development and sustainability of each partnership in schools.  The initiative is part of pillar 1, creative youth, under the Creative Ireland programme and that is very welcome.  It shows that the initiative which started as a small one in 2014 has grown and it was delivered nationwide in 2017, and will continue to be delivered over the next four years under Creative Ireland.</p><p> Arts in junior cycle is another initiative but, as the name suggests, it is for post-primary level.  This initiative consists of a series of CPD experiences for teachers to enhance engagement with the arts and learning in junior cycle.  The initiative embodies the principles and key skills which underpin the framework for junior cycle and the Arts in Education Charter.  It was first piloted in 2014 by junior cycle for teachers, in conjunction with the Arts Council.  This is an initiative that is now funded under Creative Ireland.  It is hoped that 5,040 teachers across all subject areas, not just the arts, will have participated in arts in junior cycle CPD by 2022 as part of Creative Ireland's creative youth programme.  This year, the arts in junior cycle initiative will roll out arts in English, Irish, art and music.  Over the period of the four years, every subject area will have an arts in junior cycle CPD dedicated to it.  It is about the integration of the arts across the entire curriculum at post-primary level.  Teachers usually teach two subjects in a school and they also teach junior and senior cycles so not alone are we having an impact at junior cycle but also at senior cycle as well.</p><p> Out of the portal came a plan to carry out a national digital mapping initiative.  One of the things that was highlighted was the lack of awareness of people in communities of the resources that are available to them.  Under the portal, the national digital mapping of arts in education provision and activity throughout the country commenced in 2017 under funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The technical enhancements to enable the mapping on the digital map of the Arts in Education portal have been completed.  Some population of the digital map was completed by the end of 2017.  The remaining data population of the digital map will be completed in 2018.  The map will be updated annually going forward so no matter what crossroads one lives near, one will be able to zone in to the particular area and see all arts in education provision, be it schools, local authorities, arts centres or any of the initiatives the other speakers have spoken about.  Information will be available on the types of initiatives in an area and how one can tie into them.</p><p> The other area of interest that was pushed, gently, by Professor Coolahan, was arts in education research.  One of the objectives of the Arts in Education Charter was promoting arts education and arts in education research, and the establishment and development of a national arts in education research repository.  I do not come originally from the arts and I have a science background, and if one wants information on scientific or engineering research in this country one can access a central resource that gives all the information available at the click of two buttons.  That is not there for the arts.  There is no central national digital access resource for research in arts and education or arts education.  That was one of the objectives and it has developed and is moving at a pace.  A research repository is essential to provide visibility for the discipline.  There is a lot of great arts education and arts in education research taking place throughout the country but it does not have the same visibility as other disciplines.  The intention is that the resource would provide for accessible and open access to data and for the preservation of research data in the field.  This resource in Ireland is also essential to comply with and meet the needs of funders in this research area - from both a national and international perspective.</p><p> If one wants to access Horizon 2020 funding one must guarantee that one has a research data management plan and that the publicly-funded research that is generated is available through open access.  One could not do that without a national resource such as the research repository.  We are at the stage now where we are working in partnership with the Digital Repository of Ireland, DRI, on behalf of the Arts in Education Charter and the Department of Education and Skills.  Representatives from every third level institution in Ireland involved in arts in education research came together as a committee in 2017 and we formed a steering committee to progress this initiative to completion.</p><p>Other organisations such as the Association of Teachers'/Education Centres in Ireland, Encountering the Arts Ireland, ETAI, and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, are also involved in this national initiative.  The rising tide should lift all boats and promote research.  It should not alone provide it as an open access for the country.  There are some fabulous people on the steering committee and it was opportune for the institutions involved.  It is developing well.</p><p> Music Generation is the national non-mainstream infrastructure for performance music education, initiated by Music Network, philanthropically seed funded, and currently co-funded by U2, The Ireland Funds, the Department of Education and Skills and local music education partnerships, MEPs.  Music Generation is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation DAC.  The Government committed to continue to support existing MEPs with Exchequer funding from 1 July 2014 under phase 1.  It was subsequently agreed that the roll-out of phase 2 of the programme would also be supported by the Department of Education and Skills following initial funding from philanthropic sources.  The Department has agreed to begin funding phase 2 of the programme from 2020 with funding increasing in 2021 as philanthropic funding ceases.  In December 2017, the Taoiseach announced the extension of Music Generation countrywide by 2022.  The first three MEPs were established in counties Mayo, Sligo and Louth in 2011.  Why should every other county not have them?</p><p> The Arts in Education Charter makes provision for a programme called Arts Rich Schools, ARIS, to incentivise both primary and post-primary schools to foster and develop the arts in wider elements of school life.  This concept has now become scoileanna ild&aacute;nacha/creative schools, a Creative Ireland creative youth pillar 1 funded initiative.  This will be led by the Arts Council, in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p><p> An objective of the Arts in Education Charter was the establishment of local arts education partnerships, LAEPs.  Cavan-Monaghan LAEP has been a successful pioneer in this area.  Other education and training boards, local authorities and other partners are planning initiatives along these lines.  The co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the education and training boards, in conjunction with the regional education centres and other agencies, have potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision to the great benefit of young people across the country.</p><p> Creative Ireland's creative youth plan has committed to the establishment of three local creative youth partnerships on a pilot basis in 2018.  These will draw on the experiences learned from the existing LAEP.</p><p> The charter envisages that schools will incorporate arts in education opportunities in their school policies and plans as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  The implementation group has got the agreement of the school inspectorate to assist schools in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  The group has also obtained the support of the authorities in the Department of Education and Skills that provision for arts in education practice will be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has established a reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the charter.</p><p> On 8 December 2016, the Creative Ireland programme was launched.  It is a high-level, high-ambition initiative from 2017 to 2022 which aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy.  It is designed to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation.  Pillar 1 aims at enabling the creative potential of every child and was launched on 7 December 2017.  The plan contains 17 actions, some of which I referred to earlier and have originated from the charter.</p><p> The Creative Ireland plan states explicitly the Arts in Education Charter will be embraced, fast-tracked and resourced.  The plan aims to work in parallel with and build on many of the existing initiatives and programmes which support creativity both inside and outside the formal education system.  This is welcome.</p><p> It is an exciting and challenging time to be involved in the promotion of arts in education.  What is afoot over the past several years is the forging of a new culture change, whereby a new era is opening up for integration of the arts as a core dimension of young Irish people's holistic education.  To sustain the momentum requires the collaborative, mutual respect and co-operation of all agencies involved.  The Arts in Education Charter implementation is a work in progress.  I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to outline the progress to date on the implementation of the objectives of the charter.</p></speech>

It began as an informal grouping in 2008 following the publication of the artists-schools guidelines in 2006 and the points of alignment in 2008.  The former initiative brought together individuals from both sectors to articulate their shared understanding and values around what characterises arts in education practice.  Points of alignment, which represented the findings of the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts and Education, was set up in 2007 by the then Ministers, John O'Donoghue and Mary Hanafin.  It called for greater joined-up thinking from all those involved in the arts and education sector.  Several individuals involved in these initiatives identified the need for greater collaboration and the bringing together of the existing wealth of knowledge, skills and expertise across the arts and education sectors.  This was for the purpose of providing young people with a rich engagement in the arts and culture, both in and out of school.  ETAI was born out of this need.</p> <p>  ETAI started out as an informal grouping in 2008 and developed into a company limited by guarantee in 2015.  ETAI was formally launched by both the then Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Jimmy Deenihan, and the then Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in 2013, following the publication of the Arts in Education Charter.  ETAI is made up of an alliance of organisations and individuals committed to arts and education, focusing on children and young people in Ireland.  As a company limited by guarantee, with an eight-member board of directors, this grassroots organisation has up to 40 organisations and 100 individuals as members representing the educational, arts, heritage and cultural sectors from across Ireland.</p> <p>  The current board is chaired by Jane O'Hanlon, head of education at Poetry Ireland.  As well as myself, Ms O'Donoghue and the observers, the remaining board member is Mary Manley, primary school principal and director of the Association of Creativity and Arts in Education.</p><p>Advisers to the board include Mr. Aidan Clifford, former director of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board curriculum development unit, and Ms Mary Shine Thompson, Dublin City University trustee.</p><p> The purpose of the alliance is to broaden and deepen the access, creation, participation and engagement of children and young people in the arts and culture by using its combined strength, resources and expertise.  Encountering the Arts Ireland is committed to fostering the greater strategic alignment of the arts, culture and education policies in Ireland, identifying new synergies for the sustained engagement of all children and young people in the arts and culture.  The alliance provides platforms and opportunities for the voice of the child and young person to be heard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen O'Donoghue" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018021400002#H00200"><p>ETAI acknowledges the invaluable work done in the field of arts and cultural education for children and young people in and out of school in Ireland.  This work has been initiated and supported during the years by many organisations, including the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions, the Department of Education and Skills and the local authorities, through arts officers and librarians often working in collaboration with other agencies and individual practitioners.  ETAI acknowledges the long-standing programmes in operation nationwide, many of which have been mentioned, including the artist in residence scheme, the Association for Creativity and Arts in Education creative schools award, music generation, National Association of Principal and Deputy Principals creative engagement and other programmes that support children and young people in an out-of-school context.  ETAI welcomes key policy developments and associated programmes, including the Arts in Education Charter; the document for cultural institutions, A Fresh View for the 21st Century: Education, Community, Outreach Policy Framework 2014; the Arts Council's Making Great Art Work; and Creative Ireland and the forthcoming Culture 2025 policy.  Cumulatively, they provide the sector with a policy framework to enable greater coherence and alignment between education and the arts and culture sectors.</p> <p>  Since the early days of ETAI, the alliance has successfully mobilised action across the field of arts and cultural education from individual practitioners to arts organisations and education centres, regional arts officers, national cultural institutions and third level colleges, among others.  Our impetus for action was the successful collaborative process that produced the Arts Council Artists-Schools Guidelines.  Another influential factor was the disappointing response to the points of alignment framework and the shared belief the recommendations in these policy initiatives should take root in practice.  ETAI informed the debate through three symposia held during 2009 and 2010.  Members of the alliance were contributors and lead programmers, including at the final international conference entitled, Encountering the Arts Ireland.</p> <p>  We remain involved in advocacy that draws on the combined expertise of our membership.  ETAI has been well placed to act as a network organisation in support of and as an adviser on some of the key initiatives, including the Arts in Education Charter mentioned by Dr. Sweeney, Creative Ireland and Culture 2025.  We often produce submissions and position papers on behalf of our members.</p> <p>  ETAI members are part of the design team of the teacher artist partnership continuous professional development programme referenced my colleague, Dr. Sweeney.  We are part of the design team alongside the Department of Education and Skills, the Association of Teachers Education Centres in Ireland and the Association for Creativity and Arts in Education.</p> <p>  ETAI is a member of the Arts in Education portal oversight group and more recently has become a member of the national repository for arts education research working group.  We have been actively supportive of the design and contributed to the delivery of the national arts education day in the past three years.  The role of the alliance in these initiatives includes advisory and programming work.  In addition, ETAI has attended a number of consultative meetings with the Arts Council on the ARIS arts rich schools initiative, currently known as Creative Schools.  We have met the Creative Ireland team in the context of the development of the overall programme.</p> <p>  ETAI has prepared a detailed research proposal that focuses on formal, informal and non-formal learning arts and cultural learning in schools and youth work settings.  This research aims to identify approaches to assessing sustainable quality arts and cultural engagement by children and young people.  It builds on existing research in this field, including the informative works recently produced in the Arts Council in association with the ERSI study by Dr. Emer Smyth on arts and cultural participation among children and young people.  It was drawn from insights from the Growing Up in Ireland study and, as outlined by Dr. Sweeney, on exploring the teacher artist partnership as a model of continuous professional development for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education in Ireland: A Research Project, undertaken by Dr. Ailbhe Kenny and Dr. Dorothy Morrissey.</p> <p>  We have several recommendations for the committee on the Arts in Education Charter.  We are keen to see the post of chair of the Arts in Education Charter higher implementation group filled.  We support the review and revision of the Arts in Education Charter in an ongoing way in the light of current developments.  We support the development of the charter, working in tandem with developments in Creative Ireland.  We support research to identify approaches to assessing sustainable quality arts and cultural engagement by children and young people in and out of school.  We support continuous professional development at all levels of leadership and delivery to enhance the progress of a coherent infrastructure that will mutually support and aligns energies and resources.  In turn, this will ensure effective and efficient quality arts and cultural engagement by all children and young people in formal and non-formal settings.</p></speech>

We are keen to ensure a specific reference to engagement with young people and children and education as part of the remit of local authority arts officers from the perspective of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We recommend the establishment of national fora that would include the voices of children and young people.  Such fora should initiate debate and discussion on the importance of creativity in citizens' lives.  We believe the value of the arts in society needs to be championed and that arts education and culture offer possibilities for creative expression.  These are fundamental to human rights.  Opportunities for all children and young people to find their voices are essential.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Se&oacute;na N&iacute; Bhriain, head of young people and children in education.  I am also joined by Mr. Ross Curran and Ms Laura Keogh who have been kindly seconded to the Arts Council by the Department of Education and Skills.  They are working with us on our Creative Schools programme, placing educational expertise at the heart of the work of the Arts Council in this important area.</p> <p>  The Arts Council welcomes the joint committee's consideration of this issue.  We take the opportunity to expand on our presentation committee members have received.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee the insights and perspectives of members on arts and education.</p> <p>  The Arts Council is Ireland's development agency for the arts.  The arts are for us and citizens throughout the country a central feature of our shared civic life.  They require and merit continuous support nationally, internationally and locally.  The support of the State, to the tune of &euro;68 million in 2018, enables the Arts Council to provide funding for a range of artists and arts organisations throughout the country.  Our support encompasses individual artists, musicians, writers, dancers and arts organisations, including Druid, the Cork Midsummer Festival and the Irish Writers Centre.  It provides opportunities for people to encounter and engage with the arts.  This could be in a building such as the Ark children's cultural centre or one of the 155 small festivals we will fund in 2018.  They range from the Skibbereen Arts Festival to Rosses Point Shanty Festival.  As has been mentioned, we also support local government.  We work with young people and children.  That is a key focus of our partnership with local government.</p><p>We have recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the County and City Management Association and we will proceed to do so now with every local authority throughout the country.  That local support and infrastructure of expertise is a key connection point to support and build expertise in arts and education but also in many other areas of practice.</p><p> Our work includes research, policy development and the measurement of impacts, as has been mentioned and about which Ms N&iacute; Bhriain will speak further.  Research is a critical part of informing our work into the future and measuring our work in the past.  We are a learning organisation with specialist arts expertise.  We welcome moments such as this where public conversation allows us to bring forward a critical policy area.</p><p> Ireland is a country in which creativity abounds and we welcome working across Government as a partner in the Creative Ireland Programme.  We must continue to expand and enrich our support for artists and arts organisations, those who make art.  It is upon their work that we rightly base our confidence that our children and young people are growing up in a country which has culture and the arts at its heart.  Ms N&iacute; Bhriain will now talk in more detail about her work in the area of arts and education.  However, it is critical we see this work as part of a larger project and as ongoing work to ensure we as a country support and develop the arts.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid l&aacute;ns&aacute;sta a bheith in ann &eacute;isteacht le gach duine agus a bheith mar chuid den chomhr&aacute; seo.</p> <p>  I am head of young people, children and education at the Arts Council.  The committee has received our submission.  It gives an overview of the Arts Council's policy and initiatives in this area.  The Arts Council has a long history of working to develop, support, and promote the arts and education and to advocate for arts education.  A number of my colleagues have mentioned initiatives in which the Arts Council has played a central role.  However, we always work in partnership with others such as the Points of Alignment report of the Special Committee on the Arts and Education, and the Place of the Arts in Irish Education or Benson report, going back even further, as well as various initiatives through the years.</p> <p>  The committee may have questions around our submission and current policy initiatives and developments.  We would be happy to discuss those but I thought we might take this opportunity to say why we do what we do and why we are.  The Arts Council is the agency for developing the arts in Ireland.  We wish to build a central place for the arts in Irish life.  We believe the arts are fundamental to human experience and expression.  The arts, whether music, dance, stories or visual arts or, as the Arts Act 2003 puts it, "any creative or interpretative expression...[in] any medium" are part of what make us human and what make us alive.  They are our voice in the world and give us insights into other people's voices, perspectives and experiences.  It is through the arts that we reflect on where and who we are and are also inspired to imagine new possibilities.</p> <p>  We are cheered up by the arts and sometimes challenged.  Sometimes they bring us into dark and depressing places.  Overall, however, they make us feel better and they make us feel more present and alive.  That is why we are here.  My role in particular focuses on young people's experience of and engagement with the arts.  In all of our policy initiatives in this area, whether in school or out of school, we are interested in the child or young person's experience and their engagement with the arts.  We are interested in their experience and their engagement if they are learners, an audience member with their family, an audience member with their school or a young person developing their own interests as a teenager.</p> <p>  We have a working definition of artistic quality that we use in the Arts Council.  As part of developing the arts we also fund the arts and we have to make assessments of different proposals, ideas and suggestions that come in.  The definition that we use is that we look for work, engagements or experiences that are ambitious, original, technically competent and connect with people in a lasting way.  That last item, the personal response, is critical.  It is not that high-quality arts are here and then there, but that we have the people who are engaging with it.  For a high-quality arts experience to take place, the people who are experiencing it make it high quality.</p> <p>  With respect to children and young people, that is why we focus on whether it is transforming their experience.  Are they being inspired by this?  Are they being transported?  How are they engaging with it?  That makes the arts better because we believe the more diverse voices that shape the arts and the more children and young people contribute to making meaning through the arts, the more the arts become exciting, interesting and reflective of who we are.</p> <p>  That is why we are here.  There are clear points of alignment with the high-level goals of other public bodies and why they do what they do.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is not here today.  However, it is interesting because it is very involved in what will develop as part of the Creative Ireland initiatives.  However, we work in partnership with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in a number of areas such as early childhood settings, early childhood arts, where it plays a key role, and also in youth strategy and young people's experience out of school.</p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is interested in young people's voices and their participation.  I refer to young people's right to participate fully in society and their right to communicate in the medium of their choice to reach their full potential.  The Department wants children and young people to be active and healthy.  It cares for their well-being and that is where it put the arts in its policy framework.  There is nothing that contradicts anything where we are coming from and why we want children and young people to engage with the arts.  There is clear alignment.  We are coming at planning and provision from different angles and different roles, but essentially we share many of the same goals.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills is here today, as is the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  They have a job to ensure children have an education that enables them to reach their full potential and develop the skills and competencies to help them to flourish in order that they will learn and develop as they grow.  Increasingly, as we have heard from our colleagues in the NCCA, the education system has begun to focus on competencies such as being creative.  There is a focus on play, enquiry, exploration and imagination as well as collaboration, resilience and communication.  They are all things at the heart of a quality arts experience.</p> <p>  There is also recognition within the education system that young people do better overall when they are happy in school.  The research that has been mentioned, the Arts and Cultural Participation among Children and Young People - Insights from the Growing up in Ireland Study, was commissioned by the Arts Council from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  It explains the connections between when young people participate in the arts and other related child outcomes such as their socio-emotional well-being, their academic achievement and their attitudes toward school.   There are clearly many reasons for all of us to come together around the table.</p> <p>  Even if we are all coming from these different angles, we are all talking about children reaching their potential and developing the skills and experiences that will serve them now and in life.  With the Department of Education and Skills in mind, it may be interested in those creative skills for young people not just to become artists or work in the creative industries but to be engineers or to work in whatever field.  Those are skills developed through engaging in the stuff we are about.</p> <p>  What is most rewarding but also challenging about working in this area is that it is necessary to work in partnership.  All of a person's creative skills have to be used because children and young people do not reside in any one sector.  They do not belong to any one place in public policy.  They are impacted by all the different decisions we make.  We owe it to them to work together and in partnership to achieve the best outcomes for them.  I think there is a real possibility for us to do that.  Greater collaboration has developed over recent years.  It will take all of us to make the experience for them really high quality.</p></speech>

I will get straight down to questions.</p> <p>  This question is for Dr. Sweeney.  The commitments in the Arts in Education Charter state that the implementation group would meet regularly and report to Ministers twice yearly.</p><p>Does the implementation group report to the Department twice yearly?  How often does it meet?</p></speech>

He has not been replaced.  Since that time, we have not met as a group with the Ministers.  We have met under the auspices of Creative Ireland and at the various launches.  Some of the initiatives have become embodied in the Creative Youth plan.  Therefore, there are various interactions with both Ministers.  A dedicated report from the charter implementation group has not been produced since Professor Coolahan stepped down.</p></speech>

Dr. Sweeney touched on some of them.  A number of them have yet to be honoured in a meaningful way.  Included are commitments on guaranteed student visits to cultural institutions, reduced ticket prices, artists' residencies, and arts policies for all second level schools.  Is there a reason we had to wait four years for the Creative Ireland initiative and for the charter to be embraced, fast-tracked and resourced?  Can an update be provided on some of the initiatives?</p></speech>

Much of the initial period was devoted to building relationships, collaboration and planning to deliver on a number of the initiatives.  The funding that was available initially was limited.  We were successful in receiving dormant account funding for some of the initiatives.  It would have been welcome had huge amounts of funding being available over the past four years but we are where we are.  The funding we have received and the embracing of the initiatives that now feature as part of Creative Children are welcome.</p></speech>

Locally, the music education partnerships raise 50%.  For the first three years of the initiative, in phases 1 and 2, that is, until the musical education partnership becomes established, the philanthropy funding and The Ireland Funds match the other 50%.  After three years, the philanthropy funding will cease and the Department of Education and Skills will fund the other 50%.  To date, that has been the model for phase 1.  We are moving into phase 2.  Phase 3, because it involves an announcement under pillar 1 of Creative Ireland's Creative Youth plan, will not have the philanthropy element in the first three years.  It will involve local music education partnerships, the Department of Education and Skills and Creative Ireland.  Creative Ireland and local music education partnerships will match 50% of the funding from day one.</p> <p>  There are three phases.  Phase 1 involves the ceasing of philanthropy.  With regard to phase 2, as philanthropy phases out, the Department of Education and Skills phases in as 50% with the music education partnership.  Under the final phase, involving the nationwide rolling out under Creative Ireland, there will not be a philanthropy element.  It will involve the Government and the local element coming together from day one.</p></speech>

Others have been calling for the narrative around science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, to embrace the arts and for the acronym to become STEAM.  Does Dr. Sweeney have an opinion on that narrative of the Government based on her background in science?  Does she have a view on the positive outcomes that could emerge from the inclusion of arts in the Government narrative?</p></speech>

Everyone has inbuilt creativity and it needs to be nurtured and developed.  To be a scientist, one has to be creative and resilient, and findings have to be proven.  In a science background, it is said one must fail and fail better in the pursuit of knowledge in a specific area.  The resilience that comes from being involved in creativity as part of a community of practitioners in the arts and education, in addition to creativity in its broadest form, involving digital and coding aspects, augurs well for the future of any of the disciplines.  Ms Comer and Ms N&iacute; Bhriain said the arts is not just about producing artists in the future but also about developing young people and children in an holistic manner so creativity can lead them into any discipline or field.  I believe, however, scientists are creative also.</p></speech>

Perhaps I know the work of some of the delegates better than that of others.  I have a couple of questions.  My first is an observation on which one of the delegates might comment.  It is heartening that there are so many organisations that are so passionate about arts education.  I did not hear the Art Teachers' Association of Ireland mentioned by anybody.  Do any of the organisations represented today have someone from that association sitting on its committee or working with it directly?</p> <p>  With regard to Dr. Sweeney's comments on Music Generation, the nationwide roll-out involves quite an ambitious plan.  Is the programme to be rolled out nationally by 2022, which is in four years?  By then, it is to have no philanthropic support at all, just Government support.  How many more partnerships have to be established if we are to reach the target?</p></speech>

There were nine in the second phase, and these are still developing.  They were approved only last year.

Mr. Carney gave a passionate presentation to the Art Teachers' Association of Ireland this year on the topic of turning STEM into STEAM.  Perhaps he will talk a little about bringing the arts into that group.  He said one of his goals is to assist and support the development of a national strategy for arts in post-primary education.  What is the position with a national strategy?  Do we have one yet?</p> <p>  Ms Comer and Ms O'Donoghue gave an interesting presentation.  I attended a few of their meetings as well.  Will they comment further on their disappointment with the response to the Points of Alignment framework?  I thank them for being specific about the steps this Parliament can take to help the cause they are working on as well.</p> <p>  With regard to the NCCA, I am aware that wonderful work is taking place on the development of a new art course for the leaving certificate.  Having been a student of the subject for the leaving certificate and then having taught it for the leaving certificate and seeing it never change, that is wonderful news.  It will also be welcome news for the teachers who correct the subject for the State examinations every summer.  Will Mr. Hammond comment on that?</p> <p>  I am also aware of the wonderful work of Se&oacute;na N&iacute; Bhriain at the Arts Council, along with the work of Ms O'Donoghue and Ms Comer, but will the witnesses tell us how we can do arts in education better?  All the witnesses have made wonderful cases for what they are doing, but what can the Parliament do to make arts in education better and more streamlined in our schools and outside the formal sector?</p></speech>

There is much work to be done this year and next year, but it is a framework and we are hoping to work with all the groups here today to progress it.  Dr. Sweeney in the Department of Education and Skills is a key partner.  That is the space in which we can progress.  There are many new initiatives along with the initiatives already in place under the Arts in Education Charter.  We will be taking up some of the ones mentioned by Senator Warfield earlier and fast-tracking them.  It provides the collaborative space.  Many people have mentioned collaboration and shown that it is difficult.  We are hoping that space will be where we work together on these things.</p></speech>

We have a gap at present and we will have one fairly soon again.  As an ex-member, I am always in close touch with the association.</p> <p>  With regard to STEAM and STEM, I believe everybody in the room is on the same page on that.  The House of Representatives in the US produced a policy in 2013 which stated that the arts had to be brought into STEM for the purpose of innovation in schools.  M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn said something similar to the European Parliament in 2012 or 2013.  We can see on the ground that it is a must.  There is a huge amount of work being done in this area and much is still to be done on the transfer from the arts to other areas within the school.  To make a personal comment, people talk repeatedly about creativity.  I was an art teacher for many years and it was not just about creativity.  I wanted students to leave with a knowledge and love of the arts and to ensure they had visual literacy.  They were not all creative, and to pick every policy by taking it out of creativity does not always work.  However, that is not to take it from the science area.  In the schools in which I was a principal, there was fantastic creativity in the woodwork department and all across the school.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the national strategy.  People should be talking to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, of approximately 730 schools, as part of the process for anything that is done in that area.  Whatever way that goes, they should talk to the leaders of the schools.  As I have said previously, the arts are part of the curriculum in primary schools.  In second level schools, when one sits down to timetable - I have done it and so has Ms O'Brien - the arts are not everywhere and not everybody is going to be involved.  One must get the leaders of the second level schools to work with one.  Talk to them.</p></speech>

One of the requirements of the NCCA is to include various stakeholders on all our committees.  Those stakeholders usually include teachers, management bodies, business and social interests, representatives of the Department and representatives of the State Examinations Commission.  They also usually include representatives of subject associations.  For example, the group that developed the junior cycle visual art course would have included a representative of the Art Teachers' Association of Ireland and the current work that is taking place on leaving certificate art would also include a representative of that association.  The association's voice is fully heard and represented in those structures.  Indeed, subject associations are within all the structures in the NCCA.</p> <p>  On the leaving certificate art curriculum, it is eagerly awaited among art teachers.  A draft of the curriculum is due to go to our council at its March meeting.  Once it is approved by the council, it goes for public consultation, so the Art Teachers' Association of Ireland and others will get an opportunity to comment on it and suggest adjustments to it.  The specification will be completed by September and it will then issue to the Department.  The Department ultimately decides on an implementation date for the specification within schools.  An interesting feature of the work that has been done on the new leaving certificate art specification is we have worked on aligning it with a new common European framework of reference for the visual arts.  That has proved a useful tool in terms of aligning the arts education and experience the new leaving certificate course will provide with an objective standard that is in the process of discussion and agreement across Europe.  It is an interesting development.</p></speech>

The National College of Art and Design, NCAD, which I know is not the only teacher formation for teacher provision in the country, is also a member.  As mentioned, the relationship with the NCCA and the NAPD is interwoven in terms of our work.  We would have been very supportive of the state-of-the-arts campaign, which they mounted very successfully and imaginatively to draw attention to the 50 year old curriculum, the revision of which we are looking forward to seeing.

It was the two Ministers at that time who wanted to set up the joint committee.  The committee produced some really interesting recommendations, taking into account the good practice within the fields of arts and education.  It also undertook a look-back of the 1979 Benson report and called for a joined-up thinking approach at Government level.  There was disappointment that the recommendations within Points of Alignment were not realised.  Out of that process grew ETAI.  We were a grassroots organisation that wanted to make sure that we would continue to advocate for the recommendations within Points of Alignment and also for a greater alignment of policies, which was the purpose of Points of Alignment as well.  We want to see alignment of policies across arts and education in particular.</p> <p>  The crash and the recession occurred at that time in 2008 and so there were not resources available to fund the recommendations within Points of Alignment.  At that time, creative engagement and other initiatives continued.  They created the fertile ground for initiatives like Creative Ireland.  There was a lot of really good work still happening on the ground.  The Arts and Education Charter launched in 2013 took account of all of that work.  Also, for the first time we had two Ministers from education and the arts coming together to develop policy.</p></speech>

Last week, all female politicians were invited to visit an artist who is doing a large and wonderful portrait in recognition of the 100 years of women getting the vote.  Like other Members, I went to meet the artist.  I was very taken aback by the fact that, as he did in regard to the portrait for the Northern Ireland Assembly, he is doing this portrait in visual art form.  The manner in which he is going about doing this portrait is extraordinary.  While I was talking to him he asked me why politics does not do more of this work.  I had no answer for him.  Politics tends to see itself outside of something as nebulous as the arts even though it so real in all of our lives, from a two year old to a 92 year old.  As I said, the presentations today were manna from Heaven.  I enjoyed listening to them and learning about the work the organisations are doing.</p> <p>  My background is in the arts.  When I was an M.Ed student I wrote a thesis entitled "Drama and the Education of Feeling", in respect of which I recall a tutor asking me, "what is that about?".  The arts are about feeling and who we are.  I recall trying to battle my way through that tower at the time and I might have been on the right path.  I am great believer in the arts for themselves rather than as an alignment to something else.  The arts are themselves a majesty.  Dance, drama, music, mime, ballet, movement and literature do not need to be aligned to anything.  The arts stands on its own, like physics or chemistry.  I come at this from that power.         </p> <p>  Has the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, pushed for 25 extra points for music or art on the leaving certificate curriculum?  We were happy to do that for mathematics, thus rolling over for the banks, as all the universities did.  Why can young people not get 25 additional parts for visual art or music, which are leaving certificate subjects?  Perhaps in years to come dance and other arts will be leaving certificate subjects.  If we did this, it would position arts as a serious subject rather than an activity one engages in because one is good at it and so on.  I would welcome a comment from all of the witnesses on that proposal, which is very practical, although very political.  Will they also comment on teacher training and the quality of teacher training in arts at primary and secondary level?  There is a presumption that the arts is half entertainment.  It is almost as though arts capitulates to the profit margin or the tourist margin and it does not stand on its own.  The view is that arts is very good tourism and that it is great to have the arts in towns as they encourage tourists in and so on.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on whether we are coming at the arts from the wrong angle and on where they stand in regard to the level and quality of teacher training, the teacher training colleges and courses.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe we are only changing the language for something that already exists?  In other words are we putting "ings" onto create, explore, participate, appraise and respond, such that it looks like we are doing something new but in fact we are already doing it?  On the quality of the arts, who is to train the teachers in that regard?  The artists cannot be asked to do it because they have enough to do.  Do all of the organisations really work together?  I have heard that there is collaboration and that all the organisations are coming at something from the same angle but does that actually happen?  Do the organisations speak to each other?  I note that Ms Comer said that the ETBs had held conferences on the arts.  Are the organisations saying the same things with different titles?  Are they all doing the same thing but differently?  </p> <p>  What do the witnesses think the committee can do to help?  I would like each of the witnesses to give me something real and practical in that regard.  I suppose the main wish would be more funding.  From where does the NAPD get its funding?  Has the Arts Council ever contacted NAPD to congratulate it on the work it is doing and to offer it funding?  Can it apply to Creative Ireland for funding?   I was very interested in what was said about the portal.  It seems to be a Willy Wonka factory, such that everything one ever wanted to know is on the portal.  I am confused as to what it was.  I should perhaps have looked into it more, and I will do but perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that.</p> <p>  What is Dr. Sweeney's understanding of research in the arts?  I am pleased all of the witnesses are here today.  So much of politics is about what is going wrong.  I agree with the witnesses that in terms of the arts this is a really exciting time.  Ms Comer made the brilliant point that the arts, culture and heritage are connected to local authority arts office librarians and others.  So much of our world in terms of where we ask children to live and to play is ugly.  I know this because I did a report on growing old in Ireland in which I referenced how elderly people watched while pipes were erected on walls outside their windows yet did not even have access to a tree.  There is a huge area of visualisation of environment within arts structures.  I could go on for hours.  I am so pleased to open up dialogue on how in any way we can help.</p><p>The witnesses must tell us what we can do to move it on and to keep it alive in the Seanad and on the D&aacute;il floor for them.  That is why they are here and why people come in here.  I am very interested in it and I know the Deputies, one of whom had to leave, are extremely interested in what the witnesses are doing and in moving it on.  It is the first time that we have a real collaboration between education and arts.  They can see each other as pivotal and on the same merry-go-round.  Will the witnesses speak to that?</p></speech>

I would add that there will be many people in teacher training, particularly at primary school level, who will attend third level college without having had an experience of arts education because of the value system that unfortunately permeates society.  It is not in our schools but in society.  We have a recommendation about public conversations.  The Senator mentioned issues around older people such as the understanding campaign around dementia.  As a society, we need to understand how vital the arts are and they should not be assessed purely as part of a points system so that people can trust them.  Parents would be able trust that their children will have a fully engaged and participative role in society if and when they engage in the arts.  It is particularly critical with the primary school sector.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if we really worked together.  We do really work together and there is good evidence of it.  As I said, primary school teachers can enter the classroom without having had a formative experience of the arts at second level.  However, when we work in collaboration as was described here, we can provide support for those teachers through continuing professional development and alignments of the arts and educational organisations.</p> <p>  The portal is about accessing information.  The Arts in Education portal under the Arts in Education charter is a go-to space where people can have conversations about what is happening.  People need to feel endorsed in what they believe in and the practice that they are practising.  They also need to know where to go if they want to find peers and engage in continuing professional development.</p></speech>

Resourcing all of these initiatives and ensuring that there are proper structures in place to implement them is really important.  Ms Comer mentioned the Points of Alignment report and the disappointment in the years that followed.  Two key issues hampered the report's implementation.  Resourcing was one of them.  Structures, that is, mechanisms in which to collaborate, was the other.  We do work together but it is difficult because we are all in different places with different agendas.  The Arts Council policy mentions implementation of the Arts in Education charter within it.  That allows us to engage collaboratively with other agencies and departments, but it is difficult to do.</p> <p>  I would love to see by the end of 2022, when Creative Ireland has gone through its period, that we have developed structures that work and are sustainable.  One of the recommendations, which I mentioned in our overview paper that we circulated to the committee in advance, was that there would be a development unit for the arts in education.  That was one of the recommendations of Points of Alignment.  Most of the other recommendations would have been housed within that one.  For example, the development of a portal site was first mentioned in Points of Alignment.  At the moment Creative Ireland has begun that space, which is why it is a really positive place to be in now, and we are beginning to have proper discussion and collaboration at quite a high level.</p> <p>  There has always been collaboration and work on the ground.  When we look back to the Points of Alignment report and earlier, there has always been a recognition of how amazing stuff happens anyway despite a lack of proper planning or provision.  We somehow manage to get it all together but we would be doing ourselves a disservice not to say that it is not really sustainable in this way and that we need to have proper resourcing and structures to work together.  It takes time to make these things actually align.  Part of it is the structures and part of it is all of us being willing to engage and respect where everyone is coming from and the fact that we do have some common goals. </p></speech>

We strive continually not only to resource and support the arts in education but all of the arts.  Our artists should have meaningful and working lives.  The infrastructure which we support is critical.  It is the infrastructure which these children and young people are growing up to engage with.  Alternatively, they may be artists themselves.  The committee's overall support to the arts, the Arts Council or many of the other agencies which resource and support the arts is critical.  It is also critical to our civic life.</p></speech>

First, do we work together?  Any of the initiatives under the charter would not have been at the level of implementation and development without the involvement of Association of Teachers/Education Centres in Ireland, Encountering The Arts Ireland, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the Arts Council.</p><p>They could not have happened without it.  Many of the committees that deliver these initiatives are voluntary, on which excellent people from various organisations come together because of their commitment to the development of the arts and also the integration of the arts and education.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the portal's Willy Wonka event.  It is a great event.  Without it, there would not have been 125,000 visitors to many sites since 2015, as well as 36,500 users.  It represents the building of a community in practice.</p></speech>

There are a number of elements to the Arts in Education Portal, including the digital map and the research repository.  The big things are projects and partnerships.  People submit items.  The teachers, artists and students who are engaged in them work together.  They might need coaching, mentoring or perhaps a bursary award to be able to develop their documentation, the photography or a video of what they are doing and the portal provides them.  The projects and partnerships always have an artist, a teacher and students involved.  They are the general criteria.  There are videos on projects and partnerships that are exemplars of best practice of the the highest quality.  One can watch, listen and read about them.  There are also guest bloggers.</p></speech>

The arts are encompassed by the humanities and social studies.  Research in the arts can be associated with initial teacher education or someone can work purely on the arts for the arts' sake.  It is broad and diverse, but there is no central location for anything to do with research in the arts and education for it to be visible and for anyone looking at it from a funding perspective to see that there is open access.  This is related to the repository.  The Digital Repository of Ireland was established to promote the humanities and the social sciences.</p></speech>

We all need to consult each other because we get lost in many ways.  We also need to inform each other of what is happening.  Again, we often seem to get lost in that respect.  </p> <p>  I liked what Ms Comer said about the aesthetics of housing.  I argue the same about schools and the enormous contribution the arts could make in improving school buildings, the way they look and the atmosphere and ethos within schools.  Many of the projects in which people get involved in Creative Engagement are to improve the school atmosphere.  I could give many wonderful examples of projects, but we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  It has been accepted for a long time that the arts are important in schools.  I would be worried, therefore, if we were to try o reinvent the wheel yet again.  As a lot is happening, we need to inform ourselves and tie it all up.  In Creative Engagement we would like more funding to extend our project.  The committee is quite willing to voluntarily go into schools, with which we have good relationships because we are all principals and deputy principals.  We could definitely extend the project.  We are very happy to work with Creative Ireland to that end.</p></speech>

Building on the points mentioned, the arts are one of the seven areas that comprise the primary school curriculum.  As such, they are a key part of initial teacher education.  Notwithstanding the points made by Ms O'Donoghue about the fact that some come to teaching without formative artistic experiences, it is important to remember that initial teacher education is just the initial phase of a teacher's development of skill and professional knowledge.  We have heard reference to the many opportunities to promote continuous professional development for teachers to build that experience and expertise.</p> <p>  There is another factor in considering the place of the arts in children's experiences in a primary school context on which we probably have not touched.  It relates to the time given to the arts in the curriculum.  In our opening statement Mr. Hammond referred to the ongoing review of the primary school curriculum.  As part of review, we held a consultation process last year on the structure of the primary school curriculum and the time allocations within it.  That generated an interesting discussion.  As we all know, when one talks about the time given to a particular subject or area, it is about the values that underpin the curriculum.  Many points were made in the consultation process about the allocation of time, specifically for those subjects or areas of the curriculum which received less time than others.  There was a real feeling that in the redevelopment of the primary school curriculum it was important to hold onto the principle of providing a broad and balanced experience for children and that areas such as the arts were essential.</p> <p>  There is another piece of the redevelopment work which is particularly interesting in the context of this discussion.  It relates to how we conceptualise an aspect of children's learning such as the arts.  A proposal we put out last year for consultation on the primary school curriculum was designed to encourage people to think about the curriculum in a much more integrated way.  We asked if we should continue with 11 subjects.  A key finding of our consultation process was that there had been a broad welcome for the suggestion that we should think in a more integrated away about the totality of children's experiences in primary school.  That connects with many of the points made.  Every experience has or could have an artistic dimension.  Some really interesting discussions will happen in the next year or two which will connect with many of the points made today about the critical centrality and importance of the arts experience for children throughout their primary school years.</p></speech>

In real terms, something of we have to be cognisant when looking at the question of allocating points for particular subject is how we distinguish between the worth of one subject and another.  The difficulty in embarking on the path towards awarding additional points for specific subjects is that one will end up with a competition between subjects, as to which of them should and should not attract additional points.  One will also runs into the difficulties that were recently encountered in the case of mathematics with unintended consequences in the allocation of points for a specific subject.  In general, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has been cautious when looking at the question of awarding additional points for specific subjects.  We tend to be more inclined towards and supportive of the allocation of additional points for congruent or related courses available at third level.  There is certainly a case for looking at the allocation of additional points for the arts and other subjects.  Generally, the points system has to operate on an equitable basis across subjects as much as possible.</p></speech>

I have not heard its voice on this.  My preference would obviously be for the arts.  I have not heard the NCCA argue against that point.  Equilibrium is all very well, but in this instance it is not all very well because what has gone on is appalling.  Where is the voice and influence of the NCCA in regard to that?</p></speech>

Rather, it involves words like "probably", "maybe" and "someday".  I am surprised that the voice of the NCCA was not louder on this.  Maybe it should be and maybe it should take up that cudgel.  I am not suggesting that the points go to subjects such as music, but I am surprised that if there is a belief around the equilibrium of subjects and around the conceptualisation that the voice of the NCCA is not better heard.  The NCCA made very good points on the decrease in the number of subjects areas and disciplines within the primary school curriculum.  People are walking away having made a decision on the kind of mind which is needed within a university.  If one fails honours maths one automatically passes and if one gets 29% in a pass paper one automatically passes.  It is outrageous.  I am not angry, but my pitch concerns the fact that I would like to hear the voices of NCCA.</p></speech>

I am sure when it comes up for review we will also make our position clear.  The other area raised was assessment at leaving certificate level, in particular in art.  I do not think the issue is what is assessed or how it is assessed because there is a very good fit between the nature of the assessment components used in art and music and the nature of the course.  There is a large emphasis on practicals, for example, in both subjects.</p> <p>  The point was probably being made on the introduction of changes to the grading system at leaving certificate level last year.  The only important context to provide in regard to that is that it was intended to address some of the difficulties which have frequently been voiced in terms of the experience of the leaving certificate within schools.  I am speaking in regard to predictability, teaching to the test, rote learning and the backwash effect which a highly calibrated 14-point grading system would have on teaching and learning within classrooms.  The idea of reducing the number of grades and grading points was to try to address some of those issues.  The system is in the first year of its introduction.  The NCCA has commissioned research on the impact of the changes which have been made to the grading system and we will have more insight on that in September when the next round of examination results come through.</p></speech>

I say that as a somebody who has corrected exam papers.  The history of art is a subject which I feel is outdated.  If a student does not score close to an A grade in that paper, he or she will not get an A grade in the practical exam or the overall subject.  That is where we are falling down.  I do not think the components are working in terms of assessment.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations and the discussion.  We have learned a lot.  I was in Roscommon County Council on Friday for the presentation of a wonderful sculpture from pupils from a national school in Roscommon.  It was fantastic to see the parents, brothers and sisters of the children involved.  They all appreciate the importance of the arts.  It brought much of the work of the NCCA to life.  The term "collaboration" has been used a lot today, but the project was the result of collaboration between Roscommon County Council, Creative Ireland and the teachers and pupils of the school.  If we see a lot more of that, we will be doing very well.</p> <p>  I have learned a lot about the primary and post-primary curriculum from the questions which have been asked.  I would like to know more about arts in education with regard to lifelong learning.  The witnesses spoke about CPD with regard to art teachers and the portals.  I have a certain level of experience.  We had a pilot Erasmus programme which involved a number of artists in the widest sense of the word, including digital photographers, film-makers, dramatists and so on.  I would like to know about the role of the NCCA with regard to the arts in education and lifelong learning beyond primary, post-primary and third level.  What is happening?  Does Creative Ireland fit into that?</p> <p>  I will not go into the specifics of the pilot project, but a lot of learning could be done.  The sort of project to which I refer has a lot of potential.  If I am honest, I do not feel it worked fully.  What is being done on a continuous basis, outside of art teachers, in terms of society and people who have an interest in or want to continue their professional development without being restricted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.910" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katie Sweeney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018021400002#P00800"><p>I might start and then hand over to Creative Ireland.  It is important to put the charter and pillar 1 of Creative Ireland in context.  The charter was designed to deal with everyone up to the age of 18 years.  Creative Ireland deals with creative youth, which covers those aged 0 to 22 or 23 years.  From the perspective of those aged from 0 to 18 years, that involves early years and primary and post-primary level.  If one was to talk about the next element, which involves third level or further education, that comes within the remit of the universities and would be under the auspices of SOLAS, for life-long learning outside of formal education, and the Arts Council, from the perspective of the arts.  That is not to say that all of that is not happening.</p><p>Maybe a greater realignment at that level between SOLAS and what the universities are doing would bring us to where we are.  There are five pillars to Creative Ireland and we have spoken only of pillar 1 in the context of arts and education.  There is the community and so on.  Perhaps Ms Copeland would like to speak about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.912" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sinead Copeland" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018021400002#Q00200"><p>I would like to add to that.  Just building on what Dr. Sweeney said in regard to Creative Youth under pillar 1, we will probably focus this year and next year more on early years and primary and post-primary levels.  However, under pillar 2, the community engagement piece, which is probably what was referenced earlier on, we have a great network of Creative Ireland co-ordinators who are working at local level, bringing all the different agencies together to bring that creativity forward as a lifelong objective.  It is creativity for creativity's sake.  For 2018, as part of the Creative Ireland programme, we will focus a lot on creativity and well-being and try to develop that space.  It is not something on which we have done a huge amount of work yet, but it is something we will explore this year.  We are taking on board the point that it does not stop when one is 18 years of age and we do need to develop that a bit further.</p></speech>

One is what we call arts participation, where people engage directly in arts practice.  It would be supported by many of our organisations.  There is an organisation called Create, which facilitates a huge amount of work in this field of practice.  There are also organisations such as Waterford Healing Arts, which looks at arts in health care contexts, and Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland, which works with artists with disabilities and with people with disabilities in a participative context.  There is that element of the work we do and then there is also the work we do on the continuing professional development of artists, professional practicing artists in their work.  There are groups such as resource organisations, including Visual Artists Ireland, Dance Ireland and the Irish Writers Centre.  These all provide direct supports to support the development of artists.  These can be short-term training courses.  The Arts Council also has artists' bursaries where people can apply to us for money to develop their practice as artists.  It is about that continuum of support across all the arts throughout the country in many different ways.</p> <p>  Currently, we are looking at our whole funding framework.  We are looking at the idea of rather than having one-year bursaries, having multi-annual bursaries for artists so that we give them long-term support.  For a writer who is engaging on a new project, perhaps a year is not enough.  We need to consider that and the way in which we support them.  It is that continuous support.</p> <p>  Some of our major organisations, such as the Abbey Theatre, have their own specialist arts and education department which will engage with particular communities of interest, be they young people, people from a particular geographic location or a particular cohort of the population, in their work.  It is about ensuring that all the support we provide works across that panoply, across the map of cultural provision within Ireland, whether one is a professional artist or one wishes to engage with the arts directly to have personal meaning.</p></speech>

We all run programmes at different levels and at different points of entry, all contingent on budget.  The Council of National Cultural Institutions has a policy framework document which maps out the roadmap for the work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.915" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Comer" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018021400002#Q00500"><p>To support what Ms Donoghue said, there is fantastic work going on among the cultural institutions in terms of providing programmes not just for young people and children but for adults as well.  Can I deal with a question that was asked earlier about the local authorities and local authority arts officers?  Our recommendation is that they would be more represented on advisory boards in regard to arts and education and young people and that the remit of the local authority arts officers would also include the work a number of them are doing around the whole area of arts and education.  That is really important.</p> <p>  No more than the Arts Council would say that it is the national organisation to support the development of the arts in Ireland, the local authority arts officers and the local authorities are supporting the development of the arts at a local level, and that is really important.  </p> <p>  Conversations are happening within the Arts Council between what the local authority arts officers are doing and what the Arts Council is providing as support to them.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government also needs to endorse and formalise the role of the local authority arts officers in terms of that whole area of arts and education and young people.</p></speech>

If one is looking at the critical infrastructure within many counties, it comprises the education centre for teacher continuing professional development, CPD, and linking with the classroom.  One then has the local authority arts officers who work with us on teacher-artist partnership CPD.  Many arts officers have relationships with schools and are involved in the arts in schools but it is not part of their legislative remit.  In terms of that involvement and representation, the Department should give its imprimatur for them to have a bigger role in that area.</p></speech>

There was a recommendation to review and revise the Arts in Education Charter in light of current developments.  Could they expand on that a little bit?</p></speech>

The recommendations which have been implemented were successfully landed across the board, as outlined by Dr. Sweeney.  When it was introduced, it was introduced as a living document so it should not sit as a document belonging to 2013.  It should be revised in the light of what has been achieved by the actions outlined in it and of other things that have developed.</p> <p>  As we are a ground-up organisation, the aim of Encountering the Arts Ireland is to take into account the initiatives that are happening at ground level and to bring them closer to policy.  That is the ideal scenario.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wishes to focus on traffic management and congestion in Galway.  To assist me in dealing with their subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority in this provision and regulation of public transport services.</p> <p>  The remit of the NTA is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated accessible transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.</p> <p>  The authority is limited in terms of producing a statutory transport strategy to the greater Dublin area.  Any transport strategy produced by the NTA in any other area is on a non-statutory basis.</p> <p>  On the current transport trends in Galway city, the following shows the number of journeys to work and education recorded by the 2016 census for census day, and compares that data to the 2011 census data on which the Galway transport strategy was based.</p> <p>  In terms of the different modes, between 2011 and 2016, the walking mode increased from 11,000 to 12,000 journeys.  The cycling mode grew from 2,331 to 2,987.  People used cycling as their means of access to work and education.  The bus mode grew by almost 25%.  Between 4,000 to just over 5,000 people used buses to access work and education.  Rail went from 167 down to 120 in 2016.  The car mode went from 27,461 to 27,914, representing a small increase between 2011 and 2016.</p> <p>  As can be seen from this data, there has been an increase in the number of people walking, cycling and using buses in the five years between the censuses.  That is a very positive trend in the right direction and reflects how walkable the city is in terms of its size and the investment by the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and City Direct in improving the bus services in the city.  However, significant challenges remain to movement within the city, which prompted the NTA to develop a transport strategy with Galway City and County Councils.</p> <p>  Regarding the Galway transport strategy, to safeguard the future development and growth of Galway city and its role as the economic centre of the west of Ireland, it was considered important to develop a long-term transportation strategy that would complement and support the Galway City Development Plan.  The Galway transport strategy was developed on a joint basis by the NTA and Galway City and County Councils as an integrated transport plan, the primary purpose of which was to co-ordinate and consolidate the planning and implementation of transport proposals in Galway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.938" nospeaker="true" time="13:30:00" ><p>The key issues identified as part of the study were an over-reliance on private car travel; significant peak-hour congestion and journey time unreliability; significant dispersed traffic movements to, through and around the city centre area; constraints to national, regional and local transport movements, all of which funnel through Galway city, including all movement to and from Connemara; limited bridge crossings on the River Corrib; key junctions operating over capacity; an inappropriate mix of transport modes within the city centre due to limited road space; a public transport service and network in need of enhanced capacity and additional priority; a limited, discontinuous cycle network; restricted footpaths, poor accessibility for disabled-mobility impaired; and associated safety issues due to poor walking and cycling infrastructure.  The Galway transport strategy, GTS, has identified key transport infrastructure projects and service requirements which will address the existing transportation issues and provides a framework for their phased implementation, subject to funding.  These infrastructural projects include an enhanced city traffic network; an improved bus network with a minimum frequency of 15 minutes or better at peak time and improved residential and commercial access to a bus in a ten minute walk; improved bus priority measures; and new park and ride services and improved walking and cycling routes.</p><p>The strategy was subject to extensive public consultation and a full environmental assessment.  The proposals were developed and assessed using the NTA's transport model for the region and a comprehensive demand analysis was undertaken utilising key census data to derive a new core bus network.  The GTS has been adopted into the development plans of the two local authorities and was a key factor in Galway city winning the European green leaf designation for 2017.  One of the issues considered in the development of the strategy was whether a light rail solution - Luas - would be required for any of the transport corridors in the city.  Based on a full transport modelling assessment, it was concluded that the provision of a light rail system would not be the appropriate transport solution for Galway city at this time.  The maximum passenger corridor demand was forecast at roughly 1,100 passengers per hour per direction, which would equate to roughly one third of the operating capacity for a light rail service running at an appropriate frequency, making it a highly inefficient solution.  The implementation timeline and capital costs, which would be approximately ten times that of a bus operated system, also weigh heavily against the introduction of Luas in Galway city at this time.</p><p>The economic importance of the wider Parkmore employment area is fully recognised by the NTA and is addressed at a strategic level in the Galway transport strategy.  Three of the core bus services identified in the strategy will run to Parkmore, which will also eventually be served by the proposed N6 Galway city ring road.  The NTA has recently appointed a design team to undertake a more focussed local transportation study of Parkmore.  This study will provide a detailed breakdown of the infrastructural projects required to facilitate the short, medium and long term implementation of the strategy in Parkmore.  It is anticipated that this study will allow for an accelerated delivery of new transportation options to Parkmore, providing relief for existing employees and facilitating future growth.</p><p>The implementation of the proposals in the Galway transport strategy will be challenging.  However, I believe that their delivery will protect and enhance the future development of the city as an economic and cultural centre in the west of Ireland.  We await the announcements in the national development plan to ascertain what funding is available to deliver on the recommendations in the strategy.  I look forward to working with Galway City Council, Galway County Council and public transport operators to deliver this ambitious strategy for Galway.</p></speech>

The draft national planing framework highlights the importance of our cities and the population growth ambition rates for the cities.  It references compact forms of urban development in all types of settlements, supported by public transport, and it states that Galway's population is targeted to grow by 45,000 by 2040 which interestingly is twice as much to 2040 as was achieved in the period up to 2016.  It also references the focus on investment in infrastructure and livability and choice in terms of housing and employment and supporting new employment opportunities.</p> <p>  The draft NPF highlights 13 growth enablers for Galway.  I propose to focus on what is needed in transport terms to enable Galway to grow.  The draft NPF references progressing the sustainable development of new greenfield areas for housing and the development of supporting public transport and infrastructure, such as is proposed for Ardaun; improving access and sustainable transport links to and integrated with existing employment areas to the east of the city such as Parkmore, Ballybrit and Mervue; the provision of a city-wide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre, third level institutions and employment areas to the east of the city; focuses on public realm and urban amenity projects, including streets, public spaces, particularly in support of an extended city centre area where residential and employment areas can be linked to pedestrian routes; and development of a strategic cycleway network with a number of high capacity flagship routes and the delivery of the Galway city ring road, which my county council colleagues will speak about later.</p> <p>  As everybody here will be aware, Galway city is a medieval city and so it has a compact city centre core with low density suburbs.  It has been referred to by others as the fastest growing city in Europe.  The city has succeeded in driving forward its economic development and today it has a world class medical technology cluster within it, which thankfully is continuing to grow.  Galway City Council recognises that the socioeconomic development of the city is foremost and we also recognise that address of the transportation issues is critical because it is clearly impacting on the reputation of the city.  If this issue is not addressed, attracting new economic investment and creating new jobs in the city will be difficult.  As per the statistics outlined by the chief executive of the NTA there are over 43,000 journeys to employment across the various sectors in Galway: the five national routes coming into the city carry over 80,000 vehicles per day and approximately 95,000 vehicles cross four bridges in the city, three of which are in the city centre.  Morning peak traffic on the M6 in 2013 stood at 3,200 vehicles.  Prior to the opening of the M17-M18, it stood at 4,600 and today it stands at 6,250.</p> <p>  Some of the current challenges for us in terms of transport include an over-reliance on private car travel in Galway city; significant dispersed traffic movements to, through and around the city centre; constraints to national, regional and local transport movements, all of which funnel through Galway city, including all movement to and from Connemara; and, as I stated earlier, there are limited bridge crossings, three of which are in the city centre.</p><p>The sea to the lake is a distance of 5 km, north to south, while east to west, the distance across the city is between 8 km and 9 km, depending on from where one judges that.  Traffic solutions are also impacted by constraints such as topography, water and extensive areas of protected habitats.  Finding solutions has been difficult and extensive, as we will outline specifically in respect of the city ring road. </p><p>Many of the key junctions in the city are operating way beyond their capacity.  They operate at between 120% and 140% of capacity at peak times.  There is an inappropriate mix of transport modes in the city centre due to the limited road space for all the different public transport modes.  There is significant peak hour congestion and journey times are uncertain.  Most important, there are associated safety concerns.</p><p> The city's public transport network is in need of enhanced capacity and additional priority.  We have a limited and discontinuous cycle network and the NTA emphasises that we have restricted footpaths and poor accessibility for disabled and mobility impaired persons.  There are significant safety issues, especially for pedestrians.  For example, we shot a video at the Kirwan roundabout one morning and made a presentation to the city council about removing it at our second last meeting.  The number of near misses involving pedestrians was frightening and that happens every day.  There are 1,000 pedestrian movements across that roundabout between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.  People are jumping lanes of traffic to cross the roundabout and that is just one example.</p><p> As Ms Graham outlined, the Galway transport strategy, GTS, has been brought forward as the solution.  It is an evidence-based strategy for the region, which sets out a clear vision to create a connected city region driven by smarter mobility.  The strategy has been adopted by both Galway City Council and Galway County Council and it has been included in the development plans of both local authorities.  The GTS provides a framework for implementing transport proposals in Galway for the next 20 plus years.  It is a consistent policy and builds on previous studies carried out in the area.  We welcome and appreciate the partnership with the NTA in developing the strategy, which covers the city and the surrounding hinterland from Barna to Moycullen, Oranmore and Claregalway.</p><p> Mr. Finn will take the committee through the key features of the strategy but, fundamentally, it provides benefits to regional and intercity bus services via cross-city links; bus priority measures; interchange between regional bus and rail services and the city bus network via a hub in the city centre; park-and-ride sites on key strategic corridor approaches; cross-city bus services between Barna and Oranmore; the N6-Galway city ring road scheme will enhance connectivity to the western region; and the proposed cycle network includes integration with potential greenways to Moycullen and Barna and the Dublin-Galway greenway.  The strategy was put in place following extensive consultation and developed using the NTA's new and bespoke model for the west.  It is evidence-based and it uses a comprehensive demand management analysis, which uses key census data.  A number of new bus networks are at its core.  The reconfiguration and rationalisation of bus routes in the city will provide, for example, three connections from the west of the city to the Parkmore area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.947" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#E00200"><p>The next slide outlines the seven principles of the GTS.  The focus of the strategy is very much on the city centre core to prioritise pedestrian use, cycling and public transport and to allow vehicular traffic into the city centre primarily to access car parks while making improvements in the city centre core to enable traffic to flow.  A key element is bus priority through the city centre to reduce bus journey times and provide reliability in respect of journey times for customers.  Coupled with that, a number of the primary routes of the city on the bus network, particularly on the Dublin Road, will have bus priority to enhance journey times.  The following slide outlines the modelling that was done on the public transport bus network.  It shows the existing bus routes and the proposed new bus routes with the enhancement provided.  It shows the number of people that will be within a ten-minute walk of a bus stop in the city centre under the new arrangement.  Up to 77% of people will be within ten minutes of a bus stop and 72% of them will be near where people work.  That will provide much better access to buses.  There will be increased priority for infrastructural improvements on those routes to reduce journey times.  There also will be a cycling network with different tiers.  Working with our funding agencies, the NTA and TII, we will look to develop them over the coming years to provide better connectivity throughout the city for cycling and walking.</p> <p>  Alternatives to the GTS were examined as well.  With regard to light rail and rapid transit, the current rapid transit usage is 1,100 passengers per hour and the current bus network can meet that capacity.  Our focus is very much on providing priority for the bus network and future proofing it as the city expands.  It is a low density city centre core with many of the suburbs comprising semi-detached houses.  Currently, the population density required for commuters to be within a ten-minute walk of a light rail system does not support such a system.</p> <p>  One of the other key considerations related to the city orbital route.  If everything in the GTS relating to public transport, walking and cycling improvements was done, the modelling showed that the orbital route would be still required to reduce traffic congestion out of the city centre and to provide the bus priority that is needed.</p> <p>  The final slide outlines that the GTS is excellent in that it is a strategy for the city for the next 30 years.  We are moving forward quickly to get projects to planning stage.  We have projects at construction stage but we expect a significant increase in funding in the capital plan to enable works to move to construction.  Parkmore access improvements are ongoing.  We have had a number of projects in the past year and I am sure there will be enhanced budget provision for those in 2018 and beyond.  As Mr. McGrath mentioned, the Kirwan roundabout upgrade is a TII-funded project and we hope that will go to construction at the end of the year.  It is at Part 8 in the planning process currently and we hope to have that in front of our city councillors shortly.  The Tuam Road is another key project while the city centre transport management plan is at design stage.  An update was presented to councillors at their January meeting.  That is very much about bus priority in the city centre and improvements to traffic flow outside the city centre.  There is a project for the Dublin Road as well as cycling and greenway projects.  General junction safety improvements for pedestrians throughout the city will be undertaken and, last but not least, is the Galway city ring road.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the number of people who are due to contribute and, therefore, I will not read through the document that has been circulated.</p><p>I will, however, touch on a number of key points.</p><p> Something worth emphasising is the fact that Galway city and county work together in addressing transportation issues in Galway city and its environs by means of a number of section 85 agreements, whereby one or other of the two local authorities takes the lead on different parts of the process to avoid duplication and ensure close collaboration.  That collaboration extends to our relationship with the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which has been robust and beneficial for some time.</p><p> I wish to address the part of the overall solution that is being led by Galway County Council, namely, the Galway city ring road.  The Galway transport strategy, GTS, included an evaluation of transport options for all modes of transport and affirmed the strategic need for an orbital route around Galway city to achieve the level of service required for each mode of transport, including walking, cycling, public transport and private vehicles.</p><p> The ring road proposal is effectively 5.6 km of single carriageway and 11.9 km of dual carriageway with associated road junctions and structures, including a new bridge crossing the River Corrib.  Mr. McGrath has outlined some of the constraints on delivering a solution, including Galway Bay to the south, the River Corrib, which divides the city, and a number of sites protected by the habitats directive, for example, the Lough Corrib candidate special area of conservation, SAC, and the Moycullen bogs complex candidate SAC.  From the outset, and given the linear nature of the city and the limited available space between Lough Corrib and the built-up area, the environmental constraints needed to be balanced against impacts on residential, commercial and institutional property.  It is worth noting that the project's study area covered a total of 63 sq. km.  As such, an extensive area was considered when devising a solution.</p><p> The proposal for a ring road in Galway has been supported in policy documents from national to local level, including the Galway city and county development plans, the regional planning guidelines, the national spatial strategy and the draft national planning framework.  I will not outline the issues that have arisen that necessitate the requirement for an overall transport solution, as they have been well rehearsed by now and are well understood, and it is agreed that they need urgent attention.</p><p> In terms of options identification and assessment, a preferred option was developed in accordance with national and international design standards and the relevant regulatory and statutory requirements and guidelines.  Alternatives were comprehensively appraised in accordance with the Department's framework for transport projects and programmes and TII's project appraisal guidelines.  These alternatives included every sort of scenario from doing nothing to doing the minimum, from on-line upgrades to off-line upgrades, public transport options, etc.  There was extensive consultation with the public during the options identification stage, with more than 1,400 people attending a series of four open days in January and February of 2015 and 994 submissions received during that part of the process.</p><p> My submission to the committee outlines in figure 1 the diagram of the proposed road solution currently being advanced.  It is an extensive piece of infrastructure going from the R336 Coast Road to the N59 Galway-Clifden road and on across the N84 Headford Road, the N83 Tuam Road and the Monivea Road and on to meet the N6 at Coolagh junction.  Each of those junctions is grade separated, ensuring the greatest flow of traffic across the city as well as in and out of it.</p><p> The economic valuation has presented a benefit-cost ratio of such strength that is rarely seen in an infrastructural project like this.  The business case has been approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> Throughout the process of delivering the project, there has been extensive consultation with landowners and stakeholders, with all identified landowners and property owners having been contacted.  There have been 1,000 face-to-face meetings with landowners in their homes or in the project office.  The council maintains a project website, which has had 43,000 visits to date.  Throughout that period, there also have been extensive consultations with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, particularly on environmental issues.  Further consultation is to take place with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming period.  It is hoped these consultations will be brought to a conclusion shortly.</p><p> An extensive amount of work has been done in terms of all aspects of the design and planning of this project.  We hope to be in a position to submit the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as early as April.  Depending on what happens after that, including whether there are legal challenges and so forth, construction could be expected to be completed by 2024.</p><p> There is a compelling need for the proposed road.  The mood has changed from wondering whether it is necessary to one of asking us as authorities when it will be done.  The chief executive of Galway City Council mentioned the national planning framework.  It is pertinent to consider Galway's future in that context without the ring road and the associated other transport initiatives that are under way.  It is clear that Galway will not, and cannot, grow without these infrastructural provisions.  In the current environment, if Galway cannot grow, it can only regress.  The delivery of this transport solution is essential for Galway's future.  We have received good support for it to date.  My request is that we receive continued strong support across Departments and from the Government itself in terms of advancing the project through the next phases and, in due course, providing funding to have it constructed.</p></speech>

Like all commuters in Galway, we know a great deal about traffic.  My experience and expertise is in systems optimisation and product and process flow.  I wish to share with the committee a new perspective on how these tools and techniques can be used to improve traffic flow.</p> <p>  I will highlight some data and background.  A recent INRIX global traffic congestion report placed Galway as the 70th worst city in the world, the tenth worst in Europe and the worst in Ireland for traffic congestion.  This demonstrates that our current approach to reducing congestion is not working.  We need to change.  We need to start using data to make decisions, adopt new technologies such as Waze, which I will discuss later, use standardised and internationally accepted metrics such as journey time to track progress, and implement short-term - three-to-six months - process-driven initiatives to improve traffic flow.  For example, a recent initiative in Boston showed an 18% reduction in traffic congestion using these new techniques.  Coincidentally, this is estimated to be the same approximate reduction in overall travel time for the Galway transport network following the completion of the N6 outer bypass.  The same principles can be implemented nationwide from Cork to Donegal and from Mayo to Maynooth.</p> <p>  As a general comment, the proposal I am presenting should be seen as complementary to the GTS, which has been already outlined.  The GTS provides a framework for implementing transport proposals over the next 20 years.  The planned improvements in public transport, pedestrian and cycling initiatives and the new N6 Galway city ring road are to be welcomed.  However, we must implement shorter term 20-week plans in parallel.</p> <p>  To start the journey today, we are not looking for money - we are looking for data.  Once we have the data, we can use them to make data-driven decisions.  Research has shown that, when we do not have real-time accurate data, decisions are made using the HiPPO effect - the highest paid person's opinion.</p><p>Where will we get these data?  How much will it cost?  Other cities have partnered with a company called Waze and receive these data for free.  Waze is the world's largest community-based traffic and navigation application, which can be downloaded to a phone.  With it, drivers can share real-time traffic and road information, saving everyone time on their daily commute.  Waze has 500 city partners around the world with about ten signing up each week.  It works with them through its connected citizens programme.  No Irish cities or towns are currently listed as being a member of this programme.  We have been in contact with Waze through Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's office.  It responded to say that, based on our profile, it thinks we are a great fit for the Waze connected citizens programme.</p><p> Once we get these data from Waze, we can identify bottlenecks in the system that reduce the flow of traffic.  In Galway, one could argue that we do not have a traffic problem but a traffic flow problem.  Traffic management interventions require the removal of these traffic flow blockers on key city commuting routes.  In my full submission to the committee, I listed ten, but I want to give one or two examples.  We all know them.  We should look at right turns which block traffic flow on these free-flow routes.  We should optimise traffic light timing and sequencing between sets of traffic lights.  Road works are major traffic blockers.  Road openings, as they are called, which result in the closure of a traffic lane, are a major source of traffic congestion.  The guidelines on road openings recently published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are to be welcomed.  However, we should go a step further and implement lane rental charges on major commuting routes.  For example, if one wants to open a lane in London, one has to pay the city between &pound;300 and &pound;2,500 per day.  That focuses the mind.  It has been an effective programme and has saved it approximately &pound;30 million from congestion issues.  It has been rolled out across London.  It has a net profit compared to what it costs to run.</p><p> The Arthouse Cinema has had a lane closed on Dock Road in Galway for approximately five years now.  There may be a reason for that but it should not happen.  We need to test innovative solutions.  There is a technique called a zipper merge which would work well for traffic merging or could at least be considered.  Drone footage should be looked at.  We have had a licensed operator take drone footage of some major junctions in Galway and many traffic flow blockers are evident.  While there are individual examples of such interventions in Galway, we need to implement a structured process and approach to addressing traffic flow blockers on key routes.  Only then will synergies be achieved across the traffic network.  We see evidence of what can be achieved to reduce congestion with the traffic management plan implemented for the Galway races each year.  Free flow routes are put in place for the week, designated blue, green and red.  London has 580 km of permanent red routes to assist traffic flow on major bus and commuting routes.</p><p> To implement this plan in the short term, we need to trust the process.  If we trust the process, outcomes will follow.  When Irish rugby players are asked about their success, they credit it to the plan, performance and the Schmidt system.  Passion is not enough.  We need to implement a standardised metric, such as journey time, to set goals and track progress.  As one leaves today to go home, one will be interested in the time it will take.  There are other metrics in the plan - perhaps ten - which are important but the customer-focused metric is journey time, no matter what the mode of transport is.  Except for certain parts of the motorway network, we do not report journey time in Ireland live.  Our traffic reports on national and local radio use terms such as easing, moving slowly, very slow and moving well.  In the USA and other countries, live journey times on key traffic routes are reported.  I have a recording of such a report here, which I will play for members.  They will hear a US traffic report, followed by an Irish traffic report.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee for their interest in our views on traffic and congestion.  I will speak specifically about Parkmore in Galway.  Before I speak about the challenges, I am keen to share the remarkable success story of the medtech sector here.  Ireland is home to eight of the world's top ten medtech companies.  Galway plays a vital role as a global hub for the industry.  More than 29,000 people are employed in the medtech industry across 450 companies.  The medtech industry has made, and continues to make, a critical contribution to making Ireland one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.  The committee has heard many statistics from the speakers so far.  Our most important statistic in Medtronic is simple.  Every second, two patients' lives are saved or improved by a Medtronic device.  It is crucial not one of these patients is a statistic.  Each of these 70 million people has individual thoughts and dreams.  That drives us as a company.  Our mission is to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life.</p> <p>  I am unbelievably proud that, for over 35 years, and with more than 3,000 employees and 45 nationalities at the Parkmore site, we have helped to drive that mission forward with breakthrough advances in medical care in areas as diverse as drug-eluting stents, aortic aneurism repair, aortic valve repair and leadless pacemakers as examples.  We experience a pace of change in medtech that has never been witnessed before.  Technologies are diverging and converging very rapidly.  I have been involved in the medtech industry for over 25 years and have seen significant change in this time.  The truth is that when I talk to young engineers coming into the medtech industry, I tell them that I am jealous of them because the change that will happen in the next five to ten years will far outweigh what has happened in the past 25 years.  It is our job to imagine that change and make it a reality.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, that leads me to talk about what has not changed.  The  infrastructure in Parkmore has not kept pace with the success delivered by the businesses there.  This has not happened overnight.  Last October, we celebrated our 35 year anniversary on the campus in Medtronic.  When we had that celebration, we saw aerial footage of what the campus originally looked like.  The only thing that has not changed in 35 years is the road network in and out of the campus.  The road is exactly the same as it was 35 years ago.  Every other speaker here today has much more detailed knowledge of the various aspects of the traffic challenge and solutions than I have, but I am here to share the business perspective and to emphasise the nature of the deterioration in recent years.</p> <p>  The Parkmore campus employs 6,000 people, 3,000 of whom work for Medtronic.  I do not need to point out the contribution of these businesses to local commerce, providing vital jobs to the community and supporting national economic growth.  Mr. Coll mentioned that INRIX transport analytics show that Galway city is the worst in Ireland.  Parkmore is the epicentre of this and needs its own immediate solutions.  Employees are faced with long delays coming to and from work every day, which is increasingly affecting businesses and their ability to keep and attract talent.  Parkmore staff have grown extremely frustrated by the daily challenge they face to merely get to and from their place of work.  Employees regularly encounter two-hour traffic delays on a daily basis when driving in and out of the estate.  That is not their commute.  That is time taken to get in and out of the estate, which hopefully gives a sense of the gravity of the situation.</p><p> This impacts productivity, engagement and ultimately employees' capacity in their work.  As a company, our only secret to success is our employees.  That is what delivers results for us and it is vital that we have an engaged workforce to deliver results.</p><p> More importantly than that, this affects people's quality of life on a daily basis.  In order to find a solution, Medtronic has worked hard to help tackle the traffic problem.  We have an active traffic group within the company, which has spawned initiatives like car-pooling.  We have a very active cycling group and an active commuter village, in which we have invested heavily to make sure we have state-of-the art cycling facilities.  We have appointed independent traffic consultants.  We have teamed up with other industries and the State and worked with various Government bodies in the Parkmore Traffic Action Group, PTAG, which is focused on providing a collective voice to drive change.  Within the campus, across all businesses, there is an active HR sub-team that collaborates to organise shift patterns etc. to do what can be done to manage traffic.</p><p> The Galway transport strategy is a crucial part of a long-term solution to alleviating traffic congestion in Parkmore and in Galway city.  We acknowledge that a Galway city ring-road is a vital component to this and we fully support one.  The reality is that extended timelines around the delivery of this piece of infrastructure means that our options must be explored in the immediate term. </p><p> Anybody who works in Parkmore will attest that one of the most frustrating aspects of this is that every year a huge traffic management plan is put in place for the Galway Races, which are held right beside Parkmore.  Anybody working in Parkmore will agree that the only time traffic works well there is during the Galway Races when 20,000 extra people come there.  Results can be driven.  We need to stop talking and deliver them.</p><p> In regard to progress, while the traffic situation remains acute, I acknowledge that there have been some positive developments in the recent past which are worth highlighting.  An adjustment to signalling and new road markings have helped the situation somewhat in the evenings.  It is also welcome that, in the week that we are here to discuss traffic, work has started on a new exit lane from Parkmore west.  Unfortunately this work has been significantly later than anticipated, but I acknowledge the work and the fact that this will help alleviate the situation.</p><p> I come from an industry where I am judged solely on delivering results.  I would like this committee to ensure it sees results in Parkmore and across Galway.  I am appealing to those in power to implement and promote change to deliver results, and present a vision that reflects the success of Galway industry and embraces future opportunities.  We should not be afraid of being successful.  We should plan for it and make sure we set ourselves up for it. </p><p> I acknowledge that no immediate silver bullet is available.  However, the need for urgent, focused and collaborative action to tackle congestion is indisputable.  I would very much welcome the opportunity to come back to this committee to report that results have been delivered.  Businesses right across Galway and right across Parkmore, including Medtronic, have a responsibility and a role to play in working with all other stakeholders to alleviate this problem.  We are fully committed to doing that.  I welcome any questions on these topics.</p></speech>

Dar liom, is &eacute; ceann de na ruda&iacute; is pr&aacute;inn&iacute; at&aacute; againn in iarthar na h&Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  I will not go through the statistics.  They have been illustrated very well by all of the speakers.  I will not spend a long time talking, because I am really keen that everybody gets a chance to contribute.  This is not about me or any single person.  It is about all of us working together.  As Mr. Neary said, in business we are measured by results.  One is measured by what one achieves.  He also called on us to stop talking and to start more action.  That is the world I come from too.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath outlined the situation where traffic congestion is concerned.  There are more than 6,000 vehicles at morning peak time, which is between 120% and 140% above capacity.  The population of Galway is going to grow by 45,000 in the next 22 years.  We cannot cope with existing traffic, never mind what is going to happen.  I am really scared that we will keep doing what we have always done.  Members know the outcome of that.  We will get what we always got. </p> <p>  I have some brief questions.  Can Ms Graham, Mr. McGrath and Mr. Kelly tell me a little bit about the relationship between the three different organisations, how well they are working together and their joined-up thinking?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  My second relates to Galway City Council and Galway County Council and the level of their engagement with companies like Medtronic that employ a significant number of people in the Galway area.</p> <p>  The personal stories are really important.  Can Mr. Neary share with us some of the challenges his staff members go through?  I am from Spiddal and I used to travel to school in Galway by bus every day.  I would leave at 8.20 a.m. and I would be in school 8.50 a.m.  If I left my parents' house at 8.20 a.m. today, I would arrive at the same destination at 9.30 a.m.  That is 45 years later.  Look at the backward step we have taken.  It is absolutely incredible.  I am keen to see what Ms Graham, Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGrath's short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives are.  In regard to their first, second and third objectives, what are the key performance indicators, KPIs, determining whether goals are being achieved or not?  What is the project management strategy?</p></speech>

I bow to all my esteemed colleagues from Galway, but I can provide a little perspective.  Despite living 60 miles away, I have had huge involvement in Galway over the last 20 years.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  When I saw them, the first thing I looked for was solutions.  I am interested in seeing action.  I have seen this issue, and one would not have to be an engineer, a planner or anything else to know that a totally choked bottleneck is imminent.  Culturally and historically, Galway is a wonderful city.  It is unique for its welcome to tourism.  However, the way I would see it, it is operating with its hands tied behind its back when transport and congestion are considered.  I refer to the development of the massive potential there.  The Connemara area can be opened up to tourism.</p><p>I have been at some public meetings in recent years at which people objected to the ring road and proposed that light rail would solve the matter and so on.  I think all these solutions are needed, but the time for action has arrived.</p><p> I have a few quick questions.  I welcome all the presentations.  I was very interested in Brian Coll's because he seemed to be thinking on a different level or plane.  How would all the other contributors respond to what Brian Coll has said about improving the current bottlenecks?  I will not talk about individual roundabouts or anything else - I will leave that to my Galway colleagues - because I have no agenda except to see this sorted out.  Medtronic has expanded greatly over the years.  Has the issue of traffic congestion hampered this expansion?  Would Medtronic be bigger if there were a better traffic flow?  In other words, does it make it more difficult to recruit at times?  Hypothetically, if Medtronic were to expand or announce 1,000 new jobs in the morning, how would the traffic in Galway affect such a decision?  What dynamic would it have?  Finally, how do all the council officials see this rolling out?  What will Galway city be like in five years' time and ten years' time?  Regarding the figure that was mentioned of an increase in population of 40,000, unless something changes radically that will not happen because people just will not be able either to commute to or to live in a city that is hampered as it is at present.</p></speech>

For anyone who either works in Galway or has to try to get in and out of it, the simple fact of the matter is that most of us avoid travelling between 8 o'clock and 9.30 a. m.  If I am in the office at 5 o'clock in the evening, I never bother leaving until 7 p.m. because all I will be doing is sitting in a car in a car park, so there are major problems.  Before we come to the big changes, what are the impediments to making the small changes we need, or are there impediments?  The witnesses have talked about lane changes, minor widenings, which are being done on the way to Parkmore, co-ordinating the traffic lights, getting rid of some of the roundabouts that should be long gone and so on.  Are there planning or design impediments to just getting on and doing these things?  They make quite a significant difference and they can be done quickly.  I am very interested in Brian Coll's submission.  It would be very handy if one could just check when to leave.  We are playing a guessing game at present.  We sit in our offices and do not know when it is safe to leave and be able to get out of town.  Information can be of huge benefit to making things happen.  The people who do not have to be there at a fixed time can put travelling back by half an hour.  If that can make an 18% improvement, that kind of technological solution is absolutely vital, and technology can make a huge difference in the modern world.  I would be interested to know whether city council and county council or the NTA has looked at traffic management.</p> <p>  I read this plan two years ago on my holidays.</p></speech>

These are the sad things I do on my holidays.  It came out in August 2016.  I went through it and I buy into its analysis.  My attitude is that it needs to be done in total as soon as possible.  Therefore, I buy into the public transport element of it but I also buy into the fact that this cannot be done unless one builds the road around the city.  However, building a road around the city and not carrying out the public transport work will not work either.  We should just get on with fully implementing this.  I share the concern that, when we have done all that, if we do get 40,000 more people in the city and another 40,000 people within 40 miles of the city, we may still be at a zero-sum game, but we will ask the NTA about that another day.</p> <p>  This study has one big weakness in that it basically concerns Barna and Moycullen to Claregalway and Oranmore.  My understanding - perhaps Tony Neary could confirm this - is that approximately 46% of the employees in Parkmore Estate alone come from the county area, mainly from the east, and an awful lot of those are in turn from beyond Claregalway and Oranmore.  I accept that one is fine if one is in a car on the motorway route; one is sorted once one gets clear of the town.  However, there are two issues that do not seem to be addressed in the study.  One is how one gets from Galway to Carrowroe, as mentioned by an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  That can take an hour and a half either way in the morning and the evening, which is totally unacceptable for the distance involved.  Regarding the part nearest Galway, one is fine when one gets to Baile na hAbhann outwards; it is the near end that is the problem.  The other issue is who is responsible for this wider planning.  This plan just gets us to Barna, to Oranmore.  Who is responsible for the wider planning of transport in the region?  Galway is meant to be a regional grower and many of Medtronic's employees will insist on living where they are from no matter what plans we bring in.  We should be practical about that.  That is the way it will be.</p> <p>  Finally, who would be responsible for the analysis and the development of an existing resource, that is, commuter rail into Galway?  I see this as coming from the north, the east and the south and drawing up a plan as to what it would take to use the existing assets that are there and sweat them to their absolute maximum ability.  We have seen big growth in traffic from Athenry by accident since the train to Limerick started because there is some frequency to it.  However, my question is who has the responsibility of analysing what could be achieved at a modest investment if the current assets, that is, three railway lines going in three different directions, were sweated, passing bays and so on, in order to achieve frequency of trains and a focus on commuters.  It is crazy that we do not have any commuter service into Galway.  All over Northern Ireland, from Bangor to Derry and everywhere else, services are very much focused on the needs of the commuter.  Which authority, county council, city council or other body - the NTA, TII - is responsible for making a policy decision to examine this and come up with a solution?</p></speech>

This is not a committee on which I normally sit, so I thank the committee members for affording me the opportunity to contribute.  I come from east Galway, which was not discussed at all in any of the presentations, so I represent that part of the county that is home to over 46% of the staff of Parkmore Estate, as my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  Coming from Headford and Tuam, along the M6 and with the opening of the M17 and the M18, we are now funnelling even more quickly into the city.</p><p>My first question is for Mr. Tony Neary.  How long will it take to get the extra slip road that started on Monday completed?  Believe it or not, one of my Facebook pages is usually very busy with Mr. Neary's employees contacting me about their frustration with how long they are left sitting in traffic because they cannot make it home on time in the evenings to get to the cr&egrave;che, doctor's appointments or parent-teacher meetings.  While there is progress, the staff in that zone are frustrated and annoyed with how slow it is.</p><p> The next question is for the county manager, the city manager and the NTA.  Are there funding allocations for putting a dedicated bus corridor or bus lane in place from places such as Athenry and Tuam, far enough out to cope with the capacity so we can keep traffic out of the city?  If it works very well during race week, what are the hold ups preventing it being rolled out for a 52-week period?</p><p> Finally, with regard to thinking outside the box, I welcome Mr. Brian Coll's presentation.  There is a thing called the "bendy bus".  I do not know if people have heard of it or if they can discuss it, but has consideration ever been given to putting a bendy bus in places such as Headford, Athenry or Tuam and running it into Galway?  It could service Parkmore with a park and ride and keep the traffic out.  I believe that would have merit even while we are discussing the bigger stuff.  As Brian Coll said, we need time-measured results.  There are the bigger pictures mentioned here, but we need results at present.  I was in the United States last year and the only thing people spoke about regarding Galway was how long they were stuck in the car.  That is not the image I would wish for it, so we need short-term solutions as well as long-term ones.  However, the short-term solutions and gains are not very short term when one hears from Mr. Tony Neary about how long it took to complete the slip road.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for instigating this discussion.  This is a critical issue for Members of the Oireachtas representing east and west Galway and south Mayo.  There are huge numbers of commuters coming from outside the county area, as has been highlighted.  It is significant that Mr. Tony Neary from Medtronic is present.  I am sure he would prefer not to be here talking about a negative issue that is affecting not only his company but also the 6,000 employees in Parkmore Business and Technology Park, not to mention the traffic problems across the city.</p> <p>  The key issue is solutions.  We must work on short-term to medium-term solutions as well as the long-term picture.  Last year, I invited the then Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to Galway to meet local authority members and business leaders in the Parkmore area with regard to setting out timeframes, targets and actions for the short, medium and long terms.  That happened and there was good progress at the time, but it went off the boil over the last few months.  One can hear today the sense of frustration with the lack of movement.  Funding is not the issue, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong.  We were told that last year.  It is about setting out targets and timeframes and having a plan of action.  Does the city manager need a project manager?  What are the stumbling blocks to progressing this?  I realise there are planning issues, CPOs and so forth.  We should lay them out on the public record.  Are more resources required from the Department?  What is needed to assist the county manager?  The plans and solutions exist.  I hear this constantly from the multinationals.  However, there is a great sense of frustration that they have the solutions and they are willing to work and even invest with regard to funding, but the push or drive is not there.  If it is the case that more resources and a project manager are required to drive this, that must happen.  The elected representatives would be willing to assist in that regard.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Coll about laying out the short-term picture.  He said there must be parallel solutions.  There are many small items.  They will not be the silver bullet solution, and none of us is saying that.  However, there is definitely a lack of progress in pushing this agenda not just for Parkmore but across the city.  We need a public integrated transport system and park and ride facilities to be identified north, south, east and west of the city centre.  Can both the county manager and city manager explain the current position with regard to identifying park and ride sites?  We need those sites and, as my colleague mentioned, the bus routes and lanes so people are not sitting in traffic.  If they are in a bus, they will be on a designated bus lane.  What is the position with that?  What are the stumbling blocks to progressing it?  These are the solutions, and that is what we need to emerge from this meeting.  Yes, the outer city bypass is extremely important but that will take at least ten years.  If it is less, that would be great and I will stand corrected.  However, we cannot sit on our hands until then.  We must have the parallel process taking place on the short-term and medium-term solutions.  Integrated public transport and park and ride sites will be key to that.  There is a great willingness on the part of the multinationals to work with everybody.  If a project manager is needed, the witness should say that now.  This is the time to do so.  As I understand it, funding is not the issue.  It is a lack of leadership in dealing with our traffic problems.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question.  I am not a native of Galway, but one of the solutions must be about future planning.  Will there be a higher density of housing?  Will you increase development contributions in certain parts, perhaps to encourage people to develop where you want them to do so?  There is the issue of going up rather than out and the question of areas that might require redevelopment.  I do not know if you have a plan regarding what areas you want to develop first.  However, the day is long gone where people can live where they wish in terms of spread out cities and towns.  We have to be far more cognitive of the issues that cause the type of congestion being experienced.</p> <p>  Who wishes to speak first?

The first question was about the relationship between ourselves and the city and county councils.  We have a very good working relationship with both authorities.  We probably deal more with the city council because most of our activity is focused on the city centre.  We have had some engagement collaboratively with the county council as well, but we would deal with Brendan McGrath's officials in the city council on a weekly basis on the various schemes.  It is a tight working relationship.</p> <p>  With regard to the engagement level with businesses, we have had some engagement but the local authorities can answer that more clearly than us.  They would have the first hand engagement in most cases.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if we have short-tem, medium-term and long-term ambitions to deliver the transport strategy for Galway.  As was said by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, we believe that is the overall solution to the problem in Galway.  In page 91, the last page, a programme is set out which divides the various measures into short term, medium term and long term.  At the start of it we say that the bus and public transport system must be tackled very quickly.  That is set down as the short-term measure.  The ring road is included as a medium-term to long-term measure, but the bus priority and the traffic network through the city centre are down as key things to be started in the short term.</p> <p>  Regarding KPIs, we would build them out of this.  I do not have certain KPIs to quote to the Senator now, but they are ones that would get developed as we would start to deliver on the various projects.</p> <p>  Senator O'Mahony asked how we would respond to Mr. Coll's proposals for responding to individual bottlenecks.</p><p>We are very familiar with how to optimise traffic flow.  We do it all the time at various locations.  We do not believe it is the answer for Galway, albeit it would help.  While there is no doubt that certain things can be improved, it is often the case that when one improves one thing, it is at the expense of something else.  For instance, to improve the movement through a junction, one may have to ban a left or right turn.  There are things that can be done to improve junctions and the flow of traffic, but quite often one finds that one is just moving a problem down to another place and must chase it along.  Fundamentally, one is dealing with a city with very narrow streets and too much traffic running down them as it is.  While there are things that can be done to help, it is not our view that this is the long-term solution.  What is in the transport strategy is the foundation to solve the issues.  Certainly, there are beneficial things we would not ignore that could be done.</p><p>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe asked if we had looked at traffic management and measures like this.  We have.

That is always the case.  We are all waiting for the capital plan to come out later this week.  If the funding were provided, we would like to follow the timeline we have set out on page 91 of our document.  In five years' time, we would like to see the bus network changed in Galway and bus priority in place on as many of the routes there as possible.  We would like to see the traffic system reorganised around an orbital route around the city centre.  There are various other things set out there also.  These things are not cheap and funding is therefore important.  Without that funding, we simply will not get it delivered.</p></speech>

We have to await the outcome of the national capital plan process.  When we published our plans for BusConnects in Dublin, we wanted to continue and do a BusConnects programme for Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  The detailed planning around bus infrastructure and services that follows on from the strategy would go into a BusConnects programme and we would set out the deliveries we want in terms of bus infrastructure for Galway.</p></speech>

The Galway transport strategy is subject to a lot of further detailed work but the estimated cost to deliver it as drafted is somewhere in the ballpark of &euro;250 million to &euro;300 million.  If the Oireachtas gives us &euro;300 million, we can solve and implement what is in the strategy.  The Galway transport strategy has a 20-year horizon with significant front-loading in the first ten years and a huge amount of work targeted for years one to five.  I need a guarantee of money on a multiannual basis which will permit us to put the resources in place.  The programme we are following with the NTA has been to line up the ducks on the various projects which make up the totality of the Galway transport strategy, organising and getting through the planning processes to have the fundamental heavy lifting done in so far as possible by the end of 2018.  For example, the Galway city centre transport management plan, which is one aspect of the Galway transport strategy, probably requires between 25 and 30 individual projects rolled out to make it happen.  Some are short term, some are medium term and some are long term.  Some of them cannot be implemented until the Galway city ring road is in place.  As Mr. Uinsinn Finn pointed out, the ring road is still needed even if the Galway transport strategy is implemented in full.  It is an absolute must and a <i>sine qua non</i>.<br/><br/>The city centre transport management plan involves many difficult decisions.  It is radical, innovative and requires new thinking.  It will mean changing traffic flows at junctions, changing junctions, eliminating on-street parking and providing traffic links across the city prioritising bus, cycle and pedestrian traffic within the city core.  It means approaching it in a fundamentally different way from the way things are approached now.  The real challenge will come when we put a proposal on the table to change the traffic flow on a particular street to something fundamentally different, remove on-street car parking, change one-way systems and take traffic off some streets completely, giving them over completely to cyclists and pedestrians.  There is a win-win if we succeed in implementing the Galway transport strategy as we will also succeed in fundamentally enhancing the public realm across Galway city.  We will give the city back to its citizens and we will not be prioritising the car.<br/><br/>A number of members referred to the park and ride system.  There are a number of parallel pieces here that are in progress and which can and will happen in tandem.  The park and ride network is a fundamental element but I can only go out and buy land for park and ride facilities if funding guarantees are in place.  The NTA can only give me that money if it has guarantees in turn.  We need somewhere between &euro;950 million and &euro;1 billion to solve Galway's traffic problems.  If I have that guarantee, I can, of course, have a dedicated head of traffic.  The NTA has worked exceptionally closely with us, as has TII.  The NTA has bolstered our resources, including by providing us with additional staff and, along with TII, dedicating staff within their own organisations to work on specific Galway projects.  They are funding a range of consultancies across the city working on the different elements of the project.  A great deal is happening.  However, I guarantee the committee that as soon as we put the Galway city centre management plan into the public domain, initially by way of a non-statutory consultation and thereafter through the statutory consultation process and probably a Part X process, which possibly means it going into An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will upset a lot of people, no more than with the Kirwan roundabout.  People will not be able to continue to do things the way they are being done now.  However, I can state categorically that doing nothing on traffic and transport in Galway is not an option.  Waiting <i>ad infinitum</i>to solve it is not an option either.<br/><br/>To achieve Galway's potential and allow it to act as the gateway capital to the west of Ireland and as an economic and entrepreneurial leader, leveraging the value of the world-class medical technology cluster in the city, the university, GMIT, and the hospital, we have to stop the city being choked.  People taking hours and hours to get out of work is not acceptable.  People have no guarantee as to their journey time.  One day a journey takes ten minutes whereas the next it takes an hour.  We met Mr. Tony Neary and the Parkmore group yesterday and we are absolutely conscious of the frustration of his and the other companies in Parkmore.  What is probably not recognised, however, is that the university and the hospital are equally large generators of traffic.  In fact, they probably generate more traffic than the Parkmore area.  The vast majority of journeys into Parkmore currently involve single-occupancy cars.  Mr. Finn will correct me if I am wrong, but it is of the order to 80% to 83% of those journeys.  We have to change the mindset.  We have to bring about the modal shift.<br/><br/>Nothing in the Galway transport strategy rules out a light rail system for Galway down the road.  At the moment, however, we can implement and deliver bus-based solutions if we have a guarantee of resources.  For example, if I get &euro;30 million, I can provide a bus lane on both sides of the Old Dublin Road, which links to Doughiska.  That is what we are talking about.  The Tuam Road bus corridor requires bold decisions but the only way it can work, fundamentally, probably requires us to eliminate the right turn into Ballybrit.  People will not like me saying that.  People do not want to hear it.  I understand the concerns of business, but radical changes in thinking are required to deliver these solutions.  We now have the strategy in place.</p><p>A hell of a lot of work went in.  It is based on evidence and facts.  The various organisations such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the city council and the county council have signed up to say this is the way forward and the solution.  I am sure Mr. Kelly will come in on this.  When the Galway city ring road is submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is hoped in April, if we end up with a legal challenge <i>&agrave; la</i>Athenry, and it is open to legal challenge, our timelines at the moment are based on a reasonable period in which the board will deal with it, so if such a challenge were to take two, three or four years, the completion date for the city ring road would not be 2024 but beyond that.<br/><br/>We have fundamentally said to our colleagues in Parkmore that the ultimate solution to Parkmore is the city ring road.  Dedicated access to the Parkmore area is provided through the city ring road, which we can outline if the committee wants.  If the city ring road could be got through planning and there was not a court challenge, we have had a discussion with TII about bringing forward the Parkmore piece as enabling works to facilitate the area.  It could be fast-tracked.  The key piece with the city ring road is getting it through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and dealing with the courts system, should the need arise.</p></speech>

I want to ask about a project manager specifically for the Parkmore area.  I agree that the bypass is needed and all of that.  It is recognised that there are measures that would improve the situation and it needs to be moved on.  There is a time lag in respect of achieving targets on time.  Does Mr. McGrath need project manager assistance?  There may be costs involved.  If that is what needs to be discussed here, this is the moment to do it.

Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked me about the personal impact of this.  I have jotted down about 20 examples but will leave it at maybe two or three.  About two years ago, an employee of ours got a phone call saying her son had been seriously injured at school and had to go for surgery.  She sat in traffic for an hour and a half in Parkmore, missed the surgery and only got to see him an hour after that.  She did not get to the event.  I had another employee who got a phone call saying her father was dying and she had to go to visit him.  Thankfully, she got there before he passed away.  Those are the types of stories that happen every day.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact it has on employees, a couple of years ago we spent a lot of effort in hiring a pharmaceutical expert.  She lived on the other side of Athlone and decided not to relocate.  I was worried about our ability to retain her, so a few months after she was hired I met her to see how things were going.  We talked mainly about what work was like, but at the end of it I asked her about the commute.  Her line to me was, "by the time I get to Briarhill I am halfway home".  For anyone who does not know Galway, Briarhill is less than a mile from Parkmore.</p> <p>  I could even tell my own personal stories.  Every morning I drop my kids to Oranmore to school before I go to work.  I travel from Oranmore to Parkmore, which is about three miles.  About two weeks before Christmas there was a medtech board meeting in Limerick in the Radisson Hotel.  I am a member of the medtech board of Ireland.  After dropping the kids at Oranmore, I was in the Radisson Hotel in Limerick ten minutes before I would have got to Parkmore.  Yesterday morning I left my house, which is just off the Coast Road, travelled to the roundabout at the Galway Clinic and went from there up to Parkmore, a total journey of two miles.  I left at 6.20 a.m. and got to Parkmore at 7.25 a.m.  That is an hour and five minutes for two miles.  That is the impact of the situation.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Mahony asked what the solutions are.  Our job is to make sure that we compete as the best in the world and we make sure we have experts in the various areas.  I am not a traffic expert and am not here to provide the solutions.  The people who are responsible need to do that.  It is not my job to tell everybody how to manage traffic because I do not know.  I am here to say that this has a very real impact in terms of both industry and people's lives.  We should start thinking as the best in the world in this respect as well.  That is what makes industry succeed and it is what is needed to make Galway and Ireland succeed as well from an overall infrastructure point of view.  There is no secret to success for industry.  Certainly Medtronic has no secret to success other than that we put a huge emphasis on recruiting the best talent and then developing it.  To be able to ensure our people's continued success, we need to be sure we have an infrastructure that allows them to succeed as well.</p> <p>  The second part of the question was whether it has hampered expansion.  Again, our only secret to success is in terms of our people.  If people's experience in work is diminished hugely by their transport to and from work, then that does hamper development.  I do not want to speculate about numbers or whether we would be bigger without this.  What I will suggest is that, overall, the secret to success is getting the right people and making sure they have an environment where they are engaged to deliver results.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the question about where people come from.  He quoted the statistic that 46% come from County Galway.  I believe that figure is accurate but I do not have the numbers with me.  With regard to the Parkmore estate, Medtronic is so large we are a reflection of the entire community.  Our people come from everywhere, including Galway city centre, the Connemara area, east, south and north Galway, and from neighbouring counties.  We are reflective of the community we come from.  That is where the people come from.  They come from all around.  I believe 46% coming from outside the city is a reasonably accurate figure.</p><p> Deputy Rabbitte asked how long it has taken for the new slip road to start construction.  I have had many jobs in the medical device industry and I have worked in my current job for just over four years.  There was plenty of discussion on traffic before I took over this job and I have been actively talking about traffic for four years at least.  This is the first time we have had construction work begin to alleviate the traffic.  There have been many other discussions about exit lanes.  In terms of specific delays, we certainly had hoped it would have commenced a year ago or certainly many months ago.  It has started now and that has to be welcomed.  It will improve the situation.</p><p> If one looks at the world we live in, in Medtronic, of our 3,000 people, probably fewer than a couple of hundred are working on something that existed five years ago.  In 2024, which is the at-best case for the ring road being built, only a tiny fraction of what we have will still exist then.  We have to change constantly.  Our ability to succeed is on different timelines from this.  I find it frustrating that the only thing I have thought about consistently for four years is traffic.</p><p> I am not a traffic management expert but all I can say is that if one asks people working in Parkmore, they will say the best way to get in and out of Parkmore is to go there when the Galway Races are on.</p><p> I have covered most of Deputy Naughton's questions.  I do not want to talk about traffic, I would love to have been invited here to talk about some other topic.  That is why I feel so passionately about it.  From an industry point of view, particularly a medtech industry point of view, we have made massive advances as a country - and Galway as an area - in transforming health care around the world.  We should have the same ambition for our infrastructure to allow our people to succeed.</p></speech>

Specifically on this issue, it is important that those who are responsible determine exactly how it should be organised.  My experience in industry certainly suggests it is important to have accountability and have clear leadership for specific projects.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath made a point about 80% of cars being single user cars.  I have no reason to doubt it.  It is probably a fair statistic.  I would not call it a perk of my job, but a reality of my job is that I travel all over the world and visit cities everywhere.  How one commutes in cities depends on the infrastructure of the city.  There are certain areas where one absolutely has to hire a car.  I regularly visit Zurich and I would never consider getting a car there because there are much better modes of transport.  People will use the infrastructure that is available to them, so telling people they cannot drive their cars is not the answer.  If the infrastructure is there to encourage people not to drive their cars, then they will not drive them.  That is my experience having travelled in many cities around the world.  That is what works.  I do not feel in a position to lecture people and tell them they cannot drive their own cars.  If the infrastructure is there, people will use it, in my experience.</p></speech>

In that way, we will get everybody in.  I am conscious of other demands on people.  There are party meetings and things like that.</p></speech>

We talk about modal shifts and things being long-term.  We heard Mr. Neary talk about metrics and accountability.  We cannot improve what we cannot measure.  We have no measurement of traffic in Ireland today and we do not know if things are easing, slow, bad or heavy.  We need to get a metric in place.  If we are talking about journey times on key routes, that would be a success because it would drive changing behaviour.</p> <p>  Let us look at modal shifts.  The 1986 census showed that 46% of people travelled to work in their cars.  In 2016, 65% travelled to work in their cars.  We are now saying that we will miraculously reverse that trend over the next 20 years and shift everyone back again.  I support the initiatives but the data do not show that.  That is what I am talking about today.  Another example is incentivising people to share cars.  The Seamus Quirke Road in Galway is a 2 km stretch of road that cost us &euro;15 million or more to build.  It took nine years from when planning was granted.  Currently its bus lane does not allow carpooling.  There have been decisions made at Galway City Council and there was a vote not to open it to carpooling.  Was the decision driven by opinion or data?  We can only conclude it was driven by opinion because we do not have data.</p> <p>  The only way we could identify whether carpools will work on that lane is to baseline the data.  What is the journey time from Threadneedle Road to Tuam Road?  Currently the free-flow time on that route is nine minutes, driving legally at 6 o'clock in the morning.  The evening traffic time is about 45 minutes, which is a 500% increase.  It should be somebody's job to get it from 45 minutes to nine minutes.  We may never get to nine minutes but perhaps we will reduce it to a 200% increase.  One of the things we could do is baseline it.  We know what it takes today and we can have much more real-time data.  We could open it up for two weeks to carpooling because a lot of people drive that route.  If 50% of people who drive that route decide to drive around to their friend's houses and pick those people up, there would be half the number of cars on the route.  We could also continue the bus lane.  There are seven buses an hour scheduled on that route.  That is what we keep it open for.  There are two lanes going the whole way out to Parkmore but we do not have bus lanes out there because the buses do not go across the bridges.  That could be considered.  We want to use the data, technology and tools to make data-driven decisions.  That way we will know they are the right decisions.</p></speech>

It has made some very good interventions.  An example is the junction at the top of Threadneedle Road.  The council changed the light sequence there and eliminated right turns.  It affects me negatively but people in Barna say it has free-flowed the route into town.  We have no data to support that so people could be of the opinion that the council has done nothing.  Data can support the council in making these decisions and show evidence of the positive initiatives and interventions it is making.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh agus leis an gcoiste as ucht an seisi&uacute;n seo a eagr&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tuillte.  Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh i nGaillimh m&eacute;.

I will make a few observations and then I will ask a few questions.  During my 17 years an outer bypass was built on a cul-de-sac.  Whatever about one's view of an outer bypass or a ring road, my difficulty was that no solutions were put forward because all of the eggs went into one basket and therein built up a problem.  Another problem was the management structure but that is not a reflection on management.  During my first 13 years working on a local authority we had seven city managers, either acting or permanent.  Such a structure does not lead to long-term solutions.  When the outer bypass was put down a cul-de-sac the next effort was to get another road.  The Arrow Road Construction Company was brought in to look at that road.  Public transport was put on the road and not the other way around.  In an ideal world I would have loved the company to have declared it had a major problem due to Galway being a fantastic medieval city, that it also had serious climate change responsibilities and seek to come up with solutions in the next few years.  </p><p> I shall make a final observation.  I spent almost two days attending an oral hearing on the Seamus Quirke Road in Galway and, subsequently, I was accused by a certain person of delaying the road.  My efforts, and that of Councillor Colette Connolly, were to ensure that four roundabouts were not located on a road that spanned over 1 km.  The exact distance has been mentioned.  </p></speech>

That was the type of engineering solution put forward.  I spent my time making sure the flyover and two extra roundabouts were not erected.  Ironically, the management has adopted a policy of removing roundabouts over the past number of years.</p> <p>  My questions will be on the national planning framework, which will be published next Friday.  It is unfortunate that the framework will not be discussed in the D&aacute;il.  I have read the framework and noted terms like "sustainability" and "place-making".  The framework has identified Galway city is one of five cities that have been picked to grow more than 50% of its present population.  In addition, 50% of development must take place on sites in the inner city.</p> <p>  Light rail was ruled out as an option without proper analysis, in my opinion.  Light rail was ruled out on the basis that the city was not going to grow that big and, therefore, there would not be the same demand for development on 50% of the city which will now, if we comply with the framework, lead to further population.  Also, our climate change obligations have increased utterly.  Neither Mr. McGrath, Mr. Kelly nor Ms Graham have talked about our climate change obligations.  They did not mention what has been done to future proof our roads and transport solutions in terms of climate change legislation.</p> <p>  In 2005, I had the privilege of being elected mayor of Galway.  At that time all of the councillors unanimously voted to add park and ride facilities in the city's development plan and against the then management's advice who said it was unnecessary and premature.  We included park and ride facilities in the development plan that covered east and west of the city.  Time has elapsed and it is now 2018 yet the objectives were never complied with and people have allowed traffic congestion to build up.  I appreciate that we all want more development in Galway but it must be sustainable.  My specific questions have been asked already.  Why was a park and ride scheme not rolled out?  When will it be rolled out?  What applications were made for funding to provide park and ride facilities on the east and west of the city since the initiative was first mooted in 2005?  </p> <p>  I shall now discuss the master plan for the city in terms of sustainable development and transport.  I am open to correction but I believe that Ceannt railway station is comprised of between 12 and 14 acres of prime land that is located in the middle of the city.  I ask one of the witnesses to confirm how big the dock area is in acres.  These are public lands and we also have private lands.  Unfortunately, there is no master plan to develop that land in terms of transport.  </p> <p>  Earlier the manager gave an example of a planning application that is pending.  The private land was sold off by the docks and port company.   The planning application is for office accommodation for 2,700 people and some accommodation for students who come from abroad.  I mention this project not to criticise but to say that the plan that we will publish on Friday has sustainability written into it yet that is not happening on the ground.</p> <p>  What is happening with the park and ride option?  The last time I checked there were 30 schools located in the city within a small radius.  Just recently I have ceased having to drive my children to school and putting an idiotic car on the road in order to drive my children from the Claddagh area up to a scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, a distance of less than a mile and a half.  I had no choice but to undertake that drive as it was the only way to get my children to the school and similar situations are repeated all over Galway.  We need a living and vibrant city and it is great that the city has 30 schools where students are taught in Irish and English.  Is cathair dh&aacute;theangach &iacute;.  We need to reduce school traffic.  It has been repeatedly identified that peak traffic is a problem, which is substantially contributed to by schools.  What is the solution?  </p> <p>  I have had the privilege of travelling abroad and know that transport mobility plans for each big industry was a major factor.  I ask Mr. Neary to comment.  </p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.  I shall now refer to the contribution made by Mr. Coll.  I was frightened by one of his comments when he said: "a recent initiative in Boston showed an 18% reduction in traffic congestion using these new techniques.  Coincidentally, this is estimated to be the same approximate reduction in overall travel time for the Galway transport network following the completion of the N6 outer bypass."  He went on to say that is the estimated change that will happen as a result of 16.5 km being built at a cost of over &euro;30 million per kilometre.  That solution will lead to huge trouble and will not reduce traffic congestion.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has mentioned Oranmore, Athenry and a train service.  Has the frequency of trains in the area increased?  Can we use what already exists as a commuter service?  </p></speech>

My first two questions are for Ms Graham from the National Transport Authority.  It is fine to have a national planning framework that spans the next 20 years.  Are there immediate plans to provide a light rail service around Galway?  Are there plans to bolster the bus service?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGrath and Mr. Kelly for their presentations.  I understand they consulted each other about getting a road built to Parkmore.  Let us call a spade a spade here after the debacle that took place in Athenry where people objected to a planning application.  Realistically, we are more than likely going to encounter people again that will want to object.  In my opinion, the outer ring road is probably ten years away, which is not good for Galway and will not tackle the current traffic crisis.  I can travel to Dublin quicker than travel the shorter distance of 43 miles to the offices of Galway County Council, which is a frightening reality.  Where are we with solving the lane issue mentioned by Mr. Neary?  There are other plans afoot.  Is another road that has been estimated to cost &euro;5 million being considered?</p> <p>  In terms of a park and ride scheme, we have the airport site.  I wonder, no more than other Deputies, what is happening with the park and ride schemes.  </p> <p>  The hospital has been mentioned.  Is there joined-up thinking between the National Transport Authority, both councils and the HSE on plans, if any, for the hospital to be moved to Merlin Park?  Deputy Naughton has raised the issue on several occasions.</p><p>What can we do quickly to deal with this?  I know that businesspeople, especially those in large companies in Galway, cannot say it, but the traffic chaos is preventing companies from investing and coming to the west.  While there is no magic bullet to solve the problem in Galway city overnight, can efforts be made to deal with quick fixes?</p><p> It is predicted that the population of Galway will grow by 45,000 people in the next 20 years, which means that 18,000 housing units will be needed.  While I hope we will be able to have high rise developments around the CIE depot in the city, where else will we fit that number of units?  If a city is in chaos, should we not study the existing problems and solve them, rather than engaging in another fire-fighting exercise later?</p></speech>

It is crucially important that we have this debate.  Galway is suffering on two fronts.  It is losing business and shoppers.  People are no longer going into the city to do their shopping.  With the opening of the new motorway, they are going further afield.  No doubt, Galway Bay FM will cover this meeting, featuring soundbites from it, to which those stuck in traffic this evening in Galway will listen.  All they want to know are the short-term solutions and timeframes in which the works will be done.</p> <p>  I work in Parkmore and receive calls from people concerning traffic congestion around it.  Yesterday morning, for example, it took 37 minutes to get from the Ballintemple junction to the traffic lights before the business park.  The traffic is so bad I have to leave home at 7 a.m. to get into my office for 8 a.m..  Why does it take so long to get from planning to the actual works commencing?  Will Mr. Brendan McGrath and Mr. Uinsinn Finn give us a firm timeframe for when the work will be completed and people will be able to get in and out of Parkmore at a reasonable time?</p> <p>  We will not go back over the horror stories about it taking three hours to get half a mile down the road.  We all know that a happy worker is a productive worker.  A worker who gets stuck in traffic and spends the first 15 minutes in work giving out about how long his or her commute took is not a happy one.  I know Mr. Tony Neary who has a multinational business to run and Mr. Brian Coll do not want to be here discussing this issue.</p> <p>  On some occasions at the traffic lights at Briarhill I have seen one road clear with no traffic, but it still has a green light.  I was recently stuck at the Carnmore junction going into Galway on a red light.  The traffic lights for the road in front with no traffic had a green light, but I had to wait.  I timed it and it took one minute and ten seconds for it to change.  The volume of traffic which could have moved in that time would have been phenomenal.  I know that Mr. Michael Timmins worked on it at the time with Mr. Fran McEvoy.  The traffic lights at Carnmore crossroads are smart traffic lights and controlled by pads on the road.  At Carnmore Cross, coming from Monivea Road, if there is no traffic coming from town, the light will not go green but will switch to another.  It can control the traffic.  It would be a huge help if smart traffic lights could be installed at Briarhill.  There is a state-of-the-art traffic control room in Galway City Council, but, unfortunately, it is not manned.  If there are backlogs in particular areas, why can the lights not be synchronised to move traffic?</p> <p>  Is funding a hold-up in having projects approved for Galway City Council?  Is the council actually waiting for approval from the National Transport Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland or the Department to move projects forward?  If it is the case, what projects are being held up by requiring approval or funding?</p> <p>  Members said all of the eggs were in the one basket, namely, the ring road.  I could be dead and buried before it is built.  It was said by some delegates that parts of the Galway city outer ring road project would solve the problem at Parkmore.  I have looked at the ring road proposal and there are sections of back roads.  Why can they not be built now?  Why can we not go ahead with those sections and get traffic onto the Tuam Toad, instead of waiting for the whole picture of the Galway inner ring road to be presented?  Why cannot it be done in stages?  Can Galway County Council examine developing various stages of it now?  If permission for the ring road is refused, will all of the proposed new roads to service Parkmore and other parts of the city be thrown out of the pram with the toys?  We need to look at building the road in stages.</p> <p>  I have tabled parliamentary questions about park and ride facilities, as well as raising the issue in the D&aacute;il.  I have discussed with the city manager and Mr. Uinsinn Finn why the Galway Airport site is not used for this facility.  The NTA claimed that it was too far out.  When it was tried before, nobody used it.  Why did nobody use it?  It was because the park and ride bus service was also stuck in traffic.  Who will use such a facility if the bus service is going to be stuck in traffic?  The answer is nobody.  The only way a park and ride facilitiy will work is if buses actually pass through every 15 minutes.</p> <p>  There was a proposal to locate the park and ride facility in Doughiska on residentially zoned land.  We are crying out for homes to be built for people in Galway, but there is a proposal to locate a park and ride facility in Doughiska which is practically in the city and one mile from Parkmore.  That is a crazy proposal.  We should look at situating it at Galway Airport, particularly when one considers the number of people coming from the east side of the city.  There is Junction 19 on the M6 and the Rathmorrissy intersection.  In two turns, one is at Galway Airport where there are 125 acres of land.  A proper bus corridor from the site could solve many problems at Parkmore.  Will Ms Anne Graham explain why the Galway Airport site has been dismissed?  I want a feasibility study to be carried.  One does locate a park and ride facility in the middle of a city.</p> <p>  What discussions has Galway County Council had with IDA Ireland on providing infrastructure in the county?  I tabled a parliamentary question yesterday on the available lands in the IDA Ireland portfolio in Galway.  Tuam Business Park has 1.47 ha of land, Ballinasloe Business and Technology Park has 8.8 ha of land; Tuam Science and Technology Park has 9.92 ha of land; Parkmore Business and Technology Park has 26.75 ha of land; Oranmore Science and Technology Park has 26.78 ha of land; while in Athenry there is 92.43 ha of land available.  Why is IDA Ireland not locating industries at these locations?  Why do we have to bring everybody into the city?  There are motorways between Tuam, Ballinasloe, Gort and Shannon, while there is a huge intersection at Rathmorrissy which services Oranmore and Athenry.  In the United States and elsewhere in Europe there is forward planning.  Why is Galway suffering?  This issue dates back many moons to the delegates&rsquo; predecessors when there was no forward planning.  Parkmore was developed 35 years ago, but there is the same road in and out of the business park.  Why were roads not planned to come out onto the Tuam Road or the Monivea Road?  We are suffering owing to lack of forward planning.</p><p>We should pick IDA Ireland sites at Oranmore and Athenry and provide the roads infrastructure.  Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh should ask Mr. Martin Shanahan to address the committee on what IDA Ireland is doing to solve the traffic problems in Galway.  A number of units were built at Parkmore by public private partnerships for leasing to IDA Ireland which then aimed to bring in industry, but it could not get people to come there.  Therefore, why is it still building there?  We have lost industry to Limerick.  Over 600 jobs were supposed to come to Galway but did not on account of the traffic problems.  I received a telephone call from the managing director of a factory in Galway.  The top person had flown in from the United States, but he was stuck in traffic and late for a meeting.  He had to get a Garda escort to get him there on time.  We have to work on the issue of forward planning.  I ask Mr. Finn and Mr. McGrath to tell people who will be listening to this debate in their cars this evening when there will be progress at Parkmore and in other parts of the city.  It is frustrating for the and Galway is suffering.  This will continue to be the case until we see progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.1019" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#Q00200"><p>We should grasp a few things from this meeting.  Mr. Brian Coll made suggestions on easy things that could be done to help traffic flow in Galway.  I call on the National Transport Authority to collaborate with him to see if we can make Galway a pilot project in introducing Waze immediately.  It would be something positive to come from this discussion.</p> <p>  Everybody has a gripe, but we should not talk ourselves out of attracting industry.  IDA Ireland is a victim of its own success, but it has a responsibility when building parks.  I remember building at Parkmore when I worked in the private sector in construction.  We built a lot of the factories, including some stuff for Medtronic, but nobody had the vision to assess capacity and provide for infrastructure-led development to maximise it.  IDA Ireland needs to look at how it designs parks and the width of carriageways has to change.  On the other side of the road the carriageways are all single-lane.  Local authorities also have to future proof the developments IDA Ireland business parks.  We have proved that we can get the numbers and create the best products in the world and need to design our infrastructure to match it.</p> <p>  Little things can make a big difference.  I believe a commuter rail service would make a difference to Galway.  The clearest artery from Tuam and Claremorris into Eyre Square is the railway line, but there is no rail service in those places.  There are 13 acres of land in Tuam which could be developed into a transport hub, with park and ride facilities and private bus services to take people into Galway every day.  Those who car-pool should also be allowed to use bus lanes.  We should try it for a month or six weeks to see how it would changes people's habits.  We would not have to spend millions in doing so.</p> <p>  Galway City Council and Galway County Council own Galway Airport.  A park and ride facility could be provided, but bus lanes are needed on the ring road around the city.  It baffles me why buses do not travel over the Quincentennial bridge to create a loop.  It would not cost money to do it, although a line might need to be painted on the road.  There is also space in the area from the airport to Parkmore, up to GMIT, across to the city centre, out to the hospital and the university and back out over the bridge.  There has been talk of the provision of a bus lane from Claregalway to the city, but there are issues with the last leg of the route and some businesses are not happy with it.  Bus operators do not need to have the bus lane right into the city, but if there was one as far as Leader's shop, they could come back out.  It works in Claregalway village, where there is no bus lane through the village.  These are small things that would not cost money, but they would take away the frustrating delays.  We need to change the mindset where we do nothing until we have it all right.</p> <p>  I was in China last year for St. Patrick's Day.  I was in a train station where 14 platforms had been built, even though only one was in operation.  They had been built for the future.  While I am not saying we should build 14 in Galway, we should build on the basis of the projections up to 2040.  A project manager is required to manage traffic at Parkmore in order that there would be no distraction and it could be dealt with successfully.  Everybody wants to do something and to do it right, but there are some quick fixes.  The most important for me is getting Waze into Galway as a pilot project in order that we can become the leader in it in this country.</p></speech>

We spoke about the predecessor of the Galway city ring road, the Galway city outer bypass, and the difficulties it ran into.  The project could have been built in 2011, but we are a long way from it now.  On a smaller scale, we spoke about the project that got under way this week to provide a left-hand turning lane out of Parkmore.  A previous version, granted permission by Galway County Council, was taken to An Bord Plean&aacute;la where it was refused.  It is not the case that nothing is being done.</p></speech>

There are standards for every development, as well as land ownership and environmental issues.</p><p>It takes time to get those projects through and the outcome is uncertain.</p><p> In respect of issues of rail to some of the other towns, there are good examples of collaboration with Irish Rail.  For example, there is the development of the Garraun rail station in conjunction with Galway County Council with regard to the parking area required for it.  There are a number of locations in the county with rail stations, including villages like Ardrahan, Craughwell and Athenry.  Looking to the future, there are deficiencies with respect to wastewater treatment facilities at all those locations.  Despite the fact that the rail services could take some pressure from the city, they will be unable to do so without the availability of services.</p><p> With the ring road, the approach has been to try to develop an overall solution both in terms of the road and public transport elements.  If a piece was taken out, it would become a separate project and all the processes would have to be gone through separately.  At the end, one would probably be accused of project-splitting.</p></speech>

The bottom line is we are at a point where we are very close to submitting a full project that would deal with all those issues.  If we secured approval for that, elements of the project can be brought ahead and delivered more quickly in advance.</p> <p>  As for IDA Ireland lands, there have been initiatives in some locations, such as an advanced facility that was recently approved for Ballinasloe.  We have engaged on an ongoing basis with IDA Ireland and it is aware of the availability of lands.  There are lands that have seen the benefit of planning permission that have not come forward for development.  IDA Ireland has been trying to secure development of those lands and I met representatives of various enterprises with IDA Ireland in that regard over a period.  From the county's perspective, we would dearly love to see some of those lands developed, available, zoned and serviced etc.</p> <p>  The point was raised about the overall accommodation of population growth.  When we tease through the detail of the national planning framework, there will be a piece about how much development will be in the city and within the city and metropolitan area.  It is quite clear from recent decisions on strategic housing developments that there is a clear indication that the metropolitan area must deliver higher densities in the commuter belt of Barna, Moycullen etc.  In advance of the required infrastructure that we have spent the afternoon speaking about, it would be a real challenge to have additional higher densities at those locations without supporting infrastructure.</p></speech>

We did an assessment of light rail and it is included in the transport strategy.  Deputy Connolly has a different view but we tried to assess the evidence and formulated our conclusions from that.  With respect to climate change obligations, everything in the strategy is focused on assisting us in meeting climate change obligations.  We are putting in a really efficient public transport system that will bring more users to that system and that can only be beneficial from a climate change perspective.  Similarly, with cycling and walking, we are putting in decent networks.  From a sustainability perspective, a mode shift is fundamental to tackling climate change.</p> <p>  Others will be able to answer the Deputy's question as to why park-and-ride was not rolled out in the past.  It has been mentioned by several people that for park-and-ride to work successfully with a bus system there must be bus lanes and bus priority; it simply will not work otherwise.  Nobody will get out of a car and get into a bus just to be stuck in the same traffic.  We need bus infrastructure, including bus lanes and priority through the city centre, to be in place before we can successfully introduce park-and-ride.  We can put a site in tomorrow but it would not be successful because there is no priority through the city.</p></speech>

I am not saying it might not be a little better now.  We looked around the Coolagh roundabout on that side of the city.  There was a big attraction to putting a site off that roundabout if that could be achieved.  It would connect straight away to the city bus service we are putting in under that strategy.  That would mean people could hop on a bus that hopefully would be coming every ten minutes into Parkmore Estate.  More importantly, one could hop on a bus going the other direction through the city centre to the university, hospital and so on.  There were many attractions to that site as part of the overall package.  I am not saying we cannot look at the city airport again but that is why we thought the other site was better.</p> <p>  A question was asked about school transport.  With the bus system proposed in that network, we set out how many schools suddenly come within walking distance of that network.  At present, only approximately half the schools are within a walkable distance of a bus route.  Under the revised system, 93% of the secondary schools would be within ten minutes, or much less in most cases, of a bus route.  That gives the tremendous opportunity to at least explore the chance of secondary school kids being able to use bus transport to get to school.  That is in addition to the cycling network it is proposed to develop.  There has been a reasonable degree of consideration in that regard.  Those are the main points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.1034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#R01200"><p>A couple of other questions were raised.  The park-and-ride issue was raised by a number of members.  Working with the National Transport Authority, we are very keen to develop such sites in Galway and they are very much in the Galway transport strategy.  They are linked to the national climate change policy as well.  Location is vital to park-and-ride sites.  Many of us here are familiar with Galway and within a very small edge of the city, between the Oranmore coast road, the old N6 - now the R446, the M6 motorway, the Monivea Road and the Tuam Road, there is a corridor of approximately 2 km or 3 km and approximately 50% of the traffic coming to the city uses that corridor.  There are approximately 80,000 vehicles per day using the national roads in and out, with approximately 40,000 of those vehicle movements coming through that area.  It is a key priority for a park-and-ride site in that area, as it would serve the main commuter traffic in and out of the city.</p> <p>  The next element important for the location of park-and-ride sites is the perceived edge of congestion.  If a person comes into congestion and drives for ten or 15 minutes, the driver is more than likely to continue the journey.  If the point is too far out, the driver will not pull in but go on past it.  It is very important to have the location at the perceived edge of congestion.  Pricing and parking management is also very important in getting people to use park-and-ride facilities.  As people in Parkmore have free parking, it is very unlikely they will use a site where there may be an element of pricing.  If it is to be provided free of charge, there must be a grant allocation to run the service.  They are expensive to run in terms of infrastructure to be provided.  The land is provided initially before the site is constructed and then bus priority is allocated to it.</p><p>There is an infrastructural cost to that and then there is the ongoing operating cost as well.  Where it does very work very well is in terms of what we would like to see, and that is why it is very important in the Galway transport strategy, GTS.  What we are doing in the city centre, in a project that is currently at planning stage, is based on the city centre traffic management plan.  There is parking in the city centre and one pays from &euro;5 to &euro;12 to &euro;18 for day parking.  What we would love to see is that the people who are parking in the city centre might park at the park-and-ride site and get a bus service into the city that would cut 15 to 20 minutes off their journey time on a cost-neutral basis from their perspective, in that they would be paying for the park and ride on the edge of the city and getting the public transport service into the city.  The 409 service that serves Galway is extremely successful because of the priority it has coming in the Dublin Road.  We think the park-and-ride system would really work well serving the hospitals and the big employment centres within the city centre in the future.</p><p> That ties in very much as well with the modal shift, in that we must be conscious of the people who come from the county and as some members said, are reliant on the car.  They will then have the opportunity to change over into the modal shift.  When we talk about park and ride, it is not about getting people out of their car onto a bus, it is about getting out of one's car and perhaps onto a bike or walking as well.  In the GTS we have walking and cycling routes because we perceive a shift where people are starting to move over into using their bikes for certain elements of their journey.  That could involve having bike lockers at the park-and-ride sites or for people to carry a bike in their vehicle.</p><p> Parkmore has been raised on a number of occasions.  There are more than 6,000 employees in Parkmore and more than 5,000 of them are using single-occupancy vehicles.  The Galway Races is used as an example of how traffic is managed.  Those of us who went to the races 20 years ago were aware of huge traffic congestion around and one could ask why that has changed now.  There is very minimal traffic congestion connected with the races currently and that is down to the modal shift.  It is an ideal model.  I will not quote figures in case I get them wrong.  A significant number of people now go to the races by bus.  There are double-decker buses lined up in Eyre Square and various other locations to bus them out.  A lot of people also walk to the races.  There is also high occupancy in cars that do travel to the races.  Three, four and five passengers are squeezed in.  That is what we would like to see in terms of the overall context of how one can move people into more sustainable transport, going forward.</p><p> I will recap on some of the projects that have been delivered in Galway that we can perhaps forget about fairly quickly.  What is very important for Galway city at the moment is the existing N6 corridor across the city.  In recent years a lot of junction improvements have been carried out, including the removal of roundabouts and signalising the junctions, which are linked to the urban traffic control, UTC, centre in city hall.  Deputy Grealish mentioned the Carnmore junction earlier.  Those are all fibre linked and monitored systems.  With the traffic modelling and counting we have done we are getting between 15% and 30% more traffic through at each junction since they were upgraded.  The key priority for the upgrading of junctions was not just to get more traffic through them, pedestrian safety has been another factor.  Safe pedestrian crossing facilities have been provided at the junctions and at the same time traffic volumes have been increased.</p><p> In terms of serving Parkmore and the broader area, it is not that long ago when we did not have the M6 motorway linking Athlone to Galway.  Consequently, in the example given of a person leaving Parkmore who was half way home at Briarhill, if that person needed to go through Craughwell, Loughrea, Ballinasloe and all the towns along the way, they would certainly not have been half way home.  It is not long ago since the M6 opened.  The M17 and M18 motorways are now open as well.  I think that the example being given was prior to the last 12 months but a lot of improvements have been delivered in Parkmore.  We were getting continuous complaints about it taking an hour and a half to get out of Parkmore but I think Mr. Neary would agree with me that there are very few occasions now when there are any significant delays such as was the case previously.  I do not want to put a number on it but apart from one or two bad days, the traffic currently is being managed.  We cannot rest in that regard because it is important to keep moving and to further reduce delays, as well as to look at the situation in terms of the modal shift.  It is not just about providing increased capacity into Parkmore for the single-occupancy cars but also for buses and cyclists.</p></speech>

What is the timeframe for it?  I know there are extra lanes, bus lanes, left-turning lanes and an extra slip lane coming in from the Monivea Road to bypass the bottleneck.  People want to hear about the completion date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.1037" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#S00300"><p>It was during this mid-term break last year when we started the first phase of the current programme of works, which has NTA funding.  That provided two lanes on the Parkmore Road on the approach to the Monivea junction.  It also reconfigured the Briarhill junction to provide two lanes going left.  The reason for that was based on the traffic modelling we had done as part of the work.  We saw that 80% of the traffic coming down Parkmore towards that direction was going left towards the motorway.  Two additional lanes were added with changes to the light sequencing and that has had a significant benefit in terms of people coming out of Parkmore.</p> <p>  Two other elements of work were delivered but I will not focus on them.  The next phase that is going on at present, the 1D works, is the left-turn lane coming out of the Parkmore West Estate.  Going back to the modelling that was done, we had picked up that about 39% of the people coming out were going left towards the Tuam Road and consequently the left-turn lane, which is 330 m long, will provide additional capacity for people coming out of Parkmore West who are going left to avoid being in the left-turning queue and that will certainly help them.  That work is ongoing at present and is due to be completed before the end of the Easter holidays.</p> <p>  The next element of work for which we have a commitment is the signalisation of the Tuam Road and Parkmore junction in order that the 40% of people who are turning left going down towards the Tuam Road will have a signalised junction to help them get out from the perspectives of traffic flow and safety.  We are hoping for other elements to be added in 2018 but as we do not have the budget allocations yet, I cannot give any confirmation on that.  We are, however, seeking to deliver other elements of improvements in the current programme in 2018.  We ultimately are going into what we call the more medium-term measures, which are projects that will require land, possibly by CPO, that will need to go through the planning process as well.  Again, as my colleagues in the NTA outlined, consultants have been appointed who are working on an overall strategy and that will steer us in terms of funding going forward in the next two to five years.</p></speech>

The first assurance I will give is that from an industry point of view and certainly from Medtronic's point of view, we recognise we have a responsibility and we fully intend to meet all our responsibilities.</p> <p>  The Parkmore traffic action group has been active for a number of years.  I sit on it myself and I always attend meetings, where possible, or send a delegate.  I think that is also the case for most other industries there, in that the most senior person in Parkmore is the person who is the representative on the group.</p> <p>  On initiatives such as a cycling village, in Medtronic we established a team of active cyclists to design a cycling village that would meet the needs of cyclists and we constructed and built that.  Members are more than welcome to come and see it at some stage.  In response to requests we provided drying facilities, shower facilities, secure locking, subsidised cycling gear and active cycling days where we provide repair for bicycles.  The response to that has been very positive.</p> <p>  As for car pooling, while we cannot control the road infrastructure, we could control our car parking space.  All the parking spaces adjacent to each building, which have prime access to the road network, have been dedicated to car pooling.  Consequently, anyone who wants to car pool can get a space in the best car parking locations we have.</p> <p>  The land for the new slip road has been given by both Medtronic and Merit Medical.  We have an active forum within Medtronic where people can make suggestions about transport mechanisms to and from work.  We recognise that we are part of the solution.  I assure the committee that we will play an active role and I feel I can speak for every other industry based in Parkmore in that regard as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Grealish asked a question about new office space being built.  I will not get into speculation about the usage of that but I can confirm it is being built right now.  The size is roughly 300 office spaces.  I believe it is due to come on stream in the summer.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to Deputy Canney's comments.</p><p>While I was not asked a direct question I would like to follow up by saying we need an overall strategic plan but small things can make a difference.  As Mr. Finn mentioned the improvements last year have made a difference.  When we say there were additional lanes it was movement of lanes.  We moved road markings to allow additional access out but that made a difference.  We need a long-term vision but we also need to do our day-to-day job and deliver small things every day.</p></speech>

I want to know the sequence of events to progress these measures.</p></speech>

As soon as this is developed to the point where we are all comfortable that in terms of its detail it is the right scheme it is moved to the next stage and it is a question of whether we have the funding available to put into the construction.  We hope we have but we will not know until the future funding comes.</p></speech>

The proposals need to come forward to identify these park and ride sites, east, west, north or south, wherever the NTA deems strategic.  It has the expertise.  I welcome the fact that the Coolagh location has been identified or progressed.  If the NTA feels it is the right location and will link up with the integrated public transport I would not speak out against it but I have an issue with the slow pace of identifying these sites.  Funding may be an issue but if the proposals do not come forward we cannot help the NTA get that funding.</p></speech>

The bus lane from Claregalway was opened for people who are carpooling.  We need to incentivise people to leave their cars at home.  A stick and carrot approach might help.  I would like something to come out of this meeting.  As somebody said at the very start the time for talking is over.  That is one action that could be taken.</p></speech>

Rail services are costly to provide.  We would consider it on the basis of demand and where we think demand is growing.

Our focus initially is on buses but alongside that, if we are in a position to, we put in additional rail services.  It does have an impact on the inter-city services too and that would have to be considered.</p></speech>

There is such a level of knowledge, expertise, commitment and passion that we are not going to give up until such time as we see tangible verifiable results and I hope I speak on behalf of everybody here.  I thank all my colleagues for their contributions, particularly Senator O'Mahony who worked hard with me on this from the very beginning.</p> <p>  Will the city and county managers and Mr. Creegan give us a commitment that they will investigate the Waze and work with Mr. Coll on that?</p></speech>

I would like if, through the Chair's good offices or my office, we could get a report or feedback now on the follow-up from this meeting, on what the Chairman aims to achieve in the next 12 months, where is the accountability, how much will it cost and how we will measure it.
