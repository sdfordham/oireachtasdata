A number of MEPs were not able to make it here today and we have been asked to note their apologies, including Brian Crowley, Brian Hayes, Se&aacute;n Kelly and Nessa Childers.  I met with Brian Hayes in person a few days ago and he explained to me what he is doing today.  He made it clear that he wanted to be here, but he cannot, nor can the others.  Due to Murphy's law, at approximately 3.10 p.m., I will have to vacate the Chair to go to the D&aacute;il as we have been selected for a Topical Issue debate.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and people in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  I welcome Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, Ms Deirdre Clune, MEP, Ms Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP and Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP and I thank them for taking the time to engage with the committee today.  We hope to complete this session in one hour so with the agreement of the witnesses, owing to Ms McGuinness's role as first vice president, of which we are immensely proud, I propose to allow her to make a five minute opening statement first, following which each of the other MEPs will have an opportunity to make a five minute opening statement.  We will then have a questions and answers session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>Today we are discussing the Brexit negotiations, the future of Europe, the future composition of the European Parliament following Brexit and any other issues which the MEPs and members would like to discuss.  Before we commence, I must advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <br/><br/>I now invite Ms McGuinness to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

One of my roles as first vice-president is to liaise and dialogue with national Parliaments.  I believe we need to dialogue more and to do so better.  The chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of national Parliaments meet every six months in the country that holds the Presidency.  I attend those meetings.  I understand the Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, has not yet attended.  These are meetings where engagement takes place with colleagues from other national Parliaments.</p></speech>

I sometimes think there is a little bit of tension, unnecessarily so, between national parliamentarians and Members of the European Parliament.  We are all elected by citizens and we do the same work and I think we could do it better together.  I would be interested in hearing the committee's observations in that regard.</p> <p>  On the topics for discussion, the taskforce on subsidiarity is in place.  National parliamentarians will have a role in that taskforce and the European Parliament will provide the facilities.  I hope to be involved in the work of the working group.  Specifically on the future of Europe, I am happy to see that Ireland is doing a lot on the future of Europe by way of national consultations led by the Minister with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy McEntee.  Last night, a meeting was held in County Meath, led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, with a further meeting to be held tonight in Carrick-on-Shannon.  We are doing a lot of work in Ireland on very serious issues around the future of Europe which are linked to the budgetary issues.  This came across very strongly at last night's meeting.  It is important to put on the record that every person who spoke at the meeting last night said that in light of the trend in farm incomes we need not only to hold onto the budget we have but to push for an increase in the budget for the Common Agricultural Policy.  While that might be a difficult proposal to discuss it is important to put on the record the view of the people on the ground.  </p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, we are trying to garner the UK position from various speeches that have been read into the record, including today.  While the UK has said it does not want to see the European Union weakened, with every speech, I get the opposite impression.  There is a sense from the UK side that it is going alone on the high seas, breaking off to do global trade agreements without the European Union and suggesting that it can be bigger and better without being part of the European Union.  For all its flaws, Europe has been very good at keeping people at the table.  Large and small countries have managed to work together and to do so effectively.  We are now seeing the consequences of one country deciding that it might be better off doing its own thing.  This week, a report was published, which shows the serious consequences of Brexit for Ireland.  It will be important for us in the Parliament, in terms of our making sure it fully understands the impact for Ireland. </p> <p>  Parliamentarians are working well together not only on the Irish issues but on the consequences for the European Union around its future but issues are being forgotten about, including public health and consumer protection issues.  Europe currently has in place a huge amount of rules and regulations which protect public health not only in Ireland but across the European Union.  </p> <p>  On the composition of the European Parliament, Ireland is set to gain two seats, although this has yet to be confirmed by the Council.  If that happens, all of us would like to know where and how the boundaries might be drawn to accommodate the two extra seats.  The sooner we know that the better because the elections will take place in May 2019.  The issue of transnational lists was voted down by the Parliament.  My own view is that it is an idea not to be scrapped.  It is one that could be developed in future when other matters at a European level have settled down.  </p> <p>  While our focus is on Brexit, with so much happening we also have to keep an eye to the debate about the future.  I hope that the voice from Ireland that we believe that Europe has a future but that we will have to engage differently.  In my speech to the European Parliament last week I made the point that I will miss the engagement with MEPs from the United Kingdom.  Those who worked well in the Parliament will be missed.  Their voices will be missed at the Council table and we will have to reflect that in how we do our business.   </p> <p>  While the engagement between national Parliaments and the European Parliament is working it could be better.  I am interested to hear the committee's thoughts on that engagement.  I acknowledge that everybody is busy and that the Chairman has to leave soon to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We are never in Ireland when this committee is meeting.  If we believe that Europe needs to be strengthened and reformed then I think we need to work well.  I appreciate this opportunity.</p></speech>

Brexit is consuming Parliament.  In terms of the March session, we are currently working on a resolution on what the future arrangement could or should be with the UK but we are operating in a vacuum because as everybody knows the UK does not know what it wants.  I know that the committee has held numerous hearings on the likely impacts of Brexit.  At the same time, the future of Europe is very much part of the debate in the Parliament.  Only last week the Prime Minister of Croatia was in Parliament outlining Croatia's position and the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was also there outlining issues relating to Ireland' s position.  The budget is dominating procedures today.  An announcement was made earlier today by the Commission on how the future budget of the European Union could be structured.  When the UK leaves Europe, there will be a gap in funding of approximately &euro;12 billion.  How this gap is to be filled needs to be addressed.</p><p>Is it going to be filled or is it going to be addressed by increased contributions from member states or is it going to be a combination of budgetary cuts and contributions from member states, or is it going to be completely left as a gap and the programmes cut?  This is going to be a matter for member states.  We certainly do not want to see a cut in programmes, especially those such as the CAP, but there is a lot of pressure to increase funding for security.  We are all very much aware of the security issue and the challenge is there with the fight against terrorism and ensuring that borders are protected, that information is shared among member states and that citizens are protected.  This is a challenge, along with the challenge of migration.  While we do not hear as much about the migration challenge in Ireland, dealing with migration is a real challenge for our southern European neighbours as is the contribution to Turkey and dealing with migrants there.  These are pressures on the budget.  The CAP is very important to Ireland but nonetheless the contribution has decreased to just under 40% or 38% from a level of more than 70% many years ago.  These are the challenges facing us.  I am aware that the budget will be on the agenda of the EU Council on 23 February, so I am sure we will hear about whether it will increase.  Ireland is now a net contributor but we gain substantially in our contribution under the CAP.</p><p> I will now give the committee a sense of my own work with the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism, TRAN.  We are very conscious, obviously, of the impact of Brexit on transport issues.  Next week there will be a hearing on what Brexit will mean for maritime issues and if we should be developing our short sea shipping routes.  We have already had a hearing on road transport and the implications for European consumers and for Ireland; how are we going to get across the UK and what that means if the EU has invested in road projects across the UK, how does the investment continue and how do we benefit Ireland.  Ireland does a lot of trade with the UK but we also do a substantial amount with the EU mainland.  The fastest way to the Continent is across the UK and through its very busy Dover-Calais route, which is the shortest and most efficient route.  Where do we stand on that? There is particular concern around aviation because the UK is so close to Ireland geographically.  If there is a cliff edge scenario and if the UK leaves the European Union without an aviation agreement in place we are in trouble because there is no alternative arrangement to fall back to without an European aviation agreement.  There is nothing in the World Trade Organization, WTO, guidelines that would facilitate that.  We really would need some form of arrangement in place to facilitate aviation because European airspace is supervised by the European Air Safety Agency and every EU country abides by its rules, regulations and supervision.  If the UK is no longer part of the European Union, then there will be a problem for those who cross UK airspace.  These are the kinds of issues that the TRAN committee focuses on.  We are moving forward now we are into the second phase of negotiations in terms of what will the future arrangements be and focusing on the real difficult issues relating to transport.  This gives the members a sense of the work we do.</p><p> The European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, EMPL, is also looking at the issues.  I am aware other contributors want to speak but I am happy to discuss this and to elaborate on my work in that area for the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liadh N&iacute; Riada" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#C00200"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I am sorry that I will not be able to stay for the whole meeting.  It is very important that we have a cohesive approach when we are dealing with Brexit from the national Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and from an EU perspective.  I sit on the European Parliament Committee on Budgets, BUDG, as a co-ordinator and the picture for the future is not looking good at all.  We are currently discussing the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  Commissioner Oettinger said this morning that they are looking at a 15% cut to the CAP.  This is not a big surprise but in real terms it is a cut of &euro;60 billion.  How will we shore up that gap when the cut is actually implemented?  They are also talking about cuts to cohesion policy or aid to more developed countries, of which Ireland was a beneficiary.  This cut will be about &euro;95 billion.  It seems to be cuts right across the board due to the debts we now see because of the British going out.  How are we going to shore this up?  I spoke with representatives from the European Investment Bank yesterday and they spoke of having a &euro;300 million reserve fund in place as a measure to protect us against Brexit.  I do not believe it is enough.  It is a start and it may be a step in the right direction but we need to be more creative in how we are going to use more strategically the funds that are there to help those who are most vulnerable; those in the agriculture and fisheries sector.  Fisheries seems to be very much an industry that is not being talked about.  Ireland will be providing most of the waters when the British waters are out of the equation.  Those displaced boats will be coming in to fish from Irish waters and Ireland will still be dealing with the same quota.  There are huge challenges for the fishing industry, which is already on its knees, and I do not believe it is going to improve after Brexit - not by a long shot.  We have to put absolute safeguards in place to protect and sustain our fishing industry.  The MFF is a huge worry.  Given that we will have less money, the bottom line is that we will do more, or the same, with less money or that member states will be asked to contribute more.  It is as simple as that.  These are the two options.  We must be very robust in how we deal with the MFF, particularly at Council level and with regard to Ireland's representation there so we do not suffer hugely when we see the CAP.  I am aware that Ms Anderson and Mr. Carthy will probably speak more about trade and other issues but I just wanted to give the committee a heads up from the budget perspective.  F&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; mar sin &eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Anderson" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#C00300"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to address the committee today.  I sit on three EU Parliament committees; the constitutional affairs committee, the civil liberties committee and the regional development committee.  Each committee deals primarily with the Brexit files, as do other committees.  All of us have read, line by line the joint report of 8 December.  The European Parliament, the Commission and the Council have stated that the commitments given had to be faithfully and fully implemented and brought into legal texts.  This legal text is currently being worked on.  Sinn F&eacute;in had advocated caution on the 8 December because we did not accept the assessment given to us that these were cast iron guarantees.  What has played out this week is proof positive that they were not cast iron guarantees.  We advocated caution because nobody knows better than us the British in the context of negotiations.  We know how duplicitous they can be and we know they will roll back from negotiation.  Once one decides and declares a bottom line, the next stage for the British is to negotiate downwards.  Some of the reports we have heard from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today clearly shows that this is exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  Without a doubt it is fundamentally better that we do not have any barriers North-South or east-west.  There is nothing wrong with trying to explore all that but because Theresa May is always questioned on this, she has repeatedly and categorically said that the entire territory is leaving the Single Market and the customs union.  If this is the case then we have to ensure the draft treaty, which is currently being worked on, incudes binding terms, called the back-stop option No. 3.  For example, if there is no agreement, then we would have a situation of full alignment in the North.  Some people make reference to the full alignment only in the context of North South co-operation but as the committee will be aware, having read the text, it includes North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, which is crucially important.</p> <p>  Today and yesterday we have heard reports that contingency planning is taking place in the State for a hard border.  A report came out yesterday or today around the Dublin docklands and its terminal in the context of planning for border controls.  Ms McGuinness referred to the Copenhagen report and the damage that it has outlined for the State and how growth will be affected, going down by 7%.  We are also aware that the UK's Department for Exiting the European Union has produced a report.</p><p>Mr. Chris Hazzard is a Member of Parliament.  Every MP has to go into a locked room without a phone, a pen or a pencil to see the report.  He is in it today to examine the details of that report as the British Government does not want that report out there.  We have heard information that it will result in a 12% drop in gross domestic product, GDP, for the North and we know 10% of the North's GDP comes from European funding.  We can see that 54 weeks into the process, there is infighting in the British Cabinet.  Mr. Boris Johnson is trying today to give some measure of assurance for those of us who voted to remain but he is certainly not speaking to the people of Ireland, never mind the people of the North.  We know from Mr. Barnier's comments in Europe that there is a chaotic Brexit negotiation taking place.</p><p> The European Union and the British Government knows this and I am inclined to agree with Ms McGuinness's assessment of the British Government's efforts around Brexit.  It has not left any country without leaving it in a mess.  This will come to the cliff-edge scenario and it will go over a cliff.  Britain will try to create as much damage as it can, particularly for the people of Ireland, including those North, South, east and west.  Mr. Barnier, Commissioner Hogan and others have said that if we are out of the customs union and Single Market in the North, there will be barriers, friction and borders.  That is something that the contingency planning taking place needs to apply for the island in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  The only way to secure that is a process, whether it is what is known as designated special status for the North to remain in the EU, or as An Taoiseach called it when he was in Strasbourg, special arrangements for the North to remain in the EU.  Whatever one calls it is irrelevant so long as the ingredients are the same.  That means there must be a role for the European Court of Justice.  There has been much talk of trade, barriers and all that is important.</p><p> I was thinking today and I remind everyone that I was born into a gerrymandered state 50 years ago.  Only this week we have had a report from the British Government that it intends to reintroduce gerrymandering in the North.  We can see that in the context of the Westminster elections and the report that has come from that.  Esteemed academics like Professor McCrudden, Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Mr. Colm Harvey have said that rights are only genuine if they are reinforced.  In this State there was the opportunity to hear from a senior judge in the European Court of Justice only last week, Mr. Anthony Collins.  He spoke of the first right that will be lost for the people of the North, the right to representative democracy and the right to be represented in the European Parliament.  The voice of the people of the North will be lost.  He said it is not just unsatisfactory but it is illegal.  Paragraph 53 of the joint report agreed in December indicates there were cast-iron guarantees, and it states the rights, entitlements, identity and the opportunity of the people of the North would not be lost as a consequence of the Article 50 agreement.  We must be able to exercise those rights.</p><p> Whatever about the seats being allocated - I welcome two have been allocated to this State - this is about the entitlement of the people of Ireland.  Three additional seats should be allocated to the people in the North of Ireland.  The only way to secure that is the Irish Government in Council ensuring there is a greater allocation of the seats.  The 14 seats mean a seat is lost to Ireland as an island.  As we all know, the Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, so what it has said to the people about cast-iron guarantees must be implemented in this phase and before negotiations are allowed into the second phase.  As the European Parliament and Council indicates, these must be fully and faithfully implemented.  We hope this committee will ensure the commitments given in the joint report of December 8 will be followed through so the island, North and South, east and west, can be protected from the chaos and madness that Brexit will bring to this entire Ireland, whether one is from Derry or Kerry.  We will all be damaged by it unless we come together and ensure the island can be protected.</p></speech>

It is an important facet of our work, identified earlier as something we needed to improve.  The committee has taken that on board and improved the communication.  I thank the clerk and Ms C&aacute;it Hayes, the Oireachtas representative in Brussels, who keeps us informed on key debates.  I also thank the staff of the European Parliament office in Brussels, who also ensure we are aware of the legislative developments happening in Ireland when we deal with some very similar files at a European level.  Ms Anderson and others have spoken about the Brexit position and I will not elaborate greatly on that, except to be positive where I can.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Carthy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#D00400"><p>The last time I attended this committee I was very critical of the Government's position on Brexit.  I was critical of what I considered to be a weakness of language and a commitment to protect the entire Ireland.  That changed considerably in the meantime and the Government's position improved.  It is important to note that and give credit.  We must also tell the Government and representatives in this House that this process must continue and we must remain vigilant.  The work did not stop on 8 December, when the communiqu&eacute; was agreed, and in many ways the work only started then.  What we got then was not the solution to the problems Ireland is facing as a result of Brexit but we potentially got the capacity to achieve the solution.  It will only happen, as Ms Anderson notes, if we are determined to ensure no part of our country is sacrificed.</p> <p>  We must recognise that every part of our country is threatened with economic, political and social upheaval, if the current British Government's position on Brexit and the North of Ireland.  Everybody looking at this objectively at a European level that I am aware of and internationally, including in Britain, has not found a solution to the issues pertaining to our Ireland with respect to Brexit that does not include the North of Ireland remaining as part of the customs union and Single Market.  Mr. Barnier put that very clearly in his most recent remarks.  It needs to be the stated position, in my view, of this committee, all Irish MEPs and particularly the Irish Government.</p> <p>  I will touch on the future of the EU discussions that are ongoing.  The Minister has organised consultation meetings but the entire project of discussion at an EU level may be a wasted opportunity.  Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker effectively usurped discussions before they were even started in his so-called state of the EU address.  He outlined his own position quite emphatically.  It can be described as a cursory nod towards Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and other major political upheavals, with the position of the EU doing what it always intended to only, only more quickly than originally envisaged and with less democratic oversight.  That can be clearly seen with the move towards Permanent Structure Co-operation, PESCO, and a so-called European defence.  The vote in these Houses was rushed through with zero public debate and members might ask their constituents if they are even aware of PESCO.  It is a major move with respect to Irish neutrality and it is a step away from what the EU should be doing at this time and in current political circumstances.</p><p> In my view, it should be moving towards more democracy, more accountability and more devolution to the national parliaments and not the opposite.  I believe the move towards a militaristic agenda is the exact opposite of what the EU should be doing.  It is the opposite of what the vast majority of EU citizens want to see happening.</p><p> The transnational lists proposal was part of that and shows a completely oblivious attitude to what citizens are looking for.  They are not looking for representatives to represent 27 member states all at once.  I and others present represent a constituency of 15 Irish counties.  It is very hard to remain connected and engaged with the communities I am supposed to represent despite the huge amount of effort we put in to ensure we do.  It is impossible to fathom a scenario where somebody could legitimately argue to represent people in eastern Germany or Latvia while at the same time representing the voters in Connemara, Inishowen or Carrickmacross.</p><p> Regarding PESCO and the EU budget, if we want to prevent the potential CAP cuts that the Commissioner has indicated may be coming down the line, an easy place to start would be to remove what is being proposed for the EU defence fund and ring-fence it for CAP and rural development.</p><p> Some of the important work taking place at European Parliament level, in which many members here have an interest, is the issue of corporate tax avoidance, tax evasion and money laundering.  The European Parliament is in the process of setting up another committee following on from the committee that was established on the Panama papers, called the paradise papers committee.  As Irish representatives, we need to engage on this at a number of levels.  Irrespective of whether members like it, we need to acknowledge that at an EU level and internationally Ireland has gained a reputation as a facilitator of corporate tax avoidance.</p><p> We need to address two areas.  One is the issue of tax sovereignty.  Our party and all MEPs are on record as saying we will defend to the hilt the right of national parliaments to put in place their own tax rates and policies.  The other is the issue of tax transparency and public country-by-country reporting.  The two things are not the same.  Sometimes Irish commentators argue that they are.  It is possible to have maximum tax transparency while at the same time defending tax sovereignty.</p><p> I realise that I have gone on for longer than the Chairman might have wanted.  I know there have been many debates at this committee, at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in the House about the Mercosur trade agreement.  Members need to be aware that Irish farmers - and I would argue the Irish domestic economy - are on the verge of being sold out by the European Commission which has already reportedly increased the offer on beef, for example, to 99,000 tonnes.  The Mercosur countries are looking for 200,000 tonnes.  We could, should and must now demand that the Mercosur negotiations be brought to a close.  I say this as a citizen more than anything else: we have already been treated abysmally in the way the Government has dealt with the CETA trade agreement and other trade agreements.  However, the Mercosur deal is the most immediate threat.  We should be united in calling for those negotiations to be stopped immediately on the basis that the Commission has advised us that there will be no Mercosur trade agreement without a significant offer of beef being on the table.  With the damage that will cause to Irish agriculture along with the uncertainty as a result of Brexit, that alone is a basis for us to demand that the negotiations are brought to an end.</p><p> The Irish people have repeatedly let it be known that they want to be part of the European Union.  Most recently we saw that in the vote in the North where they voted to remain.  I also believe the Irish people have given plenty of messages that they want the EU to change.  The two things are not contradictory.  I hope we can work together to ensure that all of Ireland remains part of the European Union, but that we work together to ensure it is a better and more democratic European Union.</p></speech>

I managed to follow the earlier speakers thanks to technology.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms McGuinness, MEP, that engagement between MEPs and Oireachtas Members is essential.  I have asked for this for some time.  Perhaps it could be facilitated during green week because we get enough time off.  I am delighted to see that is the case and I would like to see it happen more regularly.  There is always something happening in what we do and it directly impacts on the citizens of the country, people whom the members of the committee also represent.</p> <p>  I work on the agriculture and rural affairs committee, which is very relevant to the constituency I represent covering the midlands and the north west.  I am also on the budget control committee and am a substitute on the environment committee.  The budget control committee is a bit of bean-counter committee but it is probably the most interesting committee when one gets into it because we go through every last cent of the people's money that is spent and Ireland is a net contributor.  Given the enormity of the CAP budget and the agriculture and rural affairs budget, it is all the more important.  We are now entering into the beginning of a debate as to how this money will be divided up.</p> <p>  I am a townie and have never lived on a farm in my life but bit by bit, the penny has dropped as to why the place where I live exists; it exists because we have farmers living outside the town.  They are farmers who down the years paid people like my father to put in fitted cupboards.  They paid painters in the town to come out and paint their houses.  Those farmers and their wives went in and got haircuts.  The money was spread around.  I know how important this is.  At the moment we are talking about a development plan for Ireland and a development plan for rural Ireland; this is integral to it.</p> <p>  We are also talking about how Border areas will struggle because of Brexit.  This is also integral to that debate because if we had listened the last time to the then Commissioner Ciolo and had the deal that was done on CAP not been warped and twisted by our Government at the time, people in Leitrim would have got &euro;11 million more per year from CAP and there would have been &euro;29 million more per year for Donegal.  There would have been less for the Queen and less for Larry Goodman, but we can get over that.  We are now deciding whether we will make that same mistake again or whether we will, in the case of Leitrim, put &euro;3,000 into the pockets of every man, woman and child over the course of the next CAP deal or whether we put it into the wrong people's hands.</p> <p>  People talk about pressure on the budget - there is particular pressure on the CAP budget.  One obvious reason is Brexit because the UK is a massive net contributor.  There is another reason for pressure on the CAP budget.  The penny has dropped among many MEPs that it is going to the wrong people.  Rather than arguing that it should go to the right people, many of these people are now saying we need to cut it.  MEPs who represent urban areas come in and say this was meant to go to small farmers and was meant to make rural areas vibrant but it is not doing that.  They are talking about cutting it on that basis.  If it is cut - we will fight to ensure it is not cut - we know who to look at.  We need to look at the people who have twisted and turned what was meant to be a payment for small farmers to keep people in family farms and instead left it in the hands of ranchers.  We will do our best to ensure it is not cut.</p> <p>  When I went out there I thought I might have had a radical point of view that this money should be redistributed to small farmers.  The good news is that even the people in Fine Gael's group, the EPP, agree hook, line and sinker that the money needs to go to the small farmer.  Mr. Zeller, who is in the same group as Fine Gael, is on the budgetary control committee.  He constantly harps on about how this must change.  I am fairly definite that we will get a good deal for small farmers.  At one of the last meetings I attended, Marian Harkin made the point that we did not really succeed in the previous CAP negotiations.  I am afraid she did not give herself and the MEPs who got the good deal the credit they deserved.  The problem was that when it was brought home it was twisted and turned so that it ended up in the wrong hands.  We need to ensure that does not happen again if we want rural Ireland to survive.</p><p> Another point of great importance - Mr. Carthy and others have mentioned it - is the Mercosur deal.  We are apparently going to trade off our suckler farmers and beef industry so that our car industry can thrive.  I am sorry, but where is our car industry?  We do not have one.  We are trading off something we have for something that we will never have and something we are not going to get.  If the deal goes through, we will expect our farmers to compete.  Our farmers have to explain the origin of their produce and where exactly it has been from the moment the sperm is delivered until a consumer eats the meat on his plate.  Now, potentially, we will have to compete with people who farm on the basis that it is sufficient to know where the produce has been for the past three months.  Obviously, traceability comes with costs.  Costs reduce profitability and make it less feasible for people to farm where we come from.  We have to stop this deal.  As Mr. Carthy has said, they need beef on the table for this deal to go through.  We need to say "No more" to this deal.</p><p> I wish to comment positively on the White Paper on the future of Europe.  We are now, finally, debating it, but one would have to be concerned.  When one sets up a timetable for something, one should stick to it.  When the GAA sets up a timetable for the All-Ireland competition, it takes place when it is meant to take place.  It does not take place six months later.  GAA officials do not come along and say that they did not have to bother telling those involved that it was not going to take place for six months.  We were told in March last year by Jean-Claude Juncker that there would be a series of future of Europe debates throughout Europe between March and December and that the matter would brought to the Council and to us for discussion.  He claimed there were thousands of debates but there were not.  I looked and searched for them.  I was obsessed looking for them because I know my future and the future of my children are at stake.</p><p> Now, finally, we are having the debates and that is good.  As was said already however, we were meant to be debating five options.  However, before we got to debate them or before most people even knew there was a debate ongoing, the man who is meant to be leading us, Jean-Claude Juncker, had made up his mind already about a sixth option.</p><p> Obviously, there are some brilliant things done within Europe.  I may be a sceptic in many areas but when it comes to agriculture I am not.  Other important areas include full fiscal union, which potentially we could face and an end to our choice or ability to choose our corporation tax rate - that could be gone.  We need a proper debate on that and we need to look at it.</p><p> We certainly need to look at defence.  At the moment we are being railroaded down the road of something that is described by Federica Mogherini not as a European army but something even more ambitious.  We now have socialists standing up in the European Parliament saying this should become our most important project.  Food security is our most important project and it has to stay that way but we are pushing in the opposite direction.  The Commissioner, Ms Federica Mogherini, continuously cites opinion polls in Europe suggesting support for going further into a European army-type system.  If one looks for the information on the matter - at the same meetings where she talks about being open and transparent - one cannot find out what the results were for Ireland even though Ms Mogherini and the Commission have claimed we are all supportive of it.  Maybe we are or maybe we are not.  Certainly, I am not and I would like to know what the answer to that question is but we cannot find it.  Earlier, I said that I am sceptical in certain areas.  If we ask a question of the European Commission on agriculture, we get an answer.  If we ask a question of Federica Mogherini, we do not get an answer.</p><p> We now have a high-level committee on fake news in the European Union.  MEPs have a right to find out how the process is organised and how the appointments to these committees take place.  I have a serious problem with the person appointed from Ireland.  Committee members can find out for themselves who the person appointed from Ireland is - the information is publically available.  I have attempted to find out how this process took place with the relevant Commissioner and Commission office.  I have looked for an opportunity to express concern over who was appointed.  We have not even got an answer.  That is what I am at in the European Union and there is far more of it.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

We will now go to our members.  I know our members will keep it as concise as possible &ndash; we are over-running our time a little.  I call Deputy Durkan.  During your contribution, Deputy Durkan, we will change over in the Chair, as I explained.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#F00300"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their dissertation.  It is an interesting exchange of views at an interesting time.  As we know, Europe is inhaling at the moment.  We have to wait for it to exhale and we do not know what the outcome will be.  We do not know whether Brexit will lead to the destruction of Europe.  It could, in that it could undermine the whole structure of Europe.  The UK could be the first of others to go.  I strongly advise all and sundry that such an outcome would not be in the interests of this country, Europe, Britain, ironically, or the globe.</p> <p>  We should all recognise that those present are totally committed to the Irish economic entity on the island of Ireland.  We have set that down from the beginning and there will be no watering down of that.  It is injudicious to suggest from time to time that we do not believe what people say.  If a person does not believe what another says to him, presumably, the person is expecting the comment to become a self-fulfilling prophesy and, as a result, there is no use having negotiations.</p> <p>  It is of the utmost importance that we maintain the stance we have had from the beginning, that is to say, the question as set down by the European negotiators and the Government at the beginning of the year and that we maintain it without variation.  Of course, people will decide from time to time that we have reason not to believe it.  If we sow that into the ether, then it becomes part of what the defence will use, the defence being the UK authorities.  They will say the people did not believe them and will ask what one would expect.  Then they will row away from it so they do not have to achieve any agreement.</p> <p>  The Single Market and customs union are of the utmost importance.  We are operating as an island nation and that is the way the European negotiators have stated it will be.  That is the way the British Government negotiators reluctantly admitted that it would be or how they hoped it would be but they then cast doubts upon the water, throwing bread upon the water, as it were, to try to undermine it.  Of course they are going to do that - that is their negotiating position.  Anyway, they must remember one thing: they decided to leave the European Union.  They did not seek approval from anyone else.  We, they and everyone else in the European Union are part of the Union.  We all agreed to it.  Several treaties were entered into incorporating what we have now as the European Union.  We have a commitment to it.</p></speech>

Nigel Farage is known for many things but being a supporter of the European Union is not one of them.  By his own admission, he spent 18 years working to undermine it.  Interestingly - and it is symbolic of what has happened thus far - at the end of the day, when he was asked what would happen and what would replace what he had undermined, he did not know.  None of the Brexiteers at the time or since has known either.  They have shown no indication that they knew anything or had any alternative in mind.  They had not and that is sad.  It is easy to knock down something in place.  It is easy to wreck and destroy.  It is not so easy to come up with the alternatives.  It is always easy to throw away something but to put it together again and restructure it is not so easy.</p> <p>  We need to reiterate emphatically again and again that we stand for what we have said.  We need to stand over the interdependence of North and South on the island.  The Single Market and the single entity must remain.  Acting to the contrary will do irreparable economic damage to Northern Ireland and the South and, ultimately, to the European Union and the UK as well.

Regardless of politics, we have to be strongly supportive of that stance.  If we move away from it, we are in serious trouble.</p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the situation of Irish fishing.  There will be a problem in that sector and with the Common Agricultural Policy as well.  They will be resolved.  The CAP problem has to be resolved.  There is a big population in Europe amounting to 500 million people and they have to eat.</p><p>If somebody decides to trade that off against a car, people cannot eat the car no matter how hungry they are.  That should not be done.</p><p> The security issue needs to be dealt with.  We have become more dependent on our neighbours for security as time has passed and we cannot have it both ways.  We need to enable our Defence Forces to be upgraded and trained in line with the best available in Europe, which would not be a breach of our neutrality.  Alternatively, will we rely on the British Government to come to our aid in the case of a terrorist attack?  I would not be happy about that.  We need to recognise that, unfortunately, for security reasons, we need to upgrade our Defence Forces in order that they can understand their colleagues in Europe in the event of a security breach.</p><p> The stance adopted by the Taoiseach and Mr. Barnier in respect of the Border still stands and we should not presume that there will be any backing off from that.  If we do back away from it, we will have made a serious negotiating error.</p><p> On the urban-rural divide, people tend to support their own bailiwicks.  As matters progress, there is a great need for all European politicians to represent the people of Europe and not one sector against another, one village against the next or one country against another.  They need to provide universal representation.  We are either a European Union or we are not.  If we want to go in different directions, we can do that but it will be at our own cost.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G00900"><p>I will be as brief as possible because we do not want to keep the European Ombudsman waiting.  We are anxious to hear what she has to say.  I thank the MEPs for attending.  We will not get to have an exchange of views because we have had a series of statements.  The committee needs to work on that for the future.</p> <p>  I will not address Brexit because it was dealt with by previous speakers.  The committee has considered the future of Europe.  We had a series of meetings and we are finalising a report.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, has conducted a public consultation process.  While something is happening, we all have to make a greater effort to engage with citizens regarding the future direction of Europe.  Many politicians have made statements.  President Macron and Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker have outlined their visions and the European Commission has put forward a series of options.  From the point of view of balance, the EU is either a union of sovereign nation states or a federal united states of Europe.  That covers a wide spectrum and we need to be tuned in to that debate.  Most Irish people see it as a union of sovereign nation states but there is a move towards more integration.  The Franco-German axis is reappearing, which is a threat to smaller nation states.  These are fundamental issues about which we need to be conscious.</p> <p>  I have a question but the MEPs will not have an opportunity to answer it.   The UK is leaving, regrettably.  It was an ally on many of the key issues that Ireland faces in the EU, including the CAP, tax sovereignty, corporation tax rates, immigration and mandatory quotas, security and defence, Cohesion Funds, and the principle of subsidiarity.  Cohesion Funds are important for central and eastern European member states and, therefore, we need to forge new alliances on theses issues now that the UK is going.  I will not get a response to that but I have no doubt that our MEPs will take up the challenge in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1420" speakername="Paul Coghlan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G01000"><p>I thank the MEPs for their interesting commentaries.  The previous speaker did not want discuss Brexit but it is dominating all our thoughts, regardless whether we like it.  I cannot fathom that Britain would countenance leaving the Union and a market of 500 million people without wanting what has become known as option A.  While its representatives say that Britain will leave the customs union and the Single Market, something similar will have to be negotiated, whatever it is called.  Phase 1 of the negotiations has concluded and we will not let them off the hook on that.  They signed up to all the rules, regulations, treaties and so on and legal obligations have to be met on leaving the Union as well as acceding to it.  They will, presumably, have to be observed and complied with.  What do the MEPs think is the bottom line?  As Ms Clune, said, Ireland does not want to give up the short sea route between Dover and Calais because it is essential to us.  Whatever happens, there will have to be regulatory alignment, no matter what it is called.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#G01100"><p>I thank the MEPs for attending.  There is a huge opportunity cost for them to spend time here in light of their massive constituencies.  I am sure they have plenty of work to do.  It is good that everybody is wearing the same green jersey on Brexit as our Government, which has done a tremendous job so far.  The representation we have in Europe has been excellent across the board.</p> <p>  On the future of Europe, the conversation that has begun, with public meetings being held throughout the country, is good.  It is good to bring Europe to the people for good or bad.  Whatever comes out of the process, let us hear it.  Like Deputy Haughey, I would be interested in Ms McGuinness telling us about new allies as we move towards a new Europe.  Clearly, we are losing a major ally and, therefore, we will have to sectionalise our allies with different allies on finance, agriculture, etc.</p> <p>   Ms Clune mentioned transport, which is a serious concern.  A number of haulage companies have mentioned to me that they have will difficulty crossing a third country in a post-Brexit world.  I refer to the requirement on the European Investment Bank to support Ireland as new super highways to Europe will have to be developed to avoid crossing the UK.  I do not know if I will get a response to that but I would be interested in hearing it.</p> <p>  Fisheries are extremely important.  I will not discuss agriculture because, like Mr. Luke "Ming" Flanagan, I think milk comes in cartons and that is all I know about it.</p> <p>  The issue of Northern Ireland with respect to Brexit comes up all the time and we constantly hear that 56% of those in Northern Ireland who voted in the referendum opposed leaving the Union.  On the one hand, we cannot talk about democracy while, on the other, rejecting it.  Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.  As long as that remains the case, there is no way there will be a border in the Irish Sea.  This will be a major problem because unionists will not accept it.  It should be borne in mind that they sit in Westminster, a forum where nationalists have no voice.</p><p>We cannot negotiate where we do not have a voice.  It is as simple as that.  I am sorry to bring it up because I have tremendous respect for the work that has been done by the nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland over the last 20 years or so to make the country as safe as it is and to make it so welcoming for anybody who wants to travel there from abroad.  The truth is that unless people get up off their bums and start giving Northern Ireland a voice - outside, that is, of those of us in the Republic of Ireland who have been screaming to the high heavens - it will be hard to make progress.  I know Mr. Carthy does not like hearing this but unless somebody goes to Westminster and starts representing the republican side of Ireland, we will end up with a hard border.  I predicted that in June 2016 and people laughed at me but there is nobody laughing now.  We are coming ever closer to a hard border on this island and that would be detrimental to the people of Northern Ireland.  It is they who will suffer.  I asked the unionists and Mr. Carthy knows the answer to this.  At the end of the day, Britain will not provide the level of financial support to Northern Ireland that the European Union has been providing.  We really have to exercise the full democratic imperative in order to protect those citizens of Ireland who are geographically separated from their country by virtue of the fact that they are located in a place that is currently regarded as part of the United Kingdom.  One hopes that will change in time but it is how matters stand.</p><p> PESCO continually comes up along with this nonsense about a European army.  I hear today that perhaps we should be putting the money into the CAP.  The CAP will not be worth a continental damn if we experience a serious cyber attack that grinds this country's information technology system to a halt and leaves us in a situation where we are praying for security.  It is not that long since a major cyber attack in the United Kingdom brought its entire health system down.  That weekend, Ireland did not have anybody on duty in cyber security because we did not have the numbers to do it.  Let us get away from the nonsense of a European army.  PESCO is a menu of choices.  We can pick what we want from it and avoid what we do not want.  There is an article being published this weekend, I understand, that will explore the security of this country and the need for us to modernise our equipment.  Ireland is a small country and, on its own, it cannot have the purchasing power that would be available under PESCO.  If somebody is talking about a European army, I urge them to remember that this country is militarily non-aligned.  It is not a neutral country.  It is militarily non-aligned and we will not be changing our position short of a referendum of the people.  I take grave exception to people trying to pretend that something different is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#H00200"><p>I am not a member of the committee but I always appreciate the opportunity to engage with and hear from MEPs because they are operating at the coalface.  Unfortunately, it seems we are not going to have the opportunity for an engagement today.  I had a number of questions and will put them on record in any event.  Perhaps the witnesses can provide answers at the next session.</p> <p>  I also want to refer to Senator Craughwell's points, for the purposes of balance.  He cannot admire people for pulling on the green jersey and then whip that jersey off in order to have a pop at those who adhere to a democratic imperative not to take their seats in Westminster.  If we are going to talk about democratic imperatives, let us remember that core one.  I will not hang on that issue for too long, however.</p> <p>  Ms Anderson referred to a number of the issues I want to raise.  Other colleagues have mentioned the issue of the Border.  It seems to me that the cast-iron guarantees the Taoiseach may have got from Theresa May are much more precarious than they appeared to be a number of weeks ago.  Do the MEPs want to expand on that?  Is there merit in asking the Taoiseach, publicly and privately, to do more to ensure that those commitments from the British Government are honoured, particularly in light of what Ms Anderson outlined in respect of the previous form of British negotiation teams when it comes to Ireland?</p> <p>  One of the issues I have consistently raised, as my Seanad colleagues will be well aware, is that there are between 800,000 and 900,000 Irish and, therefore, EU citizens in the North.  An Taoiseach has said those citizens will not be abandoned, a position I support fully.  When Mr. Guy Verhofstadt was here, he also said that the EU citizenship of those of us who are going to be held hostage in a post-Brexit scenario will not be undermined or weakened in any way.  Two questions flow from that.  First, should one or more of the two additional MEP seats for Ireland be used to represent Irish citizens in the North, given that we did vote to remain in the EU, as Senator Craughwell said?  Second, I have raised on a number of occasions the potential for the Government to put its money where its mouth is in terms of practical infrastructural service investment in the North, through something like the location of an Irish passport office in the Six Counties, particularly in view of the fact that last year alone there were over 82,000 applications for passports from the North.  I have also proposed the idea of a citizenship hub, a facility that would be dedicated to supporting citizens in the North to engage with the Government and, indeed, the EU structures regarding their rights and entitlements post-Brexit.</p> <p>  My concerns in the context of PESCO are not nonsense.  They are very sincerely and legitimately held.  PESCO moves us onto very unsavoury ground and has the potential to impinge upon Ireland's neutral status.  For example, while we can be very proud of the Defence Forces operations in the Mediterranean, which have a humanitarian focus, PESCO has the potential to shift us towards a much more militarised and, I believe, anti-immigrant and anti-asylum seeker status.  Senator Craughwell is not here any more.  He should not simply dismiss the concerns that we and many other human rights, humanitarian and charitable organisations have in respect of PESCO, just because he disagrees.  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

It is also welcome that the meeting is being broadcast live so that people can watch our deliberations.  I welcome the MEPs and the Vice President of the European Parliament, Ms McGuinness whom I meet regularly at COSAC meetings.  We met recently in Sofia in Bulgaria.  She plays a very important role in respect of liaison with all the parliaments.  It is a very influential role and the more we have those contacts, the better.  The UK was not represented at the last set of meetings in Sofia, which is unfortunate.  It is a pity to see that they are moving out already.</p> <p>  In the context of Brexit, we will have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  That is very evident from the statements today.  It is moving very fast.  The guarantee of free movement of people between North and South and throughout the United Kingdom must be upheld.  Irrespective of what the outcome will be, those are the fundamentals that were discussed at the start.  The Good Friday Agreement, in all its facets, must also be guaranteed and honoured by the United Kingdom.  That is vital.  May I suggest that those extra two seats should, as Ms Anderson said, be located as close as possible to the Border.  I am sure our MEPs from that region will agree with me.</p> <p>  The reality is that the text of December is a fudge and is not being put into law because there is no agreement.  Let us be quite blunt.  It is a most complicated situation whereby the DUP basically has a veto on the British Government.  As long as it has that veto, there will be no great agreement in this regard and the talks are not far from collapse at this stage.  There is certainly potential for destabilisation of the current British Government as well.  The situation is very difficult.  Ireland, North and South, will be the big loser.  All we can say is that we hope for the best and hope there will be an agreement.</p> <p>  This dialogue could go on longer.  I expect that the committee will be with the MEPs in Brussels in due course to follow up.  I will ask Ms Guinness to respond briefly.  I know we are not going to get answers on all of the points raised.  I ask her to keep her response as short as possible.  I am very conscious that the European Ombudsman is also here.</p></speech>

The Vice Chairman said the text was a fudge and that it was not being put into law.  Let me say, on behalf of the European Union, to the citizens who are listening, that it regards the text as an agreement.  It is not a fudge.  We believe it is an agreement which will be put into law.</p></speech>

Every country is watching and if it misbehaves, it will be noted.  Who would conclude a trade agreement with a country the word of which could not be taken as the truth?</p> <p>  I also caution those who are saying the budgetary outlook is bleak for the future.  There is a danger that if we keep repeating that narrative, as Deputy Bernard J. Durkan stated, it will become real.  We have to fight hard and are doing so to achieve an increase in the budget.  Member states will have to put money into the pot.  If we believe there is a future for the European Union, we have to fund it.  I hope Ireland will be part of that battle.</p> <p>  There is democracy in Europe, despite people saying we need more of it.  This is democracy in action.  The proceedings of the committee are being broadcast live.  We meet regularly.  There is no harm in reminding ourselves when we are critical of the European Union, as many of us are, with what are we comparing it.  Where on the globe do citizens have the freedoms that they enjoy, enjoy the rule of law and live a democracy that functions as well, despite its flaws, as the European Union?  If we remember this in the battles about where it is and where it is going, it will at least put us on the one sheet in saying the European Union is worth defending because without it, we would all be much worse off, not only financially.</p></speech>

Durkan asked an important question about whether Brexit could lead to the destruction of the European Union.  Obviously, we all hope it will not.  The answer to the question lies in whether the rest of us will learn the lessons from it.  It is true - it has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>- that in large part the Brexit vote result was caused by a xenophobic negative racist element which was epitomised by the Deputy's good friend who was in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#J01000"><p>Not mine.</p></speech>

We do not know the overall percentage who were disillusioned at the direction the European Union was taking in latter years, but we can assume that it was more than 3%, which was the difference between winning and losing in the referendum.  I argue, therefore, that we need to learn the lessons.</p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan also stated we needed to make a decision on whether we were all moving in the same direction or in different directions on whether we should have European Union representatives across member states.  The secret of the success of the European Union lies in the fact that we have the maturity to agree that there are areas in which we should all move forward together and also areas in which there are national priorities which will trump EU priorities and that national governments should have the ability and the freedom to decide what they shoould do in those instances.  We need to be honest with ourselves in all matters.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Gerard P. Craughwell's points about PESCO and whether it is a stepping stone to an EU army, almost every other member state that has signed up to it refer to it as a stepping stone to an EU army, yet in Ireland we are supposed to expect that it is something different.  We should be honest and say that is what it has been sold and championed as.  </p> <p>  Obviously, I do not have time to deal with all of the other points made by the Senator, but I suggest that if President Higgins is to seek a second term, he should replay the comments made by the Senator and that he will not face much opposition in the ballot box.</p> <p>  My final statement is on the future of the European Union, the debates on which provide an opportunity.  Thus far, they have not be capitalised.  If they do not include space for critical keynote speeches by those who have a different view on issues of concern to citizens within the European Union such as membership of PESCO and trade, they will have been a missed opportunity.</p> <p>  On a positive note, I can speak on behalf of all Irish MEPs when I say we are in absolute agreement that the next speaker, the European Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly, is doing a magnificent job and that we are very proud of her.  She is not afraid to be critical and stand up to the most powerful interests within the European institutions when required.  That should be noted.</p></speech>

That is part of the problem we have in the North.  It goes back to what Ms McGuinness stated about the reckless behaviour of the British Government on where it may be going and the damage it could do to us all, but I take on board and accept her statement that it will be put into law.  Within it, it states there will be no diminution of rights.  Therefore, it is about ensuring the rights and entitlements of the people of the North will be upheld.  Fifty years after the civil rights campaign, it is the Irish Government that needs to ensure it will stand over those rights.  We have had comments made on the issue of the passports.  It is not just because someone holds an Irish passport.  As a result of the Good Friday Agreement, some 1.8 million of us have been afforded the right to be British or Irish or both.  That means that the rights of the people of the North have to be applied, regardless of whether someone holds an Irish passport.  Without a doubt, we need passport offices in the North, but that is another subject matter.</p> <p>  The principle of consent was built into the Good Friday Agreement.  Senator Gerard P. Craughwell talked about the people of the North being part of the United Kingdom.  For the first time in the North, we have been given an opportunity to identify as Irish, to have our Irish citizenship recognised and to have the aspiration of Irish unity to be taken forward and addressed in a Border poll.  Let us remember that in April the European Council gave a signal to the people of Ireland when it stated that in the event of a Border poll being triggered under the Good Friday Agreement, it would mean that the North of Ireland would rejoin the European Union.  Therefore, what we need is for the Irish Government to become a facilitator.  Perhaps the Senator does not realise - I want everyone to know in case those listening do not realise it - that there is already a border in the Irish Sea.  Animals, animal products, plants and plant produce are all checked at the port and airport in Belfast.  I am not saying that border needs to be enhanced.  I do not want to see a border between the North and the South or east to west, but let people realise that for decades there has been a border.  We were able to tackle bluetongue on the island because we were able to work together on an all-island basis.  One does not have to have new infrastructure put in place, but what can never happen and be accepted by anyone on the island is the re-emergence of a harder border.  That cannot be tolerated.  I accept that is something that is being said by everyone at this committee.</p></speech>

In fact, we, in the European Parliament, had our own resolution, of which the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement formed parts, as well as the fact that there should be no border between the North and South.  That was recognised by the European Parliament which will eventually agree to whatever arrangement is put in place between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union.  We take the issue seriously.  I understand the European Commission and Mr. Barnier who is heading its delegation take very seriously the commitments given, to which the United Kingdom will be held.  The groundwork has been done.</p><p>The groundwork will have to be acknowledged and be part of whatever agreement is reached.  We spoke about the budget but did not deal with it enough.  It will be very important.  This debate will dominate our proceedings for the next few months as we decide where the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, from 2020 will go.  Last week, Mario Draghi came to the Parliament.  He said that in December 2016, he had predicted that the European economies would grow by 1.5% but in fact, they grew by 2.5% over 2017.  We are in a positive period in which economies are growing across Europe.  Our country is doing extremely well.  The last time the MFF was put in place there was, unfortunately, a recession and that also should be borne in mind.</p></speech>

We are net contributors and will have to increase our contribution.  One of the factors taken into account in calculating the contribution is the size of our economy and our gross domestic product, GDP.  We must remember that only a couple of years ago, we were described as having a system of leprechaun economics.  While those leprechaun economic growths in GDP may not trickle down to the people, the cost to the State rises because our contribution goes up.  We need to take that into account when we massage our figures on GDP unrealistically.</p> <p>  As far as fudge is concerned, I think the Vice Chairman is suggesting it might be on the British side.  Maybe it would and will be but the idea that someone will be worried about not being able to make future trade agreements because they would not be trusted is complete and utter rubbish.  The European Union and Ireland trade with China, which harvests the organs of people who do not agree with certain people.  Germany sells tanks to Saudi Arabia, not to plough the fields in Yemen and not just for money but in return for votes to host the World Cup.  There are no morals or fairness when it comes to trading or doing deals.  There are more morals in hell.  </p></speech>

I always wonder why the office is not called "ombudsperson".  It should be changed.  I find it uncomfortable, like "chairman".  Maybe it is something else Ms O'Reilly might achieve before the end of her term.</p> <p>  The committee had the opportunity to meet her this time last year in Brussels and it was a very rewarding engagement.  The committee is interested in the work she has been doing on transparency and in particular a case that she opened on transparency in the Council of the European Union, which examines the legislative process.  Separately, the Dutch Parliament has also been considering transparency.  This committee is considering it as well.  Only yesterday, Ms O'Reilly made recommendations following almost a year of work with inquiry and public consultation.  The published recommendations were circulated to all members of the committee yesterday but they may not have had a chance to read them in detail.  The timing of today's engagement is very helpful.  </p> <p>  Most of our engagement today will focus on transparency in the Council but if Ms O'Reilly has the time, the committee will also be interested in other areas of her work.  When the committee was in Brussels the Brexit negotiations were at an early stage and, considering how important they are for citizens, she strongly advocated for transparency.</p><p>Her work has never been so vital as it is with the negotiations that are under way at present.  We are delighted that, as an Irish person, Ms O'Reilly holds that position.  I was there when you were campaigning and successfully won the election.  It is one of the few prestigious positions in the European Union to which a person is elected by the Parliament, not appointed.  It is a great achievement for you and for Ireland.<br/><br/>Before we begin, I must remind everybody of the rules on privilege.  You are all aware of them but for legal purposes it is necessary to read them out.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Ms O'Reilly will be aware of all this so it was probably unnecessary.  I invite her to begin.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be in Leinster House again and to have the opportunity to address members on an issue that goes to the heart of the current challenges facing the EU, which the members have been discussing with the MEPs.  I am aware that the committee has invested a considerable amount of time over the past year to hearing from experts and assessing the current deliberations on the future of Europe.  While they may not feature on the list of more high-profile institutional reforms currently under discussion, it would be a mistake not to consider democratic accountability and transparency reforms as priorities as we seek to respond to the current public uncertainty about the EU.<br/><br/>Laws that affect people&rsquo;s daily lives should be drawn up in a manner that is as transparent as possible.  This is essential for enabling meaningful public scrutiny of, and thus accountability for, those laws.  More transparent lawmaking is central to the democratic legitimacy of our institutions and, at a more fundamental level, to responding to the current crisis of public confidence in democratic institutions whether at EU level or in the member states.  Overall, despite what some may assume, the EU administration has higher ethical and transparency standards than the administrations of most member states.  For example, very few member states have a lobbyist register as the EU does, Ireland being a commendable exception.  Few national Ministers in Europe publish details of their travel expenses, as the European Commission has just recently agreed to do.  The Commission and important EU agencies such as the European Medicines Agency have also made commendable strides in recent years in opening up their processes and practices to public scrutiny.  Matters of great public interest, such as EU trade deals and the results of clinical trials on medicines, are now much more transparent than they were previously.  As I have frequently said, the world has not stopped turning as a result.<br/><br/>That said, it is clear that the Council of the EU, where the national governments are represented, is not a star pupil among the institutions when it comes to transparency and accounting for its decisions.  Given its crucial role in the EU&rsquo;s lawmaking process, I believe this must be addressed.  That is what motivated my decision to launch a strategic inquiry last year into the transparency and accountability of the Council.  On the basis of that inquiry, this week I issued a series of recommendations.<br/><br/>When the Council formally adopts EU laws, meetings and discussions of the Ministers on the draft laws are public.  However, before the Council reaches a formal position, preparatory discussions will have taken place in some of the more than 150 committees and working parties in the Council.  It is at this level that not only do the nuts and bolts of the legislative work take place but it is also where legislative decisions are occasionally made.  Most of the changes to draft laws are proposed and compromises between member states are sought at this stage, before Ministers adopt a final position.  Unlike Council meetings, these preparatory bodies of ambassadors and civil servants do not meet in public.  As such, the only way to follow their discussions on legislation is through whatever records exist of those discussions.  This requires, first, that legislative discussions in preparatory bodies be documented and, second, that such documents are accessible in an easy and timely manner.  Both of these factors are essential for facilitating public scrutiny of the legislative work in these bodies.<br/><br/>The national representatives who sit on these Council bodies are democratically accountable to the national parliaments and to citizens of their member states, in theory.  However, in order for the public to be able to hold governments to account for the decisions they make on EU laws, they need to know how their governments positioned themselves in the legislative process.  This crucial piece of the process is currently generally lacking.  As part of my inquiry, we carried out a public consultation last year.  This consultation yielded some highly relevant responses, including from the Dutch and UK Parliaments, that have helped fine-tune the outstanding issues.  On the basis of this, I have made a series of recommendations and suggestions to the Council.<br/><br/>The Council secretariat is clearly aware of its deficiencies in this area and has certainly made some welcome progress, not least by introducing a new internal recording system in November 2016.  While this is an internal register, the existence of such a system should help provide a greater incentive comprehensively to record and document all legislative discussions in the preparatory bodies.  At present, it appears there is no uniform approach to reporting and documenting the legislative discussions in the preparatory bodies.  The Council also takes a selective approach to how it discloses the documents that do exist.  My recommendations and suggestions to the Council seek to ensure these issues are addressed.<br/><br/>Much of this can seem rather abstract or removed from the stuff of daily political life.  However, all of us are aware of the practice by which member state governments sometimes criticise decisions taken in Brussels to their domestic audience when, very often, during the legislative process in Brussels they had supported or shaped the very decision they then criticise.  Systematically recording the identity of member states expressing positions<b></b>in the preparatory bodies, and proactively disclosing these records, would go some way to addressing this problem.  I am aware of the challenges this may pose when the diplomatic impulse is towards arriving at a consensus with the minimum of fuss but the price of that may be to continue to feed an inaccurate view of how EU lawmaking is actually carried out, and to allow some member state governments to continue to perpetuate the stigmatisation of the so-called faceless Brussels bureaucrat.  My hope is that, by addressing the opaque nature of lawmaking in the Council, my inquiry will help to encourage all EU governments to defend democratically decided EU legislation in the public interest in the future.  As a result, I hope the Council responds positively to the recommendations I set out this week.<br/><br/>Before I conclude, I wish to mention two other pieces of work in which my office is currently engaged.  Brexit<b></b>is a huge issue for this country and for the EU more widely.  Early last year, I wrote to both the European Commission and the Council of the EU encouraging them to be as transparent as possible in the Brexit negotiations.  It is important that citizens and national parliaments can follow this crucial process which will affect the lives of millions, especially on this island.  Thankfully, the EU has adopted a progressive stance to publishing all important documents during the negotiations, including the EU guidelines, negotiating directives and position papers.  Unfortunately, the UK side has not been seen to be as transparent.<br/><br/>Also recently, following a year-long inquiry based on a complaint from Denmark, I made a recommendation to the European Central Bank, ECB, about its involvement with the Washington DC-based so-called Group of Thirty.  Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,  is a member of this group, which is a private group of 30 senior bankers, public officials and academics.  It holds two private meetings per year and includes representatives of some global banks which the ECB supervises as part of its banking supervision mandate.  My main recommendation was that the President, Mr. Draghi, suspend his membership of this group until he leaves office, in order to protect the ECB from any perception that its independence could be compromised.</p><p>I also recommended that no future executive board members become members of the Group of 30.  I expect the response of the ECB in April. </p><p>Finally, I thank the committee for its support in my role as European Ombudsman and also the Irish MEPs who have been consistently supportive of my work in the European Parliament. </p></speech>

I think it was last year that she met members of the committee in Brussels and was very informative about the details of her work then.  I welcome her more recent recommendations which all of us will support.  We live in an age of openness, transparency and accountability.  I will be devil's advocate for a moment.  Through the years, European or even UK diplomacy involved wheeling and dealing and smoke-filled rooms, quiet diplomacy.  Is Ms O'Reilly satisfied that as we move to this more open and transparent system that it will not hinder the objective of getting an outcome in terms of a deal or solution?  It is mostly a philosophical question.  I support the work that Ms O'Reilly does and the objectives she has outlined but will it hinder the Council's work in any way?</p> <p>  Another question which is not entirely related to Ms O'Reilly's work is a general issue in which she will be interested, namely the rise of illiberal tendencies in the European Union, in countries such as Poland, Hungary and so on, in terms of the freedom of the press, the appointment of judges and so forth.  There are threats to European values and democratic norms.  Is Ms O'Reilly concerned about that or does she feel that the EU can deal with that through its rules, mechanisms and so forth?  In the course of her own experience, has Ms O'Reilly noticed a rise of such illiberal tendencies among the people she mixes with in Brussels, for instance?  Is it something that we should be concerned about?</p></speech>

She is doing important work.  She is critical of the Council, probably rightly.  How has she found the Commission and other bodies?  Which of them occupy more of her time or which are slightly more difficult to deal with?  Is there a culture of cover-up, although I hesitate to use that term?  They do not wish to release information.  Perhaps it is natural or is human nature when certain select bodies get together, especially  Mario Draghi has not formally reacted yet but I would be very interested to know if Ms O'Reilly has had any feedback on that recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#M00500"><p>I welcome the Ombudsman and thank her for her presentation.</p> <p>  I agree that transparency is hugely important.  If one is dealing with colleagues on an international or European level, it is always good to know their hidden thoughts, and whether the views they express in one particular arena are the same as those they have expressed secretly or might be influencing things in a different direction at home.  I am particularly interested in the European Medicines Agency.  We have had some grief over the cost of medicines.  I have complained for a long time that Ireland does not seem able to avail of the benefits of a 500 million-people market in relation to the cost of medicines, particularly in relation to trial medicines, new discoveries, orphan medicines, all of which has caused severe problems whereby the manufacturers sell the medicines at an agreed price until they become accepted and established when they then change the pricing structure.  In recent days, the Minister has made arrangements with some of the smaller countries in the EU in an effort to bring about some improvement in the area.  </p> <p>  It is very important for us in Ireland, but it is equally important for every country in the EU.  Every state in the EU, big or small, there is no difference, is entitled to be able to buy their medicines at a price that reflects the type of market in which we live.  After all, if we were not members of the EU, presumably we would not get medicine at all or we would do so at only a particular pricing structure.  There is still a tendency to do that.  I strongly support Ms O'Reilly's activities in that area and hope there will be more of it.  A huge benefit accrues to all member states across the EU from achieving a result where medicines are priced within an acceptable range.  </p> <p>  I wish Ms O'Sullivan well in the area of Brexit.  In the matter of transparency, Ms O'Sullivan will have to get into what people have in their minds as well as their documents and their policies.  I know that she is well capable of doing that.  Any good ombudsman or journalist knows that it is crucially important in current circumstances to know where the other side is coming from in the negotiations that are now taking place.  It is not on this meeting's agenda, but there has been considerable discussion about tax justice recently and the 12.5% corporation tax.  Very powerful people in Europe with powerful associations have concluded that it must be dismantled or else we must collect taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions, some of which are in Europe.  I strongly oppose that.  It has the potential to do us considerable damage.  Last week, an international aid organisation was opining on this along side a major, multi-billion dollar international investment house.  I do not know what the association is between the two, it is somewhere in the back of my mind that they appeared to complement each other in their goal of destroying what is seen as being an advantage to Ireland.  Incidentally, I am in favour of equality of taxation, I have no difficulty whatever with that, where I do have difficulty is if it comes in under a guise of something else, which is to discourage foreign direct investment in this particular country.</p></speech>

I am also delighted to welcome my old sparring partner Mr. Aidan O'Sullivan to the committee.</p> <p>  My colleagues have already mentioned Brexit so I will step away from the issue, for once, but I commend Ms O'Reilly on her efforts to ensure that the European side is as transparent as possible.  It is an issue that she has raised with us in Brussels long before the negotiations.  It has been heartening to see it rolled out.  I wish that the UK side was as transparent, perhaps among each other as well as with the European side.  </p> <p> I want to raise three areas.  The first may link into the future of Europe, but generally feeds into the post-Brexit scenario, with trade negotiations and discussions.  I was an outspoken supporter of both TTIP and CETA, which I felt were both great trade deals.  I think CETA will be excellent for the European Union.  One of the main reasons TTIP stalled, apart from the change in the political direction of the United States, was the mass opposition which was bred by the idea that it was being done in secret.  When I had the trade portfolio in the EU committee of the regions, I looked at the TTIP negotiation documents.  I went to a basement in the Berlaymont and had to surrender my mobile phone.  I was writing a report on that from the EU side.  It set a really bad tone for a process that I thought was very worthwhile.  CETA was exactly the same.  The opposition lobby pushed those arguments.  If we are looking at new trade deals with Malaysia, Vietnam, Australasia, Mercosur is particularly important for this island, I hope that the ombudsman's office is beefed up and is allowed to play the role that it is there to do.</p><p>I really have high hopes for the Office of the European Ombudsman.<br/><br/>An area I would like to discuss is the issue of lobbying.  I have taken a major interest in the lobbyist register and other measures we have taken in the State.  I wonder if there is scope for an EU-wide lobbying register, so that it is not left to the individual member state.  I will be frank, many of my friends are lobbyists.  When one works in politics, lobbying is an industry that one ends up going into.  Who knows, someday I could be forced into it, depending on the will of the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown?  If an Irish MEP is being lobbied in Brussels by a third party from another member state, there is huge confusion on where responsibility for that lies.  Is that lobbying in Belgium, or is it lobbying in Ireland or is it lobbying by a third party lobbyist?  There is a lack of clarity and there are too many discrepancies between the member states to allow it be efficient.  Is there a way to simplify it?  I know I possibly<b></b>may be opening a can of worms.  Brussels, as a city, just short of Washington has the highest number of lobbyists in the world.  It is a difficult area but in order for politics to continue in the best way possible we need the highest level of transparency in our lobbyists.  It should not be a black mark for an individual to say I am lobbyist.  One does not know what an individual lobbying for.  The vast majority of lobbyists are doing it in a very benevolent manner and they are trying to aid the legislative process.  More rules and a clearer process makes it easier not just for the lobbyists but in our parlance, the designated public officeholders and officials, such as all of us who are on this side of the room and indeed Ms O'Reilly as well.<br/><br/>I want to raise the issue of political funding and the role of outside bodies in the domestic affairs of individual member states.  I will give two examples that are unique to Ireland, first our upcoming referendum on whether to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, Article 40. 3. 3<sup>o</sup>.  Both sides of the campaign have raised really valid concerns about outside funding coming into the campaign to support campaign groups, be they NGOs or groups that have been just set up for this campaign.  I raised the matter on the floor of the Seanad in the context that I received ten separate Facebook advertisements from campaigns seeking to retain the eighth amendment, supposedly from ten separate groups, even though their imagery, language and content was identical.  How do we peel that back; what is the single source for that?  Where is the funding coming from?  The exact same applies to those who are seeking to repeal the eighth amendment.  Let me declare publicly I believe in repealing the eighth amendment.  There are legitimate concerns about outside funding from the US or other EU funding of certain bodies in this country.  Does the European Ombudsman have a role in that area to make sure that it is fair and transparent and that the referendum can be held with the highest level of integrity?<br/><br/>My second point relates to direct political funding.  Last week the European grouping for Freedom and Direct Democracy held an event calling for an Irexit, a damp squib in the end.  The EFDD group in the European Parliament has no Irish members.  No Irish political party is a constituent member, either of their European parliamentary group or their European-wide political family.  All of us on this side happen to be members of the Fine Gael Party and we are all members of the European People's Party, EPP.  It states that on our membership card therefore when the EPP holds events in Ireland, such as the study days with our MEPs or any campaigning for example on the Lisbon referendum or the fiscal stability, it does so through its member party and we pay a membership fee.  What distinguishes any EU political family from member state parties or groupings in the European Parliament and what rights or responsibilities do they have if they are going to act in a member state where they do not have actual constituted member parties?  The only member state in which the EPP does not have a member party is the United Kingdom.  Could it have launched a campaign on the referendum on Brexit and run an EPP campaign?  Could we as a member of the EPP have launched a campaign on Brexit during the referendum?  Could we start holding public meetings and using EU funds, which is what the EFDD has, to pursue a political agenda in another member state?  I welcome debate on Ireland's future in the European Union but I question why British MEPs and European funding is going to a group that has no Irish members and being used to stimulate that debate.  Is the EFDD doing so within the rules?  Is it an area in which there needs to be more clarity and what role can the Office of the European Ombudsman take in that? </p></speech>

I would like to tease one point out further.  There is a fundamental difference between a sovereign state and a national parliament legislating in a particular way.  The European Union, which is a confederation of national states, is engaging in the legislative process that it has put together.  I welcome a lot of the work that the Ms O'Reilly has gone into around this because I have always advocated as a passionate pro-European that one of the most significant problems we have is the way in which national governments will consistently blame the European Union or a faceless bureaucrat in the European Commission for some piece of legislation that they do not like, whereas if it is a project that has received funding, it will be the national government's success when the funded project is completed.</p> <p>  What worries me - and I would be interested to learn how the European Ombudsman has looked at this - is that as much failure as there is in the process of a closed door discussion between sovereign governments trying to harmonise their position, it has by and large delivered a lot of things which have significantly benefited Europe and Ireland during our period of membership of the European Union.  If we go down the path of a far more open and transparent process at that stage, has the European Ombudsman considered what the repercussions could be in terms of member states effectively taking the bit of the process that they do not want to be made public outside of that structure, having private sidebar conversations and dealing off the official agenda, so that we actually end up knowing less about what is happening?   I would hope that Ireland would find it perfectly okay to operate in an open and transparent way but I have no doubt that there would be other member states where that would be very alien to their process of operating.  What would worry me is that in adjusting the current process we could end up with a worse process, where more of the actual initial stages of putting together legislation take place in a completely untransparent way.  Has Ms O'Reilly looked at that and how does she think some of the processes she wants to engage in will ensure that does not happen?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#N00800"><p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to welcome the European Ombudsman to this committee.  Interestingly enough I was in the Seanad this morning dealing with the progress of a report called Too Old to be Elderly and the mobility allowance.  I had the support of the Leas-Chathaoirleach who was chairing that session.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey spoke about issues in Hungary, Poland and other countries.  I have a particular interest in people with disabilities of whom there are 80 million across the European Union.  The experiences and expectations are very different in member states.  I am familiar with this from my own work, and I know the European Ombudsman would have some sense of this from her involvement with the various European disability organisations and the European social platform.  There are real concerns about the growth and the development of civil society groups, but my major issue is with the groups related to disability.</p><p> Ms O'Reilly's particular work is about ensuring that European institutions are more effective, transparent and open, as well as protecting people's fundamental rights.  Will she comment on the role that civil society organisations can play in member states given the right environment?  From talking to colleagues in certain member states, I know they feel quite vulnerable trying to do their advocacy work and that they are being watched critically.  A strong civil society movement, where people get organised, involved and criticise their governments, is important as part of one of the bedrocks of developing a strong, cohesive and socially progressive European project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.90" nospeaker="true" time="14:00:00" ><p>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae resumed the Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018021400002#O00300"><p>I understand the arguments presented by Deputies Haughey and Brophy about how good legislation has been done through a process which is less than transparent or, indeed, accountable at European Council level.  Deputy Haughey asked would we be able to get much of this work done if everything was out there and there was not this room for a diplomatic safe space.  The problem is that the current process does not match the rights in the European treaty for citizens to see how legislation has been processed.  In a way, the problem is that they are using the diplomatic processes we are accustomed to in the areas of defence, foreign affairs or international relations in a legislative process.<br/><br/>The EU cannot have it both ways.  On the one hand, it cannot decry populism, along with those who blame Brussels for everything and give a distorted view of how the EU legislates, while insisting on using a process which does not allow for full transparency or for the sort of accountability one gets in the Oireachtas or other member state parliaments and governments.  When one is trying to get 28 member states to agree on non-sensitive issues, their positions can be recorded and there is not a problem.  On sensitive issues, however, it is a problem and one can understand the impulse of keeping one's hands across one's homework, if one likes, until one gets consensus and the issue across the line.  If the price for that is that Eurosceptics, as well as those who are anti-EU, can claim that proves we are being ruled by undemocratic and faceless bureaucrats and the EU does not afford citizens the right to have full accountability for what is done in their name and for them, then that is a problem.<br/><br/>There is also an issue of political maturity.  Obviously, the impulse in many member states, as well as at EU and Council level, would be to get these things through with the minimum of fuss.  People are accustomed, and therefore expect, there to be argument and debate.  People are also accustomed to political parties and groupings making compromises.  According to the treaty and various rulings made by the European Court of Justice, that is the way it is supposed to happen at EU level, even though the difficulties which the Deputies spoke about can arise.  There was an interesting court case in 2012, when a transparency NGO, Access Info Europe, sought to get records of member state positions on, curiously enough, the EU transparency regulation.  The European Court of Justice agreed that records of member state positions should be made publicly available and as soon as possible.  What happened then?  The Council accepted this, meaning any member state positions which were actually recorded would be released.  However, they now simply do not record them in many instances.  There is a consensus, nod of the head or an informal agreement on a particular matter.  If a record does not exist, then it cannot be accessed.<br/><br/>The Council has three months to deliberate on my proposals.  Obviously, I will be interested, and I am sure other member state parliaments will be interested, in what position it takes.  As an ombudsman, if I have difficult recommendations to get across the line, it can be hard to do so if mine is the only voice.  All members of the committee will have observed, however, a head of steam is building up around this.  There have been calls from certain member states, the Dutch in particular, as well as civil society and the European Parliament, for the Council to become more open.  As we move towards the 2019 European Parliament elections, and as the debate on the future of Europe becomes more intense, this will be an issue.<br/><br/>On the comments I made in my investigation and here earlier, blaming Brussels has led to many bad things.  We might as well try something else.<br/><br/>Hungary and Poland are difficult issues for the EU.  The EU has soft power and has been trying to use initiatives and dialogue to have certain member states, which seem to be rolling back democratic norms and the rule of law, to heed what it is saying and bring their value systems in line with what they are supposed to accept by virtue of being members of the Union.  It is difficult.  We have seen what has happened in Poland.  The European Commission's First Vice President, Frans Timmermans, has done much negotiating with the Polish Government and we will see what happens.  People are not as engaged with this as much as they might be about Brexit or migration.  However, it goes to the core of what the EU is meant to be about.  If certain member states are not accepting the foundational basis of the EU, then that is a big problem.  I do not believe any of us have the answers to that.  We have to continue to support the ombudsmen in those countries, as well as civil society groups as much as we can.<br/><br/>On Senator Coghlan's question on the culture of cover-up, I do not find one.  All of the institutions and agencies have become much more transparent over the past several years.  Curiously enough, social media has played a large part in that, plus a generation growing up with high expectations of transparency.  I do not believe they can resist that.<br/><br/>The President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, will respond to me in April on whether he will suspend his membership of the G30 until he leaves office in October 2019.  I am hoping he will respond positively.  I have had several cases with the European Central Bank.  It has always collaborated well and has made all of its processes much more open as a result.  I am hoping for a positive response.<br/><br/>On Deputy Durkan's questions about the European Medicines Agency, I remember back in 1982, when I was working in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, doing a two-page article on drugs pricing and generic drugs.  It is still a significant problem.  Being home over the past few days, I have listened to the conversation taking place on the Joe Duffy radio programme about the withdrawal of a certain drug.  Whatever the ins and outs of it, I was struck by the human stories, the suffering the people affected are going through and their belief that this particular drug was helping them to tolerate almost intolerable situations.</p><p>The issue of pricing is also important because a number of people who spoke were able to point to the price of that drug in Northern Ireland but also in the US.  A lot of work is being done at European level in the context of harmonising these issues.  That is important because if the EU is to be for citizens, I cannot think of any more important areas in respect of which it should for the citizens than those of health and, as Senator Dolan mentioned, disability.</p><p> Regarding the trade negotiations and TTIP, as members are aware, we did a lot of work with the Commission regarding making the talks far more open.  In fairness to the Commission, it has really transformed its transparency policy on that.  I think the Commission was quite stunned by the level of engagement regarding the TTIP negotiations and realised that times have moved on, the rules of the game have changed and it could no longer do things behind closed doors and had to transform the way in which it did business.  As was rightly noted, the TTIP talks are stalled at the moment but last year, the Commission set out its five principles of trade negotiations and for the first time, one of them was transparency.  It is true even in the way it has conducted itself with regard to Brexit.  I know there are political reasons behind the transparency as well but an awful lot is out there.  It is still early days.  When we really get down to the hard negotiation about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, we will see the limits of transparency.</p><p> I forgot to mention a point about Council transparency.  If we look hard enough, we will be able to track a particular regulation or a particular player who is putting down amendments and so on.  A lot of it is down there.  If one knows the right people within a particular working group or a particular ambassador, one can get the information.  In a sense, that creates a playing field that is not level because a well-resourced lobbyist or global corporation in Brussels will be able to afford to send people out to do nothing but track the trajectory of a particular regulation 24-7.  In a sense, this gives privileged access to people while not allowing ordinary members of the public or civil society who would not be as well resourced to have their say.</p><p> With regard to the lobbying register, I agree that there is huge unevenness across member states.  Ireland is very often talked about as a model in the context of its lobbying register.  When people are speculating or talking about the improvements that could be made at EU level or within member states, they often point to the Irish register.  I have tried to interest my member state colleagues in the issue of lobbying transparency.  Some are very engaged with it because they recognise it as an issue and recognise the role lobbying can play in the making of legislation.  Obviously, a piece of legislation is the sum total of every influence brought to bear on it.  Other countries do not think it is a big deal and have a system of revolving doors where people move very rapidly from public service or politics to big industry and often back again.  Some member states do not see that there is a problem with this.  If one examines the Volkswagen scandal, the role lobbying played in that and the revolving door issue, one can see that people are increasingly waking up to why this is important.  I think we will see developments in this area.  I try to raise awareness of this issue at every opportunity, whether it be by dint of a complaint or through an investigation on my own initiative.</p><p> On disability rights, I think the Senator and I were both at the meeting at the European Parliament where people with disabilities from across member states came together in plenary.  It was quite a remarkable session.  I had been to one or two of those previously.  What I found really interesting, not just as European Ombudsman but as a citizen and human being, is that when one is in a room where everybody present has some kind of disability, be it visual or a physical incapacity, and is attempting to do what all of us take for granted every day of the week.  When one sees the challenges they face, even in a very well-resourced place like the European Parliament building, it really does bring home to one the challenges that remain.  I think Ireland is about to ratify the convention, or we hope it will, which is very good.  It has been delayed.  I think we are only one of two countries that has not ratified it.  Are we the last country?</p></speech>

Obviously, civil society has a huge role to play in this.  There is no doubt about that.  One of the more disturbing things about Hungary and Poland has been the attacks on civil society.  It is classic stuff.  Anybody who tries to challenge any part of the ruling orthodoxy is seen and depicted as an enemy of the people.  This has particularly affected civil society groupings.</p> <p>  I am certainly not going to give my tuppence worth regarding the referendum on repealing the eighth amendment - been there, done that.  Obviously, as a citizen and a woman, I look at it very carefully.  I wrote extensively on the subject as a journalist in the 1980s when the original referendum took place.  I also wrote a book about what had happened.  It is very interesting for me to see the debate for a new generation.  Some things have not changed while others have.  It is a referendum and everybody will have their say.  With regard to outside funding, I did follow a debate - not one relating to this referendum but one relating to the marriage equality referendum when there was an argument between Amnesty International and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO with regard to money received by Amnesty International.  If there is an element to it involving an EU body, conceivably, there may be some role for me.  I cannot see it at the moment.  Unless I am mistaken, SIPO would deal with those matters.  The rules are there.  Obviously, decisions will be made - whether by SIPO or through the courts - as to what is legitimate.</p> <p>  Regarding the questions about politicians from other countries coming in and they may not be members of a grouping that has Irish members, I assume it is valid for anybody to come in and be able to speak.  I think Senator Richmond was referring to Nigel Farage and some people who came here the past week or two weeks ago.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Leyden, our Vice Chairman, for taking over.  It is like the MEPs coming here earlier today.  In respect of any time Ms O'Reilly takes time out of her busy schedule to come before the committee to hear the concerns members have and get a feeling for what is happening on the ground and the issues of concern we face on a daily basis as politicians, I know she is very much in tune with what is happening here all the time politically, nationally and internationally.  She is really on top of her game, which is very important because we are the voice from the ground up.</p><p>Many of the issues that reach the ombudsman's desk have come to us through our constituencies and work already.  I gave five years here, on the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  Many of those cases, over the years, had been to the ombudsman.  It is important that we work together because, at the end of the day, it is like the matter of the Versatis patches over the last weeks.  The agony that people are going through is a matter that I raised in the D&aacute;il today during Leaders' Questions because issues like that affect people.  At the end of the day, with the ombudsman in her role and us in our role, we help people, organisations, groups and individuals.  Some people look down their noses at politicians when they see and hear them talking about and raising individual cases.  There is nothing wrong with that and no need to be ashamed about dealing with an individual and his or her problem if one is elected or is in the role of someone such as Ms Emily O'Reilly.  That is what we are supposed to do.  We are advocates.  We are there to speak for people who cannot speak for themselves.  One thing I get great satisfaction from, which I presume the ombudsman would be interested in hearing, is that late on a Monday night, I can be in a quiet country pub, meeting people, or in a cold community centre, talking to people about a particular issue.  The following day, I can stand up in the D&aacute;il and face a Minister who might have direct responsibility for that issue, or the Taoiseach, say that I met an individual somewhere last night and raise that person's problem.  That is what democracy is about.  Sometimes, journalists in particular have a hang-up about that.  They call it clientelism, parochial or parish-pump politics.  We have to listen to all this nonsense but, in the end, that is what we are supposed to do.  We are national politicians who are elected locally.  We have to start somewhere and that is where we start.  I look forward, for as long as we are there, to working with the ombudsman and her office.  We all seek to do our best for people.</p><p> I thank the ombudsman.  I will be looking back on the proceedings because I will be able to read the questions that were asked.  I thank Senator Terry Leyden and all members for their contributions.  Does Senator Dolan want to come back in?  We are wrapping up, so he can speak now.</p></speech>

I had the honour of leading an 11-strong Irish delegation.  One was from Kerry, so that is parish-pump at its best.  The Chairman might consider inviting some of those people to listen to what they have to say about their experiences.  In fairness to Ireland, the European Down's syndrome delegation was made up entirely of Irish people.  There was an Irish woman on the European Alzheimer's disease group.  There was a fine presentation of people from Ireland.  That makes the point that Irish groups, whether disability-related or otherwise, want to participate and have an interest in participating in matters at a European level.  The ombudsman mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Government committed two weeks ago to having it ratified by the end of next month.  We have got a lot of slagging internationally for being the last country in Europe to do so but I am convinced that Ireland can come out strongly over the next years and show what it can do.  The ombudsman mentioned big, multi-national agencies, including the European Disability Forum, the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities, and the Social Platform.  They do not have three dozen staff between them and are trying to work for people with disabilities and others.  There are real issues between who has the money to get selective knowledge and insider information.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and tolerance.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to just put a phone on silent mode, as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>Today we are considering the reports, Finding a Home - Families' Journeys out of Homelessness, and Keeping a Home - Preventing Families from Becoming Homeless.  On behalf of the committee I welcome, from Focus Ireland, Mr. Mike Allen and Ms Sarah Sheridan, and also Dr. Kathy Walsh, Mr. Brian Harvey and Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Siochr&uacute; who are independent research consultants of social issues.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the witnesses attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The opening statements of today's meeting will be shared by Mr. Allen and the authors of the reports.  I call on Mr. Allen to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The main business is to hear from the researchers but I just want to make a couple of introductory remarks.</p> <p>  People will know Focus Ireland because of the work we do, namely, our services providing support to prevent homelessness or support people out of homelessness right across Ireland.  Last year, we worked with more than 14,000 people, to prevent them from becoming homeless or sort them out, or provide them with housing - we are one of the largest approved housing bodies in the country.  Right from the beginning, Focus Ireland has argued that we need to understand homelessness better.  We cannot just assume we know what it is and what works to solve it.  We have an ambitious research programme in recent years which shines a light on our own services to learn what works but also gives wider information to help public and policy understanding of what types of interventions work to end homelessness.  That is very much the context in which these reports were commissioned.</p> <p>  At one level, the reports reflect areas of work which Focus Ireland is very proud of and successful in.  Last year alone, we supported more than 700 families who were in homeless services into secure housing.  That is the highest ever, and is probably the largest single contribution of any organisation to that goal of moving people out of homelessness, and similar effectiveness in terms of the prevention work which will emerge in the two pieces of research.</p> <p>  The main conclusions we would draw the committee's attention to are as follows.  First, prevention works.  It is meaningful and important to prevent people from becoming homeless and we should be doing much more of that.  The sort of prevention work which people may be more familiar with is the advice and information.  What comes from this piece of work is the role of case management in preventative work.  Really intense human-to-human interaction is important.</p> <p>  It is also important to look at the way in which these services and the research reports were funded.  More than half of Focus Ireland's funding comes from State contracts, but it is important to see in these pieces of work the role of corporate sponsors and partners.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy funded the prevention programme that is being looked at here and part-funded its evaluation while in the area of exits from homelessness, the main funder of services is the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive but also, particularly in the area of the child support work, Tusla and the HSE.</p> <p>  In the area of supporting families out of homelessness, we are saying prevention works even when there is huge pressure on housing.  It is also possible to move families and individual households out of homelessness even when there is insufficient affordable housing.  Obviously, the ultimate answer to the problem we are facing involves a significant increase in the amount of affordable secure housing that is available to everybody but there is meaningful work we can be doing in the right policy context, even in the current context.</p> <p>  Those are the main points that we are drawing to the committee's attention.  We also circulated our research strategy to the committee to show the broad range of research interests that we have and we would be happy to discuss that further with any Deputy or Senator who wishes to ask.</p></speech>

Its defining feature is that it looks at those who were at risk of homelessness and managed to avoid it.  The main reasons for that risk fall into two primary categories.  The first is notice to quit, of which landlords selling property accounted for 40%.</p><p>Family members moving in accounted for nearly half of all notices to quit.  Then there were those who could not pay their rent, either because of arrears or rent increases.  Some 14% of people had to move out because of direct rent increases.  Overall, approximately 80% had experienced notices to quit or simply could not pay for where they were living, which does not come as a surprise but does say a lot.</p><p> A number of Focus Ireland's strategies worked and helped people to avoid homelessness.  First was building families' awareness of their rights and entitlements and providing clear directions to them.  Understandably, most did not know what these were.  Many had never experienced anything like this before.  A second strategy was assisting families to navigate the State systems, which enabled them to access their rights and entitlements by going to meetings, advocating with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, writing letters to State agencies, etc.  A third strategy was coaching families on how to find properties.  Many needed this help, particularly because they were in vulnerable situations dealing with agents and landlords and overcoming or getting around the latter's prejudices.  A fourth strategy was supporting families to access financial assistance when they found somewhere.  In particular, the housing assistance payment, HAP, was just coming into being and was a major factor for families, but many landlords did not want to engage with it at that point.  A fifth strategy was bringing prevention services together in an integrated package and adding to them the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, counselling and other services that were available.</p><p> It was this combination of supports that worked, and we know that it worked because, between three and 15 months afterwards, 34 of the 35 families interviewed had succeeded in avoiding homelessness.  They told us which supports had worked and how they had worked.  That is our evidence.  It is not just a question of what worked, but also how - the "how" of prevention - it worked when dealing with each family's complex circumstances.</p><p> Any family from any background, economic status, ethnicity or culture can be at risk of homelessness.  When approaching services and others, prejudice can put families that are already under stress under even greater stress and reduce their resilience and motivation.  Being non-judgmental does the opposite and builds their motivation.  The case management approach is effective.  Families need personalised, timely, flexible and hands-on support.  They also require integrated and varied packages of support that are tailored to their needs.</p><p> Regarding short-term versus medium-term solutions, prevention services can only hope to achieve short-term solutions.  We can see that with many people returning to homelessness after a period of being able to avoid it.  While these solutions support families in crisis, they cannot address the structural causes.  Alongside the evidence, the interviewees propose that long-term and medium-term solutions involve an effective implementation of HAP - they did not find it effective at that time, although matters have improved - improved regulation of the private rental sector and an increased supply of social housing.  These are the interviewees' own views.  They are quite well informed about what needs to be done after their experiences with Focus Ireland.</p></speech>

It involved interviews with a cross-section of 25 families across the four Dublin local authority areas.  I will cover three findings: what enabled people to exit homelessness; what inhibited people from exiting it; and what were the factors that helped people to sustain their tenancies.  Mr. Harvey will present on the conclusions and recommendations.</p> <p>  We identified three exit enablers, the first of which was the availability of support, specifically information and case management support from Focus Ireland workers; support from child support workers where available; and support from family and friends.  The second enabler was the capacity and tenacity of parents to engage with local authorities and private rental landlords.  This linked to their time spent in homelessness.  The longer they were in homelessness, the less able they appeared to be to engage with those different structures.  The third enabler was the particular family circumstances.  Some families had certain reasons for trying to get out of emergency accommodation, for example, an unplanned pregnancy, someone was unwell or claustrophobia was an issue.  These were drivers.</p> <p>  Of the inhibitors from exiting homelessness, the first was the high stress levels and negative emotions linked to living in emergency accommodation.  The consequences include relationship breakdown, addiction, behavioural problems in children and poor performance in school.  The second was the lack of suitable affordable accommodation in general and in preferred areas of Dublin, specifically near family supports and schools.  The third was the lack of case management and child support work.  Families often had to wait a long time before being allocated a key worker.  The fourth was the practical difficulties associated with finding the necessary child care to enable parents to attend accommodation viewings and secure accommodation.</p> <p>  In contrast, the five factors that helped sustain new tenancies were: affordable rent, ideally deducted at source, with a sense of security for families lucky enough to have been allocated local authority or approved housing body, AHB, accommodation, which was a game changer; the quality, suitability and location of accommodation where it was close to families, friends and schools that made life much easier; the availability of the exceptional needs payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which was a considerable support in fitting out accommodation and enabling families to avoid falling into unnecessary debt; where families had previous experience of living independently, matters moved more quickly, but where families had not lived independently previously, it was a significant challenge; and the shorter the length of time a family spent in homelessness, the quicker the parents and the children were able to adjust to independent living.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Harvey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#D00400"><p>Our first finding was that panic and high stress levels were families' first issue on becoming homeless, followed by a long period of less intense but accumulating stress with boredom and poor conditions.  School was a key stress point.  Many families lose all their possessions at the point of homelessness.  While we need long-term solutions to family homelessness, alleviating stress while homeless is equally important.</p> <p>  Families strongly favoured local authority accommodation because of its security, affordability, standard and location in communities that they knew.  They liked AHBs.  The HAP system was affordable, but not secure.  They did not favour private renting because of its insecurity, high rents and bad conditions.</p> <p>  A key finding was that the construction programme must be weighted heavily in favour of local authority accommodation.  We must accentuate good practices that enable exits from homelessness and address bad practices that inhibit them.  Many of these are low-cost changes to procedures.  In terms of prevention, we must change the system.  When people first approach local authorities to say that they are about to be made homeless, the authorities tell them to return after they have actually become homeless.  That is not a preventative practice.</p> <p>  There must be an end to the practice of self-accommodation.  It is not in accordance with the law, does not work and causes extreme stress.  There must be an end to substandard and overcrowded emergency accommodation where there is a lack of cooking facilities and play areas for children, some of which we have encountered.  There must be an end to the daily practice of signing in in person or by phone, to be replaced by an electronic or text system, given that this is another significant stress point.  There must be an end to the practice of removing families from the housing waiting list without their knowledge or consent, as it means that they return to the bottom of the list, sometimes after spending many years on it.  Systems of scanning, quality control and independent appeals must be applied.  There must be an end to local authorities' "two strikes and out" policy, to be replaced by a test of what is a reasonable offer or refusal and an independent appeals system.</p> <p>  When homeless people finally move into accommodation, it is important that it be furnished and floored.  Many places people moved to had no floors, so they had to handle that themselves.  There must be improved treatment of homeless people in some of the local authority offices where it is poor currently, with dialogue between local authorities and homeless people and training for local authority staff.  There must be some kind of depot or place where people who have become homeless can leave their possessions and reclaim them afterwards.</p></speech>

These are two really important reports, which is one of the reasons we agreed to bring the witnesses before the committee today to discuss them.  It is not just important to give the witnesses the opportunity to put them on the record, but that after this meeting the committee would write to the Minister specifically requesting him to respond to the recommendations that have been set out in the report because we would like to hear what he has to say.  It is very nice to be having an evidence-based discussion on family homelessness, unlike in one of our previous sessions and it is incumbent on us that we listen to the evidence in that respect.</p> <p>  I wish to make a couple of points, primarily to pick up on some of the points Mr. Harvey's made at the end.  One of the things that has happened since the research has been done is that some local authorities have now changed their procedures for what happens when a family presents before the notice-to-quit period expires.  For example, in South Dublin County Council it now gives families access to homeless HAP rates of payment, probably about two months out from the notice-to-quit date.  It would be better if it did it from an earlier period but that is clearly something that should be standardised across all local authorities because it would give people another tool.</p> <p>  The recommendation on self-accommodation is one of the most important elements in the report, given the additional stress it adds to families.  I do not mean just in terms of financing if one is low on credit but the huge efforts people have to go to.</p> <p>  It is important to state that last year South Dublin County Council made a change to how it treats housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants, partly because it realised, rightly, that families in emergency accommodation who had been on the housing list for a long term had a disincentive to go into HAP accommodation.  What South Dublin County Council has now done is ensured that while one is still put on a HAP transfer list, one still has access to choice-based letting on the same terms as one had prior to opting for HAP.  Essentially, it means that while one is not counted in the top line housing list figures one has access to the primary housing list exactly as one would have done previously, which is a very significant change.  Again, we have raised it with the Minister to say that should be rolled out across all local authorities because, essentially, it means that one's access to council housing and the period of time one waits does not change by going into HAP.  It creates a problem in terms of counting the figures but we can just add the HAP figures to the housing list figures and get over that.</p> <p>  On two strikes and out, where a local authority is using choice-based letting for the majority of its lettings then nobody gets an offer and therefore nobody has to refuse it because one applies for it.  Obviously it is different with emergency accommodation.  I strongly support the recommendation that has been made.  There must be some other way of introducing not an element of choice, because that makes it sound like people are choosing properties willy-nilly, but something that gives the applicant or the family in emergency accommodation some degree of decision-making over it.  I have dealt with offers where, for example, families in emergency accommodation who have children with severe special needs were being offered accommodation directly in front of a canal.  When I say directly, I mean outside the gate of the house with no barrier.  In that case there was a severely autistic 18-year old young man.  On the basis of the information alone one can see how it is inappropriate.  In that particular instance it took us some months of fighting with the local authority to withdraw the offer but one should not have to fight in that way.  The independent appeals process is important.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses had any response from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, the Minister or the Department on the recommendations?  The report is important but unless we get a response from them it will not make a difference.  I am interested to hear about that.  I was at the launch of the report.  I genuinely support the recommendations which tally not only with the research but the experience of many of us who are working with lots of families who are presenting as homeless in emergency accommodation.  It confirms what we already know, anecdotally, in the constituency office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#E00200"><p>We have not had a formal response from either the Department or the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  We would welcome if the committee were to ask for a formal response.  On a day-to-day basis our services would be talking about those issues with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and elsewhere.  A formal response from that quarter is probably less appropriate.</p> <p>  The self-accommodation issue continues to be an enormous problem.  To be clear, what is involved in that is once a family has been assessed as homeless under the legislation by the local authority, the local authority believes that it fulfils its statutory obligation by saying "Go and find yourself somewhere to stay tonight and we will pay for it."  We share the view expressed by Mr. Harvey that it is not a correct interpretation of the intention of the Oireachtas when it passed that legislation or of the people when they changed the Constitution to protect the rights of children.  It is hard to get the number but there are more than 250 families who are still self-accommodating so the concentration in Rebuilding Ireland is whether they are in commercial hotels or in hubs and that is where all this debate has been, but we believe what is equally important is the question of the big difference between being in a commercial hotel and knowing one will be there for six months, and being in a commercial hotel and going to be out tomorrow night and having to look for another place.</p> <p>  There are more than 250 families who have no case manager working with them and they may be waiting for several months.  They complained strongly in the course of the research that they were waiting for a case manager.  There have been several occasions when the homeless executive has funded an additional cohort of case managers in Focus Ireland and we very much welcome and appreciate that expenditure.  The case management ratio is about 20 families to one case worker who is skilled and has a degree in social care and other areas.  What has happened is that every time an additional cohort of case managers has been recruited the total number of homeless families has gone up and therefore recreated a waiting list.</p> <p>  The waiting list for children is even greater.  When a family becomes homeless its needs are assessed when it gets a case manager but our trained staff also assess whether there are particular needs for the children, not just a problem arising from the fact that the family is homeless, which is a problem in itself.  We have a number of child support workers funded by the HSE and Tusla but there is a waiting list for that.  In a situation of a family being homeless where it does not have a case manager and it has been assessed as having additional needs for a child there is a waiting list.  The overall problem of homelessness is so large that people are beginning to have to stand back from it but within the reports certain key things have been identified which could make a substantial difference to the experience of families and children who are homeless and the likelihood of them moving out.  We know from our own work that a family which has a case manager is four times more likely to move out of homelessness than a family which is left to its own devices.  From every point of view it makes sense to invest in an adequate number of case managers.</p></speech>

Even the name is indicative of the exceptionally good job it does.  Everything Deputy &Oacute; Broin said is spot on.  He has hit the nail on the head.  What struck me is all the recurring themes.  I served on a council for more than 20 years so none of this is new to me.</p> <p>  What is really scary is that only two weeks ago I had someone in here who was homeless in another county, not where I was involved, and we made representations to Tusla, the Minister and the local authority and we are still waiting for a response.  I refer to a crisis situation.  I am a Member of the Oireachtas and that is the experience I receive as a public representative.  When one rings up local authorities on a regular basis, which I do, the response I get is that the people whom I represent are not homeless yet.  In one case there was an 80-year old woman living in Dundrum who was being put out of her home.  The local authority said it needed evidence.  I said the woman is vulnerable, she is 80 years of age.  She is in a three-bedroom house that is falling down.  I agreed that it was beyond her needs and capacity but she needs something else.  I was asked whether she was on the homeless list because if not, the local authority was not really interested in talking to her.  I asked if the woman could meet somebody to talk to them but there was no interest in that.</p> <p>  Everything the witnesses said is clear.  I thank them for the evidence based on the personal journeys and experiences they have shared with us through the research.  That makes the result even more profound.  I agree with what was said about taking a non-judgmental approach.  It is about dignity and respect for people in those situations.  That is not the experience of people dealing with local authorities.</p><p>I want to hone in on local authorities because they are the housing authorities.  People are being told to self-refer and get out on the road and get their own place.  I live in south County Dublin, where property is very expensive and it is not possible to rent accommodation, even for many who are employed.  I am glad this report is evidence-based.  There is a need for standard practice across all local authority areas because there is an inconsistency in personnel, staff and approach.  I agree about the need for case managers to be personal advocates, mentors or supporters.  Housing is complex and there are many reasons why people are homeless besides affordability.  It needs a case response, a bigger plan, particularly because many children and vulnerable people with mental health problems and a whole range of issues are affected.</p><p> The witnesses say some local authority practices have been identified as the cause of significant stress to homeless families.  We have talked about some of them here.  Can they share some of that with us?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point that there are strong recommendations here and I do not think anyone on this committee would doubt that we should be pursuing them.  We should bring the Minister back in, get an official response and get timelines for rolling it out.  What are the witnesses recommending in terms of an overall charter of rights for people who are homeless? </p><p> Families favour local authority accommodation over other accommodation.  Why cannot HAP, or some other model, provide the same assurances in respect of affordability, security and choice?  HAP is everywhere and there is not enough social housing.  Location is a priority and Mr. Harvey stated "Families very much favoured local authority accommodation because of its security, affordability, standard and location."  People have said that to me too.  I can see why it is the case.  The gap between HAP and affordability and security and so on is a challenge for all of us.  It strikes me that we need a charter of rights and standard practice across all local authority areas for dealing with people who present as homeless.</p></speech>

They could be put out again quite quickly.  They could not do anything to that home.  If they were in a local authority home, in most cases having a good relationship with local authorities when they were tenants, they felt they could reasonably call it their home.  Legally, they had no long-term rights to be in HAP accommodation.  Generally a person in a local authority home will not be put out unless they are responsible for gravely serious anti-social behaviour.  There is a strong sense of security in local authority accommodation which is not the case in the HAP system.</p> <p>  In respect of the local authority practices, the problem is that the local authorities tend to contest that these problems happen.  There is no point of dialogue between homeless people or organisations working with the homeless and the local authorities to address, name and sort out these issues.  We know of some homeless people who complained about the way they were treated and those complaints went nowhere.  Many of these people were in a state of fear about the local authorities.  We have recorded the processes here such as "come back when you are really homeless"; "go and self-accommodate yourself"; "sign in daily".  In one extreme case, a woman in emergency accommodation was going into town every day from the airport, with two children in a buggy, to sign in in person and meet three members of staff: a garda, a person who then signed her in and a case worker.  Each of them went through her file, even though it had not changed since the previous day.  Then she walked back out to the airport and had to do the same thing again the next day.  Others had a car and were driving from distant parts of the city to sign in in person.  This causes intense stress to homeless people.  We recorded instances of homeless people breaking down in tears in offices and of children wetting themselves.  One more sympathetic staff member said "I'm tired of you breaking down in tears in my office, go home, don't come back to me again.  You can sign in by phone instead."  We do have mobile phones and text messaging so why are those systems not used?  There is also a practice of taking homeless people off the housing list when they do not know about it.  The local authority says it tried to contact the people but these people genuinely have no knowledge of such contact ever having happened.  They took the view that if the Revenue Commissioners or the social welfare office were looking for them they would have found them.</p></speech>

It might seem that if a person turns down a first offer they should take the second one.  The problem is that the first offer is often not in a place that the person applied for.  I can think of a father in one case and a mother in another who said they could not bring their children there because the place was in very bad condition and, more important, it was surrounded by drug pushers, people shooting up and needles.  They said they would not attempt to rear their children in those conditions.  That is why they said no and took the risk of a second offer.  The second offer is normally a lot better.  There is a sense among some homeless people that a really bad first offer is being cynically offered so that they will feel under much greater pressure to accept the second offer.<br/><br/>Private accommodation should be furnished but often is not.  Local authority accommodation should be furnished but not only is it not furnished but it is often not floored either.  The people then have to find money from their own resources, if they still have it, or go to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which generally does provide it.  The way in which that is done was one of the strong good points in the report.<br/><br/>The poor treatment in local authority offices needs to be recognised and accepted, not denied.  We have suggested dialogue but while local authorities by definition have authority, it strikes me that there is scope for the Minister to issue guidelines to them as to what is a reasonable standard of behaviour and to say there should be an independent appeals system and scanning of the removal of people from the local authority list.  Instructions, guidelines or a <i>desiderata</i>of what they should do could issue from the Minister.  That should be treated seriously by the local authorities but it would also mean that the advocates and the Focus Ireland case workers could go to local authorities and say that what they are doing is not in line with what the Minister has said should be the normal practice.  Yes, there could be a charter of rights provided there is a mechanism to implement it, complain and work through it but the Minister should also say that the standard in respect of the points we have highlighted here in local authorities should be much better.</p></speech>

In our examination of how people avoided becoming homeless they found the single most important thing they got from Focus Ireland was being treated properly.  That built their confidence.  They realised it was not their fault and it motivated them to persist, work and pursue this.  That was the single major factor that enabled them to avoid homelessness.  It is important and it is a practical point because otherwise motivation is lost, people become depressed and are unable to act to solve their own problems.  Then they find themselves victimised even more because they are accused of being unable to solve their own problems.  It helps to avoid homelessness, as well as to deal with being homeless.  Some kind of training and capacity building for local authority and other staff would have to be added to guidelines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#F00600"><p>The reservations that families have about HAP - I am sure this is true for individuals too - are based on objective facts, which are a result of specific public policies.  Therefore, the way to deal with their reservations is not to put more pressure on them to take offers they do not want to take but to change the public policies which make that form of housing insecure.</p><p>The big answer is more social housing, but there are smaller answers immediately available.  The first, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has mentioned, is the policy used in south County Dublin to integrate the HAP transfer list with the housing list.  This would make a huge difference to the reality of people accepting HAP offers.  If one has been on the housing list for ten years and takes a HAP offer and knows that is it and that one is now back to the bottom of the housing list, it is a huge disincentive.  There is absolutely no reason why what was introduced in south Dublin could not be introduced everywhere else and made policy rather than just an individual positive measure.</p><p> The second answer concerns security.  People, if they move into private rented accommodation, get a Part 4 tenancy for six years but they know that if the landlord is going to sell up or renovate the property, he can terminate the tenancy at any point.  Again, as Focus Ireland has argued, these loopholes which allow landlords to evict tenants at will when they want to sell up, or say they want to sell up, should be removed for all private sector combination buy-to-lets.  This would make HAP more attractive.</p><p> Someone on a HAP tenancy pays the differential rent but when the rent goes up, as it is allowed to by 4%, very often the amount that the local authority will pay under HAP does not go up.  There is very little discussion of this.  There seems to be no policy to ensure that that follows.  The State says the landlord can put up the rent by 4% but takes no responsibility to pay that, so people in HAP premises are finding themselves paying the differential rent and making up a gap between the rent and the actual amount being paid.  Under rent supplement this was illegal.  It was widespread but at least it was acknowledged publicly as wrong and illegal.  Under HAP, it appears to be treated as if it is perfectly okay.  This drives people into much deeper poverty and below their minimum threshold of income and makes HAP less attractive because they know they will be squeezed.  That is the issue with HAP.</p><p> Regarding what has been said about the local authorities, the stories the families tell need to be listened to.  As Mr. Harvey correctly says, local authority staff have a different perspective.  Most local authority staff are courteous and hard-working, and we recognise the huge pressure they are under, but the absence of guidelines and training for front-line staff in dealing with these hugely pressured situations is sadly missing.</p><p> Finally, if the public discourse about homelessness presents people who are homeless as gamers and scammers who are essentially trying to cheat the system, the front-line staff inevitably respond by trying to catch them out.  If the relationship between a public servant and a citizen needing support is one in which the public servant feels he or she is being cheated, if that is the public discourse, it is very hard to make that a supportive and human relationship.  This is why we so strongly reacted to the comments of the chair of the Housing Agency and why we do not think he is suitable to hold that post.</p></speech>

I have had dealings with the local authorities and some of the staff of Focus Ireland, who have been doing an excellent job but the problem is that the system is wrong.  Mr. Allen brought up HAP, for example.  I will give the committee two recent examples of my representations in this regard.  One took place on Monday, the other on Friday, when I met a lady who was in arrears and whose son had moved back into the family house.  Her rent had doubled and, because she had not cleared the associated arrears, her HAP payment was cut from the end of December.  We are now into February and she is still paying off whatever the sum is weekly to HAP.  Unless she clears her arrears, which she has 12 weeks to do, those administering HAP will not put her back on the system.  She is therefore getting no HAP and is also clearing her rent arrears.  It just does not make sense.  I said to those administering HAP that there must be an appeals process in place to give her that extra little time.  They refused.  HAP will only allow a tenant 12 weeks to clear his or her arrears.  If he or she does not do so within 12 weeks, they do not want to know and they cut the tenant off.</p> <p>  Another experience I had was through working through the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  These are people who come to my clinics on foot of a referral from the society and have just become homeless.  There is no help out there for them.  It is the system that is wrong.  I met a lady who, through no fault of her own - I know the family well - handed back her house eight years ago to the local authority.  I will correct Mr. Harvey on local authorities.  The reason she left was anti-social behaviour, of which she was a victim.  There was nothing the local authority could do for her.  Tenants who do not pay their rent to the local authorities are evicted.  A local authority tenant is not evicted, however, if he or she causes anti-social behaviour - there is no such legislation - yet tenants who do not pay their rent to the local authorities will be brought to court by them for the rent.  This seems to be the way in which HAP is administered too.  It is all about arrears.  The lady to whom I refer is off the housing list.  Naturally, when one hands back a key, one is off it for five years.  This was agreed, and there was no problem.  She had been off the list for five years - she has been off it for eight years now - and had a small amount of arrears of &euro;800.  She qualified to go back on the housing list, but until she clears her &euro;800 arrears, those administering HAP will not put her back on the payment.  Therefore, she is now paying out &euro;1,000 a month on rent and does not qualify to go on HAP because she has arrears of a few hundred euro.  I suggested that she would pay it in instalments but they did not want to know.</p> <p>  It is the system that is wrong.  I see this with Focus Ireland.  I know it is going around working with people, but what can it do if the system cannot be beaten?  We were talking about rent recently.  Rent increases have become humongous.  I see this in Carlow, my area, where rent has increased from &euro;700 a month to &euro;1,000 a month.  Then one fights with those administering HAP to get the extra increase.  In fairness, if a tenant has a good case, they will give him or her the extra bit but there is no wider help there.  The rent pressure zones are not working, as the witnesses know from the report.  The landlords are increasing the rent and the people cannot afford to come up with it.  We now have soup kitchens.  In my constituency we have set up what we would know as a soup kitchen.  This is the era we are living in.  It does not make sense.</p> <p>  What do we do?  I know Focus Ireland's role is to speak to those involved but what can all of us do?  We need to give those affected information and tell them their entitlements but this can only happen if the system is changed and everyone works together.  I have noticed lately that if I make representations about a case in which I know the person will become homeless again, it is the same situation: I am told to come back when they are homeless.  Then the person rings Focus Ireland, which, by the way, does a great job.  I am not giving out about it.  However, what do we do?  I had representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in with me again the other day to try to help the woman to whom I referred earlier to clear her arrears.  As those administering HAP will not look at the case, what role are we all going to play?  The biggest issue facing us is lack of housing, including apartments.  Unless the system is changed, the suggested solutions will not work.  Focus Ireland plays a very positive role.  We seem to be knocking the county councils here.  As Mr. Allen said, county councils are going with what they are told to do.  They are implementing legislation.  That is what I was told yesterday and that is fine.</p> <p>  Does Focus Ireland buy houses?  When it meets a family that is homeless - and it is great that it does so - and sits down with them and helps them with awareness of their rights and entitlements, does it follow up on this through the local authorities?  I know the local authorities ring Focus Ireland and tell its staff when they have cases of people who are ready to become homeless.  What exactly is Focus Ireland's role in this regard?  Does Focus Ireland follow up on this?  Does it go back and work with the local authority?  Does it go back to the family?  Does it keep in contact with the families until they are sorted?  I could outline to the witnesses five or six cases I know of that need help from Focus Ireland.  I acknowledge it helps such cases and does a great job but unless it looks at the system, it will not work.  Focus Ireland's biggest problem is HAP.  HAP is only what is called rent allowance, and I think that is people's confusion.  That is exactly what it is; it is no different.  One gets one's form, fills it in and stays on the housing list.  One can stay on the housing list while on HAP.  One only comes off the housing list through RAS, and there is massive confusion over RAS and HAP.</p></speech>

There is not one I would fail to support.  A few themes shine through from what has been written and said.  The success of the Focus Ireland policy of appointing case managers is striking, as they deal with people on a one to one basis, are non-judgmental and understand the nuances and individual circumstances of each person facing or in homelessness while providing assistance.  Being in someone's corner makes a huge difference, as evidenced by the fact that there was a result in 34 out of 35 cases, which is positive.</p><p>Another theme that emerges strongly is the position in which the system puts people when they become homeless.  Is there anything more stressful in people's lives than facing homelessness?  Perhaps divorce or the death of a spouse, while some surveys have shown that going to war is up there, but it is one of the three or four most stressful life events a human could face, yet the system says people have to provide their own accommodation and sign in on a daily basis when there are clear alternatives such as texting.  An issue that is constantly raised with me but which has not been mentioned in this discussion is the lack of storage facilities in which people can store their worldly goods.  The provision of such facilities is recommended in the report.  This is perhaps the most stressful situation someone will face, yet the system forces him or her to jump through a series of petty and humiliating hoops as though they are being punished for the crime of being homeless.  This highlighted in the report which calls for a complete reversal of culture, which is entirely what is needed.</p><p>I read with interest the survey of the primary reasons people face homelessness.  It is overwhelmingly down to issues in the private rented sector such as notice to quit to allow the sale of property.  Mr. Harvey has mentioned that rent arrears and rent increases account for approximately 80% of cases.  The interviewees picked three issues thated need to be addressed, one of which was regulation of the private rented sector.  Clearly, that is an issue to be addressed in this discussion.  I was a wee bit surprised that none of the 35 cases that were managed referred to notice to quit on the grounds of substantial refurbishment or renovation because my experience is that the number of so-called renovictions is on the increase.  It is the excuse <i>du jour</i>for landlords who are moving away from the sale of property to substantial refurbishment when issuing notices to quit.  Will the delegates comment on this?  For example, I am dealing with a case in Cork city which involves a block of apartments, Leeside Apartments, which was purchased last year by a vulture fund.  The prospectus issued by Sherry Fitzgerald when it was being sold referred to the opportunity to refurbish and significantly increase rents to yield more than &euro;1 million a year from the building.  A fresh batch of notices to quit have just been issued because the fund did not do its homework in the first batch.  More than 25 households face homelessness, many of which are families with young children.  The residents have written to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who is a local representative asking for a face to face meeting.  They will ask for the loophole in the law in that regard to be closed entirely and for a ban on economic evictions or, at the very least, a moratorium.  I support the imposition of a full ban in that regard.  Will Mr. Allen comment on the phenomenon of the rise the number of of renovictions?  Is it on Focus Ireland's radar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018021400002#H00300"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I agree with almost everything that has been said.  I am a public representative for 43 years and have long experience of working on housing issues which have always been on my doorstep.  I agree, in particular, with the points made about how local authorities deal with applicants when they first present.  I have always objected to the hatch or counter mentality, particularly where individuals have to discuss personal matters with a queue of people behind them.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  Local authority officials should be instructed to automatically direct people who say they wish to discuss a private or housing matter to a private interview room or a comfortable space in which nobody else can hear what is being discussed.  If that costs money, let it cost money and if councils have to rent other accommodation, that should be done.  Respect for the individual should have primacy.  I commend those in County Louth who work on housing issues, as they do a fantastic job, but when they do not have the facilities or provide the privacy the client needs, that is unacceptable.</p> <p>  Mr. Allen raised the issue of being an advocate for the client.  Many families are able to make a good case, but others are not.  They may have difficulties in communicating because of their educational background or they may not be used to dealing with officialdom and are intimidated by the process.  An advocacy service is important to allow an advocate to accompany the client to the interview and present the case on his or her behalf.  Attending the interview should be a professional service that is provided.  People who are homeless or in acute housing difficulty may not know what the best case scenario is for them.  Sometimes when talking to affected constituents, they mention casually that there is a serious medical problem in the family arising from caring for a child with a disability or someone being treated for cancer and so on.</p><p>Being able to articulate the best case for them is hugely important.  We do it as elected representatives by listening and speaking to them.  Quite often people do not put their best case forward and this is the other role of the advocate or council official.  This is where the training issue comes in.  There should be a national training course and a national standard that everybody must meet.  Universally applied protocols must be in place and it should not be acceptable if they are not applied.<br/><br/>The advocacy bodies for housing are very strong and I welcome them.  In many ways I do not suggest they should be the invigilators of the standard, but we need an independent look at how people are treated and dealt with by local authorities.  This should be somebody outside the local government box.  I would not have a problem if it was carried out collectively.  It would be a professional service by an outside agency and it could be supported in providing it.  We would have the same standards everywhere, we would have qualified people trained to listen and the best case would be put forward for people.<br/><br/>I am quite sure other members and the witnesses also come across people who had been on the housing list for eight years, then left an address but did not tell the local authority where they went and now find themselves cut off the housing list.  If these people can prove they have been living in the community I do not have a problem with sustaining continuation of their housing timeline.  If they leave the jurisdiction that is a different matter.  This is a serious problem I come across it and it needs to be dealt with.<br/><br/>My next problem is on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  My experience of it in Louth is completely the opposite to what we have heard, but that is the personal nature of the service.  More than 2,000 people are in receipt of the HAP in Louth and it is a professional and focused top-class service.  I cannot praise it enough.  If and when I am in contact with the HAP service about a family the staff are fully versed with that family's needs.  They are really on top of their game.  I am sorry this is not happening in every area but I have no doubt it ought to be.<br/><br/>The issue of being non-judgmental has been mentioned.  It does not matter who people are or what their background is, whatever it is no judgment should be made on them.  This is critically important.  Sometimes this is the case.  People <i>in extremis</i>who are homeless might ring me at 5 p.m. telling me the office is closed and asking what they will do, and I will phone the officer.  They are in a dreadful situation.  When people go looking for accommodation even with the HAP, if they are poor or unemployed they may feel inadequate because they are not dressed properly or they cannot speak with the same accent as other people because of where they come from.  They feel absolutely discriminated against.  I have discussed this with a housing body nationally and it funds applicants going for an interview for accommodation by giving them money.  It is not a begging process, but if it feels it can help it will give the person a couple of hundred euro to buy a shirt and tie or a suit so that person presents as well as anybody else.<br/><br/>When landlords are deciding between applicants obviously they are subjective and perhaps they do not like somebody and one does not know why.  The council could be the advocate whereby the HAP officer views a property for rent and asks to take it.  I do not know whether this makes sense, but the council could be an agent that fills the property with its clients.  In other words, the landlord would effectively let to the local authority.  I know this is not a strictly legal case.  This would take away discrimination by landlords who can and do discriminate against families who come from poor backgrounds.  I do not have to spell it out.  These are the types of changes that are needed.<br/><br/>I agree with the main point that has been made on evictions.  I have heard about many of them.  The number of people who come to me with their notice to get out has increased exponentially in the past year.  I challenge the person and I ask to see the letter.  I then telephone the landlord involved to see whether he or she does have a sister living in England.  In many cases what the landlords say is not true, but they use it to get the person out.<br/><br/>This has been a very helpful debate and I thank the witnesses.  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak.  This is positive determined collective progress that will articulate the change needed in officialdom and in how people are approached.  Above all there should be respect for everybody and the words I want to hear are support, help, advocacy and empathy.  We know when somebody who comes to us is not getting this.  We know when they are angry and when nobody is listening to them.  We need a sea change, and I recommend the Louth staff with whom I deal.  We must have best practice, and nothing less than that will do or will be acceptable.  The louder the witnesses shout at us the more we must get on with fixing the problem and ensure people are respected and treated fairly and properly.</p></speech>

One was on advocacy and having an advocate to put the case.  We asked all of the families whether they feel more confident now and whether, if they were confronted by this again, they could handle it themselves and manage it.  Not all, but almost all, said they could, but they would want and need an advocate with them.  They stated they understand their rights much better but they are not confident they could meet the Residential Tenancies Board or the agencies involved.  The day that people feel they do not need an advocate with them when going to these offices, and feel they will be fairly treated and will be able to respond in a comfortable manner is the day we should all look forward to.</p> <p>  On the issue of renovictions, in a way the Deputy answered the question himself.  The people we were looking at had avoided homelessness and their experience came from 18 months to nine months ago.  At that period, the situations mostly involved landlords with one or two properties who were going the simple route and thought they would get away with it.  Committee members might be amazed by how many of them got the letters wrong and, of course, they were spotted immediately.  Support in this regard gave tenants another three months to stay in their housing.  If anybody is playing the system now it is landlords, because we are seeing far more corporate vulture funds and corporate landlords.  The professionalisation of the landlord system is going in the wrong direction.  It is going corporate professional and vulture fund professional.  They are the ones playing the system and this is the effect we are seeing.</p></speech>

A year ago, my colleague, Dr. Cathy Walsh, and I did a study for the Housing Agency on why families were becoming homeless.  The question has a certain artificiality for many homeless people.  In some cases landlords said they wanted to increase the rent and they knew the tenants could not afford it.  In other cases they stated they needed the property for a relative or that they wanted to renovate the property.  The point is the tenants do not know.  In some renovation cases the tenants have said they went past the house and it was not being renovated.  In these cases even though renovation may be the stated reason a rent increase and a desire to get in a higher paying tenant may actually be the reason.</p> <p>  The reason tenants feel so powerless in this situation is a critical one that is not often mentioned.  The most important thing a leaving tenant needs from a former landlord is a letter of reference.  If tenants argue they will not get a letter of reference.  Arguing about why they are being put out is not something tenants want to do because a letter of reference for their next potential landlord is absolutely the most precious thing they can get.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any local authority that has a system for checking this information.  There is an obvious feedback system which would enable local authorities to become part of policing this.  When people inform the local authority that they have received a notice of termination because their accommodation is being put up for sale, the local authorities should automatically verify whether this is true.  Currently, if anyone wishes to contest the reasons given by the landlord, he or she can go to the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p> The State must police its own laws.  While we recognise that successive Governmen</p><p>ts have recently introduced a number of additional rights for private rental tenants, for instance, the rent control systems and additional requirements on people choosing to sell up, it has not done anything to police these rights.  We hear people make the case that rent control is not working.  A system that pushes against the market, is not policed and does not have penalties will not work.</p><p> Landlords have an major economic interest in doing exactly what the previous speaker described.  If we are to prevent them from doing this, we need not only legislation but systems for checking up on what is being done.  I find it incredible that local authorities put so many questions to families and spend public money on hotel rooms, family hubs and so forth, yet they do not have a system for checking whether an eviction is being carried out for the reasons given.  They should do this as a means of protecting public funds. </p></speech>

It is very useful to have an evidence based report and I note also that we are already discussing what we, as legislators, can do to advance some of the issues under discussion.</p> <p>  Does Focus Ireland intend carrying out an analysis in other counties?  Can the findings of the report be extrapolated nationwide or are there likely to be differences in other counties?  I am a Green Party Senator from Waterford.  I met Mr. David Niblock, Focus Ireland's south east co-ordinator, about a year ago when we visited some of the housing the organisation provides.  I am concerned about the energy standards that apply when renovations are being carried out.  We need to provide cosy homes for tenants.  The Government should provide additional funding to ensure the accommodation offered by Focus Ireland to people who need housing is of good quality in terms of energy efficiency.</p> <p>  I have some concerns.  The witnesses spoke about systems change and a change in culture.  How will this come about?  Members have been given some tasks that would help change the system.  I am concerned because the cost of living is increasing.  Will the gap between the haves and haves-not increase in the next three years?  We have a problem with supply and homelessness has become a concern.  The word "resilience" and the actions being taken to build resilience jumped out of the reports.  It is extremely important that the Government recognises the importance of the educational aspect to avoid the crisis that people are experiencing. </p> <p>  The Acting Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, spoke about strike-off.  In County Waterford people who refuse accommodation based on their personal circumstances, for example, because a child has a disability, are being struck off.  Some of these cases are complex.  What can be done to ensure local authorities recognise that people presenting as homeless are not just a number in their little red books but individuals with complex cases who need to be shown respect on that basis?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which have given members some clear direction.  What more can the Government do to support Focus Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in light of the importance of the work they do?</p></speech>

Every time the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government appears before the joint committee, I speak about the housing assistance payment and the system but I do not believe he is listening.  Have the witnesses met the Minister to discuss their reports?  What has been the Minister's feedback with regard to the system and the possibility of introducing an additional appeals mechanism as a temporary measure?  We have a housing crisis which I hope will be resolved in the next year or two.  I have asked the Minister to introduce some form of appeals mechanism.  Have the witnesses discussed the matter with the Minister?</p></speech>

During Senator Murnane O'Connor's contribution, I was struck by something which I would like to share because it illustrates the extent of the problem.  A number of county councillors have made representations to Wicklow County Council on this issue.  I have received in writing a clear policy statement from the county council, which has had a number of chief executives, including acting chief executives, in the past year or two.  No one in the Customs House seems to be interested in addressing this issue.  I refer to the refusal on the part of Wicklow County Council to allow public representatives to advocate or accompany people affected by the homeless crisis.  When I sought to make representations on behalf of a woman I met, the executive of the council refused to meet me.  I forced the issue by insisting on having the reasons for the county council's refusal to meet me set out in writing.</p> <p>  I was contacted by a woman with literacy and mental health problems who has been in and out of Newcastle hospital.  The county council refused to allow county councillors, Deputies or Senators to accompany her to meet officials.  This is a measure of the difficulties being experienced by public representatives. </p> <p>  The witnesses made a number of recommendations and members will not fall short in terms of pursuing them, whether through legislation or guidelines. </p></speech>

The research carried out by Dr. Walsh and Mr. Harvey is focused on Dublin only because it essentially studied the family action team, which is funded by the four local authorities in Dublin.  In general, when carrying out research, we try to look outside Dublin.  An increasing proportion of homelessness is in Dublin but we need to be clear about what is happening elsewhere.  We also have a greater capacity in Dublin to understand what is happening from where we are sitting because of the range of services we run.  There tends to be a slightly greater level of fragmentation outside Dublin and Focus Ireland is not necessarily in a position to do the research.  It is not right that the largest research budget in homelessness is being provided by a voluntary sector organisation and funded by individual donations and corporate support.  The State should allocate a percentage of the money it is spending on homelessness for the type of research work Focus Ireland and others are doing.  It is in a much better position to do this work and it should then publish the findings because many of the reports carried out by the State are not published.</p> <p>  Focus Ireland does not operate in all counties, specifically in the west and midlands where we work with partners.  Our services are different in different counties, depending on history, our relationships with the relevant local authority and so forth. </p> <p>  We meed the Minister reasonably regularly and we will meet the new principal officer on housing, Mr. David Kelly, later this morning when he visits Focus Ireland's offices.  These meetings are constructive in broad terms, although we have a fundamental disagreement with the Department.  Nevertheless, we also recognise the progress being made and work being done.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what will happen in the next three years.  Housing is being delivered in the private sector, through new social housing units and, I understand, through an increase in rented accommodation.</p><p>The demand for housing is growing faster than the supply.  That means the problem is going to get worse, which inevitably will squeeze some people out and into homelessness.  There is a lack of acknowledgment of those facts both in terms of the aspirations or targets to deliver housing and planning to deal with the scale of the problem we will continue to face for the next three years.  This is the first time in my experience of working in homelessness where the Government is not saying it intends to end homelessness and outlining a timescale.  There has been a lot of sneering at the attempts to do that before but we achieved an enormous amount in the run up to 2010, with which Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others will be familiar.  The fact that we failed does not mean we should give up on our aspiration to end homelessness.  It would be much easier, more motivating and meaningful for everybody involved if we identified a period where we acknowledge that the situation will get worse, when we genuinely expect it to turn a corner and what we will do then.  Our fear is that as soon as that corner is turned public attention will move away from these issues and these families and single people will be left in hubs or in emergency accommodation.  Our fear is that we will get used to this high level of homelessness and it will become normalised.  To avoid that situation we need the sort of plan that the Oireachtas laid out.  We would say that the work that was done by the last committee, or the committee that existed in the period before this Government was formed, set out an agenda.  For example, Sl&aacute;intecare is constantly referred to, although people will argue about the extent to which the policy has framed the response to the health issue, and is acknowledged as the framework.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case with housing and homelessness.  The targets that were set have not been adopted and we are still using the targets from before.  We could list many things that the Government needs to do.  We do not need to make up a new list because the committee has already done a lot of that work and the Government should revert back to that report as a framework in terms of its ambition.  </p></speech>

First, the big picture is about the issues that Mr. Allen has described.  Second, we must increase the supply of local authority accommodation because that will take the pressure out of the system and, in terms of our concern in particular, the measure will ensure that homeless people get housed quicker, better, more affordably and in more secure ways.  I would like to stress that our report has laid out short-term and procedural actions that can be changed quite quickly and are not costly.</p> <p>  The real problem is that many local authorities are in denial about this issue around treatment and the procedures that cause great stress, humiliation and so on.  There are two parts to this matter.  First, as has already been identified, it is important that all homeless people get caseworkers and advocacy workers.  Second, there should be no waiting list for them while their vulnerability increases.  In an ideal world they should not need caseworkers and advocacy workers if the system worked well but I digress.</p> <p>  In terms of who can do what regarding these changes, whether it is from storage depots, two strikes and out, prevention, signing in and so on, there is a sense in which local authorities will deny that.  They may well regard Focus Ireland and ourselves, as researchers, as a nuisance to whom one does not need to pay an awful lot of attention.  The Minister and his Department should send out clear and unambiguous signals about what Deputy O'Dowd spoke about, which is the need for respect, better treatment, better procedures and revising, considering, changing and improving them from top to bottom.  I can assure members that they would be much more likely to listen to the Minister than to us.  I also suspect they would be much more likely to listen to members than to us.  Naming the issue, identifying it and bringing this measure up to ministerial and departmental levels to ensure the practical changes are made and signals are sent to the local authorities about what is appropriate and what is not would help.  That is the small but absolutely vital picture that will improve exits from homelessness over the next number of years.    </p></speech>

I understand his funeral takes place this morning which is why the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, cannot be with us.  Our thoughts are with Mr. Fox's family and his colleagues, including those here, and his friends at this very sad time.<br/><br/>Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name, in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I will pass on his sentiments to my colleagues and to the family of our late colleague.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes the investigation of each and every suspicious death very seriously.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand completely that any death regardless of whether it is ultimately deemed to be from natural causes, accidental or premeditated brings significant pain for the deceased&rsquo;s loved ones and, as such, it is vital that they are investigated fully and professionally so families can be provided with answers.  It is also important that each death is recorded accurately on PULSE to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, our stakeholders and society at large has the most up-to-date information available on natural, accidental and suspicious deaths recorded in Ireland at any particular time.  It was in this light that, in July 2016, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau asked the Garda analysis service to conduct a comprehensive analysis of homicides with a domestic motive in the Republic of Ireland over a ten-year period from 2007 to 2016.  The purpose of this analysis was to identify any trends and patterns in homicides recorded in Ireland where domestic abuse may have been a motive.  This data could then be used to inform the development of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's domestic abuse policy and interventions.<br/><br/>In furtherance of this review, cases dealt with by the Office of the State Pathologist, OSP, during 2013, 2014 and 2015 were initially examined by the Garda analysis service.  This examination was carried out to ensure that every case that had a suspicious circumstance or cause of death, which would be pathologically considered to be a homicide, was compared with the PULSE incident classification.  This review identified 41 deaths where, on initial examination, the related PULSE incidents required further analysis from either a PULSE incident classification or data quality perspective.  In January 2017, a working group was established under a chief superintendent that included senior staff from the Garda analysis service to review the PULSE incidents concerned and identify the rational for the PULSE classification and the data quality relating to the 41 deaths.  The review identified a necessity for clarity and consistency regarding the application of the crime-counting rules in the context of the PULSE classification of homicide incidents.  This review found that each of the 41 deaths were investigated.<br/><br/>In September 2017, guidance for classification rules for homicides were agreed upon in order to assist the correct classification of homicide incidents.  Of the 41 deaths, it was identified that 12 deaths required reclassification.  In each of those 12 deaths, family members of the deceased were contacted to inform them of the change in the incident classification and to offer them advice and information on victim support organisations that may be of help to them.  I am conscious of the need to protect the identify of victims and victims&rsquo; families and I am sure the committee will appreciate this concern.  I am also conscious that a number of the 12 cases are before the courts or currently under investigation and may be subject to further classification changes on PULSE.  In order to provide assurance on the validity of PULSE classification, it was decided in consultation with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to extend the review to all homicides back to 2003.  The data for the period 2003 to the present is utilised by the CSO to prepare the publication of crime statistics.  The Policing Authority requested an independent peer review of the quality of the investigations carried out in respect of the 41 cases.  This is now being carried out by the recently established working group.  <br/><br/>As a result of interactions with the CSO and the Policing Authority, the terms of reference for a working group under assistant commissioner, executive support and corporate services were agreed.  The working group has been tasked with undertaking the following: an independent peer review of the quality of the investigations carried out in respect of the 41 cases for which investigations have not yet concluded or reached the courts; dip sampling to establish the degree to which PULSE is updated in a timely manner with outcomes from the higher courts; and all homicide cases from 2003 to 2017 to be reviewed including fatal road traffic collisions.  The working group will also monitor PULSE to identify any new homicide incidents from 1 January 2018 to ensure that they are appropriately classified.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very conscious of the need to ensure we have a high quality data across all crime areas to assist us in preventing and detecting crime to protect and support communities and victims of crime.  We have introduced a number of measures in this regard and more are planned.  It is also vital that there is a culture throughout the organisation of correctly recording data.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully recognises the need to provide the public and our other stakeholders with correct data so that issues affecting policing are based on accurate information.  That is why we are continually examining our processes and have expended so much time and effort to ensure our data in respect of crimes, including homicides, is accurate.<br/><br/>I fully accept that the review process could have been quicker.  However, this is a highly complex area - often of a very complicated, fluid<b></b>and sensitive nature, relating to case files, and each and every case being analysed and reviewed.  Given the seriousness of the crimes involved, it is important that this process is thorough, detailed and robust.  Any issues identified from this further review will be comprehensively addressed.<br/><br/>This matter was discovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The process to date has identified issues that we are addressing so they cannot happen again.  I can assure the committee that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken this matter very seriously and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

When I looked at the incident classification and some of the surrounding information, I could not square how an incident had been classified in the way that it had, given the information available.  I felt some contradicted our own crime counting rules on the basis of the information available.  For example, I was looking at incidents in which an injured party was deceased and the offence was down as an assault causing harm.  Our own crime recording rules state an assault causing harm where subsequently someone dies because of the assault should be upgraded to a homicide.  We had such examples on the system.  There were sudden deaths which looked as if they were being investigated as homicides.  As a sudden death is seen as non-crime, there were times when I could not reconcile what had been included.  </p> <p>  The other concern I had was about the methodology used.  There were views that the methodology used and approach members of my team took were limited.  I felt that was incorrect.  The limiting factor suggested we were reliant on only two sources.  We always said we would be reliant on only two sources - PULSE and the State Pathologist's reports.  We always said that to get a more rounded view of the classification, we needed to go to the case files.  That is what we were arguing for.</p></speech>

Again, the homicide review was raised.  In fairness to Dr. Singh, it was in the context of issues related to dangerous driving causing death.  However, I think he did say the database had been rectified.  In that reference was he trying to indicate that the homicide review issue had been resolved at that stage?</p></speech>

When they were raised, we did have a look at the internal system and began to identify some of the problems on the system.  To me, the roads policing side of the issue has always been slightly different from the homicide aspect.  Many of the homicides were already on the system.  It is not that they were misclassified <i>per se</i>but how they had been classified.  They were being obscured and we began to identify them.  I went into the meeting on that date with the assumption that the database had been rectified.  However, I was notified subsequently that some of the changes still had to be made.  In the process of the making the changes some other issues began to rise.  Therefore, we needed to ensure the changes were made subsequently.</p></speech>

I also congratulate the Garda on the quite considerable recent success in tackling the distribution of child abuse material.  It was a considerable success in combatting a heinous crime.  That is worth noting.  I have a number of questions, some of which arise from Deputy O'Callaghan's questions and the first of which is addressed to Assistant Commissioner Finn.  Does he agree it would be a cause of grave public concern and would be very serious if it was the case that any unlawful deaths were not properly investigated?</p></speech>

How did it come to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there was a discrepancy or that there might be any issue regarding the recording of homicides?</p></speech>

This process started in July and the end of the year had been reached before that three-year period was completed.  I say that to demonstrate that a significant amount of work would be required to go back to 2013, given how long it took to analyse that segment alone.  That was an internal review instigated by the Garda.  As each of the cases was examined, issues relating to classification did arise.  That was the context in which Dr. Singh and his people said to us that 41 homicides from that batch required examination, because there were concerns around classification.  That is how the process started.  It started internally, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carrying out its own review and unearthing these issues, which we determined would require further analysis.</p></speech>

However, when we looked on the PULSE system, such an incident might not be recorded there as a homicide.  It was often recorded in a lesser group - a non-crime group, such as sudden death.  Alternatively, it might be recorded as an assault.  The report that we had from the Office of the State Pathologist did not correspond to what was recorded on PULSE.  That said, there was always a missing piece of information, namely, the investigation file.  The investigation file may have recorded some other issues which led to the incident's classification.  That is why, when the issue was initially raised with me in discussion with the analysts, I decided to raise this problem with the executive.  It was about November when we raised the problem.  I felt that we needed to have a look at this, but we needed to review the case files in order to get a fuller picture.</p></speech>

My next question concerns the review.  I do not refer to the independent peer review that has been announced, but the review of the initial group of cases.  My understanding is that the Garda data analysts checked how deaths were classified in the crime records but did not have sight of the full case files.  It was therefore not possible to check if homicide investigations were conducted in all cases that warranted a homicide investigation.  Further, it is my understanding that where analysts found problems with the classification of some homicides, the people who were contacted to clarify any queries were the superintendents in charge of the initial investigation.  Is that an accurate reflection of that review and the way it was conducted?</p></speech>

Initially, that examination was done in the context of the classification issue.  As part of that process, the group spoke to the district officers concerned.  They raised the query around classification and inquired about the investigation file.  That liaison took place with the investigating members of various districts to see what happened to those particular investigations.  Following that interaction, the team that was looking at the examination was able to confirm that each of those 41 cases had been investigated.   However, the analysts did have some concerns about the way they were classified, because the classifications of the cases on PULSE did not tally with what Dr. Singh and his people were finding at the Office of the State Pathologist.  This was where the synchronisation of the two had to take place.</p></speech>

As such, there was not really any independent oversight.</p><p>They confirmed that they were satisfied that these investigations were carried out to the adequate standard for a homicide investigation but, of course, that is what one would expect them to do, given that they had carried out these investigations in the first place.</p></speech>

The Policing Authority asked would it not be prudent to get a peer review done of these investigations in order that everyone would be satisfied.  Therefore, we brought forward Mr. Sutton and his team to get in someone independent to do that reassessment in order that we could reassure everyone for once and for all that these investigations were carried out and were compliant with Article 2 and that we now have them classified in the correct order so that the CSO, when it publishes its homicides statistics, can state with confidence it has all these homicides correctly recorded and can publish those statistics.  That is the process that is taking place at present.</p></speech>

We flagged these up with a view to looking at them.  The initial review did go out and ask those who had conducted the investigations about the questions asked.  My understanding was that subsequently the investigation files were sought and drawn back in centrally for review.  Again, this review process was separate to the analysis.  I think the Policing Authority then raised the issue with us to ask, again, whether we should have this peer-reviewed with a senior investigating officer, which is sensible enough and a fair enough suggestion.  This was then agreed to, and those are the beginnings of this new process.</p></speech>

We must understand and accept that some of these investigations are live, still ongoing, so their statuses will change as the investigations proceed.

One of the issues that I think is causing concern is the fact that we do not have even an indicative timeline.

We have very little sense of when it will be complete, and the public and the committee deserve a date.  What is the longest period it might take?</p></speech>

First, there are two bodies of work that need to be done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first is the classification and whether the files were correctly or incorrectly classified and, if they were not classified, the reasons for that.  The second is the investigation.  Was the investigation carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights?  I will talk the committee through the process.  It can happen, and has happened on numerous occasions, in respect of the 41 cases that have been highlighted in 2013, 2014 and 2015, that someone is assaulted in one district, is brought to hospital and dies two months later and this is recorded in that hospital as a sudden death.  Then an investigation is conducted and someone is arrested, prosecuted, charged - let us say with murder - and convicted of manslaughter.  It still stays on PULSE as a sudden death.  The work done by the analysis service looked at the results of the State Pathologist's office and saw blunt force trauma to the head was the cause of death and then looked at the corresponding incidents on PULSE and it went down as a sudden death, not a homicide, so there was a fault there.  This concerns the 41 cases.  We will look at them, their classification and the reasons they were not updated.  There is now a process in place to ensure this does not happen again.</p> <p>  The second part of this is, in compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to look at the investigation.  Of the 41 cases, a number are before the courts and have been dealt with before the courts, a number have been dealt with by the coroner's courts and a number are still live investigations.  In compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, my team will look at the investigations into these cases to see whether they are compliant and whether they are correctly or incorrectly classified.  Does that address the Deputy's issues?</p></speech>

I appreciate the explanation and I am better enlightened but there was a specific question.  When one is putting together a group such as this, there must be some sense of how long the process will take.  If Mr. Sutton could offer either a minimum or a maximum, I think it would improve our confidence and the public confidence in this process.  This cannot be an indefinite process.</p></speech>

The review will be done in a thematic fashion whereby various aspects of the investigation will be looked at.  It is not possible for me to say it will take six months or nine months.  I am just not able to say that.  I have prioritised the 41 cases for years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  However, the analysis service has also been tasked with looking at 2017, 2016 and right back to 2003 and, if there are issues with those cases, to send them over to the review team for us to look at.</p></speech>

We must be mindful that not everything is in our control here.  For example, we are reliant on access to the State Pathologist's lab and so are reliant on their goodwill.  We have only one person who is very expert in this area to whom we are assigning this job, so I would say about five to six months.  I refer to the review of those pathological reports and looking at the comparison with PULSE.  Then there is the question of the investigations.  They froze up, so I cannot comment on how long that part of the review would take.</p></speech>

For example, the incidents related to fatal collisions, dangerous driving causing death, that type of information will be extrapolated from our IT system in a much quicker way.  We can therefore get that aspect of the work done quickly.  Dr. Singh's work on the homicides, the murders and the manslaughters, will take more time, but we will be able to get the traffic work done quickly and out of the way in order that when Dr. Singh's people come with the analysis from their consultation with the State Pathologist, we will be able to conclude that much more quickly.</p></speech>

I found the description of the events during Deputy O'Callaghan's questioning quite extraordinary.  I find it remarkable that there was to be a discussion at the Policing Authority on 27 April and a report was furnished to the Policing Authority specifically on these matters and that Dr. Singh and his team did not have sight of it.  I find this almost impossible to comprehend.  Would the assistant commissioner agree that this is comparable to a discussion taking place at the Policing Authority involving significant drugs issues and the Garda national drugs and serious crime unit not having sight of the report?</p></speech>

The error, however, was made in that we did not sit down with the analysts and raise or surface the issue of whether the investigations had all been properly classified.  That was probably one of the most significant issues with which we had to deal initially.  From that engagement we discovered that there had been inconsistencies in the manner in which 108 district officers across the State had interpreted our crime counting rules.  They had been done in a slightly different way but none was incorrect.  They had taken a slightly different interpretation of them.  It is important that during the work we did between April and September we sat down with the analysts and worked out the criteria, on which we all agreed, for measuring and classifying all of the incidents.  That is the piece of work that took us from April to September.  We did not just sit down with the analysts; we also sat down with staff from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which has a particular interest as it is tasked with producing statistics for homicides for Ireland and the European Union.  A lot of work was going on behind the scenes on issues the CSO had brought to the table with the classifications.  Once the issue of homicides classification had been raised with the Policing Authority, the CSO looked at its figures and raised some other issues for us with the classifications.  We worked with it on all of the issues it had raised with how incidents had been classified.  This work was ongoing in tandem with the review of the 41 incidents.  It was not just a case of sitting down and not progressing the issue between April and September; a lot of work was ongoing.  There is the broader picture on all of the data available, not just the homicides, on which we are focusing in the 41 cases.  As I said in my opening statement, it is important to have all of the data correct.</p></speech>

My final question is for Dr. Singh.  This process had its roots in the process described in July 2016.   At what stage between July 2016 and 27 April 2017 did it come to light internally that there were discrepancies?  Can Dr. Singh put a date on when the discrepancies became apparent in the documents from the State Pathologist and the PULSE system?</p></speech>

With regard to one of my recommendations at that stage, I said we had two pieces of information, the PULSE record and the State Pathologist's reports, but we were missing a very important element  - the investigation file.  The investigation file can help us to begin to understand the classification.  We needed three bits of information to be assured that what we had on the PULSE system was correct.  It was at that stage that I made a suggestion that we review the cases to satisfy ourselves that the classification was correct.  At that stage it was agreed that a group would be put together to do this.</p></speech>

We had conducted an internal review of the investigations.  We did not go back to the analysts.  That is where the issue arose, as raised by the Policing Authority.  We went back and sat down with the analysts and agreed on how we would classify and how the crime counting rules would be interpreted in the 41 incidents.  The initial review had focused on the investigations and whether an investigation had been carried out.  It looked at the information gathered on the post mortems, the covering note on the files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, at whether directions had come back from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the verdicts of the courts or the Coroner's Court.  That was the type of information we had gathered on the investigations, but the analysts still had concerns that we had not looked at the classifications.  That is why we went back to review them again.</p></speech>

I want to come back to Dr. Singh on the matter.

Was Dr. Singh frustrated by this?</p></speech>

First, one must be mindful that when we raised this issue in November, part of the purpose was to say we had concerns.  That is important.  We wanted to actually have this exercise and run it by the review group to see if the concerns were real.  That was the purpose.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we got to see the final report, I have already said we did not get an opportunity to sign off on the final report, for whatever reason.  When we did review it, there were elements with which clearly we could not agree.</p></speech>

I thought this was important because the review team had contained analysts and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If we were to argue that it was to be a joint approach, it was really important that I be able to say I had confidence in it also.  I wrote to the management team which was there on the day.  That letter was subsequently leaked after which - I am sure people were organising in the background - we were to have a look at the review again to highlight our concerns to see if we could address them.</p></speech>

I had taken time to reflect on the meeting and wrote my note.  My concern was that we had not had a full opportunity to review the final document.  We asked that the classifications be looked at again in order that we could all have confidence in them and sign off on them.  It has taken a little time because there has been some debate, but I am happy enough that our concerns have been addressed with the classifications.</p></speech>

I offer my sympathy to the family of the late Detective Superintendent Colm Fox and his colleagues.</p> <p>  I do not want to repeat points made by others, but there are two issues, the first of which is the recording and classification of homicides, while the second is the internal review.  There is no doubt that the misclassification of a homicide is probably one of the worst things that could be envisaged for the people affected.</p><p>We have met them over the years.  There are plenty of them and they formed the background of the cases which went to the independent review mechanism which the previous Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, established.  They were people who have lived for decades with dissatisfaction around investigations into homicide matters where they never received closure.  That the most serious crime imaginable could be misclassified and, potentially, not investigated properly is a hugely traumatic experience for people who have lost loved ones.</p><p> In April 2017 when the story initially raised its head, Deputy Commissioner Twomey said there were some minor issues as to the classification of some homicides.  We learned in February this year that 89 road deaths over 14 years were not classified on PULSE and had to be reclassified while 12 cases of domestic homicide over a two-year period had to be reclassified.  Does senior Garda management continue to stand over the comment that these issues are minor?</p></speech>

That does not reflect what we do on the ground.  In fact, the review of the investigations we looked at did not find that cases were not properly investigated.  While, as my colleague outlined, they were not recorded with the correct classification on our IT system, when one delves into the investigation files, one finds they were investigated.  There are investigation files to go to.  On road traffic collisions, there were fatal collisions which were investigated and directions came back subsequently to charge someone with dangerous driving causing death, the garda created the charge and it went to court.  However, having regard to crime counting rules, he or she should have created a separate incident of dangerous driving causing death so that when the CSO looked at our figures, it would have seen a fatal collision and the charge which it would then have recorded as a homicide.</p></speech>

There are linked areas around that which I want to feed into.  The 2014 report suggested that all crimes of domestic violence and incidents of dispute should be recorded on PULSE irrespective of the willingness of a victim to make a complaint.  When was that implemented?  Has it been implemented?  Is it the subject of ongoing review?  The reason I ask is that there is a link.  What assurance can the acting Commissioner give us about domestic abuse incidents which were misclassified, having been reported as a tension or complaint rather than as the serious assault which actually occurred?  I am asking about where the signs were not recognised and that subsequently became a domestic homicide.  Does the acting Commissioner know what point I am making?  There is a potential link between the early classification of the original domestic violence and a failure to follow the signs in those early investigations.  If the signs were not followed and a case was not investigated properly, something may have ended up as a homicide which should not have.  That might not have happened if the investigation of the earlier domestic incident had been treated properly.</p></speech>

Every incident recorded on our systems goes through a process whereby a review takes place the following morning by the district officer of the incidents which took place the night before.  Those incidents will not be closed out on our system until we are satisfied that the investigation has been completed.  The process is that those investigations are put back until the district officer is satisfied that we have fully and properly investigated that incident.  That process came in tandem with the EU directive on victims, which we embraced even before the legislation came in at all.  We started that process in 2015.</p></speech>

Was a final domestic homicide not classified as such to cover up for that?  Can the acting Commissioner assure us that did not take place?  I am mindful of a case in my area, the very tragic murder of one of my constituents which was very much in the public domain.  Ms Baiba Saulite, who was murdered, was the mother of two young children and the life of a solicitor in the area was put in peril.  The garda&iacute; who originally investigated the abduction of that woman's children have subsequently and to this day maintained that the improper investigation of the abduction of the children and earlier incidents which were not heeded by senior management resulted in the unnecessary death of that woman later on.  That is the angle I am coming from in this line of questioning.</p></speech>

As I was trying to explain, with some of the processes we have put in place, it will be evident to the member creating the record that a person has been involved in a previous incident.  When I record that a person is the victim of a particular crime, our system will flag the fact that he or she has previously been the subject of an incident where there is a previous investigation.  We will be alerted straight away if there was a previous domestic violence incident relating to that person.  That history is now populated and fed to the member when he or she creates the incident.  The awareness is there and one can see from the outset that there is a history and that we need to monitor the case.</p></speech>

In fact, we have done a lot of work to ensure we classify our incidents properly.</p><p>We have a new system where all our incidents are being classified centrally at our Garda information services centre, GISC, in Castlebar.  We have rolled this out in two regions, so that if a Garda wanted to create an incident, he goes through one centralised process where we have our staff equipped and trained.  We make sure there is consistency across the country.  Looking back at the issues relating to our data the challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is trying to get a level of consistency across the organisation.  The new systems will ensure that the quality of our data will be accurate in the future.  For example, when Dr. Singh and his team look at the data on domestic violence, they will find that the crimes have been correctly classified from the start.  It also ensures the victim of a crime will get the services that he or she should from the State.

I refer to the lack of seriousness in some instances where the view taken in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault is summarised by the attitude that it is a personal matter, time consuming and problematic and that people will sort it out between themselves.  I was a bit shocked during the week when I surveyed the proceedings of the Charleton tribunal when two senior officers, albeit one retired now, referred to what was deemed by Mr. Justice O'Higgins as a serious sexual assault as the Kingscourt bus incident where a woman was groped and violated and that superintendent Cunningham and former chief superintendent Rooney did not recognise this as a sexual assault.  If one senior officer said it, it might be one thing, but two senior officers saying it is a problem, particularly in view of Mr. Justice O'Higgins adjudication and the fact Mr. Justice Charleton had to pipe up and say that this incident has been established and there is no exaggeration.  This reminded me of the Byrne and McGinn report where Maurice McCabe was accused of gross exaggeration by calling that a sexual assault but his analysis was upheld by Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  Now even as late as last week we have two senior officers saying that was not a sexual assault at all.  Mr. Finn is painting a picture that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is addressing the issues but it strikes me that we have a very long way to go in terms of understanding this.  If we do not understand it, it is not going to be classified properly.</p></speech>

Dr. Singh and his team go to the Garda College and the CSO personnel come to us and give us the same message, so that we understand the importance of our data.  We had issues in the past with breath tests.  It is important we educate our staff and make the changes so that we start off on the correct course from the first day the new students come into the Garda College and they get an appreciation of, and an understanding, that it is not just about recording data in that data means something in terms of the quality of the service we give to the victim of crime and that we must categorise data properly.  Data are important in terms of giving information to the Road Safety Authority and in how we plan events to try to prevent collisions occurring.  We need to educate and that is part of the process we are undertaking.  It is not all about systems; we need also to convince and change the hearts and minds of our people.  Data are important and we need to make sure we gather data properly and accurately and that we give the people the service they deserve.</p></speech>

Mr. Finn mentioned 1 million breath tests but I would say the 60 to 80 homicides each year are not on the same level as 1 million breath tests so those cases should be capable of being classified and analysed appropriately.  What strikes me as odd, and I will raise some points on the internal review, is that while the spotlight was on, in terms of the inaccuracy and problems of classification of data around other issues, this was also going on.  In his opening remark, Mr. Finn said that he had asked the Garda analysis service to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the homicides.  We know the Policing Authority was not satisfied that this is what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did because it said the internal review was not sufficiently robust.  We know that what the Garda analysis unit did was to compare the pathology reports with the PULSE files, but it was not given access to the case files.  How in God's name could that be called a comprehensive analysis if the people who were asked to analyse the data did not get access to the data?</p></speech>

That was a specific piece of work, an analysis of data.  From that piece of work they were doing, they highlighted a number of incidents and investigations where they saw a discrepancy.  They brought that separate piece of work to the deputy commissioner and said that they had unearthed some issues in relation to the classification, separate from the main piece of work they were doing, and stated they needed to look at it.  The deputy commissioner agreed that there were issues; that the Garda needed to sit down as the analysts had brought the information to them, but they needed operational people to interpret it and address whether what the analysts were highlighting was correct or whether there were other issues.</p></speech>

Who examined the files?  Were all the files examined in detail?  My impression of what the Policing Authority was told was that, in response to the analysts asking whether the investigation had been done properly and requesting to examine the files, senior Garda management telephoned the superintendents who had conducted the investigations in the first place and asked them whether they had been conducted well, to which all those officers surprisingly said that they had been.  All the investigations were deemed to be grand.  That is the impression that has been given.</p></speech>

When the analysts brought the 41 cases to the team that was initially set up to examine those investigations, the team considered what information had been recorded on PULSE, which was the information that was causing the issue for analysts.  That team told the investigating teams that what had been recorded on PULSE did not make sense in light of what the analysts had shown, asked whether the cases in question had been investigated and asked how the investigations had turned out.  As my colleague, Mr. Sutton, mentioned, an investigation can start off when, for an example, an ambulance is called to pick someone up at the side of the street.  We do not know how that person died, but we are called by the hospital about the death and garda&iacute; go along and investigate.  During the course of that investigation, we might discover that the person was assaulted.</p></speech>

I wish to express my condolences to the family of and all belonging to the garda.</p> <p>  Many of the issues in question have been raised by various members.  Mr. Finn stated that data were important and the Garda needed to record them properly, but the PULSE system seems to be unfit for purpose.  As far back as January 2015, a chief inspector, Mr. Robert Olson, said that the system was not fit for purpose, that it was 1990s technology and that it was time to be retired.  The special rapporteur for children, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, also stated that it was not fit for purpose from a child protection point of view.</p> <p>  A couple of weeks ago in the D&aacute;il, I raised with the Taoiseach some issues surrounding Accenture, which designed the PULSE system.  Accenture has received a great deal of money for Garda work and procurement guidelines have been ignored.  When it was put to Mr. Michael Culhane, head of finance in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that 73 contracts in 2015 with a value of more than &euro;11 million had breached procurement guidelines, he said that he accepted that 73 was high but that the Garda was actively addressing all those issues and that it Garda was working with its colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement to that end.  In 2016, 94 contracts breached guidelines.</p><p> In respect of the issues to which Deputy Clare Daly alluded, are things getting any better?  I tabled a parliamentary question about Accenture and this matter in June of last year.  It took six months to get the information back.  Perhaps the assistant commissioner might be able to clarify something.  I was told that Accenture was paid more than &euro;16.5 million in 2016 but the internal audit published in August 2017, which I also raised in the D&aacute;il, said that Accenture was paid &euro;26.5 million in 2016 - some &euro;10 million more.  Perhaps there is a technical reason for that in respect of how payments are made.  Can the assistant commissioner shed any light on that issue?</p></speech>

I did not bring any material in respect of Accenture or the contracts.  We were here on another date and information on those contracts and payments made to Accenture was provided, but I have not brought anything with me today.  Perhaps I can help the committee by providing supplementary information later.</p></speech>

Many discrepancies have been highlighted by different Deputies.  Garda management has had trouble getting breath test figures, juvenile crime statistics and checkpoint numbers correct.  Now we cannot get the homicide figures right.  Does the assistant commissioner not accept that there has been serious failure at management level in the Garda?  We have been very heavily criticised for it, but Deputy Clare Daly and I have been saying for a long time that the problems in how we deliver policing are unlikely to improve dramatically until a different hierarchy is in place.  The current hierarchy has proved itself unfit for purpose in several areas.  Does the assistant commissioner think that we are exaggerating when we say that having a police force with which the Irish people will be 100% happy and getting to a new place in terms of how we do policing cannot be done with the existing hierarchy?  Does he think it can be done?</p></speech>

We have an IT system that is 20 years old and not fit for purpose.  It is at the root of many of the issues we are discussing in respect of data, the classification of homicides, how breath tests are recorded and so on.  Technology has moved on massively in 20 years.  Last week, I read in the Government's development plan for the future that one of the areas in which significant amounts of money will be invested is a new IT system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need that, but we cannot deliver it overnight.  Even if the Government was to give us all the money we needed tomorrow morning it would take time to deliver it.  We have to get from where we are right now to the point when that new system will kick into place.  We are tweaking something which is 20 years old and which was not designed for what we have achieved with it.   It is causing us difficulties and challenges.  We have to do our best with what we have in order to make it fit and to get us through until that new era when that money and new IT project will be delivered.</p> <p>  In my opinion, in which I may be a bit biased, changing management will not solve all those problems overnight.  That is my opinion.  As I said, perhaps I am biased.  The Deputy already touched on our IT system having caused us massive problems in recent times.  It is not fit for purpose.  We know that.  That has been articulated by the inspectorate and others.  However, we have to live with it until such time as that new project is delivered.  I am delighted to see that funding is being made available because we all share the view that we need a new IT system in order to be able to give the type of information that Dr. Singh needs to inform our policing plans and the way in which we patrol and look after the victims of crime.  All of those things are important.  Changing the management today will not solve all those problems.</p></speech>

When I first raised that matter the witnesses did not want me to talk about it.  Given that the assistant commissioner is now admitting that there are serious problems with the IT system, is there any way to explain why we have been giving work to Accenture and Vantage Resources without even getting them to tender for it?  Some of the contracts are being paid in advance.  Some of them date back to 2009.  Some people working for the companies supplying the IT services about which the assistant commissioner is complaining do not even have to clock in.  It is costing a fortune.  Accenture has been paid more than &euro;90 million over these few years.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that a lot of work is being done, much of it relating to IT, in respect of our modernisation and renewal programme.  In terms of new systems, we have a new investigation management system which will be in place by the end of this year.  It is based on the current PULSE architecture.  It will be able to work with our new system when it is in place.  Putting all that together is expensive and involves a lot of work.  In fairness to the Government, it has given us the funding to start off that modernisation and renewal programme in order that, when we get our new system, the new systems which we are developing right now or which have developed in the last two or three years will be able to fit into it and will not be a waste of money.  I mentioned one new system introduced in 2015 which helps us track our incidents to make sure that every one is followed up on.

I do not think that I was ever asked to intervene during the process.  I recollect saying to the members of my staff that if they wanted me to step in that I would step in.</p></speech>

I know our discussions are on data, key performance indicators, KPIs, and multiple other crime statistics and elements.  When will the witnesses be confident that the CSO can properly verify the data that is produced?  That is a confidence issue for data collection generally.  Perhaps Dr. Singh can answer my question too.  When does Dr. Singh feel the data his unit produces will be verifiable by the CSO?  When it is, we can move on from what has been two years of repeated issues with data collection or controversies.  It is important that we see a timeline or a proposed process the witnesses can stand over in the context of when verification can be stood over and there is no repeat of this controversy.</p></speech>

Certainly when we have our six-month review completed, and we estimate that the review will take six months, and the issues that have arisen or may arise are resolved, the CSO will then be in a position to sit down with us and we can see if it is happy that all of the issues that have surfaced have been dealt with.</p> <p>  We have done a lot of work with the CSO.  We have regular meetings with the CSO so that issues relating to data, whether it is homicides, domestic abuse or whatever, can be surfaced and dealt with to give the CSO reassurances.  We are working very closely with the CSO.  As I mentioned earlier, the CSO staff come to our call centre in Castlebar to educate our people about the need for good quality data, which enables them to stand over their statistics not just in this country but in Europe.  Our reputation is at stake, in that respect.  The CSO has been very helpful whether, it is going to the Garda College and talking to our students with Dr. Singh, or going to our call centres in the Garda Information Services Centre, GISC.  We understand, as I mentioned earlier, that there is probably a cultural issue that we need to address within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make sure we treat data with the respect they deserve and understand the bigger picture, which was highlighted in the Crowe Horwath report.  I mean that we understand it does not just mean filling out something on the side of the road but there must a greater realisation that what we do has an impact on people's lives and on the quality of the service we give to victims of crime or the Road Safety Authority.  That cultural change has to take place and it is not just about changing the systems.  It is about educating the people too, within the organisation, on the need to treat these data seriously.  That is a wider piece of work. </p></speech>

Then, within three years, he or she passed away due to head injuries secondary to the assault or suffered a stroke or something.  What is the reclassification process if someone has already been convicted of a crime but there is a subsequent consequence under the Criminal Justice Acts?  If the crime has subsequently caused the death of the person, how is that information converted in the context of an investigation?  Will subsequent criminal proceedings take place?</p></speech>

Let us say somebody was prosecuted for the assault and the injured party subsequently passed away after the conviction, then a separate file would be produced for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with medical evidence to be able to prove that the assault was the cause of death.  Even though initially it was a section 3 or section 4 assault for which the perpetrator was convicted, one can bounce it on then and make a recommendation for a charge of manslaughter, a homicide or a murder.</p></speech>

When we do look for evidence from medical people, casualty people or from doctors, we get great assistance from them.  Very often, in some of the cases, we must go outside the jurisdiction for some of the more complex cases involving toxicology or poisoning.

I am not sure whether the witnesses think there should be an obligation, not on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but on the flipside such as the public health system, whereby if people there believe a previous incident was the cause of a changed pathological event, they then should have a mandatory reporting mechanism back to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I express my sympathies to the Fox family and the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the death of Detective Superintendent Colm Fox.</p> <p>  There is a limited amount I am going to go into here because a lot has been gone through, in some very good detail, by my colleagues.  Some of what I have to say are just observations, having listened to the debate today.  I must stress that my following observation gives me absolutely no pleasure.</p><p>Mr. Finn's concluding remarks of his opening statement reads: </p><blockquote>I fully accept Chair that the review process could have been quicker. ...<br /><br />Given the seriousness of the crimes ... <br /><br />Any issues identified ... <br /><br />In  conclusion Chair ...<br /><br />I can assure you Chair that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken this matter very seriously and will continue to do so.</blockquote><p>That could almost be said on every occasion.  Mr. Finn could lift that text as a block and drop it into almost every opening remarks An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had to make to this committee since Mr. Finn began to appear before it in the time I have been a member of it.  That speaks volumes as to how disappointing it is in terms of where we are at.  There have been so many incidents, questions and investigations all following a very similar pattern that it takes longer, it takes time, there is a great seriousness to the matter and that they cannot supply us with the information.  It says something about the whole process in which we as a committee are having to engage in dealing with some issues.  <br/><br/>I do not want to be flippant about this, and &quot;flippant might be the wrong word to use, but I have a problem with the 20-year old IT system.  What part of the 20-year old IT system told senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to consult Dr. Singh regarding the report?  Which bit of the IT system did that?</p></speech>

If we were to separate the investigators from the analysts, the investigators did their piece of work in regard to giving reassurance that yes an investigation was carried out into each of the 41 homicides.  That was probably the initial piece of work that was done, and that was responded to the Policing Authority in April and an assurance was given.  We are happy that an investigation was carried out in regard to each of those 41 homicides, that they went through either the courts system or the coroner's system, or that some of them were currently still live investigations.  That was the reassurance given, and the context in which that reassurance was given to the Policing Authority.  There were issues in that.  If the analysts had raised this issue in regard to data quality, it would have been prudent that we would have gone back to the analysts to ask if they were happy that we had addressed their issues.  In hindsight, looking back, that is where we should have done it differently in my opinion.</p></speech>

He had people on the working group, did he not, so he was effectively involved in a process in making an input?  Unless I am being completely illogical, it seems that the process of Dr. Singh asking for the report was to make sure that he could have an input into it.  He asked for the report and therefore wanted to have an input into it before the meeting with the Policing Authority,  would that be correct?</p></speech>

First, there is a joint review team, as far as I was concerned.  It was important that all members of that review team had the opportunity to look at the final report and say " Yes, we are confident.  We are happy.  This actually represents our joint views."  Second, part of the reason I felt I needed to write arose at the Policing Authority meeting when the suggestion was made that this had been signed off or had been agreed with the analysis service.  At that point I was thinking I have neither seen it nor agreed it.</p></speech>

My concern, and I believe it is one shared by other members of the committee, is that there was a deliberate attempt to exclude the analysis section of the working group in the lead up to the meeting with the Policing Authority in April 2017.  I also have a concern that there was a deliberate attempt to push through the report that was referred to at the meeting of the Policing Authority in April 2017 in the hope that this would be a line drawn in the sand under the homicide review.  At its worst, I have a concern that there was an attempt to hoodwink the Policing Authority at the meeting of April 2017.  I wish to ask Dr. Singh two questions in respect of this.  We know from what he has said that there were two analysts on the working group.  What did they say to him in respect of their response to the fact that this report was being produced without them being involved in it?</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Brophy.  It is important to say that it gives us no satisfaction at all to find ourselves in repeat engagements regarding matters such as this.  Our primary role is as legislators and we have a backlog of legislation that no other committee has to contend with, so it is hugely frustrating.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feels this, it is not unique.  I can say that I found it incredible.</p> <p>  On the PULSE system not being fit for purpose, we have had a number of engagements regarding PULSE, particularly with regard to the false breath test recording.  That was very serious given what the whole business of breath testing is about.  Lives are at stake.  Here we are dealing with a situation relating to homicides - murders - being misrecorded or not being updated in terms of the detail recorded on the PULSE system.  I have no doubt that there is a very serious level of public disquiet about all of this.  Public confidence has been seriously impacted upon.  I repeat what I have said previously, namely, that public confidence in our policing service - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - is imperative to ensure that Mr. Finn and his colleagues can do the best job possible.  We are here in the hope of being able to help in some regard to reach that point.  Mr. Finn's point about the PULSE system not being fit for purpose may very well be true but, as Deputy Brophy highlighted and I am now reiterating, it was not the PULSE system that activated 1 million plus false recordings.  One changes the system but it is the practice and the people that are at issue.  The regularity of false recording, misrecording and not updating suggests a cavalier attitude within the service to the PULSE system.  It suggests a less than serious acceptance of the important role and function it can play.  Otherwise, why in heaven's name would members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participate in false recording, misrecording and not updating records?  I cannot think of any other comparable situation where that would be tolerated and accepted.  I find it incredible.  Yes, it is great to see a new system introduced.  I am not going to ask Mr. Finn to respond to this one question.  I will put a couple.  What is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na doing to arrest this attitude and behaviour within the force?  That must happen in tandem with any equipment updating.</p> <p>  Mr. Finn referred to the 41 cases.  I welcome what was said but I have a question to pose.  Mr. Finn indicated that these cases were investigated.  I accept that they were investigated but would a particular classification alter the course of the investigation employed?  I do not for a moment suggest any lack of thoroughness.  An investigation could be because these are the steps one takes.  Chief Superintendent Sutton outlined the different steps that can present.  Does a situation arise where because of something being mis-recorded or not being updated, a certain level of investigation and attention to detail were not employed?  How would Mr. Finn respond to each of those points?</p></speech>

Even this morning, I was talking to one of my colleagues about an investigation into a death.  Significant work was done pursuing that investigation involving following every line of inquiry.  What if that investigation turns out to be a homicide or an accidental death?  We will not know until we conclude that process, which is ongoing.  From my experience of working as an operational chief superintendent and superintendent, every one of the investigations in which I was involved was done thoroughly and every line of inquiry was pursued.  Could I honestly say that the PULSE incident reflected every one of those?  That has been our weakness.  PULSE started out as a system for recording crimes.  Twenty years later, we have asked it to be something totally different in terms of being a tool to record everything we do.  Given the way technology has evolved, PULSE is outdated.  We are talking about technology from a different era.  That does not mean that our investigations were not done.  I would be 100% confident that we do investigate every one of those incidents.  Every one with which I was involved was thoroughly investigated.  Did the PULSE incident reflect the final status of that investigation?  I think that is where we have let ourselves down in terms of our data and what we recorded on PULSE.  Just because something starts out as an assault does not mean it will not end up in the courts as murder.  Did we always go back and update the incident?  That is where we let ourselves down and that is where we need to change the culture.  The Chairman is right.  I have gone out and spoken to every chief superintendent and superintendent across the country regarding data, its importance and how it is impacting negatively in terms of breath tests when we did not do them right and record them accurately.  The same is true of homicides.  I have gone out and spoken to every chief superintendent and superintendent across the country saying that we must do it right.  Public confidence is eroded when we do not do it right.  Today is an example with regard to homicides.  I can assure members that the investigations were done and for each of the 41 investigations we are discussing, the operational end of them was done.  Yes, the Policing Authority would like us to come back and give it a belt-and-braces reassurance that they were done in a way that was compliant with Article 2.  Can it come out and say with confidence that it has reviewed every one of those investigations and that they were done properly?  That is what we are going to do because the public and the Policing Authority demand it.  I hope that when we return in six months' time, the committee will confident enough to say that it is happy we have carried out that investigation and have put this to bed in terms of any issues regarding the quality of our data.</p></speech>

People from our IT department will make data transfers to the CSO regularly.  Where there are IT issues, it will be resolved at that level.</p> <p>  On the question of giving the CSO any additional information, there is a group at senior level - I was on it with Dr. Singh - which would work with the CSO if it was looking for some additional information or data fields or had queries about data given to it.  The CSO is independent in what it does.  Any interaction we would have with it would be in the context of facilitating it and giving it additional information or data.</p></speech>

For families who lost loved ones in such circumstances, it is bound to have caused some concern and, perhaps for others, some distress.  The review of the period 2013 to 2015 identified 41 cases.  Now, however, the period from 2003 to 2017 is to be reviewed.  That is a considerable body of work and it will take five or six months to respond.  Is there any way of dealing with it more speedily?  I know there is a further outworking on cases identified.  Initially, the process of establishing the statistics would bring us out of this maelstrom, first and foremost, and then there is other work to be done subsequently.</p> <p>  Is there any way this can be expedited?  Is there an understanding of how important it is to have the CSO situation resolved?  I know that, next week, Garda management must meet the Policing Authority to discuss this issue.  A public engagement such as this will not reimbue confidence among the wider public.  This matter needs to be addressed substantively and speedily.  Is there anything Garda management can do to help reach that point?</p></speech>

It can be done in blocks on a year-by-year basis.  As we get information from the State Pathologist, it can then be fed back to the chief superintendent and his team to ensure they can be working on that aspect of it.</p> <p>  The mistake we made in the past was to rush it and do it piecemeal.  We then ended up having to do parts of it again.  If we are to learn a lesson from the past, we need to integrate and verify the information in the data fields.  Then we can come back with the reassurance the material is correct.  The mistake we made last year was we did it piecemeal and not in a wholesome way.</p> <p>  We will certainly put in whatever resources we need.  The only restriction will be the number of people in the analysis service who have the knowledge to integrate the State Pathologist's database.  We only have one person with the knowledge and experience to do that for us.  That is the stumbling block.</p></speech>

He also spoke about the lack of co-operation that he would have quite rightly expected when he sought a copy of the said report.  As a civilian member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or from the experience of any others working in his service, is there a them-and-us attitude in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between ranked members and civilian staff?</p></speech>

However, the people who work in my service have had an excellent working relationship with operational officers in terms of bringing forward cases, investigations and developing operational work.  Externally, people have pointed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service as a great example of civilianisation because it provides a unique function in supporting operational garda&iacute; like Colm Fox, whose funeral I would have loved to have been at today.</p><p>We have a very good connection with the operational side.</p></speech>

Is that experience universal in the context of bringing information to the attention of the Garda?  Is such information taken on board, acted upon and respected?</p></speech>

As part of that process, my members of staff became very frustrated.  If the Chairman is asking whether it reflects the generality, I will come back to my earlier point that I see variance.  We have great working relationships with investigators, and we have done great work to support the development of national operations, but there are variations in this.  Whether it is unique to civilian status, I do not know.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is as simple as that , to be perfectly honest.  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan referred to the worst-case scenario, namely, that there was a deliberate attempt not to give the Policing Authority the full impression.  This may not be the case.  However, the fact Dr. Singh was not given this report is of great seriousness, particularly in the context of what we are discussing.  We are discussing cases of the greatest seriousness that include the loss of life.  The analysis service had knowledge of this for months in advance of the meeting and it flagged its interest in this on a number of occasions before the meeting.  In this context, it is very difficult to imagine how a decision could have been reached or how the report was not provided to Dr. Singh for sign-off, particularly in light of its significance and the inevitable considerable public commentary at the Policing Authority meeting and in the aftermath thereof.  I find that difficult to credit.</p> <p>  My question relates to the fact the Garda Inspectorate report on changing policing in Ireland recommended putting in place the position of a director of data quality.  Am I correct in stating this has not yet been done?</p></speech>

I do not intend to make a Second Stage speech except to say that this is a short piece of legislation that supports the thriving craft brewing industry in Ireland.  The legislation also helps out a number of other producers of various different forms of beverage whether it is cider or perry distilleries.  There are two winemakers in Ireland, which was news to me.</p><p>I was motivated to draft this legislation because the brewing industry is thriving and growing all of the time.  It can be found in the four corners of Ireland and in various rural areas, which brings employment.  There is an anomaly in the licensing laws whereby brewers cannot sell their produce on site unless they have a wholesale licence where they can sell on a large scale.  They cannot sell on site.  They cannot have visitors, give them tours of their breweries and allow visitors to buy their products.  I felt that the anomaly is holding back the industry and the industry approached me about the matter.  I have spoken in depth with tourism authorities.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland wants to create a branded product and cater for visitors to Ireland who are interested in this topic.  My Bill deals with the anomaly.  My Bill proposes to create a licence where a person can go to the District Court or Circuit Court in order to sell on-sales and off-sales, depending on which one wants, but a person could sell both.  The legislation also proposes that if there is a tour, the brewer can have on-sales in the brewery.  It is also my intention that anyone who visits a brewery can take away off-sales.  Parts of my legislation are very important and we will tease out any issues.</p><p>I thank the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, in particular Mr. Seamus Carroll, for working very closely with me on this matter for more than a year.  I also thank everyone who spoke on Second Stage because we had unanimous support in the House.  My legislation will not create new pubs or off-licences and is restricted to the actual products that are brewed on site.  Let us imagine how it would feel if one could not purchase products on site having visited a vineyard in Italy, Spain, France or, indeed, the west coast of the United States where there are many craft breweries.  The industry employs nearly 500 people at present and enactment of my legislation will allow a fledgling industry to flourish.  I hope that we can deal with the Bill quickly and it will move on to Report Stage, and then through the Seanad because many of the craft brewers are waiting to expand their premises and create visitor centres, etc.  All they need is for the legislation to be passed.</p></speech>

It was made clear that, in particular, the granting of a licence by the Revenue Commissioners would be conditional upon the presentation of a court certificate, which members will be aware is the normal procedure applicable to retail sales.</p><p>I am very keen to ensure that we can advance this piece of legislation this morning and, as Deputy Kelly has said, that we can proceed to the appropriate next Stages with an objective in mind that we would have matters completed over the next few weeks, which would facilitate an early commencement.  </p><p>Amendment No. 1 contains the Government's principal proposals.<font color="#FFFFFF">End of Take</font></p><p>It will replace section 1 of the original Bill in its entirety.  Subsection (1) provides for the granting of a court certificate to an applicant who is the holder of a manufacturer's licence in respect of manufacturing premises to which persons are admitted for the purposes of a guided tour of the premises.</p><p> The court will grant a certificate to the applicant in respect of the premises on being satisfied of a number of things.  First, the court will need to be satisfied of an appropriate manufacturing licence being in force in respect of the premises.  Second, a system will need to be in place to restrict retail sales to those who have visited the premises and to those who have participated in a guided tour of the premises unless it prohibits the issuing of the licence on a number of other grounds, which are already known in legislation, being the character, the misconduct or the unfitness of the applicant, the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises in issue or the unsuitability of the premises for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood.  This provision, which will be known to members, is based on section 28 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 which governs the grant of retail licences.  I draw members' attention to the fact that, unlike section 18, there is no need to extinguish an existing licence for the purposes of obtaining a licence under this legislation.</p><p> Subsection (2) provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall, on presentation of the court's certificate, issue the licence in respect of the premises concerned while subsection (3) provides for the renewal of the licence.  All retail licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor of any description are subject to an annual renewal process.</p><p> Subsection (4) provides that where a retail licence is issued in respect of the premises any other licence, apart from the manufacturer's licence, shall be extinguished.  This corresponds with section 1(4) of the original text of the Bill, the view being that this will discourage holders of public house licences that may have an on-site brewery from applying for the licence or feeling that they have the need to apply for the licence, as they will have a public house licence in any event.</p><p> Subsection (5)  provides that the licence issued under this section will permit the sale of intoxicating liquor products manufactured on the premises between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day of the year, and this has regard to recently passed legislation.  It also provides that the supply of the products will be for visitors who have participated in a tour of the premises.  Where the court certificate has been granted by the Circuit Court, the products may be sold for consumption on or off the premises and where granted by the District Court, the products must be consumed off the premises.</p><p> Subsection (6) provides for excise duty of &euro;500 at the request of the Revenue Commissioners, which is in line with other excise licences, and subsection (7) imposes the standard requirement for the applicant for a retail licence to have a current up-to-date tax clearance certificate.</p><p> Subsections (8) and (9) make provision for the offences.  In subsection (8), it shall be an offence for a person to sell intoxicating liquor, for the sale of which a licence is required, without such a licence and subsection (9) corresponds with the original text.  Subsection (10) contains the required definitions and I draw attention to the definition of the court.  It means the Circuit Court if the applicant intends to sell products produced on the premises for consumption on or off the premises.  If the intention is to sell products for consumption off the premises, an application may be made to the District Court.</p><p> I will deal with the other amendments when Deputy Wallace moves his amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#B00200"><p>I commend Deputy Alan Kelly on bringing this forward as it is a good idea and makes sense.  It addresses an area which has been ignored.  The development of small craft breweries is a new phenomenon in Ireland, though not so new in Europe, and it is good that we address it.</p> <p>  I have a vested interest.  First, Wallace wine bars only sell craft beer.  At the beginning we imported beers from Italy but we now use a lot of Irish beer because they are getting better and better and brewers in Ireland are getting better at what they are doing all the time, which is brilliant.  My son, Fionn, is also building a brewery so it would be remiss not to declare my interest in this topic.</p> <p>  The Bill is a little bit fuzzy and we need to clean it up a bit.  I am aware that there have been challenges in bringing the Bill forward but I prefer Deputy Kelly's initial Bill to the one with the amendments.  I am not suggesting massive changes but I hope that, on Report Stage, we might address some anomalies.  The Government amendments would effectively replace the Bill as initiated, and, at the same time, if accepted would make my amendments null and void.  It would make for legislation that would only serve a few large breweries and not give a financial boost to many of the microbreweries getting on their feet in this country in recent times.</p> <p>  I have four amendments to the Bill as initiated, namely, amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive.  Amendment No. 2 is addressed in the Government amendments in that winemakers would also be included in the new licence.  The intention of amendment No. 3 is to do away with the necessity to have a guided tour in order to obtain this licence.  I understand the Government's thinking on this matter but this provision is expanded and strengthened in the Government amendments, which would be to the detriment of microbreweries.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 4 would serve to extend the hours of the operation of this licence by one hour in order to allow for people to call by after work to buy beer from their local brewery, and also in order to allow the breweries to complete the brew in the morning on weekend days as this will most commonly be the time microbreweries have the opportunity to open up the brewery to the public while still having time to set up for visitors and get in a few hours of tasting for the beer tourists they attract.  Is the Minister being a bit cynical?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#B00400"><p>Amendment No. 5 covers some of the same areas covered in the Government amendments, namely, addressing the recent change to the legislation around the closure of bars on Good Friday.  It also includes winemakers in the list of those who can avail of this licence.  In effect, the Government amendment No. 1 runs counter to my amendments Nos. 3 and 4 in that it keeps the hours for operating this licence at between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. each day, and it doubles down on the necessity of the tour provision.</p> <p>  I will explain why these two elements of the Government amendments should not be accepted.  The hours question follows on from the arguments around the tour requirement, so that can be discussed afterwards.  Government amendment No. 1 invents two licences, one for on and off sales, for which one needs to apply to the Circuit Court, and one for off sales only, for which one applies to the District Court.</p><p>With the provisions in subsection (1) of the proposed new section 1, both licences could only be attained if the applicant could prove to the court that he or she is fit to hold the licences and of decent character, that the premises is convenient and fit - for tours and the consumption of alcohol on the premises, one guesses, although the legislation is not clear on this point - and that having tours and possible consumption inside the premises would not be inconvenient for neighbours.  The legislation is not clear on how these conditions will be proven.  Must the applicant get a certificate from some Government body to prove his or her suitability in all these areas?  Is there a public consultation process and timeframe for complaints against the application for the licences?  Either way, hurdles are being erected and, where the applicant is out of favour with the local authorities, the local publicans or the locals generally, there is plenty for them to go on to halt this process.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is a contradiction in the proposed Government amendment.  For an applicant to qualify for an off-sales licence, or off and on-sales licences, he or she must show that guided tours can be held on the premises and that the premises is suitable for guided tours in the first place.  This automatically rules out a great number of the microbreweries in Ireland from qualifying for these licences.  Many microbreweries are packed to the rafters with fermenters, pipework and brewing and packaging materials as many producers start out with small enough kits and, as they see increasing demand, purchase more fermentation and storage vessels until they have no more room to move in their workspaces.  These breweries which are doing a lot in a small space, generally due to lack of investment and available funds to expand to bigger premises, are both precisely those who need the help this Bill could offer them financially and, because of the way in which the Government amendments are crafted, those who will not benefit from the Bill.  These overcrowded breweries will not have the space to have guided tours or on-sales consumption either.  They will not qualify past requirement (ii) in subsection (1) of the Government amendment, that is, &quot;the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises&quot;.<br/><br/>The most pernicious part of the legislation is that if one cannot prove one's suitability to operate a tour, not only can one not have on-sales consumption of the products one makes, but one is also prohibited from off-sales.  The Government amendment is very clear in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) that the sale of alcohol is restricted to persons who have completed a tour of the premises.  Nowhere else do the Government amendments make a special provision for off-sales, or those who do not have the space to have a tour.  This makes a mockery of the invention of the second licence.  If one does not have the space to satisfy the suitability criteria for a tour, one cannot have off-sales anyway, so why do we need a special off-sales-only licence?  If one had the space for the tour, presumably one would have the space for on-site consumption too, the ability to clear an area for a group of people to sit down and have a tasting experience.  There does not seem to be much reason to apply for the off-sales-only licence if one qualified for any licence in the first place.<br/><br/>What is proposed here is legislation designed to benefit the bigger breweries, that is, those that are on their second expansion and have some extra space on their new premises.  The smaller breweries trying to get off the ground, if the Government amendments are passed, will not even be able to sell six-packs to their next-door neighbours because they do not have breweries with enough space for tours.  Add to this the ridiculousness of the requirement to provide a tour to every person who wants to buy a can of beer or bottle of wine - and to be able to prove that one has given a tour to the person who buys the six-pack or whatever else.  How will this be enforced?  The amendment states in the proposed subsection (1)(b) &quot;an appropriate mechanism is in place to restrict the sale pursuant to a licence granted under this section of intoxicating liquor on the premises to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises&quot;.  It is difficult not to read this as saying the Government is not mad about the Bill in the first place.<br/><br/>In the UK, at weekends, some breweries do their work in the morning, clean up and then open up an entrance at one end of the brewery, cordoning off access to the nuts and bolts of the brewery and setting up a tasting facility whereby they get to sell directly to their customers and get instant feedback on new brews that perhaps one can only taste on these days.  In some states in the US there are breweries that only sell their beers directly from the breweries.  People travel from far and wide for a chance to purchase some special edition brews that are only available on that day at that place.  This is beer tourism.  It is not about the setting up of a pub scenario; it is about people who are passionate about these products travelling to places to have experiences they cannot get anywhere else.  It is great for the finances of the brewery as it means that on a small percentage of its production it can get margins that usually go to others along the chain and it can have a better chance of survival.  Four microbreweries have closed down in Ireland in the past year.  The people travelling to have these experiences inject money into the local economies surrounding the places of alcohol production that otherwise would not come to those areas.  In the long run Ireland can become the proper drinks tourism destination that it is not quite at present.<br/><br/>Regarding the issue of opening hours, the reality is that breweries are usually staffed with just enough people to do what is necessary and these people all multitask.  It is a hard graft, especially at the start, when it is difficult to afford to employ many people given the tight margins when production is small.  This means that for smaller breweries the weekend would probably be the only suitable time to have tours, tastings and off sales - and tours for every person who buys a beer.  The Government amendment sets up a very busy time for those working to make this licence work for them financially - that is, if they were able to qualify for the licence in the first place, taking into account how the amendment is stacked against smaller producers.  The requirement of a tour for every off-sale and the requirement of a guided tour for every on-sale means in reality that smaller breweries will not be able to avail of the licence while producing their product.  During the week, from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m., the vast majority of Irish people will be at work.  This, coupled with the guided tour requirements in the amendment, is designed to stop local people from buying alcohol products from their local producers.  The Bill will give with one hand and take away with the other.  The Government amendment will make the Bill less fit for purpose except for the bigger breweries that have extra staff and extra space.  If the operation of the licence were extended to 7 p.m., local people could drop by to buy some products after work and producers could get their everyday work out of the way on weekends and get some use out of the licence, with a couple of hours for the tastings.  In short, there must be some differentiation between this licence and a normal pub licence.  The fact that the hours are so short and will be over before most people even go to the pub and that one can only drink or buy the products made at these places is a pretty big difference already, but the amendment hangs all that difference on the requirement to provide a tour.  In the process the Government amendment sets up a situation in which many of those that need the benefits of the legislation the most, namely, the smaller breweries, will not get licences in the first place.<br/><br/>Deputy Kelly and I are probably the only two members present who have been in the breweries in Ireland.  They can be a little all over the shop.  Of course, for health and safety reasons, tours cannot be allowed in places that cannot meet health and safety standards.  Anyone visiting these breweries will see that having tours in some of them just would not be practical, and I assure the Minister that he can completely forget about tours taking place while they are brewing.  This would not be possible.  Italy started this 20 years before us and is well ahead of us, but even in the Italian breweries, which are fantastic to walk around, and where one can see tours work really well, one could not have a tour while brewing is taking place.  It is out of the question.  There is just too much stuff such as pipes all over the place and too much activity.<br/><br/>I look forward to the enactment of the legislation.  I just ask that we think a little more about the smaller guy whom we need to help get off the ground.  This is indigenous industry, and the Government does not need me to tell it that Ireland has been very weak in supporting indigenous industry for as long as we can remember.  We are so dependent on foreign direct investment.  Of course we are delighted that foreign direct investment provides so many jobs in Ireland, but it is becoming more and more obvious, especially in rural areas of the country, that any new foreign direct investment coming to Ireland, if it does not involve extensions to places in Cork, Limerick or Galway, is coming to the Dublin hub because that is where all the action is and everyone wants to be near Dublin now.</p><p>It is becoming even more difficult to get those involved in foreign direct investment to start something new away from the Dublin hub.  That further emphasises the need for us to be more supportive of indigenous industry. </p><p> The craft brewing industry can be powerful and will help small distillers.  Wine and other drinks are being made.  It is a win-win for the country.  Approximately 365 craft breweries open in Italy every year.  They are small in nature and often expand when they find their feet and are then more sensible and economic to run.  If 365 breweries open in Italy every year, one can imagine that they cannot possibly become large breweries.  That would not make sense because the market would not be there.</p><p> In Ireland we have an opportunity to help the industry grow.  People already recognise that Ireland has gained a powerful reputation for distilling whiskey.  We are becoming renowned worldwide for it and can do the same with craft beer.  I hope that we can improve the anomalies in the Bill and make it better on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We said on Second Stage that we would support it and will support it on Committee Stage.  We would like to see it passed.</p> <p>  Any time a Bill with the words "intoxicating liquor" in it goes through the Oireachtas, it should be said that we have an extremely troubled and complicated relationship with alcohol in this country.  The graveyards and hospitals of the country are full of people whose lives were destroyed by alcohol.  It shows that we need to develop a more mature attitude to how we consume and our relationship with alcohol.  The Bill will probably be helpful in developing a more mature attitude to alcohol.  The craft breweries which are being developed encourage people to be more interested in the taste of alcohol rather than its effects and will assist in making the country more mature about its relationship with alcohol.</p> <p>  I listened to what Deputy Wallace had to say about his amendments.  I will wait to hear what the Minister and Deputy Kelly have to say in reply.  I noted the amendments put forward by the Minister and Deputy Wallace have references to something called "perry".

I do not have a vested interest, as it happens.  In terms of competing amendments, I have different views on them and there is value in both.  I disagree with Deputy Wallace on some areas.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, no matter the circumstances, we have to take intoxicating liquor seriously.  There is sense in having criteria in respect of the suitability of a premises.  One has to take into account proximity to schools and all of that.  That is relevant.  Having said that, the case has been well made in respect of small microbreweries where it would be neither suitable nor workable to provide a tour.  Whatever about on-sales, in terms of off-sales, there is an obvious logic in people being in a position to travel to microbreweries and purchase directly.  I would be interested in listening to the Minister and Deputy Kelly.  The case has been well made about the ability to purchase on site in very small microbreweries.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace mentioned that the &euro;500 fee will be prohibitive for some of the smaller start-up breweries.  Is there any flexibility around the amendment he has proposed?</p> <p>  I refer to the guided tour obligation.  What oversight does the Minister propose for that?  In terms of people who purchase a guided tour, how will completion be assessed in the context of the licence?  Is it unnecessarily difficult in the context of the Bill?  Will a licence provider sell a particular tour with an option for completion?  Perhaps the Minister could explain how completion will be assessed in the context of the licence being proposed.  While I understand the reasons behind it, I am not sure how State oversight can be provided for in the legislative criteria in the context of the licence.  It could easily be circumvented by particular microbreweries if a tour is not possible, as Deputy Wallace said.  How does the Minister see the amendment being adhered to in the context of what he is proposing?</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge that Deputy Kelly has produced a very good piece of legislation.  From my perspective, there are two aspects on which I would like to comment.  The first is the issue of tours.  I can understand the reservations being expressed about it and they are fair.  At the end of the day, if one takes out the tour element, one effectively transfers this from what I understood it to be, which was the development of legislation to enable a tourism promoted sector and the ability of people to access a tour and purchase alcohol to, in effect, a licence for a commercial premises to sell its products to manufacturers and retail stores.  They are two different things.  I can understand why any small microbrewery or manufacturer would want to have a retail operation for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Wallace, such as margin and everything else.  It is something which is inherently different from the notion of facilitating a process like a tour which is designed to have a very different element.</p> <p>  In respect of the 6 p.m. cut-off, an extra hour would be very beneficial because if tours are being conducted and there is an access point, the cut-off will be 4 p.m., 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m. depending on the length of the tour.  The proposal for an extra hour has some validity.  I would be cautious about moving to remove the tour element completely because it would turn this into a licence for a manufacturer's retail store.  We need to examine that carefully in terms of the other aspects of what we are trying to do around alcohol in the country.  </p></speech>

I believe 64 new micro-breweries have been set up in the country in recent years which have created almost 500 jobs.  That is a massive plus.  However, I do have a concern about the sale of alcohol and I must disagree with my colleague here.  I believe the opening hours, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., are a good start.  The last thing I want to do is to encourage people to go to these breweries just to buy drink and take drink home.</p> <p>  Tours of these facilities is a good idea.  I have been regularly lobbied in County Louth because a few of the new breweries are located there.  I visited one or two of them myself and they have fantastic set ups.  Instead of changing everything in one go, I believe we should wait and see what happens over the next couple of years.  I would be delighted if jobs were created and if it encourages tourism in different areas, that would be a major plus.  As a non-drinker, a pioneer, I was very impressed with the set-up in these breweries.  I know that Deputy Wallace has much more experience than I do in going to Italy and having a look at such places.  Italy might have a 20-year head start on us, but we should be taking our time with this anyway.  It is something that could really kick off in this country.  I spoke last week in the debate on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, and there was debate on Irish whiskeys and different types of labels.  I would hate to see a stigma attached to this.  Ireland is known as a country that manufactures good alcoholic products.  I believe we have an opportunity of increasing tourism with these micro-breweries but we should take one step at a time.  Let us work with the Minister.  It could be something good and could lead to employment opportunities.  It might also help to educate young people about what actually goes into their drinks.  </p> <p>  Tours would be a massive plus, especially for schools.  Many people do not know what actually goes into the manufacturing of alcohol or about all the different contributors, such as local farmers, who get involved in the process.  A tour would be a fantastic way to get young people to understand the manufacturing process of the drinks.  </p> <p>  We are talking about increasing the opening hours from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  I believe that would give the wrong impression.</p></speech>

It might be as well for the Minister to also hear Deputy Kelly's response to the various contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#E00300"><p>I thank members of the committee for their contributions and the general support for this measure.</p> <p>  Ultimately, what we are doing is supporting a fledgling industry that is growing all the time.  It is an industry that has probably reached capacity in terms of how much it can grow and expand under the current legislation.  I do not believe it can grow much more.  It has probably reached its peak.  It is possible that we can create a scenario whereby we can educate more people around the country, and particularly internationally, about the brand of Irish craft beer.  That is what this is about.  It has knock-on effects for the agriculture industry, the servicing industry, the transport industry and a whole range of other things as well.  It could grow exponentially.  </p> <p>  In terms of education on alcohol and its misuse, this is a very positive step because this shows what brewers are doing at a local level, how beer is made, what ingredients go into it and the culture and the history of many of these breweries.  There is a whole process.  One can go to Tipperary and see White Gypsy or to Laois to see 12 Acres, to west Kerry and see the breweries down there or those in Carlingford in Louth.  Each area has its own beer.  There is an education process around that.  Each beer has a different taste and can complement different types of food.  It is like wine tasting; an educational process which is not all about young people getting as much beer into themselves as possible.  There are different experiences available when one drinks beer sensibly and socialises in the proper manner.  Statistics have shown that people who drink craft beer actually drink less because it is a whole experience, rather than just the consumption of alcohol for the sake of it.  That has been shown by international and local studies.  That is a good thing.</p> <p>  As to where we go from here, the Minister is generally very supportive and has said so himself.  The Department also has been quite supportive.  This Bill seeks to address anomalies and to provide some practical legislation to allow this industry to move forward.  </p> <p>  On the amendments which have been put forward, I agree that wine should be brought in.  I have no issue with the time change at all, because it will allow people to clean up after their day.  The issue of the suitability of premises is something of which many of the craft brewers I have visited - and I know a huge number of them at this stage - are aware.  These people know that they are going to have to invest, but they will not invest in the clean-up and reorientation to meet with health and safety standards unless this legislation is passed in the first place.  We are in a chicken-and-egg scenario.  Some of these breweries are quite small but there is still the capacity to do tours.  I have been in a number of such breweries which have had visitors.  It basically involves ring-fencing a certain area.  They still need to invest in that.  </p> <p>  I do not particularly have an issue with the idea of licences put forward by the Minister.  In fairness to the Minister and his Department they are obliged to work through earlier legislation and to try to make it fit here.  I appreciate that.  The proposed licence is restrictive in that it applies only to the produce that is sold on-site.  We met the Department to ensure this would be a distinguished licence and the issue of the tour arose.  I believe that a tour, in terms of on-sales and supporting the craft brewers in that area, is the way to go.  I have gone through this idea with the craft brewers and their association.  It creates a distinction in terms of the type of licence that will be in place for them.  </p> <p>  We need to distinguish off-sales to a degree.  I was educated about off-sales during this process.  I believe one is allowed to sell 17 l.  These craft brewers can sell kegs for parties and things like that.  That is permitted at the moment.  The issue, which I believe we will sort out through Report Stage, is to ensure that a craft brewer will also be able to sell off-licence to local people at smaller amounts than that.  For example, if a person in Templemore is holding and event, he or she should be able to go to White Gypsy in Templemore, or if in Laois people can go to 12 Acres, and purchase a small amount of bottles or cans for that purpose.  It would be very unusual and would not make sense if a craft brewer was not able to do that.  </p> <p>  On the amendments - and I know the committee is under pressure in terms of timelines today - I am willing to work with the Minister and the Department, and indeed Deputy Wallace and others who have an interest in this.  We can support the amendment that has been put forward by the Government with a view to making alterations on Report Stage based on Deputy Wallace's amendments, and based on dealing with the issue of small amounts of off-sales under such a licence, which is an anomaly which has to be dealt with.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018021400002#F00100"><p>I am sure people are all mindful that we are dealing with a complex area of law, on which the legal texts date back to the 6th century.  It is against that background that we are now expanding and developing further the sale and distribution of a product that has been a highly restricted substance in Irish law for centuries.  I am not sure if it is ironic but we need to be mindful that, as we debate this matter in the bowels of our Parliament, there is a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in the course of passage through the Houses and that changes which specifically govern the relationship between transport and intoxicating liquor have recently been introduced.</p> <p>  I am pleased that Deputy Wallace, when moving the amendments, declared a vested interest.  That is the context in which he is proposing the amendments.  If this committee were to regard the Bill as the great liberalisation of our licensing laws whereby, at the stroke of a pen, we would introduce in the region of a further 200 public houses - or perhaps many more - throughout the country, then I would be concerned.  Having regard to the proliferation of microbreweries and the importance of breweries and distilleries to the industry, this figure is likely to increase.  It was against this background that Deputy Kelly introduced the Bill, which would facilitate these breweries and distilleries in the supply of their products in small quantities to persons visiting their premises or, as Deputy Wallace stated, beer tourists.  I am supportive of this legislation, as is Government.  It is important that we recognise the points that Deputy Kelly put forward.  I would be very concerned if, as Deputy Wallace said, we were legislating for the larger breweries and were not helping microbreweries.  It is important that we acknowledge the importance of the industry.  Some of the breweries I have visited are very much on the micro in scale, they are small and it was never intended that they become international breweries or distilleries of huge size.  I want to assist them along the lines that Deputy Kelly has suggested.  In doing so, however, I want to recognise that we are dealing with something which these Houses have always regarded as a restricted sales product.  That is the balance we need to achieve.</p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers raised the issue of a fee.  That is the standard Revenue fee for governing the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor.  I do not intend to introduce a new scale of fees or have exemptions for people in some parts of the country.  The Deputy highlighted an important issue when he spoke about the tours or guided tours and what they entail.  That will be a challenge, as Deputy Wallace observed, in areas of restricted size and space.  We will probably need to establish what exactly we are talking about.  Perhaps between now and Report Stage we could work on defining the guided tour.  I have visited many of these establishments and it would seem that an office operative, a worker or a guide would take people around the premises in order that they might have the opportunity to see the vats in operation, witness the brewing process and then return to the lobby where they might be entitled to sample the product if they wish.  They could then be in a position whereby they could take away a memory of their visit in the form of a small supply.  That is restricted under law to an amount that someone mentioned as being quite restrictive, but it is actually 18 l.  Reasonably good parties have been held with 18 l of beer.  I do not think this law is unduly restrictive nor do I accept that the Government's amendments are unduly restrictive.  I want to support the legislation in a way that supports the industry but not in such as way that has no regard for health and safety or for the restricted nature what is being produced on these premises.  We must do this in a way that has regard the existing law.  That is why the status of the applicant for the licence and the premises are based along existing legal requirements.  I believe that is both important and appropriate.</p> <p>  Deputy Wallace spoke of the manner in which an applicant might show that he or she is of fit character.  That is enshrined in law in the manner in which a publican or retailer applies for his or her licence on an annual basis.  A public notice is placed in the newspaper and it is open to any member of the public who may have an objection to have it aired in open court annually.  Similarly, the granting of this certificate will be based on that level of local consultation which, in effect, is an entitlement on the part of any member of the public to raise an objection or otherwise on an annual basis and whereby the court will, on the hearing of evidence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or from any interested party, judge the character, misconduct, unfitness or otherwise of the individual and also the suitability or otherwise of the premises.  It is very important that we give due and appropriate consideration to the suitability of a premises for persons coming onto that premises in the context of health and safety and environmental health regulations and legislation.  This cannot be seen as stand-alone legislation.  Rather, it should be seen by way of reference to a whole body of legislation across various Departments dealing with public entry onto premises or the manner in which these tours can be structured.  Despite what Deputy Wallace said, space is essential.</p> <p>  I contend that amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Wallace is not required in light of the definition of relevant licence contained in the proposed new section 1(10).  Makers of wine are already covered in paragraph (d) of the definition.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 proposes to permit the granting of licences to nominees of the holders of manufacturing licences.</p><p>I am not in favour of the amendment because it would change the responsibility and, in effect, sever the responsibility for compliance with conditions attaching to the retail licence from the holder of the manufacturing licence, which I am not sure is wise at this stage.  It would also mean that although the applicant for the licence would have to be tax compliant, there would be no necessity for the nominee to be so, which is an important aspect of holding of an intoxicating liquor licence having regard to the fact that one of the requirements on an annual basis for a licence to be granted or renewed is that the holder be tax compliant.  This is not the only legislation whereby such a certificate is required in order to obtain a licence to trade.  I cannot, therefore, accept amendment No. 3.</p><p> Amendment No. 4 seeks to extend the trading hour by a further hour, until 7 p.m.  I must remind members that during the Second Stage debate, to which there were many contributions, there was support for Deputy Kelly's proposal that the trading hours be from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  I have listened to what members have said on the issue and am disinclined to extend that any further.  That was more or less what was agreed on Second Stage.  I again make the point in the context of dealing with other amendments, in particular those of Deputy Wallace, that if we are to depart from the initial intent and import of the Bill as brought forward by Deputy Kelly, then we may be changing the law to a greater extent than was understood by many of our colleagues who spoke on Second Stage and agreed to allow the legislation progress to Committee Stage.  I am not sure if they intended there to be a change to the substance of the legislation and I say that with particular reference to the trading hours, which are important.  Deputy Wallace and those who might be exercised by a closing time of 6 p.m. have raised the issue of the 30 minutes drinking-up time traditional to other aspects of intoxicating liquor legislation.  However, I am unsure if that is appropriate to a tasting endeavour rather than a more consumption-oriented experience after the guided tour.  I am minded to retain the 6 p.m. closing time, having regard to the usual latitude.</p><p> Amendment No. 5 seeks a fundamental change to the purpose and entire scope of the Bill.  Deputy Wallace seeks to dispense with the Bill's focus on visitors who have participated in a tour of the premises.  I made reference to it earlier and am conscious of the point made by Deputy Jack Chambers in this regard but it is important that we retain the visitor experience.  Deputy Wallace referred to bus tours of beer tourists and breweries must be concerned about the suitability of the premises.  However, if such visitors are to have a rounded experience, in addition to sampling the produce they must be able to go behind the scenes and look at the nuts and bolts of the operation, which I understand is the basis of beer tourism in the United Kingdom as specifically referred to by Deputy Wallace.  I cannot accept changes to the legislation that would create a completely new type of licensed premises or depart radically from the sensible and reasonable suggestion of Deputy Kelly at the outset of the legislation.  I acknowledge Deputy Kelly's experience in this area and his expertise having regard to the close relationship he has with persons directly involved in the sector.  That is not to in any way denigrate or take away from the experience of Deputy Wallace in that regard.  I cannot accept any amendment to completely change the legislation and introduce a new type of licensed premises operating on the basis of restricted hours.</p></speech>

I am not saying that the premises should not be fit for purpose but, rather, I fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in that regard.  My amendments do not challenge the fact that premises must be fit for purpose.</p> <p>  The Minister discussed health and safety and I fully agree that there must be health and safety measures in such premises.  That is all the more reason why it might not be a good idea to allow a tour through some very small breweries where it can be a bit mad in terms of how the plant is organised.  It would be challenging from a health and safety point of view to allow tours of such premises.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that alcohol has always been a restricted product in Ireland.  He probably does not need me to tell him that the time at which the most alcohol was sold in the United States was during prohibition.  He is correct that we have an odd and restrictive approach to alcohol in Ireland but we have more problems with alcohol than any country in Europe where the laws are far more flexible.  We need to take an educated approach to the consumption of alcohol and part of the Bill brought forward by Deputy Kelly would constitute an improvement in how we relate to alcohol.  The Bill would definitely bring about an improvement in how we relate to alcohol because in 2015, the last year for which there are official figures, alcohol abuse in Ireland cost the State &euro;3.6 billion.  I do not understand why the Government is not more proactive in dealing with this problem.  Why do we still allow alcohol to be advertised through sport?  If we really care about addressing the alcohol problem, why does the State not replace the &euro;36 million a year that sporting organisations currently get from the alcohol industry?  That lack of action is beyond my understanding because using sport to promote the consumption of alcohol is the best way to get young people involved in alcohol consumption.  However, the Government is not tackling it because of lobbying and vested interests.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers discussed how to monitor and provide oversight for tours, which is a huge challenge.  I would like the legislation to be stronger in that regard.  The Bill is not restrictive but it could be more practical.  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point that craft breweries are encouraging people to be more interested in the taste of alcohol.  In terms of tourism, one can complete a tour in most breweries in Ireland in a matter of minutes, and sometimes only one minute.</p><p>The tasting of the craft beer is a significant element of the tourism offering.  Deputy Kelly made the point, and he is absolutely correct, that one cannot drink a craft beer in the same way as one drinks chemical beers in the pub.  It it would not be possible.

It is a different product.  As it is made in a natural fashion, it is better for one's health.</p> <p>  The tasting of craft beer will take time and will be a larger part of the tourism offering but I welcome Deputy Brophy's support for the extended closing time of 7 p.m.  I think the vast majority of craft breweries would be happy to shorten the opening hours and open from 12 noon until 7 p.m. instead of 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.  That would be an hour less, but the hour between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. would be of significant benefit.  I would be very surprised if the craft breweries were not more comfortable with opening hours from 12 noon until 7 p.m. </p> <p>  I am from the countryside in Wexford and I go to the pubs in rural areas and there is nobody, or one could count the number on one hand, in a pub at 7 p.m.  People do not drink beer in country pubs in Ireland in a serious way at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.  Most of the pubs do not get busy until after 9 p.m.  I do not think that extending the opening hour to 7 p.m. will make the craft breweries more like a pub.  The offering is not remotely like a pub.  The craft breweries can only sell their own product, a pub can sell 100 different products and more.  A craft brewery has not a prayer of getting anywhere near what a pub is like.  </p></speech>

If a premises is too small to conduct a tour because it is not safe to do so for health and safety reasons, I do not think that brewery should be allowed to sell beer to consume on the premises.  However, I think - and Deputy Kelly raised this point - we should allow every unit to make off-sales to local people, regardless of whether they can conduct a tour.  I have no problem in agreeing to the principle of a tour for breweries that can facilitate the tour and allowing the clients to taste the craft beer in the on-site tap room.  In other words, tasting can only take place when one does a tour.  It is irrational not to allow the off-sale of quantities of craft beer to local people.  It is not practical.  Such a provision will have to be incorporated into the Bill.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wishes to focus on traffic management and congestion in Galway.  To assist me in dealing with their subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority in this provision and regulation of public transport services.</p> <p>  The remit of the NTA is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated accessible transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.</p> <p>  The authority is limited in terms of producing a statutory transport strategy to the greater Dublin area.  Any transport strategy produced by the NTA in any other area is on a non-statutory basis.</p> <p>  On the current transport trends in Galway city, the following shows the number of journeys to work and education recorded by the 2016 census for census day, and compares that data to the 2011 census data on which the Galway transport strategy was based.</p> <p>  In terms of the different modes, between 2011 and 2016, the walking mode increased from 11,000 to 12,000 journeys.  The cycling mode grew from 2,331 to 2,987.  People used cycling as their means of access to work and education.  The bus mode grew by almost 25%.  Between 4,000 to just over 5,000 people used buses to access work and education.  Rail went from 167 down to 120 in 2016.  The car mode went from 27,461 to 27,914, representing a small increase between 2011 and 2016.</p> <p>  As can be seen from this data, there has been an increase in the number of people walking, cycling and using buses in the five years between the censuses.  That is a very positive trend in the right direction and reflects how walkable the city is in terms of its size and the investment by the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and City Direct in improving the bus services in the city.  However, significant challenges remain to movement within the city, which prompted the NTA to develop a transport strategy with Galway City and County Councils.</p> <p>  Regarding the Galway transport strategy, to safeguard the future development and growth of Galway city and its role as the economic centre of the west of Ireland, it was considered important to develop a long-term transportation strategy that would complement and support the Galway City Development Plan.  The Galway transport strategy was developed on a joint basis by the NTA and Galway City and County Councils as an integrated transport plan, the primary purpose of which was to co-ordinate and consolidate the planning and implementation of transport proposals in Galway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.604" nospeaker="true" time="13:30:00" ><p>The key issues identified as part of the study were an over-reliance on private car travel; significant peak-hour congestion and journey time unreliability; significant dispersed traffic movements to, through and around the city centre area; constraints to national, regional and local transport movements, all of which funnel through Galway city, including all movement to and from Connemara; limited bridge crossings on the River Corrib; key junctions operating over capacity; an inappropriate mix of transport modes within the city centre due to limited road space; a public transport service and network in need of enhanced capacity and additional priority; a limited, discontinuous cycle network; restricted footpaths, poor accessibility for disabled-mobility impaired; and associated safety issues due to poor walking and cycling infrastructure.  The Galway transport strategy, GTS, has identified key transport infrastructure projects and service requirements which will address the existing transportation issues and provides a framework for their phased implementation, subject to funding.  These infrastructural projects include an enhanced city traffic network; an improved bus network with a minimum frequency of 15 minutes or better at peak time and improved residential and commercial access to a bus in a ten minute walk; improved bus priority measures; and new park and ride services and improved walking and cycling routes.</p><p>The strategy was subject to extensive public consultation and a full environmental assessment.  The proposals were developed and assessed using the NTA's transport model for the region and a comprehensive demand analysis was undertaken utilising key census data to derive a new core bus network.  The GTS has been adopted into the development plans of the two local authorities and was a key factor in Galway city winning the European green leaf designation for 2017.  One of the issues considered in the development of the strategy was whether a light rail solution - Luas - would be required for any of the transport corridors in the city.  Based on a full transport modelling assessment, it was concluded that the provision of a light rail system would not be the appropriate transport solution for Galway city at this time.  The maximum passenger corridor demand was forecast at roughly 1,100 passengers per hour per direction, which would equate to roughly one third of the operating capacity for a light rail service running at an appropriate frequency, making it a highly inefficient solution.  The implementation timeline and capital costs, which would be approximately ten times that of a bus operated system, also weigh heavily against the introduction of Luas in Galway city at this time.</p><p>The economic importance of the wider Parkmore employment area is fully recognised by the NTA and is addressed at a strategic level in the Galway transport strategy.  Three of the core bus services identified in the strategy will run to Parkmore, which will also eventually be served by the proposed N6 Galway city ring road.  The NTA has recently appointed a design team to undertake a more focussed local transportation study of Parkmore.  This study will provide a detailed breakdown of the infrastructural projects required to facilitate the short, medium and long term implementation of the strategy in Parkmore.  It is anticipated that this study will allow for an accelerated delivery of new transportation options to Parkmore, providing relief for existing employees and facilitating future growth.</p><p>The implementation of the proposals in the Galway transport strategy will be challenging.  However, I believe that their delivery will protect and enhance the future development of the city as an economic and cultural centre in the west of Ireland.  We await the announcements in the national development plan to ascertain what funding is available to deliver on the recommendations in the strategy.  I look forward to working with Galway City Council, Galway County Council and public transport operators to deliver this ambitious strategy for Galway.</p></speech>

The draft national planing framework highlights the importance of our cities and the population growth ambition rates for the cities.  It references compact forms of urban development in all types of settlements, supported by public transport, and it states that Galway's population is targeted to grow by 45,000 by 2040 which interestingly is twice as much to 2040 as was achieved in the period up to 2016.  It also references the focus on investment in infrastructure and livability and choice in terms of housing and employment and supporting new employment opportunities.</p> <p>  The draft NPF highlights 13 growth enablers for Galway.  I propose to focus on what is needed in transport terms to enable Galway to grow.  The draft NPF references progressing the sustainable development of new greenfield areas for housing and the development of supporting public transport and infrastructure, such as is proposed for Ardaun; improving access and sustainable transport links to and integrated with existing employment areas to the east of the city such as Parkmore, Ballybrit and Mervue; the provision of a city-wide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre, third level institutions and employment areas to the east of the city; focuses on public realm and urban amenity projects, including streets, public spaces, particularly in support of an extended city centre area where residential and employment areas can be linked to pedestrian routes; and development of a strategic cycleway network with a number of high capacity flagship routes and the delivery of the Galway city ring road, which my county council colleagues will speak about later.</p> <p>  As everybody here will be aware, Galway city is a medieval city and so it has a compact city centre core with low density suburbs.  It has been referred to by others as the fastest growing city in Europe.  The city has succeeded in driving forward its economic development and today it has a world class medical technology cluster within it, which thankfully is continuing to grow.  Galway City Council recognises that the socioeconomic development of the city is foremost and we also recognise that address of the transportation issues is critical because it is clearly impacting on the reputation of the city.  If this issue is not addressed, attracting new economic investment and creating new jobs in the city will be difficult.  As per the statistics outlined by the chief executive of the NTA there are over 43,000 journeys to employment across the various sectors in Galway: the five national routes coming into the city carry over 80,000 vehicles per day and approximately 95,000 vehicles cross four bridges in the city, three of which are in the city centre.  Morning peak traffic on the M6 in 2013 stood at 3,200 vehicles.  Prior to the opening of the M17-M18, it stood at 4,600 and today it stands at 6,250.</p> <p>  Some of the current challenges for us in terms of transport include an over-reliance on private car travel in Galway city; significant dispersed traffic movements to, through and around the city centre; constraints to national, regional and local transport movements, all of which funnel through Galway city, including all movement to and from Connemara; and, as I stated earlier, there are limited bridge crossings, three of which are in the city centre.</p><p>The sea to the lake is a distance of 5 km, north to south, while east to west, the distance across the city is between 8 km and 9 km, depending on from where one judges that.  Traffic solutions are also impacted by constraints such as topography, water and extensive areas of protected habitats.  Finding solutions has been difficult and extensive, as we will outline specifically in respect of the city ring road. </p><p>Many of the key junctions in the city are operating way beyond their capacity.  They operate at between 120% and 140% of capacity at peak times.  There is an inappropriate mix of transport modes in the city centre due to the limited road space for all the different public transport modes.  There is significant peak hour congestion and journey times are uncertain.  Most important, there are associated safety concerns.</p><p> The city's public transport network is in need of enhanced capacity and additional priority.  We have a limited and discontinuous cycle network and the NTA emphasises that we have restricted footpaths and poor accessibility for disabled and mobility impaired persons.  There are significant safety issues, especially for pedestrians.  For example, we shot a video at the Kirwan roundabout one morning and made a presentation to the city council about removing it at our second last meeting.  The number of near misses involving pedestrians was frightening and that happens every day.  There are 1,000 pedestrian movements across that roundabout between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.  People are jumping lanes of traffic to cross the roundabout and that is just one example.</p><p> As Ms Graham outlined, the Galway transport strategy, GTS, has been brought forward as the solution.  It is an evidence-based strategy for the region, which sets out a clear vision to create a connected city region driven by smarter mobility.  The strategy has been adopted by both Galway City Council and Galway County Council and it has been included in the development plans of both local authorities.  The GTS provides a framework for implementing transport proposals in Galway for the next 20 plus years.  It is a consistent policy and builds on previous studies carried out in the area.  We welcome and appreciate the partnership with the NTA in developing the strategy, which covers the city and the surrounding hinterland from Barna to Moycullen, Oranmore and Claregalway.</p><p> Mr. Finn will take the committee through the key features of the strategy but, fundamentally, it provides benefits to regional and intercity bus services via cross-city links; bus priority measures; interchange between regional bus and rail services and the city bus network via a hub in the city centre; park-and-ride sites on key strategic corridor approaches; cross-city bus services between Barna and Oranmore; the N6-Galway city ring road scheme will enhance connectivity to the western region; and the proposed cycle network includes integration with potential greenways to Moycullen and Barna and the Dublin-Galway greenway.  The strategy was put in place following extensive consultation and developed using the NTA's new and bespoke model for the west.  It is evidence-based and it uses a comprehensive demand management analysis, which uses key census data.  A number of new bus networks are at its core.  The reconfiguration and rationalisation of bus routes in the city will provide, for example, three connections from the west of the city to the Parkmore area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#E00200"><p>The next slide outlines the seven principles of the GTS.  The focus of the strategy is very much on the city centre core to prioritise pedestrian use, cycling and public transport and to allow vehicular traffic into the city centre primarily to access car parks while making improvements in the city centre core to enable traffic to flow.  A key element is bus priority through the city centre to reduce bus journey times and provide reliability in respect of journey times for customers.  Coupled with that, a number of the primary routes of the city on the bus network, particularly on the Dublin Road, will have bus priority to enhance journey times.  The following slide outlines the modelling that was done on the public transport bus network.  It shows the existing bus routes and the proposed new bus routes with the enhancement provided.  It shows the number of people that will be within a ten-minute walk of a bus stop in the city centre under the new arrangement.  Up to 77% of people will be within ten minutes of a bus stop and 72% of them will be near where people work.  That will provide much better access to buses.  There will be increased priority for infrastructural improvements on those routes to reduce journey times.  There also will be a cycling network with different tiers.  Working with our funding agencies, the NTA and TII, we will look to develop them over the coming years to provide better connectivity throughout the city for cycling and walking.</p> <p>  Alternatives to the GTS were examined as well.  With regard to light rail and rapid transit, the current rapid transit usage is 1,100 passengers per hour and the current bus network can meet that capacity.  Our focus is very much on providing priority for the bus network and future proofing it as the city expands.  It is a low density city centre core with many of the suburbs comprising semi-detached houses.  Currently, the population density required for commuters to be within a ten-minute walk of a light rail system does not support such a system.</p> <p>  One of the other key considerations related to the city orbital route.  If everything in the GTS relating to public transport, walking and cycling improvements was done, the modelling showed that the orbital route would be still required to reduce traffic congestion out of the city centre and to provide the bus priority that is needed.</p> <p>  The final slide outlines that the GTS is excellent in that it is a strategy for the city for the next 30 years.  We are moving forward quickly to get projects to planning stage.  We have projects at construction stage but we expect a significant increase in funding in the capital plan to enable works to move to construction.  Parkmore access improvements are ongoing.  We have had a number of projects in the past year and I am sure there will be enhanced budget provision for those in 2018 and beyond.  As Mr. McGrath mentioned, the Kirwan roundabout upgrade is a TII-funded project and we hope that will go to construction at the end of the year.  It is at Part 8 in the planning process currently and we hope to have that in front of our city councillors shortly.  The Tuam Road is another key project while the city centre transport management plan is at design stage.  An update was presented to councillors at their January meeting.  That is very much about bus priority in the city centre and improvements to traffic flow outside the city centre.  There is a project for the Dublin Road as well as cycling and greenway projects.  General junction safety improvements for pedestrians throughout the city will be undertaken and, last but not least, is the Galway city ring road.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the number of people who are due to contribute and, therefore, I will not read through the document that has been circulated.</p><p>I will, however, touch on a number of key points.</p><p> Something worth emphasising is the fact that Galway city and county work together in addressing transportation issues in Galway city and its environs by means of a number of section 85 agreements, whereby one or other of the two local authorities takes the lead on different parts of the process to avoid duplication and ensure close collaboration.  That collaboration extends to our relationship with the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which has been robust and beneficial for some time.</p><p> I wish to address the part of the overall solution that is being led by Galway County Council, namely, the Galway city ring road.  The Galway transport strategy, GTS, included an evaluation of transport options for all modes of transport and affirmed the strategic need for an orbital route around Galway city to achieve the level of service required for each mode of transport, including walking, cycling, public transport and private vehicles.</p><p> The ring road proposal is effectively 5.6 km of single carriageway and 11.9 km of dual carriageway with associated road junctions and structures, including a new bridge crossing the River Corrib.  Mr. McGrath has outlined some of the constraints on delivering a solution, including Galway Bay to the south, the River Corrib, which divides the city, and a number of sites protected by the habitats directive, for example, the Lough Corrib candidate special area of conservation, SAC, and the Moycullen bogs complex candidate SAC.  From the outset, and given the linear nature of the city and the limited available space between Lough Corrib and the built-up area, the environmental constraints needed to be balanced against impacts on residential, commercial and institutional property.  It is worth noting that the project's study area covered a total of 63 sq. km.  As such, an extensive area was considered when devising a solution.</p><p> The proposal for a ring road in Galway has been supported in policy documents from national to local level, including the Galway city and county development plans, the regional planning guidelines, the national spatial strategy and the draft national planning framework.  I will not outline the issues that have arisen that necessitate the requirement for an overall transport solution, as they have been well rehearsed by now and are well understood, and it is agreed that they need urgent attention.</p><p> In terms of options identification and assessment, a preferred option was developed in accordance with national and international design standards and the relevant regulatory and statutory requirements and guidelines.  Alternatives were comprehensively appraised in accordance with the Department's framework for transport projects and programmes and TII's project appraisal guidelines.  These alternatives included every sort of scenario from doing nothing to doing the minimum, from on-line upgrades to off-line upgrades, public transport options, etc.  There was extensive consultation with the public during the options identification stage, with more than 1,400 people attending a series of four open days in January and February of 2015 and 994 submissions received during that part of the process.</p><p> My submission to the committee outlines in figure 1 the diagram of the proposed road solution currently being advanced.  It is an extensive piece of infrastructure going from the R336 Coast Road to the N59 Galway-Clifden road and on across the N84 Headford Road, the N83 Tuam Road and the Monivea Road and on to meet the N6 at Coolagh junction.  Each of those junctions is grade separated, ensuring the greatest flow of traffic across the city as well as in and out of it.</p><p> The economic valuation has presented a benefit-cost ratio of such strength that is rarely seen in an infrastructural project like this.  The business case has been approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> Throughout the process of delivering the project, there has been extensive consultation with landowners and stakeholders, with all identified landowners and property owners having been contacted.  There have been 1,000 face-to-face meetings with landowners in their homes or in the project office.  The council maintains a project website, which has had 43,000 visits to date.  Throughout that period, there also have been extensive consultations with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, particularly on environmental issues.  Further consultation is to take place with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the coming period.  It is hoped these consultations will be brought to a conclusion shortly.</p><p> An extensive amount of work has been done in terms of all aspects of the design and planning of this project.  We hope to be in a position to submit the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as early as April.  Depending on what happens after that, including whether there are legal challenges and so forth, construction could be expected to be completed by 2024.</p><p> There is a compelling need for the proposed road.  The mood has changed from wondering whether it is necessary to one of asking us as authorities when it will be done.  The chief executive of Galway City Council mentioned the national planning framework.  It is pertinent to consider Galway's future in that context without the ring road and the associated other transport initiatives that are under way.  It is clear that Galway will not, and cannot, grow without these infrastructural provisions.  In the current environment, if Galway cannot grow, it can only regress.  The delivery of this transport solution is essential for Galway's future.  We have received good support for it to date.  My request is that we receive continued strong support across Departments and from the Government itself in terms of advancing the project through the next phases and, in due course, providing funding to have it constructed.</p></speech>

Like all commuters in Galway, we know a great deal about traffic.  My experience and expertise is in systems optimisation and product and process flow.  I wish to share with the committee a new perspective on how these tools and techniques can be used to improve traffic flow.</p> <p>  I will highlight some data and background.  A recent INRIX global traffic congestion report placed Galway as the 70th worst city in the world, the tenth worst in Europe and the worst in Ireland for traffic congestion.  This demonstrates that our current approach to reducing congestion is not working.  We need to change.  We need to start using data to make decisions, adopt new technologies such as Waze, which I will discuss later, use standardised and internationally accepted metrics such as journey time to track progress, and implement short-term - three-to-six months - process-driven initiatives to improve traffic flow.  For example, a recent initiative in Boston showed an 18% reduction in traffic congestion using these new techniques.  Coincidentally, this is estimated to be the same approximate reduction in overall travel time for the Galway transport network following the completion of the N6 outer bypass.  The same principles can be implemented nationwide from Cork to Donegal and from Mayo to Maynooth.</p> <p>  As a general comment, the proposal I am presenting should be seen as complementary to the GTS, which has been already outlined.  The GTS provides a framework for implementing transport proposals over the next 20 years.  The planned improvements in public transport, pedestrian and cycling initiatives and the new N6 Galway city ring road are to be welcomed.  However, we must implement shorter term 20-week plans in parallel.</p> <p>  To start the journey today, we are not looking for money - we are looking for data.  Once we have the data, we can use them to make data-driven decisions.  Research has shown that, when we do not have real-time accurate data, decisions are made using the HiPPO effect - the highest paid person's opinion.</p><p>Where will we get these data?  How much will it cost?  Other cities have partnered with a company called Waze and receive these data for free.  Waze is the world's largest community-based traffic and navigation application, which can be downloaded to a phone.  With it, drivers can share real-time traffic and road information, saving everyone time on their daily commute.  Waze has 500 city partners around the world with about ten signing up each week.  It works with them through its connected citizens programme.  No Irish cities or towns are currently listed as being a member of this programme.  We have been in contact with Waze through Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's office.  It responded to say that, based on our profile, it thinks we are a great fit for the Waze connected citizens programme.</p><p> Once we get these data from Waze, we can identify bottlenecks in the system that reduce the flow of traffic.  In Galway, one could argue that we do not have a traffic problem but a traffic flow problem.  Traffic management interventions require the removal of these traffic flow blockers on key city commuting routes.  In my full submission to the committee, I listed ten, but I want to give one or two examples.  We all know them.  We should look at right turns which block traffic flow on these free-flow routes.  We should optimise traffic light timing and sequencing between sets of traffic lights.  Road works are major traffic blockers.  Road openings, as they are called, which result in the closure of a traffic lane, are a major source of traffic congestion.  The guidelines on road openings recently published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are to be welcomed.  However, we should go a step further and implement lane rental charges on major commuting routes.  For example, if one wants to open a lane in London, one has to pay the city between &pound;300 and &pound;2,500 per day.  That focuses the mind.  It has been an effective programme and has saved it approximately &pound;30 million from congestion issues.  It has been rolled out across London.  It has a net profit compared to what it costs to run.</p><p> The Arthouse Cinema has had a lane closed on Dock Road in Galway for approximately five years now.  There may be a reason for that but it should not happen.  We need to test innovative solutions.  There is a technique called a zipper merge which would work well for traffic merging or could at least be considered.  Drone footage should be looked at.  We have had a licensed operator take drone footage of some major junctions in Galway and many traffic flow blockers are evident.  While there are individual examples of such interventions in Galway, we need to implement a structured process and approach to addressing traffic flow blockers on key routes.  Only then will synergies be achieved across the traffic network.  We see evidence of what can be achieved to reduce congestion with the traffic management plan implemented for the Galway races each year.  Free flow routes are put in place for the week, designated blue, green and red.  London has 580 km of permanent red routes to assist traffic flow on major bus and commuting routes.</p><p> To implement this plan in the short term, we need to trust the process.  If we trust the process, outcomes will follow.  When Irish rugby players are asked about their success, they credit it to the plan, performance and the Schmidt system.  Passion is not enough.  We need to implement a standardised metric, such as journey time, to set goals and track progress.  As one leaves today to go home, one will be interested in the time it will take.  There are other metrics in the plan - perhaps ten - which are important but the customer-focused metric is journey time, no matter what the mode of transport is.  Except for certain parts of the motorway network, we do not report journey time in Ireland live.  Our traffic reports on national and local radio use terms such as easing, moving slowly, very slow and moving well.  In the USA and other countries, live journey times on key traffic routes are reported.  I have a recording of such a report here, which I will play for members.  They will hear a US traffic report, followed by an Irish traffic report.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee for their interest in our views on traffic and congestion.  I will speak specifically about Parkmore in Galway.  Before I speak about the challenges, I am keen to share the remarkable success story of the medtech sector here.  Ireland is home to eight of the world's top ten medtech companies.  Galway plays a vital role as a global hub for the industry.  More than 29,000 people are employed in the medtech industry across 450 companies.  The medtech industry has made, and continues to make, a critical contribution to making Ireland one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.  The committee has heard many statistics from the speakers so far.  Our most important statistic in Medtronic is simple.  Every second, two patients' lives are saved or improved by a Medtronic device.  It is crucial not one of these patients is a statistic.  Each of these 70 million people has individual thoughts and dreams.  That drives us as a company.  Our mission is to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life.</p> <p>  I am unbelievably proud that, for over 35 years, and with more than 3,000 employees and 45 nationalities at the Parkmore site, we have helped to drive that mission forward with breakthrough advances in medical care in areas as diverse as drug-eluting stents, aortic aneurism repair, aortic valve repair and leadless pacemakers as examples.  We experience a pace of change in medtech that has never been witnessed before.  Technologies are diverging and converging very rapidly.  I have been involved in the medtech industry for over 25 years and have seen significant change in this time.  The truth is that when I talk to young engineers coming into the medtech industry, I tell them that I am jealous of them because the change that will happen in the next five to ten years will far outweigh what has happened in the past 25 years.  It is our job to imagine that change and make it a reality.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, that leads me to talk about what has not changed.  The  infrastructure in Parkmore has not kept pace with the success delivered by the businesses there.  This has not happened overnight.  Last October, we celebrated our 35 year anniversary on the campus in Medtronic.  When we had that celebration, we saw aerial footage of what the campus originally looked like.  The only thing that has not changed in 35 years is the road network in and out of the campus.  The road is exactly the same as it was 35 years ago.  Every other speaker here today has much more detailed knowledge of the various aspects of the traffic challenge and solutions than I have, but I am here to share the business perspective and to emphasise the nature of the deterioration in recent years.</p> <p>  The Parkmore campus employs 6,000 people, 3,000 of whom work for Medtronic.  I do not need to point out the contribution of these businesses to local commerce, providing vital jobs to the community and supporting national economic growth.  Mr. Coll mentioned that INRIX transport analytics show that Galway city is the worst in Ireland.  Parkmore is the epicentre of this and needs its own immediate solutions.  Employees are faced with long delays coming to and from work every day, which is increasingly affecting businesses and their ability to keep and attract talent.  Parkmore staff have grown extremely frustrated by the daily challenge they face to merely get to and from their place of work.  Employees regularly encounter two-hour traffic delays on a daily basis when driving in and out of the estate.  That is not their commute.  That is time taken to get in and out of the estate, which hopefully gives a sense of the gravity of the situation.</p><p> This impacts productivity, engagement and ultimately employees' capacity in their work.  As a company, our only secret to success is our employees.  That is what delivers results for us and it is vital that we have an engaged workforce to deliver results.</p><p> More importantly than that, this affects people's quality of life on a daily basis.  In order to find a solution, Medtronic has worked hard to help tackle the traffic problem.  We have an active traffic group within the company, which has spawned initiatives like car-pooling.  We have a very active cycling group and an active commuter village, in which we have invested heavily to make sure we have state-of-the art cycling facilities.  We have appointed independent traffic consultants.  We have teamed up with other industries and the State and worked with various Government bodies in the Parkmore Traffic Action Group, PTAG, which is focused on providing a collective voice to drive change.  Within the campus, across all businesses, there is an active HR sub-team that collaborates to organise shift patterns etc. to do what can be done to manage traffic.</p><p> The Galway transport strategy is a crucial part of a long-term solution to alleviating traffic congestion in Parkmore and in Galway city.  We acknowledge that a Galway city ring-road is a vital component to this and we fully support one.  The reality is that extended timelines around the delivery of this piece of infrastructure means that our options must be explored in the immediate term. </p><p> Anybody who works in Parkmore will attest that one of the most frustrating aspects of this is that every year a huge traffic management plan is put in place for the Galway Races, which are held right beside Parkmore.  Anybody working in Parkmore will agree that the only time traffic works well there is during the Galway Races when 20,000 extra people come there.  Results can be driven.  We need to stop talking and deliver them.</p><p> In regard to progress, while the traffic situation remains acute, I acknowledge that there have been some positive developments in the recent past which are worth highlighting.  An adjustment to signalling and new road markings have helped the situation somewhat in the evenings.  It is also welcome that, in the week that we are here to discuss traffic, work has started on a new exit lane from Parkmore west.  Unfortunately this work has been significantly later than anticipated, but I acknowledge the work and the fact that this will help alleviate the situation.</p><p> I come from an industry where I am judged solely on delivering results.  I would like this committee to ensure it sees results in Parkmore and across Galway.  I am appealing to those in power to implement and promote change to deliver results, and present a vision that reflects the success of Galway industry and embraces future opportunities.  We should not be afraid of being successful.  We should plan for it and make sure we set ourselves up for it. </p><p> I acknowledge that no immediate silver bullet is available.  However, the need for urgent, focused and collaborative action to tackle congestion is indisputable.  I would very much welcome the opportunity to come back to this committee to report that results have been delivered.  Businesses right across Galway and right across Parkmore, including Medtronic, have a responsibility and a role to play in working with all other stakeholders to alleviate this problem.  We are fully committed to doing that.  I welcome any questions on these topics.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhu&iacute;och do na finn&eacute;ithe ar fad a th&aacute;inig isteach agus, go h&aacute;irithe, do mo chomhghleacaithe anseo - na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as ceantar na Gaillimhe - as an tsuim at&aacute; acu san fhadhb seo a l&eacute;iri&uacute;.  Is &aacute;bhar an-mh&oacute;r agus f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.  Dar liom, is &eacute; ceann de na ruda&iacute; is pr&aacute;inn&iacute; at&aacute; againn in iarthar na h&Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  I will not go through the statistics.  They have been illustrated very well by all of the speakers.  I will not spend a long time talking, because I am really keen that everybody gets a chance to contribute.  This is not about me or any single person.  It is about all of us working together.  As Mr. Neary said, in business we are measured by results.  One is measured by what one achieves.  He also called on us to stop talking and to start more action.  That is the world I come from too.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath outlined the situation where traffic congestion is concerned.  There are more than 6,000 vehicles at morning peak time, which is between 120% and 140% above capacity.  The population of Galway is going to grow by 45,000 in the next 22 years.  We cannot cope with existing traffic, never mind what is going to happen.  I am really scared that we will keep doing what we have always done.  Members know the outcome of that.  We will get what we always got. </p> <p>  I have some brief questions.  Can Ms Graham, Mr. McGrath and Mr. Kelly tell me a little bit about the relationship between the three different organisations, how well they are working together and their joined-up thinking?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  My second relates to Galway City Council and Galway County Council and the level of their engagement with companies like Medtronic that employ a significant number of people in the Galway area.</p> <p>  The personal stories are really important.  Can Mr. Neary share with us some of the challenges his staff members go through?  I am from Spiddal and I used to travel to school in Galway by bus every day.  I would leave at 8.20 a.m. and I would be in school 8.50 a.m.  If I left my parents' house at 8.20 a.m. today, I would arrive at the same destination at 9.30 a.m.  That is 45 years later.  Look at the backward step we have taken.  It is absolutely incredible.  I am keen to see what Ms Graham, Mr. Kelly and Mr. McGrath's short-term, medium-term and long-term objectives are.  In regard to their first, second and third objectives, what are the key performance indicators, KPIs, determining whether goals are being achieved or not?  What is the project management strategy?</p></speech>

I bow to all my esteemed colleagues from Galway, but I can provide a little perspective.  Despite living 60 miles away, I have had huge involvement in Galway over the last 20 years.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  When I saw them, the first thing I looked for was solutions.  I am interested in seeing action.  I have seen this issue, and one would not have to be an engineer, a planner or anything else to know that a totally choked bottleneck is imminent.  Culturally and historically, Galway is a wonderful city.  It is unique for its welcome to tourism.  However, the way I would see it, it is operating with its hands tied behind its back when transport and congestion are considered.  I refer to the development of the massive potential there.  The Connemara area can be opened up to tourism.</p><p>I have been at some public meetings in recent years at which people objected to the ring road and proposed that light rail would solve the matter and so on.  I think all these solutions are needed, but the time for action has arrived.</p><p> I have a few quick questions.  I welcome all the presentations.  I was very interested in Brian Coll's because he seemed to be thinking on a different level or plane.  How would all the other contributors respond to what Brian Coll has said about improving the current bottlenecks?  I will not talk about individual roundabouts or anything else - I will leave that to my Galway colleagues - because I have no agenda except to see this sorted out.  Medtronic has expanded greatly over the years.  Has the issue of traffic congestion hampered this expansion?  Would Medtronic be bigger if there were a better traffic flow?  In other words, does it make it more difficult to recruit at times?  Hypothetically, if Medtronic were to expand or announce 1,000 new jobs in the morning, how would the traffic in Galway affect such a decision?  What dynamic would it have?  Finally, how do all the council officials see this rolling out?  What will Galway city be like in five years' time and ten years' time?  Regarding the figure that was mentioned of an increase in population of 40,000, unless something changes radically that will not happen because people just will not be able either to commute to or to live in a city that is hampered as it is at present.</p></speech>

For anyone who either works in Galway or has to try to get in and out of it, the simple fact of the matter is that most of us avoid travelling between 8 o'clock and 9.30 a. m.  If I am in the office at 5 o'clock in the evening, I never bother leaving until 7 p.m. because all I will be doing is sitting in a car in a car park, so there are major problems.  Before we come to the big changes, what are the impediments to making the small changes we need, or are there impediments?  The witnesses have talked about lane changes, minor widenings, which are being done on the way to Parkmore, co-ordinating the traffic lights, getting rid of some of the roundabouts that should be long gone and so on.  Are there planning or design impediments to just getting on and doing these things?  They make quite a significant difference and they can be done quickly.  I am very interested in Brian Coll's submission.  It would be very handy if one could just check when to leave.  We are playing a guessing game at present.  We sit in our offices and do not know when it is safe to leave and be able to get out of town.  Information can be of huge benefit to making things happen.  The people who do not have to be there at a fixed time can put travelling back by half an hour.  If that can make an 18% improvement, that kind of technological solution is absolutely vital, and technology can make a huge difference in the modern world.  I would be interested to know whether city council and county council or the NTA has looked at traffic management.</p> <p>  I read this plan two years ago on my holidays.</p></speech>

These are the sad things I do on my holidays.  It came out in August 2016.  I went through it and I buy into its analysis.  My attitude is that it needs to be done in total as soon as possible.  Therefore, I buy into the public transport element of it but I also buy into the fact that this cannot be done unless one builds the road around the city.  However, building a road around the city and not carrying out the public transport work will not work either.  We should just get on with fully implementing this.  I share the concern that, when we have done all that, if we do get 40,000 more people in the city and another 40,000 people within 40 miles of the city, we may still be at a zero-sum game, but we will ask the NTA about that another day.</p> <p>  This study has one big weakness in that it basically concerns Barna and Moycullen to Claregalway and Oranmore.  My understanding - perhaps Tony Neary could confirm this - is that approximately 46% of the employees in Parkmore Estate alone come from the county area, mainly from the east, and an awful lot of those are in turn from beyond Claregalway and Oranmore.  I accept that one is fine if one is in a car on the motorway route; one is sorted once one gets clear of the town.  However, there are two issues that do not seem to be addressed in the study.  One is how one gets from Galway to Carrowroe, as mentioned by an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  That can take an hour and a half either way in the morning and the evening, which is totally unacceptable for the distance involved.  Regarding the part nearest Galway, one is fine when one gets to Baile na hAbhann outwards; it is the near end that is the problem.  The other issue is who is responsible for this wider planning.  This plan just gets us to Barna, to Oranmore.  Who is responsible for the wider planning of transport in the region?  Galway is meant to be a regional grower and many of Medtronic's employees will insist on living where they are from no matter what plans we bring in.  We should be practical about that.  That is the way it will be.</p> <p>  Finally, who would be responsible for the analysis and the development of an existing resource, that is, commuter rail into Galway?  I see this as coming from the north, the east and the south and drawing up a plan as to what it would take to use the existing assets that are there and sweat them to their absolute maximum ability.  We have seen big growth in traffic from Athenry by accident since the train to Limerick started because there is some frequency to it.  However, my question is who has the responsibility of analysing what could be achieved at a modest investment if the current assets, that is, three railway lines going in three different directions, were sweated, passing bays and so on, in order to achieve frequency of trains and a focus on commuters.  It is crazy that we do not have any commuter service into Galway.  All over Northern Ireland, from Bangor to Derry and everywhere else, services are very much focused on the needs of the commuter.  Which authority, county council, city council or other body - the NTA, TII - is responsible for making a policy decision to examine this and come up with a solution?</p></speech>

Normally, it would be Fine Gael first, followed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independents.  I will call Deputy Naughton after Deputy Rabbitte.  Then we will go to answers and then work out what is the best way to deal with all the different Independents here and keep them all happy.</p></speech>

This is not a committee on which I normally sit, so I thank the committee members for affording me the opportunity to contribute.  I come from east Galway, which was not discussed at all in any of the presentations, so I represent that part of the county that is home to over 46% of the staff of Parkmore Estate, as my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  Coming from Headford and Tuam, along the M6 and with the opening of the M17 and the M18, we are now funnelling even more quickly into the city.</p><p>My first question is for Mr. Tony Neary.  How long will it take to get the extra slip road that started on Monday completed?  Believe it or not, one of my Facebook pages is usually very busy with Mr. Neary's employees contacting me about their frustration with how long they are left sitting in traffic because they cannot make it home on time in the evenings to get to the cr&egrave;che, doctor's appointments or parent-teacher meetings.  While there is progress, the staff in that zone are frustrated and annoyed with how slow it is.</p><p> The next question is for the county manager, the city manager and the NTA.  Are there funding allocations for putting a dedicated bus corridor or bus lane in place from places such as Athenry and Tuam, far enough out to cope with the capacity so we can keep traffic out of the city?  If it works very well during race week, what are the hold ups preventing it being rolled out for a 52-week period?</p><p> Finally, with regard to thinking outside the box, I welcome Mr. Brian Coll's presentation.  There is a thing called the "bendy bus".  I do not know if people have heard of it or if they can discuss it, but has consideration ever been given to putting a bendy bus in places such as Headford, Athenry or Tuam and running it into Galway?  It could service Parkmore with a park and ride and keep the traffic out.  I believe that would have merit even while we are discussing the bigger stuff.  As Brian Coll said, we need time-measured results.  There are the bigger pictures mentioned here, but we need results at present.  I was in the United States last year and the only thing people spoke about regarding Galway was how long they were stuck in the car.  That is not the image I would wish for it, so we need short-term solutions as well as long-term ones.  However, the short-term solutions and gains are not very short term when one hears from Mr. Tony Neary about how long it took to complete the slip road.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for instigating this discussion.  This is a critical issue for Members of the Oireachtas representing east and west Galway and south Mayo.  There are huge numbers of commuters coming from outside the county area, as has been highlighted.  It is significant that Mr. Tony Neary from Medtronic is present.  I am sure he would prefer not to be here talking about a negative issue that is affecting not only his company but also the 6,000 employees in Parkmore Business and Technology Park, not to mention the traffic problems across the city.</p> <p>  The key issue is solutions.  We must work on short-term to medium-term solutions as well as the long-term picture.  Last year, I invited the then Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to Galway to meet local authority members and business leaders in the Parkmore area with regard to setting out timeframes, targets and actions for the short, medium and long terms.  That happened and there was good progress at the time, but it went off the boil over the last few months.  One can hear today the sense of frustration with the lack of movement.  Funding is not the issue, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong.  We were told that last year.  It is about setting out targets and timeframes and having a plan of action.  Does the city manager need a project manager?  What are the stumbling blocks to progressing this?  I realise there are planning issues, CPOs and so forth.  We should lay them out on the public record.  Are more resources required from the Department?  What is needed to assist the county manager?  The plans and solutions exist.  I hear this constantly from the multinationals.  However, there is a great sense of frustration that they have the solutions and they are willing to work and even invest with regard to funding, but the push or drive is not there.  If it is the case that more resources and a project manager are required to drive this, that must happen.  The elected representatives would be willing to assist in that regard.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Coll about laying out the short-term picture.  He said there must be parallel solutions.  There are many small items.  They will not be the silver bullet solution, and none of us is saying that.  However, there is definitely a lack of progress in pushing this agenda not just for Parkmore but across the city.  We need a public integrated transport system and park and ride facilities to be identified north, south, east and west of the city centre.  Can both the county manager and city manager explain the current position with regard to identifying park and ride sites?  We need those sites and, as my colleague mentioned, the bus routes and lanes so people are not sitting in traffic.  If they are in a bus, they will be on a designated bus lane.  What is the position with that?  What are the stumbling blocks to progressing it?  These are the solutions, and that is what we need to emerge from this meeting.  Yes, the outer city bypass is extremely important but that will take at least ten years.  If it is less, that would be great and I will stand corrected.  However, we cannot sit on our hands until then.  We must have the parallel process taking place on the short-term and medium-term solutions.  Integrated public transport and park and ride sites will be key to that.  There is a great willingness on the part of the multinationals to work with everybody.  If a project manager is needed, the witness should say that now.  This is the time to do so.  As I understand it, funding is not the issue.  It is a lack of leadership in dealing with our traffic problems.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question.  I am not a native of Galway, but one of the solutions must be about future planning.  Will there be a higher density of housing?  Will you increase development contributions in certain parts, perhaps to encourage people to develop where you want them to do so?  There is the issue of going up rather than out and the question of areas that might require redevelopment.  I do not know if you have a plan regarding what areas you want to develop first.  However, the day is long gone where people can live where they wish in terms of spread out cities and towns.  We have to be far more cognitive of the issues that cause the type of congestion being experienced.</p> <p>  Who wishes to speak first?  I want you to be happy that you can comment freely.</p></speech>

The first question was about the relationship between ourselves and the city and county councils.  We have a very good working relationship with both authorities.  We probably deal more with the city council because most of our activity is focused on the city centre.  We have had some engagement collaboratively with the county council as well, but we would deal with Brendan McGrath's officials in the city council on a weekly basis on the various schemes.  It is a tight working relationship.</p> <p>  With regard to the engagement level with businesses, we have had some engagement but the local authorities can answer that more clearly than us.  They would have the first hand engagement in most cases.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if we have short-tem, medium-term and long-term ambitions to deliver the transport strategy for Galway.  As was said by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, we believe that is the overall solution to the problem in Galway.  In page 91, the last page, a programme is set out which divides the various measures into short term, medium term and long term.  At the start of it we say that the bus and public transport system must be tackled very quickly.  That is set down as the short-term measure.  The ring road is included as a medium-term to long-term measure, but the bus priority and the traffic network through the city centre are down as key things to be started in the short term.</p> <p>  Regarding KPIs, we would build them out of this.  I do not have certain KPIs to quote to the Senator now, but they are ones that would get developed as we would start to deliver on the various projects.</p> <p>  Senator O'Mahony asked how we would respond to Mr. Coll's proposals for responding to individual bottlenecks.</p><p>We are very familiar with how to optimise traffic flow.  We do it all the time at various locations.  We do not believe it is the answer for Galway, albeit it would help.  While there is no doubt that certain things can be improved, it is often the case that when one improves one thing, it is at the expense of something else.  For instance, to improve the movement through a junction, one may have to ban a left or right turn.  There are things that can be done to improve junctions and the flow of traffic, but quite often one finds that one is just moving a problem down to another place and must chase it along.  Fundamentally, one is dealing with a city with very narrow streets and too much traffic running down them as it is.  While there are things that can be done to help, it is not our view that this is the long-term solution.  What is in the transport strategy is the foundation to solve the issues.  Certainly, there are beneficial things we would not ignore that could be done.</p><p>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe asked if we had looked at traffic management and measures like this.  We have.  To build on the last point-----</p></speech>

That is always the case.  We are all waiting for the capital plan to come out later this week.  If the funding were provided, we would like to follow the timeline we have set out on page 91 of our document.  In five years' time, we would like to see the bus network changed in Galway and bus priority in place on as many of the routes there as possible.  We would like to see the traffic system reorganised around an orbital route around the city centre.  There are various other things set out there also.  These things are not cheap and funding is therefore important.  Without that funding, we simply will not get it delivered.</p></speech>

We have to await the outcome of the national capital plan process.  When we published our plans for BusConnects in Dublin, we wanted to continue and do a BusConnects programme for Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  The detailed planning around bus infrastructure and services that follows on from the strategy would go into a BusConnects programme and we would set out the deliveries we want in terms of bus infrastructure for Galway.</p></speech>

The Galway transport strategy is subject to a lot of further detailed work but the estimated cost to deliver it as drafted is somewhere in the ballpark of &euro;250 million to &euro;300 million.  If the Oireachtas gives us &euro;300 million, we can solve and implement what is in the strategy.  The Galway transport strategy has a 20-year horizon with significant front-loading in the first ten years and a huge amount of work targeted for years one to five.  I need a guarantee of money on a multiannual basis which will permit us to put the resources in place.  The programme we are following with the NTA has been to line up the ducks on the various projects which make up the totality of the Galway transport strategy, organising and getting through the planning processes to have the fundamental heavy lifting done in so far as possible by the end of 2018.  For example, the Galway city centre transport management plan, which is one aspect of the Galway transport strategy, probably requires between 25 and 30 individual projects rolled out to make it happen.  Some are short term, some are medium term and some are long term.  Some of them cannot be implemented until the Galway city ring road is in place.  As Mr. Uinsinn Finn pointed out, the ring road is still needed even if the Galway transport strategy is implemented in full.  It is an absolute must and a <i>sine qua non</i>.<br/><br/>The city centre transport management plan involves many difficult decisions.  It is radical, innovative and requires new thinking.  It will mean changing traffic flows at junctions, changing junctions, eliminating on-street parking and providing traffic links across the city prioritising bus, cycle and pedestrian traffic within the city core.  It means approaching it in a fundamentally different way from the way things are approached now.  The real challenge will come when we put a proposal on the table to change the traffic flow on a particular street to something fundamentally different, remove on-street car parking, change one-way systems and take traffic off some streets completely, giving them over completely to cyclists and pedestrians.  There is a win-win if we succeed in implementing the Galway transport strategy as we will also succeed in fundamentally enhancing the public realm across Galway city.  We will give the city back to its citizens and we will not be prioritising the car.<br/><br/>A number of members referred to the park and ride system.  There are a number of parallel pieces here that are in progress and which can and will happen in tandem.  The park and ride network is a fundamental element but I can only go out and buy land for park and ride facilities if funding guarantees are in place.  The NTA can only give me that money if it has guarantees in turn.  We need somewhere between &euro;950 million and &euro;1 billion to solve Galway's traffic problems.  If I have that guarantee, I can, of course, have a dedicated head of traffic.  The NTA has worked exceptionally closely with us, as has TII.  The NTA has bolstered our resources, including by providing us with additional staff and, along with TII, dedicating staff within their own organisations to work on specific Galway projects.  They are funding a range of consultancies across the city working on the different elements of the project.  A great deal is happening.  However, I guarantee the committee that as soon as we put the Galway city centre management plan into the public domain, initially by way of a non-statutory consultation and thereafter through the statutory consultation process and probably a Part X process, which possibly means it going into An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it will upset a lot of people, no more than with the Kirwan roundabout.  People will not be able to continue to do things the way they are being done now.  However, I can state categorically that doing nothing on traffic and transport in Galway is not an option.  Waiting <i>ad infinitum</i>to solve it is not an option either.<br/><br/>To achieve Galway's potential and allow it to act as the gateway capital to the west of Ireland and as an economic and entrepreneurial leader, leveraging the value of the world-class medical technology cluster in the city, the university, GMIT, and the hospital, we have to stop the city being choked.  People taking hours and hours to get out of work is not acceptable.  People have no guarantee as to their journey time.  One day a journey takes ten minutes whereas the next it takes an hour.  We met Mr. Tony Neary and the Parkmore group yesterday and we are absolutely conscious of the frustration of his and the other companies in Parkmore.  What is probably not recognised, however, is that the university and the hospital are equally large generators of traffic.  In fact, they probably generate more traffic than the Parkmore area.  The vast majority of journeys into Parkmore currently involve single-occupancy cars.  Mr. Finn will correct me if I am wrong, but it is of the order to 80% to 83% of those journeys.  We have to change the mindset.  We have to bring about the modal shift.<br/><br/>Nothing in the Galway transport strategy rules out a light rail system for Galway down the road.  At the moment, however, we can implement and deliver bus-based solutions if we have a guarantee of resources.  For example, if I get &euro;30 million, I can provide a bus lane on both sides of the Old Dublin Road, which links to Doughiska.  That is what we are talking about.  The Tuam Road bus corridor requires bold decisions but the only way it can work, fundamentally, probably requires us to eliminate the right turn into Ballybrit.  People will not like me saying that.  People do not want to hear it.  I understand the concerns of business, but radical changes in thinking are required to deliver these solutions.  We now have the strategy in place.</p><p>A hell of a lot of work went in.  It is based on evidence and facts.  The various organisations such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the city council and the county council have signed up to say this is the way forward and the solution.  I am sure Mr. Kelly will come in on this.  When the Galway city ring road is submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is hoped in April, if we end up with a legal challenge <i>&agrave; la</i>Athenry, and it is open to legal challenge, our timelines at the moment are based on a reasonable period in which the board will deal with it, so if such a challenge were to take two, three or four years, the completion date for the city ring road would not be 2024 but beyond that.<br/><br/>We have fundamentally said to our colleagues in Parkmore that the ultimate solution to Parkmore is the city ring road.  Dedicated access to the Parkmore area is provided through the city ring road, which we can outline if the committee wants.  If the city ring road could be got through planning and there was not a court challenge, we have had a discussion with TII about bringing forward the Parkmore piece as enabling works to facilitate the area.  It could be fast-tracked.  The key piece with the city ring road is getting it through An Bord Plean&aacute;la and dealing with the courts system, should the need arise.</p></speech>

I think Mr. McGrath would have all of our backing with regard to getting extra funding for whatever is needed for traffic solutions.  I want to ask about a project manager specifically for the Parkmore area.  I agree that the bypass is needed and all of that.  It is recognised that there are measures that would improve the situation and it needs to be moved on.  There is a time lag in respect of achieving targets on time.  Does Mr. McGrath need project manager assistance?  There may be costs involved.  If that is what needs to be discussed here, this is the moment to do it.

There are a number of other sites like the Galway Harbour lands, and there is a significant portion of land on Eyre Square within private ownership where again there is provision in the city development plan.  There is the Crown site.  There are five very specific sites for regeneration within the city area where buildings of height and scale can be accommodated.</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh asked me about the personal impact of this.  I have jotted down about 20 examples but will leave it at maybe two or three.  About two years ago, an employee of ours got a phone call saying her son had been seriously injured at school and had to go for surgery.  She sat in traffic for an hour and a half in Parkmore, missed the surgery and only got to see him an hour after that.  She did not get to the event.  I had another employee who got a phone call saying her father was dying and she had to go to visit him.  Thankfully, she got there before he passed away.  Those are the types of stories that happen every day.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact it has on employees, a couple of years ago we spent a lot of effort in hiring a pharmaceutical expert.  She lived on the other side of Athlone and decided not to relocate.  I was worried about our ability to retain her, so a few months after she was hired I met her to see how things were going.  We talked mainly about what work was like, but at the end of it I asked her about the commute.  Her line to me was, "by the time I get to Briarhill I am halfway home".  For anyone who does not know Galway, Briarhill is less than a mile from Parkmore.</p> <p>  I could even tell my own personal stories.  Every morning I drop my kids to Oranmore to school before I go to work.  I travel from Oranmore to Parkmore, which is about three miles.  About two weeks before Christmas there was a medtech board meeting in Limerick in the Radisson Hotel.  I am a member of the medtech board of Ireland.  After dropping the kids at Oranmore, I was in the Radisson Hotel in Limerick ten minutes before I would have got to Parkmore.  Yesterday morning I left my house, which is just off the Coast Road, travelled to the roundabout at the Galway Clinic and went from there up to Parkmore, a total journey of two miles.  I left at 6.20 a.m. and got to Parkmore at 7.25 a.m.  That is an hour and five minutes for two miles.  That is the impact of the situation.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Mahony asked what the solutions are.  Our job is to make sure that we compete as the best in the world and we make sure we have experts in the various areas.  I am not a traffic expert and am not here to provide the solutions.  The people who are responsible need to do that.  It is not my job to tell everybody how to manage traffic because I do not know.  I am here to say that this has a very real impact in terms of both industry and people's lives.  We should start thinking as the best in the world in this respect as well.  That is what makes industry succeed and it is what is needed to make Galway and Ireland succeed as well from an overall infrastructure point of view.  There is no secret to success for industry.  Certainly Medtronic has no secret to success other than that we put a huge emphasis on recruiting the best talent and then developing it.  To be able to ensure our people's continued success, we need to be sure we have an infrastructure that allows them to succeed as well.</p> <p>  The second part of the question was whether it has hampered expansion.  Again, our only secret to success is in terms of our people.  If people's experience in work is diminished hugely by their transport to and from work, then that does hamper development.  I do not want to speculate about numbers or whether we would be bigger without this.  What I will suggest is that, overall, the secret to success is getting the right people and making sure they have an environment where they are engaged to deliver results.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the question about where people come from.  He quoted the statistic that 46% come from County Galway.  I believe that figure is accurate but I do not have the numbers with me.  With regard to the Parkmore estate, Medtronic is so large we are a reflection of the entire community.  Our people come from everywhere, including Galway city centre, the Connemara area, east, south and north Galway, and from neighbouring counties.  We are reflective of the community we come from.  That is where the people come from.  They come from all around.  I believe 46% coming from outside the city is a reasonably accurate figure.</p><p> Deputy Rabbitte asked how long it has taken for the new slip road to start construction.  I have had many jobs in the medical device industry and I have worked in my current job for just over four years.  There was plenty of discussion on traffic before I took over this job and I have been actively talking about traffic for four years at least.  This is the first time we have had construction work begin to alleviate the traffic.  There have been many other discussions about exit lanes.  In terms of specific delays, we certainly had hoped it would have commenced a year ago or certainly many months ago.  It has started now and that has to be welcomed.  It will improve the situation.</p><p> If one looks at the world we live in, in Medtronic, of our 3,000 people, probably fewer than a couple of hundred are working on something that existed five years ago.  In 2024, which is the at-best case for the ring road being built, only a tiny fraction of what we have will still exist then.  We have to change constantly.  Our ability to succeed is on different timelines from this.  I find it frustrating that the only thing I have thought about consistently for four years is traffic.</p><p> I am not a traffic management expert but all I can say is that if one asks people working in Parkmore, they will say the best way to get in and out of Parkmore is to go there when the Galway Races are on.</p><p> I have covered most of Deputy Naughton's questions.  I do not want to talk about traffic, I would love to have been invited here to talk about some other topic.  That is why I feel so passionately about it.  From an industry point of view, particularly a medtech industry point of view, we have made massive advances as a country - and Galway as an area - in transforming health care around the world.  We should have the same ambition for our infrastructure to allow our people to succeed.</p></speech>

Specifically on this issue, it is important that those who are responsible determine exactly how it should be organised.  My experience in industry certainly suggests it is important to have accountability and have clear leadership for specific projects.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath made a point about 80% of cars being single user cars.  I have no reason to doubt it.  It is probably a fair statistic.  I would not call it a perk of my job, but a reality of my job is that I travel all over the world and visit cities everywhere.  How one commutes in cities depends on the infrastructure of the city.  There are certain areas where one absolutely has to hire a car.  I regularly visit Zurich and I would never consider getting a car there because there are much better modes of transport.  People will use the infrastructure that is available to them, so telling people they cannot drive their cars is not the answer.  If the infrastructure is there to encourage people not to drive their cars, then they will not drive them.  That is my experience having travelled in many cities around the world.  That is what works.  I do not feel in a position to lecture people and tell them they cannot drive their own cars.  If the infrastructure is there, people will use it, in my experience.</p></speech>

We talk about modal shifts and things being long-term.  We heard Mr. Neary talk about metrics and accountability.  We cannot improve what we cannot measure.  We have no measurement of traffic in Ireland today and we do not know if things are easing, slow, bad or heavy.  We need to get a metric in place.  If we are talking about journey times on key routes, that would be a success because it would drive changing behaviour.</p> <p>  Let us look at modal shifts.  The 1986 census showed that 46% of people travelled to work in their cars.  In 2016, 65% travelled to work in their cars.  We are now saying that we will miraculously reverse that trend over the next 20 years and shift everyone back again.  I support the initiatives but the data do not show that.  That is what I am talking about today.  Another example is incentivising people to share cars.  The Seamus Quirke Road in Galway is a 2 km stretch of road that cost us &euro;15 million or more to build.  It took nine years from when planning was granted.  Currently its bus lane does not allow carpooling.  There have been decisions made at Galway City Council and there was a vote not to open it to carpooling.  Was the decision driven by opinion or data?  We can only conclude it was driven by opinion because we do not have data.</p> <p>  The only way we could identify whether carpools will work on that lane is to baseline the data.  What is the journey time from Threadneedle Road to Tuam Road?  Currently the free-flow time on that route is nine minutes, driving legally at 6 o'clock in the morning.  The evening traffic time is about 45 minutes, which is a 500% increase.  It should be somebody's job to get it from 45 minutes to nine minutes.  We may never get to nine minutes but perhaps we will reduce it to a 200% increase.  One of the things we could do is baseline it.  We know what it takes today and we can have much more real-time data.  We could open it up for two weeks to carpooling because a lot of people drive that route.  If 50% of people who drive that route decide to drive around to their friend's houses and pick those people up, there would be half the number of cars on the route.  We could also continue the bus lane.  There are seven buses an hour scheduled on that route.  That is what we keep it open for.  There are two lanes going the whole way out to Parkmore but we do not have bus lanes out there because the buses do not go across the bridges.  That could be considered.  We want to use the data, technology and tools to make data-driven decisions.  That way we will know they are the right decisions.</p></speech>

It has made some very good interventions.  An example is the junction at the top of Threadneedle Road.  The council changed the light sequence there and eliminated right turns.  It affects me negatively but people in Barna say it has free-flowed the route into town.  We have no data to support that so people could be of the opinion that the council has done nothing.  Data can support the council in making these decisions and show evidence of the positive initiatives and interventions it is making.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh agus leis an gcoiste as ucht an seisi&uacute;n seo a eagr&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tuillte.  Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh i nGaillimh m&eacute;.

I will make a few observations and then I will ask a few questions.  During my 17 years an outer bypass was built on a cul-de-sac.  Whatever about one's view of an outer bypass or a ring road, my difficulty was that no solutions were put forward because all of the eggs went into one basket and therein built up a problem.  Another problem was the management structure but that is not a reflection on management.  During my first 13 years working on a local authority we had seven city managers, either acting or permanent.  Such a structure does not lead to long-term solutions.  When the outer bypass was put down a cul-de-sac the next effort was to get another road.  The Arrow Road Construction Company was brought in to look at that road.  Public transport was put on the road and not the other way around.  In an ideal world I would have loved the company to have declared it had a major problem due to Galway being a fantastic medieval city, that it also had serious climate change responsibilities and seek to come up with solutions in the next few years.  </p><p> I shall make a final observation.  I spent almost two days attending an oral hearing on the Seamus Quirke Road in Galway and, subsequently, I was accused by a certain person of delaying the road.  My efforts, and that of Councillor Colette Connolly, were to ensure that four roundabouts were not located on a road that spanned over 1 km.  The exact distance has been mentioned.  </p></speech>

That was the type of engineering solution put forward.  I spent my time making sure the flyover and two extra roundabouts were not erected.  Ironically, the management has adopted a policy of removing roundabouts over the past number of years.</p> <p>  My questions will be on the national planning framework, which will be published next Friday.  It is unfortunate that the framework will not be discussed in the D&aacute;il.  I have read the framework and noted terms like "sustainability" and "place-making".  The framework has identified Galway city is one of five cities that have been picked to grow more than 50% of its present population.  In addition, 50% of development must take place on sites in the inner city.</p> <p>  Light rail was ruled out as an option without proper analysis, in my opinion.  Light rail was ruled out on the basis that the city was not going to grow that big and, therefore, there would not be the same demand for development on 50% of the city which will now, if we comply with the framework, lead to further population.  Also, our climate change obligations have increased utterly.  Neither Mr. McGrath, Mr. Kelly nor Ms Graham have talked about our climate change obligations.  They did not mention what has been done to future proof our roads and transport solutions in terms of climate change legislation.</p> <p>  In 2005, I had the privilege of being elected mayor of Galway.  At that time all of the councillors unanimously voted to add park and ride facilities in the city's development plan and against the then management's advice who said it was unnecessary and premature.  We included park and ride facilities in the development plan that covered east and west of the city.  Time has elapsed and it is now 2018 yet the objectives were never complied with and people have allowed traffic congestion to build up.  I appreciate that we all want more development in Galway but it must be sustainable.  My specific questions have been asked already.  Why was a park and ride scheme not rolled out?  When will it be rolled out?  What applications were made for funding to provide park and ride facilities on the east and west of the city since the initiative was first mooted in 2005?  </p> <p>  I shall now discuss the master plan for the city in terms of sustainable development and transport.  I am open to correction but I believe that Ceannt railway station is comprised of between 12 and 14 acres of prime land that is located in the middle of the city.  I ask one of the witnesses to confirm how big the dock area is in acres.  These are public lands and we also have private lands.  Unfortunately, there is no master plan to develop that land in terms of transport.  </p> <p>  Earlier the manager gave an example of a planning application that is pending.  The private land was sold off by the docks and port company.   The planning application is for office accommodation for 2,700 people and some accommodation for students who come from abroad.  I mention this project not to criticise but to say that the plan that we will publish on Friday has sustainability written into it yet that is not happening on the ground.</p> <p>  What is happening with the park and ride option?  The last time I checked there were 30 schools located in the city within a small radius.  Just recently I have ceased having to drive my children to school and putting an idiotic car on the road in order to drive my children from the Claddagh area up to a scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, a distance of less than a mile and a half.  I had no choice but to undertake that drive as it was the only way to get my children to the school and similar situations are repeated all over Galway.  We need a living and vibrant city and it is great that the city has 30 schools where students are taught in Irish and English.  Is cathair dh&aacute;theangach &iacute;.  We need to reduce school traffic.  It has been repeatedly identified that peak traffic is a problem, which is substantially contributed to by schools.  What is the solution?  </p> <p>  I have had the privilege of travelling abroad and know that transport mobility plans for each big industry was a major factor.  I ask Mr. Neary to comment.  </p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.  I shall now refer to the contribution made by Mr. Coll.  I was frightened by one of his comments when he said: "a recent initiative in Boston showed an 18% reduction in traffic congestion using these new techniques.  Coincidentally, this is estimated to be the same approximate reduction in overall travel time for the Galway transport network following the completion of the N6 outer bypass."  He went on to say that is the estimated change that will happen as a result of 16.5 km being built at a cost of over &euro;30 million per kilometre.  That solution will lead to huge trouble and will not reduce traffic congestion.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, has mentioned Oranmore, Athenry and a train service.  Has the frequency of trains in the area increased?  Can we use what already exists as a commuter service?  </p></speech>

My first two questions are for Ms Graham from the National Transport Authority.  It is fine to have a national planning framework that spans the next 20 years.  Are there immediate plans to provide a light rail service around Galway?  Are there plans to bolster the bus service?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McGrath and Mr. Kelly for their presentations.  I understand they consulted each other about getting a road built to Parkmore.  Let us call a spade a spade here after the debacle that took place in Athenry where people objected to a planning application.  Realistically, we are more than likely going to encounter people again that will want to object.  In my opinion, the outer ring road is probably ten years away, which is not good for Galway and will not tackle the current traffic crisis.  I can travel to Dublin quicker than travel the shorter distance of 43 miles to the offices of Galway County Council, which is a frightening reality.  Where are we with solving the lane issue mentioned by Mr. Neary?  There are other plans afoot.  Is another road that has been estimated to cost &euro;5 million being considered?</p> <p>  In terms of a park and ride scheme, we have the airport site.  I wonder, no more than other Deputies, what is happening with the park and ride schemes.  </p> <p>  The hospital has been mentioned.  Is there joined-up thinking between the National Transport Authority, both councils and the HSE on plans, if any, for the hospital to be moved to Merlin Park?  Deputy Naughton has raised the issue on several occasions.</p><p>What can we do quickly to deal with this?  I know that businesspeople, especially those in large companies in Galway, cannot say it, but the traffic chaos is preventing companies from investing and coming to the west.  While there is no magic bullet to solve the problem in Galway city overnight, can efforts be made to deal with quick fixes?</p><p> It is predicted that the population of Galway will grow by 45,000 people in the next 20 years, which means that 18,000 housing units will be needed.  While I hope we will be able to have high rise developments around the CIE depot in the city, where else will we fit that number of units?  If a city is in chaos, should we not study the existing problems and solve them, rather than engaging in another fire-fighting exercise later?</p></speech>

It is crucially important that we have this debate.  Galway is suffering on two fronts.  It is losing business and shoppers.  People are no longer going into the city to do their shopping.  With the opening of the new motorway, they are going further afield.  No doubt, Galway Bay FM will cover this meeting, featuring soundbites from it, to which those stuck in traffic this evening in Galway will listen.  All they want to know are the short-term solutions and timeframes in which the works will be done.</p> <p>  I work in Parkmore and receive calls from people concerning traffic congestion around it.  Yesterday morning, for example, it took 37 minutes to get from the Ballintemple junction to the traffic lights before the business park.  The traffic is so bad I have to leave home at 7 a.m. to get into my office for 8 a.m..  Why does it take so long to get from planning to the actual works commencing?  Will Mr. Brendan McGrath and Mr. Uinsinn Finn give us a firm timeframe for when the work will be completed and people will be able to get in and out of Parkmore at a reasonable time?</p> <p>  We will not go back over the horror stories about it taking three hours to get half a mile down the road.  We all know that a happy worker is a productive worker.  A worker who gets stuck in traffic and spends the first 15 minutes in work giving out about how long his or her commute took is not a happy one.  I know Mr. Tony Neary who has a multinational business to run and Mr. Brian Coll do not want to be here discussing this issue.</p> <p>  On some occasions at the traffic lights at Briarhill I have seen one road clear with no traffic, but it still has a green light.  I was recently stuck at the Carnmore junction going into Galway on a red light.  The traffic lights for the road in front with no traffic had a green light, but I had to wait.  I timed it and it took one minute and ten seconds for it to change.  The volume of traffic which could have moved in that time would have been phenomenal.  I know that Mr. Michael Timmins worked on it at the time with Mr. Fran McEvoy.  The traffic lights at Carnmore crossroads are smart traffic lights and controlled by pads on the road.  At Carnmore Cross, coming from Monivea Road, if there is no traffic coming from town, the light will not go green but will switch to another.  It can control the traffic.  It would be a huge help if smart traffic lights could be installed at Briarhill.  There is a state-of-the-art traffic control room in Galway City Council, but, unfortunately, it is not manned.  If there are backlogs in particular areas, why can the lights not be synchronised to move traffic?</p> <p>  Is funding a hold-up in having projects approved for Galway City Council?  Is the council actually waiting for approval from the National Transport Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland or the Department to move projects forward?  If it is the case, what projects are being held up by requiring approval or funding?</p> <p>  Members said all of the eggs were in the one basket, namely, the ring road.  I could be dead and buried before it is built.  It was said by some delegates that parts of the Galway city outer ring road project would solve the problem at Parkmore.  I have looked at the ring road proposal and there are sections of back roads.  Why can they not be built now?  Why can we not go ahead with those sections and get traffic onto the Tuam Toad, instead of waiting for the whole picture of the Galway inner ring road to be presented?  Why cannot it be done in stages?  Can Galway County Council examine developing various stages of it now?  If permission for the ring road is refused, will all of the proposed new roads to service Parkmore and other parts of the city be thrown out of the pram with the toys?  We need to look at building the road in stages.</p> <p>  I have tabled parliamentary questions about park and ride facilities, as well as raising the issue in the D&aacute;il.  I have discussed with the city manager and Mr. Uinsinn Finn why the Galway Airport site is not used for this facility.  The NTA claimed that it was too far out.  When it was tried before, nobody used it.  Why did nobody use it?  It was because the park and ride bus service was also stuck in traffic.  Who will use such a facility if the bus service is going to be stuck in traffic?  The answer is nobody.  The only way a park and ride facilitiy will work is if buses actually pass through every 15 minutes.</p> <p>  There was a proposal to locate the park and ride facility in Doughiska on residentially zoned land.  We are crying out for homes to be built for people in Galway, but there is a proposal to locate a park and ride facility in Doughiska which is practically in the city and one mile from Parkmore.  That is a crazy proposal.  We should look at situating it at Galway Airport, particularly when one considers the number of people coming from the east side of the city.  There is Junction 19 on the M6 and the Rathmorrissy intersection.  In two turns, one is at Galway Airport where there are 125 acres of land.  A proper bus corridor from the site could solve many problems at Parkmore.  Will Ms Anne Graham explain why the Galway Airport site has been dismissed?  I want a feasibility study to be carried.  One does locate a park and ride facility in the middle of a city.</p> <p>  What discussions has Galway County Council had with IDA Ireland on providing infrastructure in the county?  I tabled a parliamentary question yesterday on the available lands in the IDA Ireland portfolio in Galway.  Tuam Business Park has 1.47 ha of land, Ballinasloe Business and Technology Park has 8.8 ha of land; Tuam Science and Technology Park has 9.92 ha of land; Parkmore Business and Technology Park has 26.75 ha of land; Oranmore Science and Technology Park has 26.78 ha of land; while in Athenry there is 92.43 ha of land available.  Why is IDA Ireland not locating industries at these locations?  Why do we have to bring everybody into the city?  There are motorways between Tuam, Ballinasloe, Gort and Shannon, while there is a huge intersection at Rathmorrissy which services Oranmore and Athenry.  In the United States and elsewhere in Europe there is forward planning.  Why is Galway suffering?  This issue dates back many moons to the delegates&rsquo; predecessors when there was no forward planning.  Parkmore was developed 35 years ago, but there is the same road in and out of the business park.  Why were roads not planned to come out onto the Tuam Road or the Monivea Road?  We are suffering owing to lack of forward planning.</p><p>We should pick IDA Ireland sites at Oranmore and Athenry and provide the roads infrastructure.  Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh should ask Mr. Martin Shanahan to address the committee on what IDA Ireland is doing to solve the traffic problems in Galway.  A number of units were built at Parkmore by public private partnerships for leasing to IDA Ireland which then aimed to bring in industry, but it could not get people to come there.  Therefore, why is it still building there?  We have lost industry to Limerick.  Over 600 jobs were supposed to come to Galway but did not on account of the traffic problems.  I received a telephone call from the managing director of a factory in Galway.  The top person had flown in from the United States, but he was stuck in traffic and late for a meeting.  He had to get a Garda escort to get him there on time.  We have to work on the issue of forward planning.  I ask Mr. Finn and Mr. McGrath to tell people who will be listening to this debate in their cars this evening when there will be progress at Parkmore and in other parts of the city.  It is frustrating for the and Galway is suffering.  This will continue to be the case until we see progress.</p></speech>

Mr. Brian Coll made suggestions on easy things that could be done to help traffic flow in Galway.  I call on the National Transport Authority to collaborate with him to see if we can make Galway a pilot project in introducing Waze immediately.  It would be something positive to come from this discussion.</p> <p>  Everybody has a gripe, but we should not talk ourselves out of attracting industry.  IDA Ireland is a victim of its own success, but it has a responsibility when building parks.  I remember building at Parkmore when I worked in the private sector in construction.  We built a lot of the factories, including some stuff for Medtronic, but nobody had the vision to assess capacity and provide for infrastructure-led development to maximise it.  IDA Ireland needs to look at how it designs parks and the width of carriageways has to change.  On the other side of the road the carriageways are all single-lane.  Local authorities also have to future proof the developments IDA Ireland business parks.  We have proved that we can get the numbers and create the best products in the world and need to design our infrastructure to match it.</p> <p>  Little things can make a big difference.  I believe a commuter rail service would make a difference to Galway.  The clearest artery from Tuam and Claremorris into Eyre Square is the railway line, but there is no rail service in those places.  There are 13 acres of land in Tuam which could be developed into a transport hub, with park and ride facilities and private bus services to take people into Galway every day.  Those who car-pool should also be allowed to use bus lanes.  We should try it for a month or six weeks to see how it would changes people's habits.  We would not have to spend millions in doing so.</p> <p>  Galway City Council and Galway County Council own Galway Airport.  A park and ride facility could be provided, but bus lanes are needed on the ring road around the city.  It baffles me why buses do not travel over the Quincentennial bridge to create a loop.  It would not cost money to do it, although a line might need to be painted on the road.  There is also space in the area from the airport to Parkmore, up to GMIT, across to the city centre, out to the hospital and the university and back out over the bridge.  There has been talk of the provision of a bus lane from Claregalway to the city, but there are issues with the last leg of the route and some businesses are not happy with it.  Bus operators do not need to have the bus lane right into the city, but if there was one as far as Leader's shop, they could come back out.  It works in Claregalway village, where there is no bus lane through the village.  These are small things that would not cost money, but they would take away the frustrating delays.  We need to change the mindset where we do nothing until we have it all right.</p> <p>  I was in China last year for St. Patrick's Day.  I was in a train station where 14 platforms had been built, even though only one was in operation.  They had been built for the future.  While I am not saying we should build 14 in Galway, we should build on the basis of the projections up to 2040.  A project manager is required to manage traffic at Parkmore in order that there would be no distraction and it could be dealt with successfully.  Everybody wants to do something and to do it right, but there are some quick fixes.  The most important for me is getting Waze into Galway as a pilot project in order that we can become the leader in it in this country.</p></speech>

We spoke about the predecessor of the Galway city ring road, the Galway city outer bypass, and the difficulties it ran into.  The project could have been built in 2011, but we are a long way from it now.  On a smaller scale, we spoke about the project that got under way this week to provide a left-hand turning lane out of Parkmore.  A previous version, granted permission by Galway County Council, was taken to An Bord Plean&aacute;la where it was refused.  It is not the case that nothing is being done.</p></speech>

There are standards for every development, as well as land ownership and environmental issues.</p><p>It takes time to get those projects through and the outcome is uncertain.</p><p> In respect of issues of rail to some of the other towns, there are good examples of collaboration with Irish Rail.  For example, there is the development of the Garraun rail station in conjunction with Galway County Council with regard to the parking area required for it.  There are a number of locations in the county with rail stations, including villages like Ardrahan, Craughwell and Athenry.  Looking to the future, there are deficiencies with respect to wastewater treatment facilities at all those locations.  Despite the fact that the rail services could take some pressure from the city, they will be unable to do so without the availability of services.</p><p> With the ring road, the approach has been to try to develop an overall solution both in terms of the road and public transport elements.  If a piece was taken out, it would become a separate project and all the processes would have to be gone through separately.  At the end, one would probably be accused of project-splitting.</p></speech>

The bottom line is we are at a point where we are very close to submitting a full project that would deal with all those issues.  If we secured approval for that, elements of the project can be brought ahead and delivered more quickly in advance.</p> <p>  As for IDA Ireland lands, there have been initiatives in some locations, such as an advanced facility that was recently approved for Ballinasloe.  We have engaged on an ongoing basis with IDA Ireland and it is aware of the availability of lands.  There are lands that have seen the benefit of planning permission that have not come forward for development.  IDA Ireland has been trying to secure development of those lands and I met representatives of various enterprises with IDA Ireland in that regard over a period.  From the county's perspective, we would dearly love to see some of those lands developed, available, zoned and serviced etc.</p> <p>  The point was raised about the overall accommodation of population growth.  When we tease through the detail of the national planning framework, there will be a piece about how much development will be in the city and within the city and metropolitan area.  It is quite clear from recent decisions on strategic housing developments that there is a clear indication that the metropolitan area must deliver higher densities in the commuter belt of Barna, Moycullen etc.  In advance of the required infrastructure that we have spent the afternoon speaking about, it would be a real challenge to have additional higher densities at those locations without supporting infrastructure.</p></speech>

We did an assessment of light rail and it is included in the transport strategy.  Deputy Connolly has a different view but we tried to assess the evidence and formulated our conclusions from that.  With respect to climate change obligations, everything in the strategy is focused on assisting us in meeting climate change obligations.  We are putting in a really efficient public transport system that will bring more users to that system and that can only be beneficial from a climate change perspective.  Similarly, with cycling and walking, we are putting in decent networks.  From a sustainability perspective, a mode shift is fundamental to tackling climate change.</p> <p>  Others will be able to answer the Deputy's question as to why park-and-ride was not rolled out in the past.  It has been mentioned by several people that for park-and-ride to work successfully with a bus system there must be bus lanes and bus priority; it simply will not work otherwise.  Nobody will get out of a car and get into a bus just to be stuck in the same traffic.  We need bus infrastructure, including bus lanes and priority through the city centre, to be in place before we can successfully introduce park-and-ride.  We can put a site in tomorrow but it would not be successful because there is no priority through the city.</p></speech>

I am not saying it might not be a little better now.  We looked around the Coolagh roundabout on that side of the city.  There was a big attraction to putting a site off that roundabout if that could be achieved.  It would connect straight away to the city bus service we are putting in under that strategy.  That would mean people could hop on a bus that hopefully would be coming every ten minutes into Parkmore Estate.  More importantly, one could hop on a bus going the other direction through the city centre to the university, hospital and so on.  There were many attractions to that site as part of the overall package.  I am not saying we cannot look at the city airport again but that is why we thought the other site was better.</p> <p>  A question was asked about school transport.  With the bus system proposed in that network, we set out how many schools suddenly come within walking distance of that network.  At present, only approximately half the schools are within a walkable distance of a bus route.  Under the revised system, 93% of the secondary schools would be within ten minutes, or much less in most cases, of a bus route.  That gives the tremendous opportunity to at least explore the chance of secondary school kids being able to use bus transport to get to school.  That is in addition to the cycling network it is proposed to develop.  There has been a reasonable degree of consideration in that regard.  Those are the main points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#R01200"><p>A couple of other questions were raised.  The park-and-ride issue was raised by a number of members.  Working with the National Transport Authority, we are very keen to develop such sites in Galway and they are very much in the Galway transport strategy.  They are linked to the national climate change policy as well.  Location is vital to park-and-ride sites.  Many of us here are familiar with Galway and within a very small edge of the city, between the Oranmore coast road, the old N6 - now the R446, the M6 motorway, the Monivea Road and the Tuam Road, there is a corridor of approximately 2 km or 3 km and approximately 50% of the traffic coming to the city uses that corridor.  There are approximately 80,000 vehicles per day using the national roads in and out, with approximately 40,000 of those vehicle movements coming through that area.  It is a key priority for a park-and-ride site in that area, as it would serve the main commuter traffic in and out of the city.</p> <p>  The next element important for the location of park-and-ride sites is the perceived edge of congestion.  If a person comes into congestion and drives for ten or 15 minutes, the driver is more than likely to continue the journey.  If the point is too far out, the driver will not pull in but go on past it.  It is very important to have the location at the perceived edge of congestion.  Pricing and parking management is also very important in getting people to use park-and-ride facilities.  As people in Parkmore have free parking, it is very unlikely they will use a site where there may be an element of pricing.  If it is to be provided free of charge, there must be a grant allocation to run the service.  They are expensive to run in terms of infrastructure to be provided.  The land is provided initially before the site is constructed and then bus priority is allocated to it.</p><p>There is an infrastructural cost to that and then there is the ongoing operating cost as well.  Where it does very work very well is in terms of what we would like to see, and that is why it is very important in the Galway transport strategy, GTS.  What we are doing in the city centre, in a project that is currently at planning stage, is based on the city centre traffic management plan.  There is parking in the city centre and one pays from &euro;5 to &euro;12 to &euro;18 for day parking.  What we would love to see is that the people who are parking in the city centre might park at the park-and-ride site and get a bus service into the city that would cut 15 to 20 minutes off their journey time on a cost-neutral basis from their perspective, in that they would be paying for the park and ride on the edge of the city and getting the public transport service into the city.  The 409 service that serves Galway is extremely successful because of the priority it has coming in the Dublin Road.  We think the park-and-ride system would really work well serving the hospitals and the big employment centres within the city centre in the future.</p><p> That ties in very much as well with the modal shift, in that we must be conscious of the people who come from the county and as some members said, are reliant on the car.  They will then have the opportunity to change over into the modal shift.  When we talk about park and ride, it is not about getting people out of their car onto a bus, it is about getting out of one's car and perhaps onto a bike or walking as well.  In the GTS we have walking and cycling routes because we perceive a shift where people are starting to move over into using their bikes for certain elements of their journey.  That could involve having bike lockers at the park-and-ride sites or for people to carry a bike in their vehicle.</p><p> Parkmore has been raised on a number of occasions.  There are more than 6,000 employees in Parkmore and more than 5,000 of them are using single-occupancy vehicles.  The Galway Races is used as an example of how traffic is managed.  Those of us who went to the races 20 years ago were aware of huge traffic congestion around and one could ask why that has changed now.  There is very minimal traffic congestion connected with the races currently and that is down to the modal shift.  It is an ideal model.  I will not quote figures in case I get them wrong.  A significant number of people now go to the races by bus.  There are double-decker buses lined up in Eyre Square and various other locations to bus them out.  A lot of people also walk to the races.  There is also high occupancy in cars that do travel to the races.  Three, four and five passengers are squeezed in.  That is what we would like to see in terms of the overall context of how one can move people into more sustainable transport, going forward.</p><p> I will recap on some of the projects that have been delivered in Galway that we can perhaps forget about fairly quickly.  What is very important for Galway city at the moment is the existing N6 corridor across the city.  In recent years a lot of junction improvements have been carried out, including the removal of roundabouts and signalising the junctions, which are linked to the urban traffic control, UTC, centre in city hall.  Deputy Grealish mentioned the Carnmore junction earlier.  Those are all fibre linked and monitored systems.  With the traffic modelling and counting we have done we are getting between 15% and 30% more traffic through at each junction since they were upgraded.  The key priority for the upgrading of junctions was not just to get more traffic through them, pedestrian safety has been another factor.  Safe pedestrian crossing facilities have been provided at the junctions and at the same time traffic volumes have been increased.</p><p> In terms of serving Parkmore and the broader area, it is not that long ago when we did not have the M6 motorway linking Athlone to Galway.  Consequently, in the example given of a person leaving Parkmore who was half way home at Briarhill, if that person needed to go through Craughwell, Loughrea, Ballinasloe and all the towns along the way, they would certainly not have been half way home.  It is not long ago since the M6 opened.  The M17 and M18 motorways are now open as well.  I think that the example being given was prior to the last 12 months but a lot of improvements have been delivered in Parkmore.  We were getting continuous complaints about it taking an hour and a half to get out of Parkmore but I think Mr. Neary would agree with me that there are very few occasions now when there are any significant delays such as was the case previously.  I do not want to put a number on it but apart from one or two bad days, the traffic currently is being managed.  We cannot rest in that regard because it is important to keep moving and to further reduce delays, as well as to look at the situation in terms of the modal shift.  It is not just about providing increased capacity into Parkmore for the single-occupancy cars but also for buses and cyclists.</p></speech>

What is the timeframe for it?  I know there are extra lanes, bus lanes, left-turning lanes and an extra slip lane coming in from the Monivea Road to bypass the bottleneck.  People want to hear about the completion date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-14a.703" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Uinsinn Finn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018021400002#S00300"><p>It was during this mid-term break last year when we started the first phase of the current programme of works, which has NTA funding.  That provided two lanes on the Parkmore Road on the approach to the Monivea junction.  It also reconfigured the Briarhill junction to provide two lanes going left.  The reason for that was based on the traffic modelling we had done as part of the work.  We saw that 80% of the traffic coming down Parkmore towards that direction was going left towards the motorway.  Two additional lanes were added with changes to the light sequencing and that has had a significant benefit in terms of people coming out of Parkmore.</p> <p>  Two other elements of work were delivered but I will not focus on them.  The next phase that is going on at present, the 1D works, is the left-turn lane coming out of the Parkmore West Estate.  Going back to the modelling that was done, we had picked up that about 39% of the people coming out were going left towards the Tuam Road and consequently the left-turn lane, which is 330 m long, will provide additional capacity for people coming out of Parkmore West who are going left to avoid being in the left-turning queue and that will certainly help them.  That work is ongoing at present and is due to be completed before the end of the Easter holidays.</p> <p>  The next element of work for which we have a commitment is the signalisation of the Tuam Road and Parkmore junction in order that the 40% of people who are turning left going down towards the Tuam Road will have a signalised junction to help them get out from the perspectives of traffic flow and safety.  We are hoping for other elements to be added in 2018 but as we do not have the budget allocations yet, I cannot give any confirmation on that.  We are, however, seeking to deliver other elements of improvements in the current programme in 2018.  We ultimately are going into what we call the more medium-term measures, which are projects that will require land, possibly by CPO, that will need to go through the planning process as well.  Again, as my colleagues in the NTA outlined, consultants have been appointed who are working on an overall strategy and that will steer us in terms of funding going forward in the next two to five years.</p></speech>

The first assurance I will give is that from an industry point of view and certainly from Medtronic's point of view, we recognise we have a responsibility and we fully intend to meet all our responsibilities.</p> <p>  The Parkmore traffic action group has been active for a number of years.  I sit on it myself and I always attend meetings, where possible, or send a delegate.  I think that is also the case for most other industries there, in that the most senior person in Parkmore is the person who is the representative on the group.</p> <p>  On initiatives such as a cycling village, in Medtronic we established a team of active cyclists to design a cycling village that would meet the needs of cyclists and we constructed and built that.  Members are more than welcome to come and see it at some stage.  In response to requests we provided drying facilities, shower facilities, secure locking, subsidised cycling gear and active cycling days where we provide repair for bicycles.  The response to that has been very positive.</p> <p>  As for car pooling, while we cannot control the road infrastructure, we could control our car parking space.  All the parking spaces adjacent to each building, which have prime access to the road network, have been dedicated to car pooling.  Consequently, anyone who wants to car pool can get a space in the best car parking locations we have.</p> <p>  The land for the new slip road has been given by both Medtronic and Merit Medical.  We have an active forum within Medtronic where people can make suggestions about transport mechanisms to and from work.  We recognise that we are part of the solution.  I assure the committee that we will play an active role and I feel I can speak for every other industry based in Parkmore in that regard as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Grealish asked a question about new office space being built.  I will not get into speculation about the usage of that but I can confirm it is being built right now.  The size is roughly 300 office spaces.  I believe it is due to come on stream in the summer.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to Deputy Canney's comments.</p><p>While I was not asked a direct question I would like to follow up by saying we need an overall strategic plan but small things can make a difference.  As Mr. Finn mentioned the improvements last year have made a difference.  When we say there were additional lanes it was movement of lanes.  We moved road markings to allow additional access out but that made a difference.  We need a long-term vision but we also need to do our day-to-day job and deliver small things every day.</p></speech>

As soon as this is developed to the point where we are all comfortable that in terms of its detail it is the right scheme it is moved to the next stage and it is a question of whether we have the funding available to put into the construction.

The proposals need to come forward to identify these park and ride sites, east, west, north or south, wherever the NTA deems strategic.  It has the expertise.  I welcome the fact that the Coolagh location has been identified or progressed.  If the NTA feels it is the right location and will link up with the integrated public transport I would not speak out against it but I have an issue with the slow pace of identifying these sites.  Funding may be an issue but if the proposals do not come forward we cannot help the NTA get that funding.</p></speech>

Our purpose here is to challenge yet support in every way we can.  We appreciate the efforts being made.  In particular I thank my colleagues.

There is such a level of knowledge, expertise, commitment and passion that we are not going to give up until such time as we see tangible verifiable results and I hope I speak on behalf of everybody here.  I thank all my colleagues for their contributions, particularly Senator O'Mahony who worked hard with me on this from the very beginning.</p> <p>  Will the city and county managers and Mr. Creegan give us a commitment that they will investigate the Waze and work with Mr. Coll on that?</p></speech>

I would like if possible to have a follow-up meeting on this before the end of the year.  Every Deputy and Senator from the Galway area attended this meeting.  That shows the need for this.  I would like if, through the Chair's good offices or my office, we could get a report or feedback now on the follow-up from this meeting, on what the Chairman aims to achieve in the next 12 months, where is the accountability, how much will it cost and how we will measure it.  I would like that all my colleagues get a copy of that to form part of our discussion and deliberation in October or later, when we are back in session.</p></speech>
