    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017052300002#D00600"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to speak with them this afternoon.  As indicated, I am the director of participation and ethics in Sport Ireland, a role which encompasses anti-doping.  I am an independent observer on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA; a former board member of the Association of National Anti-Doping Organisations; and a current member of the Management of Intelligence and Drugs Action in Sport, MIDAS, committee, which examines anti-doping in animal sports.  Ireland previously held a position on the WADA foundation board as the EU representative, during which time I acted as an adviser to the then Minister on anti-doping.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland was established under the Sport Ireland Act 2015 and is the single statutory agency responsible for the development of sport in Ireland, including performance, participation, high performance, the National Sports Campus, etc.  Under the Sport Ireland Act, Sport Ireland's functions regarding anti-doping include the provision of guidelines and information regarding anti-doping and fair play in general, good conduct and best practice in sport.  We also have responsibility to take such action as Sport Ireland considers appropriate, including testing, to combat doping in sport.  We are responsible for the provision of education and information to athletes and other people in the field of anti-doping.  We are also identified in our capacity as the national anti-doping organisation in Ireland to direct the collection of samples, manage the testing and test results of samples and attend hearings, as required.  The significant priority given to anti-doping work by Sport Ireland is recognised through a full section of the Act dedicated to strengthening the anti-doping programme.  Sport Ireland has been clearly designated as the national anti-doping organisation in Ireland and the Irish anti-doping rules have been enshrined in this legislation.  Data-sharing powers have been enhanced between key State regulatory authorities and other appropriate anti-doping organisations.  Sport Ireland collaborates closely with the Institute of National Anti-Doping Organisations, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Medical Council in the area of information-sharing.  Ireland has ratified the Council of Europe's Anti-Doping Convention, the main objective of which is to promote the national and international harmonisation of the measures to be taken against doping.  More recently, Ireland also ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, which effectively binds the Government to the implementation of a fully functioning national anti-doping programme which complies with all the relevant articles of the WADA code.</p> <p>  WADA was established in 1999 as an international independent agency composed and funded equally by the sports movement and governments of the world.  Its key activities include scientific research, education, development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code and its implementation.  The core of any anti-doping programme is the rules under which it operates, and the WADA code serves as the basis for all anti-doping programmes worldwide.  Under the definitions of the code, Sport Ireland acts as the national anti-doping organisation for Ireland and is therefore responsible for implementing the requirements of the WADA code and international standards for sport in Ireland.  To this end, the Sports Council produced the 2004, 2009 and, most recently, 2015 Irish anti-doping rules, which bring into force the WADA code in Irish sport.</p> <p>  In October 2015, the inaugural meeting of MIDAS took place at the offices of the Irish Turf Club at the Curragh.  The symposium was attended by senior level executives from Horse Sport Ireland, the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Turf Club and the investigations division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I joined this group immediately after the meeting.  It was suggested at the meeting that it would be appropriate that I join the group, so I am now part of it.  I have seen this as a positive step towards a unified approach in the regulation of doping and medication controls for horse and greyhound sports working with drugs enforcement authorities in Ireland.</p> <p>  A discussion on the undoubted benefits of information-sharing for animal sports investigations was led by the MIDAS group at a special session at the recent Tackling Doping in Sport conference in London, the world's largest independent anti-doping conference, which was attended by representatives of Sport Ireland.  During the session, which included presentations by the Irish Greyhound Board, the Turf Club and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, examples of successful prosecutions in the wake of the formation of MIDAS were highlighted.</p><p>Strong feedback was provided afterwards to the group that it was a well-received session.</p><p> Sport Ireland was asked to provide feedback on the draft general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill 2017.  My comments on the draft Bill are to be taken not in the context of greyhound racing on which I declare have no expertise, but in the broader human anti-doping context of our own legislation and advice that I can give on our experiences from human anti-doping.</p><p> The following are the key highlighted issues that we felt were relevant in terms of feedback.  First and foremost among these is the level of detail in the Act.  In our first Act, the Irish Sports Council Act 1999, we had a broad statement that we could take what action we considered appropriate to combat doping in sport, and that was it.  That was empowering and allowed us to develop a strong programme, but we felt we needed to strengthen it by recognising the Irish anti-doping rules and the status of Sport Ireland as the national anti-doping organisation.  What was important to us was the fact that the Irish anti-doping rules were taken as gospel in relation to anti-doping in Ireland.  We ensured that the detail was not in the legislation.  We have taken the detail out and placed the operational and procedural information within the Irish anti-doping rules.  Incorporating that level of detail creates a risk, in that anti-doping is a fast-moving area.  We have experience of where our international colleagues got into trouble in that they have not been able to update their regulations and legislation quickly enough to deal with changes in circumstances internationally.</p><p> Strict liability is another area on which we rely heavily.  Basically, the presence of a substance is an offence and there is no room for manoeuvre around that.  Therefore, the sanction on an athlete is based on the presence of that substance.  There is a potential opportunity for the athlete to reduce the sanction in various circumstances but, ultimately, the sanction is based on strict liability and there is no moving from that.  It makes it much more straightforward and much more easily enforced.</p><p> In regard to the racing sanctions, although there is a section around racing sanctions, our recommendation would be that it would be more straightforward if, within secondary legislation, there was clearer information as what offence would relate to what level of sanction, so that there is less room for manoeuvre for a disciplinary panel.  This aligns itself with article 16 of the world anti-doping code.  Although the vast majority of the code has been developed as a set of harmonised regulations around anti-doping in humans, there is an article entitled, Doping Control For Animals Competing in Sport.  The article guides the international federations for any sport to develop rules and regulations.  Clearly, that is not straightforward in the case of greyhound racing.  I am not aware that there is an international federation and that creates some challenges.  We would recommend that the Act would align itself with the principles of this article in the code, given that we signed up to the UNESCO convention which obliges us to enforce it.  While, strictly speaking, we will not be in a position to enforce it because it is a recommendation for international federations, we would recommend the principles identified in that and best practice would be to consider them in the Act.</p><p> Finally, the current draft makes no reference to investigations and intelligence and the potential for information sharing as a result.  Certainly, my experience of being on the MIDAS group is that this is an area which has been strong for greyhound racing and the Turf Club in terms of the potential to achieve high success in the area of anti-doping with the co-operation of the various enforcement areas as well as the national governing bodies of sport.</p><p> As I outlined previously, Sport Ireland, previously the Irish Sports Council, has extensive experience in the field of human anti-doping, both at a national and international levels.  While the subjects of this draft legislation are different from ours, the core principle of protecting the integrity of the activity against the threat of doping are the same.  I hope the issues highlighted, both in our submission and in evidence today, will assist with the development of a robust framework which will protect those who participate in greyhound racing in a fair and clean manner.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for giving me the opportunity to appear and I would welcome any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017052300002#E00300"><p>I thank Dr. May for her presentation.</p> <p>  This part of the proposed Bill will be hugely important.  There is a significant public perception that the greyhound industry has problems in regard to the doping of greyhounds and the detection of same.  I am a greyhound owner and I am involved in the greyhound industry.</p> <p>  Dr. May recommended strict liability.  Listening to her presentation, there was no mention of a tolerance level for products.  In much of the current testing, the percentage being found with a prohibited substance is small but trainers whose dogs have been found with those prohibited substances in the past 18 months to two years are adamant that it is as a result of the feed the dog is getting.  They say the small residue showing up in the doping tests is not any deliberate attempt to dope the dog.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly would be much more aware of the regulations and controls with horses.  In the past, horses have lost races because of a small amount of a prohibited substance being found in the sample and it clearly indicated that it was as a result of feed being given or something being administered within the prescribed time.  The horse might not have raced for a month after getting a certain antibiotic substance, but a residue still showed up in the test.  How can we cater for that, where a person is abiding by the rules but a small level of a prohibitive substance still shows up in the test?  It is essential for the industry that we get it right.</p> <p>  I noted in the documentation for the meeting today that the Irish Coursing Club will not make a submission to, or appear before, the committee.  That is very disappointing.  There are two elements to this, the coursing industry and the track industry, and both of them must get this right.</p> <p>  Coursing takes place in fields in numerous venues round the country.  Every weekend during the winter, there could be seven or eight coursing meetings.  How can we ensure proper standards apply?  It is not a controlled environment, such as a racecourse where one can have professional staff present and ensure there is a security guard when the horse enters the after-race parade ring or whatever.   How will we ensure that in a field in the countryside the regulations will be adhered to?  </p> <p>  There was a court case a number of years ago resulting from derby final night where a trainer maintained that someone else got at his dog before the race and there was a lengthy legal battle between Bord na gCon and the greyhound trainer.  How will we include all that in a Bill - for example, ensuring a dog is kennelled an hour before a race so that no one has access to it?  Many of those things have to be tightened up.  The proposed Bill has to cover all of those eventualities.  If someone is found with a level of substance, I agree fully there has to be strict liability.  However, in the much-publicised case to which I referred, Bord na gCon was left with a hefty legal bill and there were major questions about our industry.  There were huge question marks hanging over the performance of one dog in the derby final, which is the premier race in the calendar.  That, obviously, attracted significant public attention.  The public is waiting for this proposed Bill to ensure that in both coursing and dog racing, doping neither happening nor tolerated.</p><p> Dr. May questioned there being too much detail in the Bill.  To me, that is why the detail is in there.  It is the cornerstone of the Bill.  We have to rebuild public confidence that this industry is being run on a strict basis and that there is no doping either in coursing or on the track.  Whether it is animal welfare or whatever, there is a lot of public money going into this industry.  The doping of dogs is not acceptable.</p><p> There are a lot of things to get right in this Bill.  First, we need to ensure that if someone is found to be breaking the rules, the Bill is strong enough to ensure the proper punishment is administered.  Second, many of the events happen in fields around the countryside.  How can we ensure the proper standards and supervision is in place and that we do not get a case where someone claims he or she did not administer anything to the dog, someone else must have, and that he or she can then renege on his or her responsibility.  The owner of the dog has to bear ultimate responsibility but also the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon have a responsibility to ensure there is a certain amount of protection for competing dogs.  This is the essential part.  That is not say the rest of the Bill is not important.  It is, and the other heads in the Bill are very important, but for the sake of the perception of our industry by the public we must ensure that when this Bill passes through into legislation, we can look everyone square in the eye and say there is no way a dog can run now, whether doped for enhanced performance or for lack of performance, which can also happen, either on the coursing field or the track.  We would fail in our duty as legislators if this Bill did not stand up to that scrutiny.</p></speech>

I have to go to the D&aacute;il for a parliamentary question so I may not be here for the response, but I will get it from the record, so apologies in advance.</p> <p>  I was interested in Dr. May's remarks that the general scheme contains significantly more detailed information than she believes is required and how that would impact on the rapidly changing area and ability of the Legislature to respond or being obliged to respond by changing primary legislation at a future date.  This may be in her wider submission on the Bill, and if it is, I apologise as I have not read it yet.  Which sections of the Bill does she feel are too detailed?  What changes does she recommend regarding that detail to better streamline the Bill?  It would be important we do not have to rely on amending primary legislation if circumstances change in the whole arrangement for dealing with doping.</p> <p>  Dr. May says that the application of the concept of strict liability should be the starting point.  I presume it would then be possible by secondary legislation to minimise penalties in a case where, for example, the outcome was due to feed.  I presume that is how that would be dealt with.</p> <p>  How could article 16 of the WADA code be reflected in legislation here when there is no international body?  Could we set it up in such a way that the national body would be the body which would set the regulations?  Would that be feasible in terms of the Bill?</p> <p>  Head 14 of the Bill proposes to decriminalise doping sanctions within the legislation.  Does Dr. May have a view on whether this is sensible?</p></speech>

While I am not a greyhound owner or trainer, I know the chairman of IGB.  He is a personal friend of mine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017052300002#F00900"><p>On Deputy Cahill's question on contamination, it is an area with which we have a huge problem.  We have an issue in relation to the use of supplement and it is a massive multi-million pound and euro industry.  Athletes are all tempted to use supplements and we see it across the world.  The International Olympic Committee has issued a statement in recent weeks about the extent of the problem.  However, by having a strict liability, it means that the presence of a substance remains an offence and that an athlete is answerable to the allegation that there is a prohibited substance.  He or she then has the opportunity to explain and justify how that substance got into his or her system, and that is where the issue around the contamination comes in.  We have a whole section in the Irish anti-doping rules and also under the world anti-doping code around dealing with and managing situations around contaminated supplements.  It would be a similar situation to where the substance is still present and it is up to the individual to explain how the substance got there.  It means that, to avoid that first port of call where the person says it was not his or her fault, he or she did not do it or it was someone else, the person answerable in some shape or form.  The opportunity is there to reduce the sanction if the person can justify it and there are reductions specifically relating to contaminated substances, but the person has to prove that he or she has taken appropriate actions to try to reduce the risks.  He or she has to prove risk minimisation strategies, that he or she did not purchase a substance from an non-reputable source, and that the person did a reasonable Internet search to make sure the contents of the substance were checked out in advance.  The person has certain criteria he or she has to meet to prove he or she took all appropriate actions to avoid the possibility of that sort of contamination.  That is how we deal with it on the human side.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017052300002#F01100"><p>We do not refer to them as tolerance levels.  There are minimum reporting thresholds for some substances, so therefore it will not be reported if it is below a certain threshold.  Once it is reported, the substance must be explained.  However, that is for a very small number of substances for which there are small reporting thresholds.</p> <p>  The coursing environment is unique to an extent but it is not entirely unique in that we regulate events such as mountain biking, orienteering and many activities that are not in the controlled environment of an arena, as such.  It is similar enough.  There are definitely extra challenges when one is not in an enclosed and secure environment.  I cannot answer for the situation because I am not particularly familiar with the issues there.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about the level of detail.  An example is the experiences of the Spanish anti-doping agency which recently lost its compliance with the world anti-doping code.  Spain's laboratory lost its accreditation and suffered fairly serious reputational damage because it was not in a position to update its regulations to the latest version of the code because it required a change in legislation and no government was in office at the time.  They were caught between a rock and a hard place, they could not change their legislation and lost their accreditation as a result.  That was an example.  Where new substances come out, new issues arise.  For instance, meldonium was the product that Maria Sharapova was found guilty of taking.  If one has to change the legislation to identify new substances when they come out, that creates a challenge.  What we have done is we have removed all the detail on behalf of the Irish anti-doping rules which cover everything from the application of the rules, the definition of doping, the prohibited list, how we get medical exemptions for athletes who require medication for one reason or another, and the standards for testing, analysis of samples, results management, sanctions, appeals, reporting and public disclosure.  All that detail is in the Irish anti-doping rules and what the Act does is recognise those rules as the official rules and recognise them as being compliant with the world anti-doping code.  That gives us the extra support because of the code, which is not as straightforward in this case because there is no international body.</p><p>We go through a fair bit of external scrutiny.  The Council of Europe carried out a monitoring visit to see whether we were compliant with its requirements.  We fill out regular compliance questionnaires for the Council of Europe, UNESCO, and the world anti-doping agencies.  I hope I have answered the question on strict liability.</p><p> With regard to article 16, it is more whether its principles can be recognised in some way.  I do not know the correct legal terminology but it could state that where appropriate the rules of the Irish Greyhound Board would comply in principle with article 16 of the code.  We could have something very general.  I am afraid I am not familiar with the decriminalisation issue.  A number of countries have criminalised doping, including France and Italy, and people can go to jail for it.  We did not go this far in our legislation.  We felt it was a step too far.  Where there are serious issues we hope the various pieces of enforcement legislation, including the medicines Act, on which the Garda rely would help us.</p><p> The new code speaks about athlete support personnel, so people around the athlete, including coaches and trainers, and not just the athlete, are liable.  They have a level of responsibility also where they might be administering a substance to an athlete.  From our point of view, there are sanctions in sport and probably outside sport also.</p></speech>

Dr. May has worked with the Government and advised it in the past.  What degree of consultation and engagement has she had with the Department on the valid issues she is raising.  The Oireachtas collectively wants to ensure the greyhound industry gets a clean bill of health, that we reform it and restore confidence in it for many reasons, and whatever legislation is introduced at the end of this process needs to achieve this goal.  Finding the best way to do this will be very important.  Has Dr. May engaged with the Department?  What was its response to the issues she has raised?

As Senator Mac Lochlainn said, the issues I wish to raise have been covered in the course of the meeting.  How proficient or efficient as a body is Sport Ireland, or are we, as a society, staying ahead of the posse?  The point is often made that the science brains of the world are on the other side of the fence in this regard, continually trying to stay ahead of the tests, avoiding traceability and developing new products.  How efficient or proficient does Dr. May believe her side of the fence is in detecting new products?  We have seen in human sport the history of cycling over the past 20 years.  The scientists and doctors on the cycling side as opposed to the anti-doping side were way ahead of their counterparts.  Where does Dr May feel we are on this issue?  There is a list of products, which everybody knows and which are easy to identify, but it is a moving pitch and new products are always being developed by those people who benefit most from them, in black-market scenarios all of the time.  How efficient or proficient is Sport Ireland with regard to the traceability of new elements?  How proficient or efficient does Dr. May believe legislators are in providing her with the legislation she requires if and when such situations arise?  Is there a protocol when new stimulants or drugs are identified?  Related to this, are the lines of communication to all sectors efficient enough, and to greyhound racing in particular as this is the sector we are discussing, with regard to informing them of developments and changes in Sport Ireland's attitude towards substances on an ongoing basis?</p></speech>

Feed came in from the United States and the trainers have said this has resulted in many of the positive tests in the past 18 months to two years.  If a trainer gets feed from a reputable company, what is contained in the feed is outside his or her control.  How will we address this?  Bord na gCon will come before the committee next week and it will give us figures.  My knowledge is approximately 75% to 80% of failed tests in the past two years have been attributed to imported feed.  I accept that Dr. May's guidelines and expertise are on the human side of doping.  In this case, feed came from the United States and then dogs failed a doping test, and once people are explaining they are losing.  Given the source of the feed is from outside the country, how can we ensure no prohibited substance is finding its way into it?</p></speech>

Intelligence and investigation measures have come into the world anti-doping code more recently, along with working very closely with partners.  For example, WADA has partnered with the pharmaceutical industry so when new products are being researched and developed the pharmaceutical industry works with it to let it know if something could be abused.  This is before it ever comes on the market.  We have gone a long way towards people providing us with information.  One of the biggest cases in the US, in which Marion Jones was implicated, resulted from an athlete or coach providing information to a laboratory.  A syringe was found, which the laboratory analysed and it established the new substance.  More recently, there has been a very strong element of information sharing and intelligence.</p> <p>  The Management of Intelligence and Drugs Action in Sports, MIDAS, group is world-class in regard to its level of information sharing and expertise.  It has greater expertise than we do in terms of investigators.   My colleagues are in Lyon, at present, at a meeting with Interpol on information sharing with authorities around the world.  When new substances appear often they are found by customs, which might look for advice as to what it is.  Particularly in countries where doping is a criminal offence, athletes' hotel rooms are searched, and it tends to be in the case of cycling, for example, that substances are found and the authorities realise it may be something new which we need to look at.  It is through investigations, intelligence and information sharing that we get on top of many of the developments.  A significant amount of funding is put into research for new detection methods, which also helps.</p> <p>  With regard to how we update the prohibited list there is an annual process.  There is also the option to add something new by emergency, if it is very clear that it is a doping substance, clear that it is being heavily abused, and clear that it can be added immediately.  On the whole, the process involves consultation with all the international stakeholders throughout the first six months of the year.  In September, the new list is put before WADA's committees where it is signed off, and it then comes into force the following year.  Each year the list is updated with the most recent versions of substances.</p> <p>  The other reason we manage to not have to change it more often than annually is the substances are generally described in scientific terms as a product or substance and related compounds.</p><p>It is a general scientific term which allows for things that are similar.  If it is a tweak in a molecule or something, it will still fall under the definition of "prohibited substance".</p><p> In terms of the lines of communication within the sector, the Midas group is an example of world class best practice.  Its presentation in London was very well received.  I am not aware of any other country where there is that level of co-operation between the different sectors to ensure that the issue is dealt with appropriately.  It may be about the communication of that kind of thing.  Getting out there and presenting at a conference goes a long way towards communicating the strength of that relationship.  I spoke today with my colleague in Germany where the human anti-doping agency is also responsible for testing in the Olympic equestrian sports.  However, it only covers those equestrian sports which are in the Olympics and does not test in respect of horse racing, for example.  I do not think they have a greyhound racing industry.  Certainly, I am not familiar with it.  It is those kinds of connections.  They have found it to be quite strong and developed regulations.  That goes a long way towards making it reputable when there is a connection with an existing authority with a reputation already.  That is why connecting it to the world anti-doping code would help to strengthen it reputationally.  It would prove that there was no question of trying to create new rules.  It is recognising the principles of a well-established system that has been in place for a long time.</p><p> In relation to the imported feed, the best opportunity for athletes to protect themselves is to buy from those supplement providers who are willing to pay to protect their own product by having it batch tested.  Therefore, athletes should only purchase the batch-tested version of the product.  That is to protect the reputation of the company itself because it can be named and implicated where a case comes in.  Its reputation would be tarnished if it was found to have contaminated supplements.  That is the best way for athletes to deal with that.  The difficulty from our point of view is that there are athletes who purchase things which are clearly not reputable.  Even the way they are described is a bit of a giveaway.  When something is described as being a "testo-boost", it is a hint as to its reputability.  That is what we advise athletes and it is how the system protects them.</p></speech>

If we could have someone attend to outline how it has established a system over time in which there is full public confidence, it would be useful.  If there is something we could learn from that, it would strengthen the Bill for the greyhound industry.</p></speech>

Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector is one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths and has been the key driving force behind the Irish economic recovery, economic growth and job creation.  It is critical for the Government to recognise how vital Irish exporters are to Irish economic growth and to use the review of the capital plan to maximise the opportunities that arise from an increase in global demand.  Although the value of Irish exports as a whole last year rose to nearly &euro;117 billion, the highest annual total on record, the fluctuation of sterling resulted in a loss of nearly &euro;600 million in the value of exports to the United Kingdom, half of which was in food and live animals.  Brexit, in whatever form it will take, is coming and we need to prepare immediately.  We need to plan new direct shipping and air links to Europe and the rest of the world; become more cost competitive; lobby strongly for as close as possible a trade relationship with the United Kingdom, in particular in agrifood, although it is not in our best interests for the United Kingdom to be outside the customs union, and we must factor this into our negotiations; ensure companies consider their entire supply chain and the impact of a UK exit on all their input costs and start thinking about alternatives; and attract foreign direct investment, FDI, from the UK and elsewhere for those who want to retain access to Europe.</p> <p>  Brexit is already having an impact on Irish exports but the worst may yet be to come. The UK leaving the European Union will have major implications on Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity and processes need to be put in place to combat what is coming down the line and preparations need to start happening immediately.  </p> <p>  Brexit poses a serious threat to Ireland&rsquo;s regional airports, which depend heavily on the United Kingdom.  One example is Ireland West Regional Airport in Knock.  The United Kingdom currently accounts for 80% of the airport&rsquo;s passenger traffic with nine direct scheduled destinations.  Airlines and airports are going to have to start planning for 2019 and beyond with no indication of what the future relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe's single aviation market will be.  The uncertainty cast by Brexit could seriously impede route development across Europe.  Minimising any potential disruption and cost resulting from more rigorous immigration or customs border checks will be imperative. The implementation of hub connectivity from the west of Ireland directly into Heathrow or another European hub airports, such as Schiphol or Frankfurt, would significantly enhance business connectivity and attractiveness to locate in the west of Ireland.  This can be achieved with the implementation by the Government of a public service obligation, PSO, scheme on a similar basis to the recently activated Derry to London Stansted route by bmi regional.  </p> <p>  The Irish Exporters Association would also call for a full derogation from the EU on state aid support to regional airports handling fewer than 1 million passengers under the general block exemption regulation, GBER, and not limit it to airports handling fewer than 200,000 passengers, as announced last week.</p> <p>  With regard to Dublin Airport and the north runway that is scheduled to operational in 2020, passenger numbers at Dublin Airport increased by 11.5% in 2016, making Dublin Airport the fastest growing major airport in Europe last year.  Traffic forecasts indicate the potential for passenger throughput figures of up to 36 million by 2022 and up to 50 million by 2037.  The level of growth at Dublin Airport is staggering and infrastructure needs to be put in place now to ensure Dublin Airport is equipped for further growth in the coming years.  Priority should be given to the metro north link between Dublin city centre and Dublin Airport and to ensuring that planning and road development in the environs is put in place to deal with this growth.</p> <p>  With regard to the national planning framework, as discussed by this committee on 13 April with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the IEA would like to add to the issue that focus will need to be given to road planning and commuter regions outside of Dublin.  Development of regional infrastructure, especially in the west, has been poor.  The poor road network across Ireland is having an impact on IEA members being able to attract and retain suitably qualified staff.  Some 61% of IEA members experienced difficulty in recruiting in the first quarter of this year.  Members have cited poor road infrastructure and lack of improvement to employees' commute as a factor in poor regional retention.  Regional development is imperative, not only to maintain business, but to attract investment and development in the regions.</p> <p>  Immediate solutions need to be sought to the broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits to businesses and homes across the country if Ireland is to remain competitive in a technological age.  Improvements in broadband and the mobile phone infrastructure need to be immediate.  The new wave of business innovation with technology, such as robotics, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, big data and analytics, block chain and new business models based on digital platforms, is giving rise to a deep digitisation of industry on the scale that has not been seen so far.  The countries that aspire to participate and lead in this digitisation of industry will require very solid, robust and scalable ICT infrastructure, data centres and 5G communications connectivity.</p> <p>  Airfreight and the significant capacity constraints on services operating out of Ireland is being cited as an issue for IEA members.  There is a consensus among IEA members who are logistics providers that there is a shortage of air capacity to all markets from Irish airports.</p><p>There is also criticism of terminal and cargo handling facilities for, in particular, pharmaceutical and other controlled goods at Irish airports.  This is forcing freight forwarders to truck cargo to British and continental airports and fly it from there.  Questions have been raised about the availability of storage, particularly refrigeration and control facilities at Shannon and Cork airports and now increasingly in the east of the country.  The practice of cutting airway bills at Irish airports by shipping goods by truck to British or continental ports has relied on effective landbridge operations.  The freight forwarders concede that they are now under pressure to use direct ferry or lo-lo services to the Continent.</p><p> The acute shortage of warehouse facilities around Ireland is a major concern.  The development of warehouse facilities across Ireland, including specialist pharmaceutical storage facilities, as well as the development of ports and airports could be a significant opportunity to develop this country as a distribution hub to elsewhere in Europe. The United Kingdom currently serves this function because it has the storage capacity for onward delivery within the European network.  There is a serious opportunity for the Irish economy in the development of logistics clusters, or geographically concentrated sets of logistics-related business activities.  Logistics clusters typically develop around transportation hubs such as air or sea ports or areas in which there is easy access to road or rail networks.  Like large industrial clusters, logistics clusters exhibit a positive feedback loop, which means that the bigger they become, the more they grow.</p><p> I would like to comment on the figures and trends in shipping.  It has been reported in the Irish Maritime Transport Economist which was published by the Irish Maritime Development Office in April that although there has been strong growth in traffic through all Irish ports, there is an increasing imbalance with volumes through Dublin Port being disproportionately large, while local ports do not put through the volumes that a good spatial strategy would dictate.  Ports such as Cork should develop to take more of their fair share of traffic.  Ports such as Drogheda and Galway which have been defined as regional ports and given to local councils to run should also be supported.</p><p> According to a recent survey of IEA members, it is not just our exports to the United Kingdom that will be affected by Brexit.  Our exports that transit through the United Kingdom to get to continental Europe and beyond will also be affected.  Two thirds of our members make use of the UK landbridge to access continental markets.  Of these, 40% have said the use of a slower direct route would have an adverse impact on the quality of their product, while 53% said a longer time supply chain would have a serious impact on their inventory and other costs.  Having examined the comments made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, at the meeting of this committee on 13 April about the use of the United Kingdom as a landbridge, the IEA believes this serious issue needs to be considered.</p><p> We are aware that much of the focus in the context of Brexit has been on exports.  Brexit raises many potential challenges for importers, particularly for the supply chain where imports make up part of the final goods exported.  It is not a one-way traffic issue.  A possible solution in dealing with delays at land border crossings could involve queuing systems similar to the Estonian go-swift queue management solution.  I will explain how such a system might work at the Border.  The driver of a truck or another vehicle would go online to request a transit time slot at the Border.  Such a driver, having given his or her current location, would be allocated an estimated time slot and advised to go to a designated controlled parking area some distance from the Border.  This would be used as a rest stop until he or she was called to the Border crossing.  The system operates in a similar fashion for drivers heading for ferries or other vessels in Tallinn Port, or for the major distribution centres linked with it, thereby eliminating queues in the city and port area.  This system of virtual queues of trucks moves them away from lands that could have many better uses than as truck and car parks.</p><p> Delays at ports mean missed ferry crossings, delayed ferries or missed sailings.  They reduce available capacity and undermine the economics of these services.  They can mean that companies in the food sector, for example, can miss their docking slots at multiples' distribution centres in the United Kingdom.  More and faster direct services to the Continent are needed.  Waterford Port and Rosslare Port, in particular, will need capital funding both for the ports and road access to them.  Under EU transport policy, neither of these ports is defined as a core port.  For that reason, they do not qualify for TEN-T funding.  There is scope and potential for an intermodal system between Rosslare and Cherbourg.</p><p> Indigenous Irish businesses are woefully unprepared for Brexit.  From an administrative perspective, someone who has only ever exported to the United Kingdom has never had to deal with customs procedures.  Realistically, the training and upskilling of staff should start happening now, rather than waiting until the chaos of implementation.  The current situation highlights the need for Ireland to diversity its export markets.  We need to focus more of our attention on high-growth markets such as China, India, the ASEAN states, Africa and South America.  We need to become less dependent on our trade relationships with the European Union, the USA and the United Kingdom.  There is a need to develop infrastructure around this.</p><p> Exports continue to lead the way in driving the economy forward.  They are the most significant contributor to making Ireland one of the fastest growing economies in the world, helping to reduce unemployment, creating new employment in fast growing innovative companies and reducing the national debt.  Exporting is the success story of the economy.  It has helped to restore the country&rsquo;s image abroad, attract greater foreign direct investment and foster the development of home-grown companies by encouraging more and more entrepreneurs to grow their businesses internationally.  As a small open economy, Ireland can be particularly vulnerable to economic fluctuations in global markets.  We are asking that investments be put in place to develop the infrastructure required to support the export markets of the next 50 years.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly has given us one of the starkest presentations we have received in this series.  This was intended to be a review of the capital plan, but it has become a review of the capital plan in the context of Brexit.  The presentation we have received places a very stark focus on how ill-prepared we are for a soft or hard Brexit.  It appears from some of the commentary in the Bundestag this afternoon that it will be a hard Brexit.</p> <p>  I would like to tease out the association's proposal for public service obligation flights into a hub.  I expect that Heathrow Airport will be relatively redundant in this context after Brexit, when all of the difficulties Mr. Daly mentioned will be evident.  I presume the hub would need to be within the European Union.  What public service obligation changes would the delegates like to see to allow us to develop it?  How has it worked in Derry?</p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the landbridge crossings.  If we are to pursue Waterford and Rosslare as the two main ports that need to be developed with Dublin Port, what capital investment will be needed in the view of the association's members?  Mr. Daly referred to inadequacies in areas such as storage and access.  What specific investment is needed in these two ports?  What are the delegates' views on the ownership structure of Rosslare Europort which seems to be presenting a challenge in the development of the port in order that its potential can be maximised?</p> <p>  Mr. Daly mentioned a series of regional infrastructure challenges.  We will be drawing attention to all of them.  If he were the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and in charge of allocating the extra capital budget to specific projects, what would they be?  Does the association have a view on what should be done with the proceeds of the sale of AIB, the first tranche of which will be available soon?  In view of the starkness of the association's presentation, should the proceeds be used for capital investment?</p></speech>

We have tried to portray that what we have will not really meet the needs associated with where our exporters need to go.  They need to go further afield.  It would be great if some of the moneys from the sale of AIB could be diverted towards capital spending.</p> <p>  I do not want to go into massive detail on the ownership structure of Rosslare Europort, other than to say the duality there poses a number of challenges in further development.  Waterford and Rosslare are probably the two ports that could be used to open further direct routes to continental Europe.</p><p>We have talked to our members about the challenges they will face if the land bridge is not to be utilised going forward and a number of them are looking at alternative routes.  Approximately 57% of them have said that they could use alternative routes but in certain industries where time is of the essence, particularly the food and drink industry, the options are more limited.  It has been estimated that routing goods to the Continent via northern or eastern European routes rather than via the land bridge can add up to eight hours onto transit times.  In terms of sell by and use by dates, that could have serious implications.  It might not make a big difference to traffic that is going into southern Europe.</p><p> It has been well documented that the infrastructure in the west of Ireland is a nightmare.  Recently we held an event at the airport at Knock.  Once one reaches Mullingar, one is on a single lane highway, if even that, all the way to Knock.</p></speech>

Broadband in the countryside is also an issue.  A number of members in the west have also told us that they are having difficulties attracting and retaining skilled and qualified staff.  Even if they manage to get staff to come from places like Mullingar, within a matter of months they have leave because they are not prepared to put up with the commute.  It is a real issue for them over there.  Every time we go over there we are appalled by the state of the broadband provision.  We had an event in 2015 over there and the broadband kept cutting in and out.  It was shambolic.  That part of the country is a bit neglected and needs a considerable increase in infrastructural spending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Daly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017052300002#D00400"><p>We were asked to outline the projects we would like to see being developed.  Despite the challenges, we have some great opportunities, one of which is in the development of logistics clusters.  These are areas where logistics activities are incentivised and concentrated and they provide many advantages for a country, for industry and for employment.  They tend to replace lost manufacturing jobs in developed economies.  A number of years ago, for example, Dell left Limerick with the loss of a considerable number of manufacturing jobs.  Such jobs can be replaced by logistics hubs, which provide value-added activities such as localisation, product assembly and configuration and potentially, 3D printing.  They are less susceptible to off-shoring because a lot of the technology and economics of transport and distribution make them more immune.  They also serve as infrastructure to other industries that require specific logistics capabilities.  Ireland, for example, has a high concentration of medical devices and pharmaceutical companies.  We could develop logistics hubs around those industries that could be based on either sea or air transport.  In terms of sea transport, we are talking about the south of the country and I would not lose sight of Cork, which is a particular hub for medical devices, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  In terms of logistics hubs in the air freight industry, Shannon is probably the only airport that has a runway of the required length to service a fully loaded Boeing 7470-400.  Such aircraft require a runway of between 9,000 and 11,000 feet.  Shannon's runway is 10,500 feet whereas the runways at Dublin Airport are only 8,600 and 6,800 feet, although I understand the proposed new runway in Dublin will be 10,200 feet.</p> <p>  Logistics clusters do not depend on a single industry vertical.  They serve multiple industries which makes them more immune to shocks in the economy.  They favour social mobility because the logistics industry values deep operational experience on the floor.  They create broad based employment because they need warehouse operatives, drivers, customer service personnel, mechanics, technicians, engineers, IT managers and supervisors.  They also create a sustainable tax base that would at least defray or offset some of the cost of developing them in the first place.  They can be a stimulus for regional development which makes for a more balanced spatial strategy.  </p> <p>  Examples of logistics hubs include places like Rotterdam, Singapore and Panama.  Plaza Zaragoza in Spain is of particular interest because some of the factors contributing to its success are, or can be, replicated here.  They include favourable geography which we also have; supporting infrastructure which we can develop; and a supportive and efficient Government, in terms of creating a business friendly environment, on which we also score highly.  We can build education, research and innovation into these logistics hubs.  The National Institute for Transport and Logistics which sits in the DIT in Aungier Street is developing degree courses in supply chain logistics and is an example of the type of institution that could set up a branch in a logistics hub.  Logistics clusters also give rise to quite a lot of collaboration and value-added services.  </p></speech>

The Irish Exporters Association has conducted many surveys among its members which have shown that they are becoming more nervous about the outcome of Brexit as time goes on.  The last survey results that I read showed that 92% believed that it would be detrimental to Irish exports.  The witnesses said that indigenous businesses are woefully unprepared for Brexit.  Have they seen any changes over the last year in terms of the preparedness of businesses for the potential outcomes of Brexit?  If not, what do they believe needs to happen so that businesses are ready for whatever comes out of the negotiations?</p></speech>

Some companies have gotten their heads around it but a lot of companies have not.  The last time we took a dip in to see what level of coverage was there, most of it coming off at the end of this month.</p><p>We checked to see where the point of pain was on the currency.  Last year, in the wake of the vote, it was a rate of 80p to 85p to the euro and it is now around 85p to 90p to the euro, so there has been some adjustment to the currency.</p><p> When our organisation, which is national, goes around the country doing different things, the focus is more on customs, VAT and the supply chain.  Bigger companies are beginning to get their heads around these.  Smaller companies really need to do so.  What happens if there is disruption to the landbridge?  What happens if there is a North-South Border?  What happens to the huge amount of trade in and out of the United Kingdom?  Our CSO figures do not really show the kind of trade that is going back and forth in the supply chain, particularly in an east-west direction.  Therefore, many items are going back and forth that do not really get counted but which end up making finished goods.  We made the point that it is a matter of imports as well as exports.</p><p> Our sense from companies is that bigger non-Irish-owned ones are getting their heads around the customs piece.  There are a number of different models that are quite useful and helpful.  I have had a number of conversations with the bigger Irish indigenous companies and was quite shocked by the level of unpreparedness.  They are beginning to get their heads around the customs piece, however.  Smaller companies are not.  What we really need to do is help companies understand the implications and not only in regard to customs.  Where the Border really will be probably will not be between the North and South but in people's offices, because they will have to deal with the consequences.  Even if there will be no duty or tariffs, there will be paperwork.  The first implication of a border is a higher administrative burden on people.  We have seen figures indicating an increase in the cost of doing business of anything up to 24%.  If a company is already trading somewhere else in the world and not just with the United Kingdom, it already has experience in learning how to proceed in this regard.  If the many companies that are trading only into the United Kingdom do not have such experience, they will need to learn.</p><p> We run an SME programme that we bring around the country.  We also run a supply-chain initiative that we bring around the country.  It is very heavily focused on the customs piece.  We run a thought leadership initiative.  It is the one on the supply chain that packs the room.  People are beginning to develop awareness.</p><p> I wish to refer to something Mr. Daly said.  We envisage a big threat to rural Ireland in the wake of Brexit because the agriculture sector will get very badly hit.  The displacement that might happen over a five or ten-year period is potentially enormous if we end up having to pay tariffs of 50% on our beef and 60% on our dairy produce going into the United Kingdom.  In our conversations with various British Government organisations, we have tried to get across the message that Britain is short of food and does not generate enough for itself.  We are a natural breadbasket.  How can we ensure that, in our negotiations, we can secure what we desire in this regard?  There is great fear, particularly if Britain leaves the customs union, that it will rush to secure trade agreements with the likes of Mercosur.  In the meantime, representatives from a huge country like China are going around the world.  China has a massive food security issue.  It has bought up some of the biggest sheepmeat and pork producers in New Zealand and America.  Therefore, there is competition at a global level over food security.  The message we have been giving to the British Government is that we can continue to provide security for it.  The question will be one of what Britain, if it is buying cheaper food, will substitute our produce with if it is so much more expensive.  Have I answered the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Very helpfully, Mr. McKeever stated there is not one-way traffic.  With food, it is two-way.  Britain is dependent on us but if there is the type of trade agreement in question, it will be reciprocal.  It is not only about tariffs but also about the regulations.  If only Ireland and Britain were thrashing this out, we might have some type of outcome but there are many other factors at play here.  For example, we have just heard from French farmers who are arguing for a hard border because of fear of cheap food imports coming through Britain.</p> <p>  When Mr. McKeever says some of the larger exporters are starting to get their heads around the matter, I presume he means they are getting their heads around the fact that they have to do the administrative part, addressing the burden and costs.  They are starting to understand what they will have to do even if there are no tariffs or duty.  Are businesses starting to get their heads around the idea that there could be tariffs?  What would happen in this regard in respect of their business plans and projections?  I refer not only to WTO tariffs but also to some other types of tariffs.</p></speech>

To take it back a stage, the very first thing they need to do is to start assessing what the United Kingdom's emergence from the European Union will mean if the worst-case scenario materialises.  Everybody is thinking about the worst-case scenario from a WTO point of view.  If a business could examine everything it did last year and push it through a programme that is able to spit out what the difference to one's business would be this year &ndash; there are such programmes &ndash; it would result in a very stark message.  Bigger companies are beginning to examine the risk assessment piece.  Smaller companies are really just beginning to get their heads around what it all really means to them.  Smaller ones are not there at all.  Some of them are still trying to get their heads around the currency piece.</p></speech>

One might see a trend in the other direction in that, if customs tariffs are imposed, the supply chain may need to shorten in this country.  Some of the food and drink companies sending goods back and forth across the Border might need to produce more in Ireland also.  There may be some small counterbalance against the trend.</p></speech>

It has been internationally recognised by the OECD and others.  Representatives of the Revenue Commissioners were before the finance committee and they talked about how there would be electronic trade management for the vast majority and that 6% of freight could be directed to a location perhaps 10 km to 15 km away from the Border where there would be electronic checks and that there would be random patrols or monitoring where people could be called in along the Border.  How realistic is that to Mr. McKeever's members, particularly those who are trading on both sides of the Border quite frequently?  The last survey I saw indicated that 67% of members were exporting to the North.  How challenging would the disruption and time delay be to individuals?</p></speech>

It gives me some comfort that the figure the Deputy is stating, namely, the 6% of goods that may need to be checked, opened and examined, is a lot lower than the very stark figure that was mentioned at the very beginning of this process nearly a year ago.  It absolutely will be very challenging.  In the best-case scenario, for most types of trade an electronic message will be sent from the cab of the truck as it approaches the Border.</p><p>However, the type of freight that may need to be inspected will go into an inspection point.  That will be challenging because it does not exist at the moment.</p></speech>

The Estonian GoSwift service operates at three major crossing points but we have a Border that is so porous.  In Donegal there are dozens of ways that I can travel the Border.  If I am travelling up in Inishowen, will I be diverted to a checkpoint in Letterkenny?  What if I am travelling down in Pettigo?  We are not going back to the situation where we are closing the Border roads.  There are hundreds of crossings.  Is it possible to do that?</p></speech>

We are kind of at the beginning of a process where these things will have to be discussed and put out and then a solution that will work put together.  I guess what is happening is that we do not really know what the conditions will be.  At the same time, we are trying to devise a solution to a challenge, the nature of which we do not really know.  Suffice it say that the volumes and the frequency make it very challenging.  For all involved, it will be very challenging.</p> <p>  Another thing that we need to be cognisant of is that, notwithstanding the fact we have to deal with the United Kingdom in the future and that we have to come up with new solutions, the world does not begin and end with the United Kingdom.  I make that point because our export figures are very impressive.  I think we said there would be &euro;117 billion in merchandise exports this year.  However, if we strip out the exports of perhaps ten or 12 multinationals from that, what is left is not really that impressive in the sense that it is over-reliant on traditional markets, particularly the United Kingdom, other countries such as the United States, and near European countries.  We have been making the case for many years, before Brexit was ever a likelihood, that SME Irish exporters need to diversify their markets.  However, as Britain was there, was easy, is big and so on, people said they agreed but they did not do a lot about it.  There were some exceptions, of course.  However, we now have to start looking beyond and need to begin to diversify.</p> <p>  Think about countries such as Morocco which has 35 million people, a growing economy and a front onto the Atlantic.  It will be a major hub and market in itself.  Think of a country like Mexico.  Our trade with Mexico skyrocketed over recent years, although it has stabilised quite a bit recently.  Think about countries such as Indonesia and Colombia.  These countries are open for business and are growing.  They have huge requirements that we can satisfy, but we have not really been able to step up.  If we strip out the multinationals and compare our export figures with our peer competitors, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland, they export something like 20% or 25% of their volume to developing markets or, if one likes, exotic or unusual markets.  Our figures are in single percentages, so we have a huge job to do but a huge opportunity at the same time.</p></speech>

Their opening statement is to the point.  It is pretty blunt and pretty sobering.  I would like to pick up on Mr. Daly's very welcome emphasis on Irish-owned companies.  There is a danger with such strong total export figures last year, being the highest on record, that we miss the fact that Irish-owned companies account for only 13%.  While the multinationals are eminently welcome here and long may they come and grow, the ESRI's recent analysis is that the exports from Irish-owned companies are not where they need to be.  In fact, the international data suggest that we sell rather than scale.  On his point, we have focused on the Anglo-Saxon world.  Most Irish exporters that I know do not really differentiate between selling in Cork and selling in Birmingham, for example.  The UK is seen largely as a domestic market.  I, therefore, very much welcome his pointing to that and the fact there is a huge opportunity.</p> <p>  In fact the single greatest opportunity for Brexit is not to get the banking authority or the medicines authority but to use it as a stimulus for many of our firms finally to move beyond, largely, the UK.  To that end, specifically for the Irish-owned firms, as the multinationals have all manner of sophistication and resources available to them in international supply chains, if Mr. Daly were to prioritise one, two or three things the State could do for them, some more than others, to help them understand and mitigate the Brexit related risks they are facing but also, critically, to start viewing Brexit as the necessary push for them to do everything they can not just to continue selling into and buying from the UK but also to move beyond that to the Baltic countries, the Nordic countries, central Europe - Mr. McKeever gave the example of Morocco - what would they be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Daly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017052300002#F00500"><p>I spend my days working with both multinationals and Irish-owned companies and there is a stark difference between them.  It is almost like a time gap of perhaps somewhere between ten and 20 years in the sophistication and, I guess, the resource and the world view of business.  Irish companies are somewhat at sea in terms of how they go about doing it.  They know it is a pending subject but they wonder how they are to tackle it because they do not have the resources or the skills, principally, and consequently they do not have the confidence.  A lot of this is an issue of confidence.</p> <p>  I would therefore highlight two things.  In Enterprise Ireland we have a very capable network.  However, in some regions of great opportunity it is under-resourced.  For example, prior to this year, I chaired for two to two and a half years the Latin America trade forum in the Irish Exporters Association.  We saw opportunities in countries such as Ecuador and Mexico, Colombia and Chile in particular - the Pacific Alliance.  Those countries are open for business.  We had a number of events throughout the country and there was a lot of latent interest in them.  However, how does one go about it and what staff does Enterprise Ireland have?  It has an office in Brazil, which I think is not one of the four that would be of most interest.  In Mexico, we have a consultant but we do not have a permanent Enterprise Ireland person there.</p> <p>  The great capabilities of Enterprise Ireland may be to extend into the countries that are open for business and where there are real opportunities for us.  We have focused a lot on the BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China.  If one thinks of those four countries, they are quite protectionist in their outlook.  There are many other countries which are not so big but of medium size that really are open for business, including Morocco, Mexico, Indonesia and Colombia, which I quoted.  I think we would be pushing an open door there.</p> <p>  The other aspect is skills and knowledge.  We have the National Institute for Transport and Logistics which has been doing a good job with the resources it has.  It is located inside DIT in Aungier Street.  It has developed qualifications in supply chain logistics, transport and so on.  In terms of investment in those skills which are  related to supply chain and the new wave of technologies that are coming down the track, we have a great opportunity to get ahead of the pack.  I am speaking about technologies such as additive manufacture, 3D printing, robotics and automation, the Internet of Things and blockchain technology.  To be able to get to the front of the queue on this, we will have to develop highly integrated and robust digital infrastructure.  We will need 5G communications networks in this country.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Naughten, announced last year that the auctioning of the 5G bands is in plan.  I am aware that something is happening on that front.  We could leapfrog some of our competitors in respect of education and developing expertise in this area, if we go about it the right way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon McKeever" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017052300002#G00200"><p>Can we incentivise a focus on those other parts of the world?  People go to the UK because it is much easier to identify opportunity over there as they have a level of connectedness into that market.  I worked for a different country's agency prior to working here.  What it did very effectively was to gather all the opportunities in a particular market systematically for its companies back home.  There was a central database so that a company making widgets, for example, could see who was looking for widgets in what part of the world.  Such a focus should be incentivised.  It is not just a matter of the technical skills about which Mr. Daly is talking.  Language and cultural skills are also important.  We need to take in secondary and third level education in order to build a long-term plan.  This is not something that can be resolved overnight.</p> <p>  In respect of opportunity identification, we need to make it easier for people to get out there.  People go to the UK because they can jump on a flight on a Monday morning and be back that night to put their kids to bed.  Can we make it easier for companies to get out there?  As I said, I have worked in another country's system in which its version of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its state agencies worked together in a very unified fashion.  It is possible to combine all the assets that a government has at its disposal in a more effective way.  In fairness, it is beginning to happen in Ireland.  We need better co-operation between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and all of those guys who are working together in-market.  Nobody opens a door better than an ambassador.  Other countries are much better pulled together in-market.  That starts at home, as I have said to this committee on previous occasions.  It is something we really need to do.  Furthermore, a great deal of money goes into putting a senior person from one of those entities into market, sending the individual and his or her family and educating them.  There is likely to be very able local people already in the market, who could do the same thing for a fraction of the price and would be only too delighted to have the experience of working for a foreign country.  That is what I did.  It is an incredibly powerful way of doing things.  We are probably not using the money we have in the best way we possibly can.</p></speech>

It is by no means certain, however.  If a cliff is reached, one of the agreements of which the UK will no longer be part is open skies.  What would be the impact on the members of the Irish Exporters Association if the UK were to be outside the open skies policy?  The witnesses' submission indicated that 80% of the trips from Knock Airport are to the UK.  If that cliff is reached, which is possible, and no transition plan is in place, what would that look like for exporters?</p></speech>

Is it a big failing that we are missing out on teaching children different languages at a very young age?  We have this mental block about it.  It is easier to do business in Britain because they speak the same language.  We cannot communicate if we do not know the language.</p></speech>

I lived in Spain for ten years and married a Spanish lady.  My eldest son was born in Spain and is bilingual.  The first job he had in Ireland was in a customer service centre.  He got the job because he was a fluent Spanish speaker.  When he went to work, he and one other person were the only Irish nationals in the place.  All the other people were foreign.  The language skills are simply not available in this country.  It is a block in the sense that we do not seem to promote it in our education system the way we ought to.  As a result, we tend to concentrate our efforts in the Anglophone world.  It is possible to do business in English in many places but more is needed if we are to get the relationships that are so important in a globalised economy.  It makes sense to be promoting languages such as Spanish, French, Mandarin and Portuguese.</p></speech>

Our main connectivity for non-UK airports is through Heathrow at the moment.  If our members need to fly to Shanghai or somewhere else in the world, they need to find alternative routes.  It is not as bad out of Dublin as it would be out of Cork, for example.  I have not looked at this since the sale of Aer Lingus.  There is reasonably good connectivity to other European destinations out of Dublin but it is nothing like what we have through Heathrow.  From a services point of view for people who are travelling, it would cause a blockage.  On the freight side, a lot of our freight is hubbed through Heathrow at the moment and it would have to hubbed through another airport.  The alternative, which we include in our submission, is develop the capacity here in Ireland through greater warehousing.  There is a cost implication and a potential delay factor if the cliff is reached.  I think we are heading towards a reasonably hard, but not an extremely hard Brexit, given the rate at which the rhetoric is being dialled up at present.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have an estimate for the level of funding that would get us to the point of being good enough?  Their statement lays out very starkly that there are serious capacity constraints across a range of transport and export areas.  We have to ship freight to the UK or elsewhere because we do not have the capacity to take it out through our own airports.  There are particular constraints on the western airports.  How much money would it take to get us, not to being best in class, but to the point of these matters no longer being a constraint on our growth?</p></speech>

That is compounded by a massive hit in rural Ireland and the jobs that might go there, although Mr. Daly has suggested something that might replace some of them.  What kind of investment is going to be required to replace the trade that we currently do with the United Kingdom?  I will come back to the Deputy but I would think it is fairly substantial.</p></speech>

The visit of our negotiator, Mr. Michel Barnier, two weeks ago left me even more concerned.  I can hear the water tumbling over the cliff edge.  It is no secret that Mr. Barnier indicated there would be great flexibility in the movement of people.</p><p>What I heard in the visit and subsequently is that there would be no flexibility in regard to services and goods from the European side and similarly, no flexibility from the UK side in terms of what would be needed to retain them within the customs union.  In those circumstances that is the cliff edge.  It is very hard, politically, to see how we can steer away from that.  I think we need to change tack to try and avoid it but it seems to be coming.</p><p> There is a crucial issue for rural Ireland and that is recognised but there is also an issue for digital services.  I would be interested to hear what the witnesses know or what members in that area believe will happen if there is such a cliff-edge approach where we cannot get a transitional deal and the UK crashes out.  I accept that people have said we will revert to WTO rules.  Have the witnesses looked at the implications for software or digital services companies?  Has analysis been carried out on what are the constraints?  I was interested in the comment about a potential 24% increase in administrative costs but there may be other issues, for example, if one is sharing data with the UK as part of one's service system.  For example, will we be able to transition straight into a safe harbour or other arrangement that allows those data transactions to be part of everyday business, which is what they must be?</p><p> If we are not in a customs union, I imagine the import-export business will be very complex.  A lot of companies rely on products provided through the UK, via the Birmingham and Manchester distribution system.  One sees trucks coming over here carrying everything from sandwiches to high-tech devices that feed into our industries and go back out again.  Are people looking at an alternative distribution system to that?  Is it viable to look at a continental link via Rosslare where some of those globally traded services might come in?</p><p> Given the scenario which the witnesses seem to share, are we hearing about any difficulties for Irish exporters in terms of financial institutions giving credit?  If someone is looking to make an investment or agree credit terms around a future trading arrangement, at what point will the banks say they are sorry but they are nervous about lending on a facility because they do not know what the business case is for import-export businesses?  Is there any sign yet that financial institutions will start to be nervous about providing credit for companies that might be exposed in that regard?</p></speech>

The talks have a very strict timeline of a year to be conducted because the agreement needs to be ratified by the various parliaments afterwards.  The sense I got from a recent visit to Brussels is that there would be two years of negotiations for exit and probably a three-year interim deal where nothing would really change and then the UK would be out.  Is Deputy Ryan asking whether banks are fully prepared for whatever might happen?  When I was talking to them in September to October last year, they were beginning to do an assessment on what companies were trading into where.  One of them told me the other day that from next year they will be building that into the credit assessment in a very formal way.  One could ask if the UK were to come out, would a bank suddenly turn around and say it could not lend the money after all?  It depends on whatever covenants are in the deal.  I do not think the drawdown on a lot of loans is as great as what is sanctioned.  That is what I am being told anecdotally as well.</p> <p>  I might get Mr. Daly to talk about alternative distribution but the substance of our presentation is about alternatives.  Mr. Daly will be able to give a bit more detail.  We are beginning to look at the data piece.  I would raise two issues in that regard.  If one is looking to house data, would one be better off housing it in the UK or in a European country in a post-Brexit environment?  I think that is a question some of those ICT companies are asking.  In the very initial stages of the dive we have done into those companies, ICT companies have a lot of hardware, as well as software, and they foresee considerable difficulties in getting some of the hardware back and forth into the UK from a customs point of view.  I do not know whether Mr. Daly wants to add anything to what I have said.</p></speech>

We do business with China, the US and so on.  Many of the companies that are doing business in those countries are larger companies and many of them have sought what is called AEO, approved economic operator, status, whereby their logistics systems are approved from a security and integrity point of view by a recognised body and then that foreign country accepts that AEO status and that facilitates the entry of their goods into that country, lowers costs and speeds up the supply chain.  In the worst case, we would expect that AEO recognition would still exist between the UK and the European Union.  Up to now my understanding is that in Ireland only the very larger companies and some of the big logistics service companies that carry goods on behalf of shippers have taken the trouble to go down the route of getting AEO approval but many more would do that and will do that.  At the events we have been holding in our supply chain series in recent weeks, which will continue, we hear SMEs talking about those things already.</p> <p>  In terms of an alternative distribution route, on the supposition that it is a bad exit and the costs become prohibitive to coming through the UK and using the landbridge, the point Deputy Ryan made is very pertinent, in that it is not only what is coming from the UK that is made in the UK but what is coming through the UK even though it may have originated in Holland, Belgium or France because there would be customs clearance entering the UK on one side and the other and then a customs clearance here in Ireland.</p> <p>  Lots of good coming from far afield come to Ireland through transhipment in Felixstowe or Liverpool.  If that became a problem then we would be looking at ports like Rotterdam and Antwerp and perhaps Le Havre.  One of the issues is that many companies in continental Europe who are doing business with Ireland, in particular in consumer goods, view Ireland if not politically at least geographically as an appendix of Britain and from a distribution point of view, there is a big distribution centre somewhere in the UK and Ireland is served from it.  The reason they do that is because the volumes and the economy make sense, so if that becomes prohibitive and one has to do it from the Continent direct to Ireland those volumes will be much smaller because our economy is one tenth the size of the UK economy and consequently the unit costs will go up.  What would happen is that while the costs would go up because of the physicality of the distribution channel and the distances and times, it would require a lot of innovation on the part of operators to see what they could do to streamline the processes if their costs were going up here in order to improve communication and integrate better with France, Holland, Belgium and so on.  We would get through it, possibly with higher costs, but in the challenge of doing it we would become stronger and we would learn how to do business better.  In a way, Brexit is breaking Irish-owned SMEs out of the complacency that I think has gone on for too long, in terms of doing business easily with the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

We had an event in Knock Airport two weeks ago.  It is quite an impressive airport, which is very much needed in the west.  Road access to the west is of critical importance, particularly for companies that want to ship goods.  At present they must transport goods to Dublin Port, so the road from Castlebar to Mullingar desperately needs to be upgraded.  We have heard anecdotal evidence from our members of how embarrassing it is for them when bringing companies to different parts of the island that are not on the motorway system.  It is a let-down.  What I notice when travelling from the west is that the road going into Longford seems to go on forever.  One is looking at it on the satnav for what seems for ever.  Where I would put investment is into upgrading the road system and broadband<b>.  </b>Broadband is critical with the new technologies Mr. Daly spoke about, as well as with remote working.  We have to hand all sorts of maps showing the broadband service in the regions and the broadband situation in the west is a total embarrassment.  </p></speech>

The project faces many geopolitical challenges, as well as pure geographical challenges.  In effect the Chinese are looking to develop a modern-day Silk Road across the western reaches of their country in through Central Asia and on to Europe.  There are trains moving freight across the territories already.  There is a London to Beijing freight train.  At the same time, there are many logistical challenges.  China, as an economy, is maturing and becoming more sophisticated.  They are becoming more attuned to the requirements that people have to protect their intellectual property and much of the piracy and counterfeiting activity is beginning to decline.</p> <p>  It would be in Ireland's interest to keep an eye on the Road and Belt initiative.  I know that many western countries are putting their hand up to show their interest in co-operating with the Chinese.  I think we should do that.  This initiative is at an early stage and it is not altogether clear what it will turn out to be.  We have nothing to lose by becoming as involved as possible.</p></speech>

There has been a regional focus to our engagement on Knock Airport, but we must also talk about the Dublin region.  One of the issues that is being raised with us, and it is included in our submission, is the severe shortage of warehousing space.  As Dublin Port and Dublin Airport are such a significant part of the exporting infrastructure, one potentially has a back-up of traffic around a point on the M50.  If one looks at the development plan for Dublin Airport in particular, to my knowledge, there is only one entrance and egress from the airport.  Something needs to be done in upgrading the infrastructure around Dublin Airport, including the metro north that really needs to be accelerated.  It is important to mention that, although it is not in the Deputy's part of the country.</p></speech>

Mr. McKeever should not mistake my questions on the regions as a lack of concern for Dublin.  I fully appreciate that if Dublin is not working, it will have implications for everywhere else as well.  I take Mr. McKeever's point and I agree with him.</p></speech>

Quality warehousing for pharma and medical devices is in short supply.  I have many clients in this sector and the shortage is very acute.  It is beginning to stifle their ability to put in supply chain logistic strategies for their manufacturing businesses for the future.  It will take time for that warehousing infrastructure to be built and my understanding is that both the banks and the developers are facing issues similar to those faced in housing.  There might be a certain reluctance on the part of the banks to finance certain projects.  Some multinational manufacturers are reluctant to invest in building their own warehouse facilities but they need and want warehouse facilities.  They are beginning to develop creative solutions with developers-logistic service providers to build facilities close to their manufacturing operation and to work in lease-back arrangements where they change the capital expenditure, CapEx, expense which the corporate companies in the US and UK will not countenance to an operating expense, OPEX, in terms of an ongoing logistics cost.  Some of the challenges are to have enough people who will come to the table and commit to building a warehouse and providing a service for the next ten to 15 years.  We need to be cognisant of the fact that there is a block to bringing logistical infrastructure online in the private sector that perhaps we could look at addressing through creative logistics hub schemes that can have some public support also.</p></speech>

It will be very important to have more debates such as this to advise the public.  I am sure we will be calling on their services again as I think it is important to keep up to date with what is happening.  It will take a great deal of pressure for the European Union to recognise the difficult position in which Ireland is being left through no fault of our own.  Our special case is not a special pleading but it is owed to us because of circumstances that are way beyond our control.  If the European Union is to mean anything, it means that we look after one other and that must be taken into account when we are looking at what can and cannot be done.</p> <p>  Again I thank Mr. McKeever and Mr. Daly for coming before the committee.

The outline for the meeting is that ComReg will account to the committee for the performance of its functions and the strategy statement 2017-2019 and then any current issues can be raised.  I would like to welcome from ComReg Mr. Gerry Fahy, chairperson, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner, and Mr. Kevin O'Brien, commissioner, and thank them for joining us.  Their presentation has been circulated to members but they may wish to brief members on it.</p><p>I remind members to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they can interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters as well as for web-streaming coverage.

However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

The joint committee has had discussions with the OECD in relation to its role as an oversight body, which it intends to develop further on over the coming year.  The committee intends to meet each regulator on an annual basis to review its performance and today we are meeting ComReg for the purposes mentioned, namely, accounting to the committee for the performance of its functions and the strategy statement 2017-2019 and to deal with any current issues.</p><p>I call Mr. Gerry Fahy.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner, and Mr. Kevin O'Brien, commissioner.  We will be going through the presentation jointly.  I will give the overview and will then hand over Mr. Godfrey to talk about our strategy while Mr. O'Brien will talk about the projects that flow from our strategy.  I will then talk about the issue of roaming, which I know is of interest to the committee, and will then cover the highlights of our issues for the last 12 months.  I will close on that point.</p> <p>  ComReg was established by an Act of the Oireachtas in December 2002.  It followed on from the ODTR, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, which preceded it.  ComReg has three commissioners, who are here today.  We are supported by a highly skilled multidisciplinary staff, including economists, engineers, accountants and lawyers, among others.  We regulate under Irish and EU law and our key responsibilities are: promoting competition and consumer choice; upholding consumer rights; facilitating marketing development, innovation and efficient use of spectrum; and ensuring the maintenance of the universal service in both telecoms and post.  We have other miscellaneous responsibilities, including emergency call-answering services, domain registry and premium rate services regulation, among a number of other services which are too long to list here.</p> <p>  That is just an overview of what ComReg is and what it does.  At this point I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Godfrey, to talk about the market today and the strategy that we have evolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Godfrey" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017052300002#C00400"><p>Any strategy starts with knowing where one is today.</p><p>In view of this I will give a brief overview of the marketplace.  The electronic communications sector is an important sector in its own right in terms of its turnover and employment, but its real impact on Ireland economically is in the support it gives to other industries in making Ireland an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, and also the support it gives to a sector such as health care, education and general social life.</p><p> In the past several years, there has been a big increase in competition in the marketplace and in consumer choice.  In the fixed broadband market, there are now four players, each of whom has more than 10% market share, and the largest player is down to about 32% market share.  The supply, therefore, is much more evenly spread than has been the case.  In the mobile market it is a little more concentrated, with just three players with more than 10% market share, although there is a fourth player, Tesco, with 7%.  The largest player in mobile has a market share of something like 37%.  That competition has led to a great deal of choice for consumers.  There is a variety of bundles they can buy, including voice services, mobile, TV services and so forth.</p><p> In general, prices have been coming down in the past five years, as measured by the communications component of the consumer price index, CPI.  Prices rose slightly in 2015 and fell back again in 2016.  So far this year, we have seen a few operators increase prices slightly.  However, not all operators have done that and customers are able to switch and take up lower price bundles.  We await to see the impact that will have on prices overall.</p><p> There has also been a good deal of investment.  Even in the years since the financial crisis, investment has run at over &euro;3 billion.  That has mostly gone into high speed networks for broadband and 4G high speed mobile networks.  The result of that is that the number of people with high speed packages since 2012 has increased from approximately 20% to approximately 65%.  The percentage of users using 4G has gone from 27% to 42% in a year but, and it is a significant "but", the benefits of that have occurred for around the 70% of the population that lives in urban and more highly populated areas.  The experience of users in less populated rural areas is that those services are much less widespread.  I will come back to that issue when we talk about the strategy.</p><p> These changes have been very useful in meeting consumers' evolving needs.  We are seeing a much greater use of smart phones, tablets and laptops.  The mobile data use has increased by 500% in the past five years.  Mobile phones have become the primary communications device people use, which was not the case several years ago.</p><p> In terms of the trends we see developing in the next four or five years, the first one we will highlight is the variability in consumer experience.  In urban areas in Ireland, the availability of communications services is as good as anywhere in Europe, but we have a much bigger rural population than most other places in Europe and the impact of the poorer services in the rural areas is much more significant.  That problem is getting worse because of the importance of communications services.  To give an example, five or six years ago it did not matter too much to people if they could not get mobile coverage in their homes because when they were in their homes they would largely use their fixed line.  Now that people's main communications device is their mobile phone, it matters much more that they can make phone calls on their mobile phone while they are in their homes.  In recent years, we have started to see many more complaints about poor indoor coverage in rural areas, as well as complaints about outdoor coverage.  As our strategy goes forward, addressing that issue is a very important plank for us.</p><p> The next three trends we see are all about making sure that the services available in Ireland remain at the forefront of what is available globally.  It takes a good deal of work on the part of the Regulator to create the conditions where people will invest and innovate, and where the need to compete creates that imperative.  We believe that is important for three reasons.  First, electronic communications in their own right are less important than the things they enable.  As we are seeing greater use of social media and online video, we need to have an eye on how we enable start-ups, innovation and development of those related markets, even though we do not regulate them ourselves.</p><p> Second, we need to have an eye on what has been called the internet of things.  In the future, communications will not just be between people.  It is quite likely they will be between one device and another device.  Already, we are seeing the beginning of that with devices for smart homes.  We read a lot about autonomous vehicles.  These new services are not of great importance today, but they will be of great importance in four or five years time, and we want to make sure that in five years time a member in a D&aacute;il committee is not asking us why we did not make sure that people in Ireland had access to those new services.</p><p> The third aspect is around the technologies that support them.  We can see much greater investment in fibre-optic technology to support services and also new sorts of mobile technology, particularly around 5G.</p><p> The fourth important aspect it is worth pointing out is that the European legal framework in which we operate is being fundamentally reviewed.  The proposal for a new communications code that is being discussed in the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament is in some ways just a useful updating of the existing framework.  However, there are some proposals which cause some concern, particularly around reducing the ability of regulators to promote consumer choice and protect the interests of consumers, and also some centralisation proposals, particularly around spectrum, which is to bring the decisions away from member states into Brussels.  That proposal has attracted a great deal of concern, both from member states and regulatory authorities throughout Europe.</p><p> On the vision we adopted in our strategy, having looked at those trends, I will highlight three main concepts, namely, affordable, high quality and widespread access to communications services.  That is picking up on the need for the services to continue to be at the forefront of what people need for them to be affordable, but also for them to be available not just in urban areas but also in rural and less populated areas.</p><p> ComReg's role in this, as an economic regulator, is to make sure that the market operates in the interests of end users in society.  That is not just about being an efficient market, it is about a market that operates in the public interest.  We do that by promoting investment and consumer choice, and protecting consumers.</p><p> I will conclude with a slide on five elements of what we call strategic intent.  We looked at the main tools available to ComReg and what we would like to achieve through the use of those tools.  From a strategic intent we develop goals and then the projects, which Mr. O'Brien will discuss shortly.</p><p> On the competition side, having a variety of players providing services to end users is something we wish to promote.  Also, it is a complicated market where the participants buy and sell services from one another.  We want to see as much competition as is possible in the provision of some of the underlying networks and those wholesale services.</p><p> The second element is consumer protection.  Many of the bundles are quite complicated, and it is difficult for consumers to have good information on all of the attributes of the service to allow them choose their services in a fully informed way.  We are looking to make sure they are provided with the right information, that they are able to switch service providers when they need to do so, and that they are treated fairly by providers.</p><p> Investment is very important to make sure the new technologies are invested in.  Regulation can ensure that the market delivers good, state-of-the-art services.</p><p>It can also push back the boundaries of where that delivery is economically feasible.  One thing we acknowledge also is that there are some parts of Ireland where, because of the costs of delivering service, a State intervention may be necessary in order to make the investment happen.  Where that is the case, our role is much more as an adviser to the policy Department, as it is its policy initiatives to design the interventions.</p><p> Enforcement and compliance are very important.  There is no point in our setting rules if they are not complied with.  Our aim here is to make sure that operators proactively comply.  </p><p> Mr. Fahy referred to the staff who support us.  It is very important that we as an organisation are set up to deliver the strategy.  That involves the people we have, the powers we need, the way we gather data about the marketplace and the techniques we use to analyse them and the way we engage with stakeholders such as the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017052300002#E00200"><p>I will set out the key projects that ComReg is working on and that we see ourselves delivering on over the next two-year period.  The first is promoting competition.  Where operators have significant power in the market, and this usually means Eir or Eircom Limited about which we are talking, we introduce regulation.  In the case of Eircom's network for broadband, through regulation we allow companies like Sky and Vodafone to use the Eir network so that they can sell services on to Irish consumers.  That is a constantly changing piece of regulation and we have some big pieces of work in the job jar on that over the next 24 months.  They will be dealing with issues like how other operators get access to things like poles and ducts on the Eir network and also at how Eir has led price, in particular with regard to the bundles market.</p> <p>  My second point concerns Eir's regulatory governance model.  Over the years ComReg has had concerns about Eir's approach to meeting its regulatory obligations.  Recently we commissioned consultants to do a deep dive examination of Eir in this regard.  Those consultants are just finishing their work and on the basis of their recommendations we will be proceeding to look at new ways of approaching Eir to demand certain standards from it around governance and adherence to regulation.  That can include issues such as aspects or rules around separation of elements of the company.</p> <p>  I will now address the issue of empowering consumers.  We have commissioned research into this area on an ongoing basis but we are trying to deepen our levels of research and understanding of consumer behaviour and consumers' ability to grapple with complex information better.  We will produce a new comparison tool.  ComReg had the first comparison tool on its website ten or more years ago called callcosts.  We are updating that tool and we will relaunch it in 2017.  It will be much more advanced and useful for consumers.  Through our new website we are trying to find better ways for consumers to engage with us and ask us questions, and we are also starting to implement the neutrality rules, which are new European rules from last year.  These concern keeping the Internet free and open.</p> <p>  ComReg has a number of initiatives in the area of mobile user experience.  These are being carried out in the context of the Department's broadband and mobile coverage task force.  We plan to gather information so that we can put in place something like a coverage checker map.  We have not yet decided on the actual output of that yet but it will be something that consumers can use to understand coverage in their area.  We are starting to work on examining handset performance because there is a big issue about the variability of handsets when it comes to mobile coverage and we will try to make data publicly available on that.  We also want to examine the impact of better insulation in housing because that also has an impact on indoor coverage.</p> <p>  Moving on to how operators deal with complaints, we are currently consulting on proposals to basically tighten up the obligations on operators when they are contacted by consumers and we will propose new regulation in that regard.</p> <p>  My next point concerns investment.  One of the spectrum bands that will become available in the next three years is the 700 band.  Some members may remember analogue switch-off and the freeing up of the 800 band, which was subsequently auctioned and is now used for 4G services.  It has now been decided at a European level that the 700 band will be used and made available for electronic communication services.  Currently, RTE in conjunction with the Department is planning to continue providing the same television services but more efficiently and freeing up the 700 band.  What is interesting about this band is that it has very good coverage characteristics so the ability to reach more on a geographic basis is a big possibility here.  </p> <p>  Another point mentioned by Mr. Godfrey is our role in supporting the Department.  The Department is the decision maker in all aspects of the national broadband plan project, however under state aid guidelines we have an advisory role.</p> <p>  I will now mention universal service.  Eir is obliged to make sure that everybody in Ireland has a fixed telephony service that is fit for purpose.  We have put in place obligations on that and we intend to ensure those obligations are met by Eir.  In due course, we will also examine the question as to whether universal service should also include broadband.</p> <p>  My final point concerns the organisation.  First, I will talk about compliance.  We have learned in ComReg over that years that for regulation to be effective there must be real and serious compliance action.  We have become more active in that regard.  We want there to be proper deterrents to ensure operators meet their obligations.  I mention to the committee that we have been engaging with Departments and with the Law Reform Commission on the need for regulators to have appropriate powers and in 2017 the Law Reform Commission intends to publish its findings on this.  That is something the committee might want to look at when it comes out.  We need the organisation to be able to deliver on the strategic intent and projects we have mentioned so far.  Therefore, to have the right capacity and the right skills means that, in some cases, we need additional staff and skills in the organisation.  That is to ensure we deliver on our remit.  I will pass back to Mr. Fahy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Fahy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017052300002#E00300"><p>I would like to talk about roaming which has been somewhat controversial in recent times in respect of how the benefits of the European roam like at home regulations will be implemented in the Irish market.  Let me take a step back and recall what roaming is.  Roaming takes place when one takes one mobile abroad and generate a call or a text or a data event on a foreign network.  That network generates a wholesale charge which it bills back to one's home operator.  The home operator likely adds a retail margin and then one receives the bill.  Those charges in the past were very high and were quite negatively received, naturally, and the European Commission took a close interest in seeking to address that issue.  </p> <p>  In August 2007, the Commission commenced looking at the retail and wholesale charges for voice services and since that activity has rolled out over the years the retail prices for outgoing voice calls has reduced by 92%.  In July 2010 it began to look at the wholesale charges for SMS and for data and since 2010 the retail charge for sending SMS has reduced by 92%.  In 2012 it began to look very much more closely at charges for data and since then data roaming charges have reduced by 96%.</p> <p>  In April 2016 the Commission began the transition towards the roam like at home capability, putting very severe surcharge caps on the various elements of mobile usage.  The culmination of that process will be on 15 June 2017 when the new roam like at home regulations come into force.  That will effectively mean that one should be able to take one's home tariff abroad anywhere within the EU and use it as one would at home.</p> <p>  There are certain exceptions allowed, however, and I would like to take the committee through these.  When the European Commission and the various bodies concerned examined this issue, they understood that there were certain very attractive domestic bundles in particular markets in Europe.</p><p>When the European Commission and the various bodies were analysing this, they saw that there were some very attractive domestic bundles in particular markets in Europe, namely, the Scandinavian markets and in Ireland, where there were very large or effectively unlimited bundles of data available.  If such bundles were obliged to be offered as a roaming capability, there would be unlimited wholesale charges and the offering operators would be at risk of having to respond to such charges.  This was recognised as being an anomaly and if a roaming regime was implemented in this way, operators such as those in Ireland might be forced to take their particularly large bundles off the market.  These large data bundles are very attractive and are very positive in terms of competition and consumer benefit.  Therefore, a decision was made that a fair usage policy could be applied to these especially large bundles to protect the domestic data bundles while still allowing very significant amounts of roaming data to be made available.  In the example outlined in my presentation document, the retail price for the tariff in Ireland is &euro;25, including data. The customer will be able to use up to 6.5 Gbit of data while roaming.  Given that the average smartphone user in Ireland today uses less than 3.5 Gbit of data per month, that is quite a generous amount of data to be allowed for while roaming.  We must also bear in mind that 95% of travellers in Europe stay away for less than two weeks.  This was seen as a way of ensuring domestic customers did not effectively have to subsidise roamers because, surprising as this may be, not everybody roams.  At the European level approximately one third of customers do not roam at all.  Therefore, it is possible to be compliant with the regulations while bringing in a fair usage policy.  If a customer goes over the cap on the data bundle while roaming, he or she will pay a 0.77 cent charge.  Operators need to inform the regulator of their intention to bring in this fair usage policy and they must also inform their customers of same.</p><p> What has ComReg being doing about all of this?  ComReg has written to all of the mobile operators reminding them of their obligations under the regulations and asking them what changes they are making to their tariffs to comply with those obligations and with the regulations coming into force on 15 June.  Operators have indicated that the necessary steps are being taken to comply with the new roaming regulations and ComReg will be undertaking a full review of these tariffs, as implemented, to be satisfied with respect to their compliance.  ComReg also notes that following the publication of the roaming guidelines produced recently by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, BEREC, one operator in particular, 3, has announced a change to its previously publicly indicated approach with the introduction of a fair usage policy bundle as provided for in the regulations.</p><p> I will now move on to talk about some other significant achievements at ComReg in the recent past.  Yesterday, ComReg was pleased to announce the outcome of its 3.6 GHz spectrum auction.  There were five winners and all the spectrum was assigned, which effectively is an 86% uplift on the amount of spectrum that was available previously for mobility services.  This is in line with the strategy we outlined in 2016 in respect of spectrum.  The five winners were three mobile operators, one new entrant and one fixed wireless operator.  Between them they will pay &euro;78 million to the Exchequer over the licence period of 15 years.</p><p> In recent months, ComReg has redesignated Eir as a universal service provider, USP, for five years.  We have also instigated a new quality regime in service provision with a particular focus on rural areas.  We have imposed penalties in the order of &euro;3 million on Eir for failing to meet its quality service targets in previous years.  In promoting competition, ComReg has set wholesale prices for voice and data services on the Eir fixed network at a level that will stimulate more competition.  We have also published proposals for a reduction in charges for services using Eir's next generation access network with the aim of stimulating further competition.</p><p> In terms of enforcement actions undertaken to uphold consumer rights, several successful prosecutions have been taken by ComReg in the courts against various operators for overcharging and incorrect billing.  We are also taking action to ensure consumers are properly informed about contract changes and have the opportunity to exercise their right to sever a contract should they so wish.  A number of investigations are ongoing in that area.</p><p> I look forward to engaging with committee members.</p></speech>

I am much happier on this occasion than the previous time representatives from the commission appeared before us.  The witnesses have indicated a recognition that there is a very considerable level of dysfunction in the coverage in certain parts of the country, particularly but not exclusively in rural areas.  I know of places in Dublin where, because of topography, trees and so on, there are very significant issues with coverage.  At least it is clear from its strategy and its statements that ComReg is very cognisant of that fact.  Obviously, the issue now is how it succeeds in encouraging or forcing its vision on the contractors.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Fahy, who spoke about the spectrum auction and about urban and rural service provision.  In terms of mobile coverage in particular, what is the land area requirement on the mobile phone operators for this spectrum?</p></speech>

The original users of this spectrum were fixed wireless operators so they were largely regional and rural.  The spectrum was divided nationally into nine regions, both rural and urban.  To strike a balance within those regions and to make the opportunity attractive to both regional and national operators, the coverage obligations were expressed in the number of base stations that will be required per region, depending on the amount of spectrum that was accumulated in the auction.  They were not expressed in terms of percentages of land coverage.</p></speech>

It is certainly capable of use for mobile telephony and that would be one of its main uses.  It is also designated as a 5G band, so it is one of those bands that manufacturers will target in terms of making 5G equipment and services available.</p></speech>

I am not trying to catch Mr. Fahy out or be awkward.  Mr. Fahy has recognised the issues concerning the spread of coverage through the land mass.  It is my view that on a small island, it should be possible to cover virtually every corner of the island.  I do not want to hog the meeting but this is something ComReg needs to look at.  I see some mobile phone companies advertising their service in very remote, scenic and beautiful rural areas where Mr. Fahy and I know full well there is no coverage.  Has ComReg failed yet again in this auction to ensure or put stipulations on those that have one spectrum?  Has ComReg let them slip through the net again in terms of providing that coverage?  </p></speech>

It is more of a capacity spectrum.  It is certainly usable for coverage and is used significantly throughout the country for fixed wireless broadband services so it is not a mobility service.  It is a fixed service and is very useful for that.  One would expect it to be continued to be used for that.  As was mentioned earlier by my colleagues, the real coverage is the 700 MHz band.  That is used today for broadcast services and broadcasts well into valleys and through buildings.  That would be the classic coverage spectrum.  There is a big debate to be had with all stakeholders as to whether we need to move away from the population expression of coverage towards a geographic expression of coverage.  ComReg is completely open minded on that issue.</p></speech>

The reason RTE uses it today for broadcasting is because it is useful for that purpose.  It is a low frequency spectrum that penetrates much further and has the ability to serve wide geographic areas.  That is really the solution.  Nevertheless, very significant services are offered on the 3.6 spectrum.  They are not offered in a mobile way but are offered with fixed terminals at both ends and high-gain antennaes at both ends so significant coverage can be achieved and is achieved today.</p></speech>

I will begin with roaming charges, about which Mr. Fahy has spoken.  The issue of roaming charges is very important for people who travel a lot.  I represent Cavan-Monaghan and the issue of roaming charges is very important for people there.  It is understood that there are 30,000 journeys across the Border every day so it is important in that context.  There have been reports in the media recently that phone operators are attempting to circumvent the regulations - the new roaming rules.  Is Mr. Fahy happy that this issue has been fully resolved?  Do EU roaming rules mean that people can use their phones in other member states in a manner comparable to the way they are used at home?  Can they have the same ease and assurances in terms of cost, etc.?  Recent reports have suggested that all is not as it seems where data allowances are concerned, that there is a hidden charge there and that people are being penalised in that area.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Fahy agree that the area I represent, which is a microcosm of much of the country, has very uneven coverage for a combination of reasons with topography being a major one?  Our towns and villages are quite good but our broadband access and coverage is poor in many rural areas.  Does Mr. Fahy agree that this is the case?  Does he agree that mobile phone services are erratic in parts of Cavan-Monaghan?  I receive anecdotal evidence.  People tell me that they cannot use their mobile phones in certain areas.  Could Mr. Fahy tell us the steps ComReg is taking to ensure that we get a good service in rural communities?  Could he assure us that he will work to go for land coverage rather than focusing totally on population centres and ensure that the various operators, notably Eir in this instance, meet their obligations in terms of people getting access?  </p> <p>  What will be the immediate impact of assigning the spectrum on coverage and consumers, particularly those in rural areas?  It is a reasonable proposition to say that people have the same need for broadband regardless of where they live.  They use broadband on their mobile phones.  It is a big issue for students in rural communities and local businesses.  I do not have to go through the list but it is a very serious matter for many people.  Can Mr. Fahy reassure us or give us any indication when the auction of the spectrum and the welcome announcement yesterday will result in better services?  How will that manifest itself?  When can the consumers who are watching this online be assured that they will get a better service as a consequence?   </p> <p>  I know Mr. Fahy is not in the policy department but will the &euro;78 million relating to this be ring-fenced for communications expenditure?  I was concerned that the base stations might be in very large urban centres.  I share Deputy Dooley's concern that we would not have a sufficient number of base stations and access in rural communities.  It seems that Mr. Fahy is talking about a very advanced level of broadband service.  In so far as it is accessible, broadband in the future will be very powerful, which is to be welcomed.  My duty to the people I represent is to find out the degree to which ComReg is ensuring in a proactive way that the great discrimination that exists in terms of broadband and mobile phone coverage is being actively addressed.</p><p>How is ComReg on the side of those who are discriminated against?  Throughout Cavan-Monaghan which I represent it is extraordinary how the culture and everything else have changed.  The issue of coverage is raised with me regularly when I attend meetings or meet people in other settings.  It has replaced other issues that arose in the past.  I never attend a public meeting now at which the question of coverage does not arise.  Somebody will say to me that he or she cannot get coverage on his or her phone and cannot get broadband.  People tell me that their children are in college in Dundalk or Cavan or attending the Monaghan Institute and they cannot study at home because they cannot access to information.  They might say they have a small business that is affected.  In the village of Canningstown, near Bailieborough, County Cavan, there is an employer who could be employing up to 50 people.  It is in an area that traditionally has not had employment.  This staffing level is the equivalent of a few hundred jobs in an urban setting, but the employer tells me that he has real issues with coverage and broadband.  How will ComReg correct this?</p></speech>

I will answer some of them and pass on the rest to my colleagues.  </p> <p>  The quickest question to answer is on the figure of &euro;78 million.  The initial payment is &euro;60.5 million upfront.  It forms part of ComReg's surplus and is immediately available for distribution back to the Department.  It is not ring-fenced and is returned to the Exchequer.  It is probably worth noting that in its 21-year existence ComReg has effectively generated a surplus return to the Exchequer of over &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>  With regard to coverage in rural areas such as Cavan and other areas with undulating and mountainous terrain, there are undoubtedly black spots.  Planning permission is a key issue.  Some of the locations are beauty spots.  One of the work streams of the Government task force which is engaging with the mobile operators and local authorities involves looking for ways to smooth the path for base stations in areas where there are known black spots and great difficulties in obtaining planning permission.  The mobile operators, ComReg and the local communities have a joint interest in solving these problems.  There is positive intent generally, but the planning issues can be problematic, particularly in beauty spots.  In a sense, it is a society challenge.  What is ComReg doing about it?  Reference was made to the current spectrum award and the Senator asked how it would help.  The spectrum is being trialled and used for high-speed rural broadband provision.  One operator offers a wireless service of 70 Mbps on the spectrum.  Now that it has secured a long licence, it will be able to deploy the service more widely.  Three of the operators that have won spectrum are mobile operators.  They have thousands of base stations all over the country, each one of which can be used to deploy the spectrum for either mobile or fixed broadband services.  There is significant potential which competition will drive.</p></speech>

There are operators serving those communities and a new entrant is coming into the market.  There will be a dynamic in terms of competition in this regard and we strongly hope there will be many quick returns.  To be clear, the coverage or roll-out target is three years.  It is not specified what should happen in years one and two as the reference is to the end of year three.  I can tell the Senator that the degree of interest in the spectrum far surpasses ComReg's expectations.  I notice that there is quite a lot of interest internationally in the outcome achieved and the fact that it was well ahead of any other international benchmark in terms of the price paid for spectrum.  That shows the degree of interest in using the spectrum.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the availability of broadband services in rural areas.  I invite my colleague, Mr. Godfrey, to talk about broadband services in rural areas and, perhaps, the national broadband plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Godfrey" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017052300002#H00500"><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly is right that Cavan-Monaghan is probably a microcosm of Ireland.  Cavan town is the place where SIRO made its first investment in an all-fibre network.  There is a really sharp difference between the services available in Cavan town and beyond it.  Eir was also responsible for investment.  One part of where the Senator represents is as well served as Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong, while others are very poorly served.  The Department, in its national broadband plan, has published a map of where high-speed broadband services are available and expected to become available.  I do not have the map in front of me, but it will confirm absolutely that the population centres which comprise tiny landmasses are the places where many of the high-speed broadband services dare expected to be.</p> <p>  The biggest initiative to address the problem of rural broadband coverage, as I alluded to in the presentation, is State intervention.  That is not ComReg's responsibility; it is an intervention being run by the Department.  ComReg has a few roles in support of it.  Under state aid guidelines, it is an adviser to the Department on various competition matters.  We have seconded staff to help with that initiative.</p> <p>  On there being an immediate benefit, I echo what Mr. Fahy said.  The wireless operators represent the quickest way of improving broadband coverage.  I do not have the benefit of a home in Cavan-Monaghan as my family home is in north Cork, but I have certainly found that, since I switched from the fixed to the mobile network, the speed has increased from 1.5 Mbps to 70 Mbps.  Even where I live, 5 km from the village centre, it is certainly possible to obtain very high speeds.  The operator that has been trialling this service has certainly been saying publicly in the past couple of years and in response to our consultations that there was a limit to the investment it could make until the spectrum had been reassigned with a long-licence duration supporting investment.  I do not know how quickly its plans are to be realised, but its intention which it has aired publicly was to expand investment once it knew the licences had been awarded.  Probably the best entity to answer the Senator's question on what could happen within months would be that operator.  I will be happy to provide the Senator with the contact details afterwards.</p></speech>

We will look into licensing a repeater, so that where there is a black spot or coverage deficit, the repeater will bring coverage in from afar and direct it into a location.  There are some very useful new technologies which are quite reasonably priced.  We will work through a process, but if they were licensed in our jurisdiction they would significantly improve coverage.</p></speech>

The price that was received was eight times that minimum threshold, that is to say the reserve price.  As I mentioned earlier, the price received was well above the prices paid for similar spectrum internationally.  Just before I came in I read a headline in an international journal saying that the price was 20 times what would have been expected based on international benchmarks.  ComReg has no remit, however, in terms of the actual price.  We are not there to generate the highest price.  We are there to ensure the spectrum is assigned efficiently and is used effectively.  That is what the auction process is about.</p></speech>

We are interested in public assets.  Our job is to make sure that we get a good return for any public assets.  That is important.  I put the question because one when looks at the process, four of the existing players are continuing to operate and there is one new player.  I do not know what spectrum Airspan holds.  I was frantically trying to check on my own 4G service.  It seems to be more of a business-to-business type of an operator.  I could be wrong on that.</p></speech>

Other than those whose bids succeed, we do not reveal who bidders are.</p></speech>

Perhaps there is not one.  Perhaps three operators and Imagine are all we are going to get.  I might pursue other means to get this information because it seems that we cannot get details on whether there were underbidders.  It is important.  I have just come out of a meeting of the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight where the Irish Exporters Association said that one of the most important infrastructure investments that it wants to see is 5G technology.  What we get there is not insignificant.  Is Mr. Fahy confident that we have a competitive market in the area of mobile broadband?</p></speech>

One of the operators, 3, consolidated by buying O2.  That was reviewed by the European Commission.  Remedies were agreed between the parties to address any potential deficit in competition which might have arisen due to the merger.  Those remedies effectively provided for two mobile virtual network operators in the market, which have been provided.  At the time, ComReg publicly expressed its scepticism as to whether those remedies would be sufficient.  To date the impact of the mobile virtual network operators on the market has been minimal.  It may be that they need time to get going.  We were concerned at the time that there might have been a degree of reduction in competition.  We continually monitor the market to ensure that we understand what is going on.  We welcome the entry of a new operator to the 3.6 GHz auction because that potentially introduces a new player.  Imagine also now has a technology-neutral spectrum.  It currently uses the spectrum for fixed broadband services but it does not have to.</p></speech>

In a sense Mr. Fahy has raised real concerns that we do not.  I might mark that because if we do not have competition that is an issue.  When I was looking at the investment figures, somewhere in our pile of data, we invested something like &euro;3 billion since 2009.  I thought that was a bit of an under-investment.  That was my concern when I was looking at  it.  It may be above international expectation, but over 15 years the price for the 3.6 GHz spectrum works out at &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million a year.  I was slightly concerned when I saw the figures.</p></speech>

I would not want to give the committee the impression that we do not think there is competition.  There is competition but a fourth competitor acting as a maverick is always better than three competitors who have, perhaps, different interests.  We therefore hoped to see the mobile virtual network operators reintroducing the maverick tendency into the market.  Some of that has come in but it has not fully replaced what was there beforehand.</p></speech>

Therefore, people can come to us at any time and seek to trial unused or fallow spectrum or spectrum that is about to be licensed.

Which of the three bidders is selected must be the ultimate question of competition.  I know it will be divided into two parts of the country.  I am particularly interested in that question because the latest digital economy and society index shows that overall we are going okay.  We are placed eighth in Europe, but that is primarily because we are very good at using mobile broadband technology for business.  In terms of provision of fixed broadband prices, we are 22nd out of 28 in Europe.  In terms of fixed broadband coverage, we are 20th out of 28 in Europe.  I am concerned, when I see those figures, that we have a significant problem in respect of fixed broadband, regardless of what is happening in our mobile sector.  Does Mr. Fahy think the national broadband scheme might help in that regard?</p></speech>

We have had such investment from Virgin Media in cable broadband in urban areas and we have had it from Eir, competing with Virgin Media in those areas.  Eir's stated plan is now to roll out to 1.9 million homes.  It is proposed that the last 300,000 of those homes would be to bring fibre to the home.  We have a role in that because we have regulated Eir to let others compete, but we have also priced Eir so that it has an incentive to invest itself.  There is a good news story in fixed broadband, but it does run out after approximately 70% of households.  State intervention is required thereafter.  We think that story stacks up.  On pricing levels, in fixed broadband we saw a period of intense competition where Eir was pushing down both its wholesale and retail prices as it launched its high-speed service two to three years ago.</p><p>Then, in recent years we have seen prices float up a little.</p><p> We are in a process at the moment whereby, through regulation, we are looking at the core wholesale products that Eir provides.  When it sells a telephony service on to another company like Vodafone or Sky or when it sells on a broadband service, we are proposing changes in the way that is priced.  We are largely proposing to move to what we call cost orientation models.  These models recognise the actual cost of the investment and allow a reasonable mark-up.  At wholesale level, in a competitive marketplace this should result in the right retail outcome.  That is a snapshot description of what we are about in the fixed area.</p></speech>

Sometimes it comes in lumps.  The committee may recall that the previous spectrum auction generated over &euro;800 million in spectrum fees, some upfront and some annually.  The annual spectrum fees generate a surplus on an yearly basis.  Typically, in an average year, ComReg might generate a surplus of &euro;50 million based on the surplus over the levy.  We impose a levy on the industry and we collect spectrum fees for the various uses of spectrum.  Every year, that surplus is available to be returned to the Exchequer.  The use of the surplus is a matter for the Exchequer.</p></speech>

Has ComReg disengaged from the control of the price of stamps?  Has that gone back directly to An Post?  I disagree with the increase of the standard stamp to &euro;1.  It is a high price and the law of diminishing marginal returns could apply in the sense that the more we charge, the less we get back.  The cost of postage is expensive.  The company is certainly faces challenges from the private sector.</p> <p>  My next question relates to maintenance of the landlines that used to belong to Eircom and the old Department of Post and Telegraphs.  I presume Eir is still responsible for the maintenance of those lines, even those other private companies are making offers and so on with those lines.  Is that correct?  The idea of having a telephone in the house is coming to an end as far as I can see.  Most places do not have telephones aside from mobile telephones.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the use of infrastructure for land lines and poles throughout Ireland.  Can fibre-optic cable be stretched from those poles, as opposed to being laid underground?  Is it simply impractical?  I realise that copper wire can bring broadband but it does not rate with the fibre-optic option.</p></speech>

The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011, which had given us a role in setting a price cap, was amended by legislation earlier this year.  In January we provided a statement to this committee on those matters.  ComReg no longer has a role in that regard.</p> <p>  Senator Leyden made another point relating to fibre-optic cable on poles.  That is possible.  It is happening at the moment.  Eir and other operators are doing that.  In more rural areas the idea of fibre to the home is a proposal that is becoming a reality throughout the country.</p></speech>

The answer is that the company is still responsible for that.  Under universal service designation we have set standards for the quality of service.  Previously, we had national targets, but in our most recent decision we have set regional targets as well.  In the past it was possible for national targets to be met by delivering a good service in the urban areas and a poorer service in rural areas.  We have now made sure of minimum targets for services in rural areas as well.</p></speech>

I had a broadband service to my house in Roscommon.  I noticed that it was very strained because it improved in the afternoon and then seemed to disimprove.  Then I tried to work out whether my neighbours were watching television or something.  It turned out that the explanation was that there was condensation on a joint.  As the part at the top of the telephone pole warmed up, I got service and then I lost it.  I hope that fibre between poles will be better than that.  I presume it will be.</p></speech>

I have some questions of my own.  I wanted to allow the members to have interaction first and it has been useful.  I have a number of questions to put to the deputation as well.</p> <p>  The first question relates to Q-Sat.  I presume the ComReg representatives are familiar with this company.  For the record, Q-Sat was a private company that provided rural satellite broadband technology to 3,000 rural customers.  It went spectacularly bust when some difficult arose in the middle of last week.  This meant that approximately 3,000 customers were left without broadband services.  I understand they may have been given notice of a few moments or no notice at all in many cases.  That is a major blow to the people subscribing to the service and it also undermines confidence in the marketplace.  To be frank, it undermines confidence in the regulation of the marketplace.</p> <p>  I wish to invite comment on that scenario.  How did it unfold?  How can it be prevented in future?  What can be done to address the situation for the 3,000 people who have been affected?</p></speech>

Briefly the way it works is Avanti is a company that owns some satellites and QSAT is one of four companies that service in Ireland based on the Avanti satellites.  We understand there was a commercial difference between QSAT and Avanti, which has led to that relationship breaking down.  Our understanding, from talking to them, is that at present QSAT customers are still receiving service from Avanti.  When they go onto their service they get a pop-up advising them to get service with one of the other companies that provide the Avanti service, but at present people have not lost service.  I understand QSAT customers pay in arrears and a small number of customers who have paid in advance have been refunded.  There is still an opportunity for all of those QSAT customers to switch to one of the other service providers and retain service.  We are in touch with QSAT and Avanti to monitor the situation.  In the regulations, there is an obligation on people to inform us when there is a prospective cessation of service.  When we see that cessation of service, our role is to ensure customers are informed about what will happen and, as in this case, use our good offices to speak to the operators concerned to try to encourage some way of achieving continuity of service.  We get notified when these problems arise and we try to do something about them.  As I have said, at present QSAT customers are getting a bit of free service for a short while, during which time they have an opportunity to switch to something else.</p></speech>

Some of them are not getting any service.  I was speaking to someone last week, and when I asked for an email address I was told it was pointless because the person is totally offline.  Naturally, quite a degree of frustration is arising and I believe it was aired on RTE on Friday afternoon.  There are some difficulties.  Perhaps Mr. Godfrey can take this away and come back to me on it.</p></speech>

The difficulties certain rural areas face are well established, as is the criticality of having broadband in all of these areas.  Something that strikes me is the inconsistency in the map.  I represent a constituency on the periphery of Dublin, namely, Kildare North, which in many ways could be considered part of the greater Dublin areas and is very much part of the commuter belt.  We have huge gaps, so it is not just an issue for very rural areas.  From studying the broadband map and the national broadband plan map, which will be discussed in later questions, there are lanes, boreens and rural roads which one might anticipate may still have difficulties, which I hope are being addressed, but there seems to be no particular logic as to why one road has service provision and one does not.  In the national broadband plan map, some boreens are in light blue areas and others are in amber areas.  ComReg does not provide the service but it regulates how it is provided.  Is ComReg aware of why an operator runs fibre up one rural road but not the road beside it and does not have plans to do so?  We have heard about geographic coverage.  I would have thought an area would be covered in totality before an operator moved on to another area, but it seems to be very much hotchpotch and I am trying to understand how this arises.  Is there anything ComReg can do to give a direction that one area is finished before another is started?</p></speech>

The remaining amber area will get filled in through the national broadband plan and the precise details of this are a matter for the Department.  It is not really for us to second-guess the commercial decisions and tell people where to invest.  Where they do invest, our role is to ensure it is not just Eir that is able to provide service but other operators can also provide service in those dark blue and light blue areas.  As Mr. O'Brien said, we are resetting the rules.  We have proposed reductions in prices to access certain aspects of the eir network.  We cannot tell people where to invest as that is their commercial decision.  Areas where it is not commercial for them to invest fall within the scope of the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

Obviously, we look at trends over a somewhat longer period and some of the data we presented today was drawn from those quarterly reports.  The strategy statements and the quarterly reports serve slightly different purposes.  I am not sure we would necessarily try to combine them, although we are planning to look at how we make the quarterly data available and whether a big report remains the best way of doing things, and whether we might be better just to make the datasets available for people to download and process in their own way.  This is under review.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Fahy for that.  There was a question around the 700 MHz band.  I know we have heard about the more recent auction but it had previously been stated that the 700 MHz spectrum may enable more 5G broadband roll-out and that high-speed mobile broadband would arise from that, to some extent.  What is Mr. Fahy's opinion on the suitability of that plan for 5G services that could be envisaged under that spectrum?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it is entirely suitable for wide-area coverage because that is what it is used for currently by RTE.  It is a band that we have a lot of expectation for, as do other countries.  At a European level it is being co-ordinated in respect of its release.  Across Europe they are trying to ensure it is released by 2022 at the latest but in our case it will be 2020.  The release of the spectrum here must be co-ordinated with the UK television operators because they must release the spectrum to their market at the same time.  There is a whole European process around this spectrum because it is seen as a very strong contender for 5G services and for coverage in general.</p></speech>

As I expressed earlier, there are known black spots and they have been known for a long time.  It can be an issue of planning permission.  One initiative of the broadband task force, which I understand has had some early success, is the appointment of broadband officers in various local authority areas.  Their role pertains to both fixed and mobile broadband and is to seek to work to grease the wheels of the planning processes, to identify blockages and seek potential solutions.  Operators have expressed a willingness to share masts if that will help the planning process.  They do a lot of sharing already and this is a recommendation we would strongly support.  We believe there is good traction on it.</p></speech>

That brings me on to the shared infrastructure directive, Directive No. 2014/61/EU, which came into force on 26 July last year.  Does ComReg have views on the implementation of the regulations in Ireland?  Did ComReg have any input into those regulations?  I am interested to know whether any dispute resolution processes have been invoked yet and how has that fared?  Without getting into the nitty-gritty, how is it working in practice?</p></speech>

It was the Department's task to do that.  Once transposed, the first step for ComReg was to set out a dispute process for if a dispute was taken to us under the directive.  We have done this.  We consulted on it and set out the timelines and processes that ComReg would follow if there was a request under the directive from one operator to access another entity's infrastructure.  We have not had any disputes or requests brought to us at this stage but we are ready to accept them if they arrive.</p></speech>

It is encouraged that the policy-makers doing these interventions would consult with us on certain aspects.  We have set up a mechanism for that consultation as the strategy evolves.  For example, when the map changes, we are being consulted about it in accordance with the state aid guidelines.  That is an ongoing process and we stand ready to do that.  Obviously, once the national broadband plan is in place, the contractors involved would be operating in the marketplace and they will be subject to the regulatory rules that apply at the time.  We will have a role in that regard.</p></speech>

Of the four winning bidders of both urban and rural spectrum, one of the bidders has just the rural spectrum.  It is only focused on rural areas.  That operator already has a customer base, businesses and base stations in rural Ireland.  In the past, this operator has made public statements that if it had a licence for a long period, then it would be in a position to invest.  If it is being consistent with that then the operator will be investing in rural Ireland because that is where its spectrum is.</p></speech>

One can get information in many ways today.  Telephone directories are available.  One can get information about telephone numbers online.  One can telephone one of these service providers.  The pricing is commercial in the sense that a component of it is charged by the company that provides the directory inquiry process and a component of it is charged by the operator.  One can access the ComReg website to find out what the charges are.  One can use that information to choose what operator or service provider to use if one wants to avail of one of these services.  The volume of activity in this area is declining significantly.  There is very little traffic now.

I have a background in technology, computing and communications.  I headed up the computing services department in University College Dublin for 22 years.  I am an Internet pioneer, having made significant contributions to the development of the global Internet in the 1980s.  More recently, I have been an early stage investor and non-executive director.  I also serve on the Open Data Governance Board of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  It is evident that the modern state requires personal information to run effectively and efficiently and support the individual citizen and resident.  It is also evident that, as citizens, we expect more of State services than ever before.  We expect them to be efficient, timely, cost-effective, fraud free and driven by automated processes.  However, we also expect to be protected and safe when we use them.  Part of this safety involves the protection of our privacy and personal data.</p> <p>  When I read the draft Bill last year, I was shocked and disappointed, but it stimulated me to consider the principles that should underpin a shared e-infrastructure to enable the public sector to properly serve the citizens of the State.  A copy of the current version of my paper entitled, Implementing Public Service Shared e-Infrastructure: The Individual &amp;amp; the Irish State &ndash; The Grand Bargain, has been submitted to the committee.  The paper outlines the ten principles that I believe should be adopted before the implementation of any shared State-citizen e-infrastructure is even contemplated.  I would like to focus on some of the issues highlighted in my paper.</p> <p>  The first issue concerns identity and opting in.  Little can be done to implement an appropriate shared services e-infrastructure without agreement - I stress the word "agreement" - on a unique, rigorously authenticated, biometrically and multi-factorial secured identity mechanism for each individual.  Current identity mechanisms &ndash; passports, driving licences, public service cards and medical cards, for example &ndash; are all poor substitutes for what is actually required.  General buy-in to the use of unique identifiers can and will be achieved by the State offering compelling value propositions &ndash; better, faster, slicker, more convenient, more accurate and more efficient services &ndash; in order that, in due course, when public confidence in the data protection provided by the systems has been established, the identification system may be made compulsory. </p> <p>  The State and civil society organisations representing the individual's rights to data privacy need to agree on the necessary identity approach and solutions.  The current situation, in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is trying to introduce 3 million public service cards using data from multiple sources under the provisions of social welfare legislation that I believe to be very old and out of date, is truly shocking and a gross breach of this principle and the trust required.  In addition, we should be talking about queries and responses through data access, not data sharing.  A fundamental principle to be adopted in any shared services e-infrastructure implementation is that individual personal data are never copied and shared, with consequential loss of control over access and authenticity, but are always accessed dynamically online.  In addition, no general access to the underlying data may be given; rather, such access is provided so as to respond with answers to a predefined and pre-approved set of queries.   The data-sharing concept underlying the Bill is fundamentally flawed. </p> <p>  With regard to authentication and access, to ensure confidence in the new shared services e-infrastructure, access to personal data held by the State must be restricted to the individual data subject and data owner and only to legally authorised and EU GDPR-compliant organisations and personnel.  Strict multi-factorial authentication of all individuals with query access must be required.  Not only must they be authorised but also authenticated to establish their true identity.  The Bill, as drafted, is almost silent on the need for rigorous authorisation and authentication of every person in the public service with access to data.  That is a major defect.</p> <p>  With regard to data logging by requestor and responder and data logging centrally, it is self-evident that access to personal data must be logged and recorded in order that audits can be undertaken and individual citizens can easily track by whom, why and when their personal data have been accessed.</p><p>It is also self evident that all access to personal data must be logged and recorded so that audits can be undertaken and individual citizens can easily track by whom, why and when their personal data has been accessed.  Both the requesting and the responding organisations' data privacy gateways, however that is implemented, must automatically log an encrypted hashed record of all queries and data requests, and the resulting responses, that access data relating to an individual.  The Bill has no mention of the data access logging that is a central component of any trusted shared e-infrastructure.<br/><br/><b></b>There are other matters in my paper but the last one I want to highlight is a secure online portal for individuals<b>.  </b>A vital part of any shared services e-infrastructure is the citizens&rsquo; portal, where citizens and residents can track the State services provided and the details of the use and access to their data.  The Bill makes the briefest mention of a single customer view and future online authentication.  That is ridiculous.  Citizens' access to their own data must be an integral part of any implementation from the beginning.<br/><br/>This Bill needs a great deal of work.  None of the issues I have outlined can be taken separately.  They have to be combined to make a safe and trusted e-infrastructure.  I will pass over to my colleague, Daragh O'Brien, who will talk about the governance aspects of what should be in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Daragh O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017052300002#C00200"><p>I will summarise the submission as I am conscious of time.  As Mr. Jennings said, the potential value of the sharing of data between organisations cannot be lightly dismissed.  Data is neutral.  It does not care what it is being used for.  That is why governance structures around data are essential.<br/><br/>We have seen recent cases where the careless handling of information in State agencies resulted in a fact being created and a process put in train that impacted on the private life of at least one whistleblower.  In the scenario where data has been shared with agencies, the veracity and lineage of data becomes even more important in that context, and the Bill is silent on that question.<br/><br/>We have also seen a constant procession of cases before the Data Protection Commissioner and the courts where data has been accessed inappropriately and without authorisation.  That goes back to Mr. Jennings's point about access logging.  In these cases, personal data has been disclosed to third parties by people in the employment of the State who already have access to significant amounts of personal information.<br/><br/>I know from my work with civil servants in a professional capacity as a consultant and trainer that individual civil servants are dismayed when they see those headlines about information being shared in that way.  In a data sharing context, when more information is potentially made available in a general scheme of legislation, civil servants are equally aware of how it easy it is for the trust between the citizen and the State to be breached, whether by the conscious action of an individual or the ill-considered acts of an official body.<br/><br/>The presentation of data sharing as a panacea for efficiency and effectiveness needs to be considered in the context of the quality of data sets that are being linked together, the impact of the processing of data on the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, as Mr. Jennings alluded to, the transparency of the processing to the individuals.  In 2014, we were engaged by Digital Rights Ireland to do a review of the proposed scheme of the Bill.  I understand a copy of our analysis at that time has been included in our submissions.  In terms of summarising that submission, we concluded that the cart had been put before the horse.  The focus was on sharing and not on governance.  It needs to be the other way around.  The focus on improving efficiency through sharing in the Bill as proposed does not do anything to ensure the robustness of governance necessary to ensure that the right data is being shared in the right way at the right time, with the right clear basis.<br/><br/>Essentially, the Bill proposes to tell the citizen to &quot;trust us, we&rsquo;re the Government&quot;, but does very little to put in place anything by way of standards, structures or accountability upon which that trust may be grounded.  I listened with interest to the video of last week&rsquo;s presentation to the committee and I found it very difficult to square the views of the Data Protection Commissioner's office that the Bill was simply a framework that would allow additional legislation to be enacted with the view from others who presented that the Bill was an umbrella piece of legislation that would allow sharing to take place without additional legislative measures.  It is either one thing or the other.  It is either a skeleton or an umbrella; it cannot be both.  The fact that almost three years after the scheme of this Bill was first published there is still a lack of clarity on the purpose, intent and scope between the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which is tasked with enforcing the fundamental right to data privacy, and the Civil Service on what this Bill is intended to do is a matter of concern.<br/><br/>I also noted Mr. Sutherland&rsquo;s written remarks in which he pointed out that,<i><font color="#4F4F4F"> </font></i>&quot;In itself, this legislation will not be sufficient to validate the processing of personal data to the standard required under EU law and it cannot provide a basis for automatically sanctioning public sector authorities to share personal data&quot;.  There is a missed opportunity to learn from prior experience of other projects where the State has attempted to share personal data across the organisation.  Based on experience from private sector data governance projects and successful models of implementation that I have studied and applied with clients over the years, effective cross-functional approaches to the governance of data in organisations is essential to make sure that the promise of efficiency is delivered on.  I have lost track of the number of organisations I have worked with where one department's definition of a &quot;customer&quot; was different to that of the team sitting next to them, but I remember vividly the late nights at the end of a reporting period where everyone sat sweating the figures trying to make them match.  This simple example of cross-departmental communication in an organisation is because of poor data definition.  In the absence of standards for codifying the meaning of a simple term or concept, confusion reigns.<br/><br/>In the public sector we see examples of this type of metadata challenge in a variety of contexts.  For example, on the definition of &quot;means&quot; and sharing of means data, different organisations have a different understanding of what &quot;means&quot; is because the terms of a means tested benefit can differ based on the schemes that are being applied.  Likewise, the definition of &quot;income&quot; can also differ depending on the perspective of the organisation, the nature of the schemes that are applied etc.  In terms of what is an &quot;address&quot;, in a given context, an address can have different meanings for different purposes in different organisations.  When we ask for an address from one organisation to be given to another, there must be some definition as to how that is governed and controlled to ensure there is clarity of meaning, given the potential for sub-optimal outcomes if the wrong data is applied for the wrong purpose.<br/><br/>A far better and valuable focus of the Bill would have been to mandate the improvement, standardisation and professionalisation of data governance functions and data protection officer functions in Departments.  This is particularly significant given the critical role effective governance of information plays in compliance with the general data protection regulation, which comes into force in a little over 260 working days from today.<br/><br/>I will not dwell on the Bara ruling.  Mr. Kelleher will discuss that briefly, but suffice it to say that the interpretation of EU law has moved on and evolved.  Some of the assumptions that may have been made when this Bill was being formulated no longer apply.<br/><br/>The Bill represents a missed opportunity in its current form.  There is a host of aspects that Dr. Jennings has already alluded to, which I will not repeat.  Data sharing on foot of umbrella legislation is not compatible with the necessity and proportionality principles of EU law.  Clear statutory grounds should be created, and should be open to scrutiny.  If sharing is important, it should be open to discussion.  That is particularly true of large-scale bulk sharing of data.  The Bill requires much more detail to be introduced in terms of effective frameworks for data governance and appropriate standards.  The data sharing arrangements in the public sector need to provide protections equal to or greater than those already enjoyed by citizens since the Bara ruling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Kelleher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017052300002#C00300"><p>I will look at the compliance of the proposed heads of the Bill with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I will not go into the Bara ruling, given that the draft heads of the Bill are only being discussed now.  The GDPR will apply from 25 May next year so the reality is that this legislation will not be enacted before then.  I will look at this in the context of the forthcoming legislation and what it will have to comply with in the future.</p> <p>  I would suggest a number of changes, and I do not believe there will be any surprises in that regard.  Data sharing by the State requires a law.  The model used in the proposed heads is one of memorandums agreed between Departments.  Under the new GDPR, a law will be needed.  Some flexibility is allowed for different situations.  Members may hear reference to issues like recycling 41 and so forth, but there is a clear requirement under the GDPR that a law must be in place in that regard.  The best way to go about that is to have secondary legislation.</p> <p>  Members will see on slide 3 of my presentation a suggestion that the Government should move away from memorandums.  A statutory instrument would have to be made.  A Minister would have to make a decision that there was an objective public interest and legitimate aims that required the making of a statutory instrument.  Under the GDPR, that statutory instrument might have to set out general conditions, types of data, data subjects, disclosees, purpose and storage periods.  If the Government were to do that, it would have a very secure base for data processing.  It would be avoiding two risks in that regard, namely, the risk to data subjects and the risk that this expensive system would be set up but then finds it is not in compliance with data protection law.</p><p>It is very important to set up a secure process for data processing from the start.  In terms of the data to be processed in the system, it would be wise for the legislation to distinguish between data that is processed for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crime and more general purposes.  Quite different legal regimes apply to both sets of data.  It would be wise to split them out in the legislation.  If one shares data for a general purpose, one would not necessarily be able to use that personal data for the prevention, detection and investigation of crime.  It does not mean that one cannot share data for that purpose, rather that one would need a different framework for sharing it.  That will be quite important down the road in terms of what use is made of that data.</p><p> The sharing of comprehensive data sets is highly problematic.  One would have a concern about the excessive sharing of data, which is a major issue with regard to data processing.  The goal has to be data minimisation under the GDPR.  At the same time, the accuracy of personal data is an issue.  Citizens, data subjects, have the right to insist that their data is as accurate as possible.  If one does not want excessive data sharing, but wishes to ensure the accuracy of data across the public sector, I suggest the best way to go about achieving that is to set up a system whereby people in different departments can query the accuracy of data in a data set.  One does not move the entire data set from one Department to another, rather one just lets another Department query whether the data is accurate and correct in individual cases.  Under the case law review of the European Union, they have a very major concern about mass sharing of data sets.  On the other hand, if one looks at the recent case in Sweden, the EU is less concerned about very focused queries, where one is not sharing mass surveillance.  The Bill in some ways allows for that with the setting out of base data sets.  That is a model that perhaps could be built upon in terms of the legislation.  </p><p> In terms of information, Mr. Daragh O&rsquo;Brien, mentioned the Bara case.  In the Bara case, there was a query about the legal basis for the data which was transferred.  The model in Bara is quite similar to the model in this legislation.  The primary legislation was very high level, and the Romanian Government department of health agreed to share data underneath that very high level description using memorandums, which is quite similar to this model.  The European Court of Justice shut that down, saying it was illegal because the subject was not informed of what was going on.</p><p> What I suggest should change in the heads of the Bill to give a more secure legal basis is to have a statutory instrument allowing for that data sharing.  In addition, subjects are still entitled to information.  Under the new GDPR, some leeway is allowed, so one does not necessarily have to inform data subjects that his or her data is being transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the Department of Health if one can show that they are plainly disclosures that are expressly covered by law, as I am suggesting they should be, regarding the control of the subject's data and one provides appropriate measures to protect the subject's legitimate interests.  In addition to a legal basis, one needs what are termed appropriate measures.  If one looks at the other exceptions, it must allow for personal data to remain confidential subject to the obligation of professional secrecy.  We need to bring in those sorts of controls as well, if one wants to adopt this model of sharing on the basis of statutory instruments and when that sharing takes place there must be appropriate measures in place and there has to be professional secrecy protections. </p><p> Another area that needs to be looked at, and I think Dr. Jennings mentioned this at the start, is the idea of portals to enable subjects to access their data.  One of the major changes coming through the system with the new GDPR is that, at present, people effectively have a right to get a copy of their personal data.  For example, if a Member of the Oireachtas decided that he or she wanted to see the personal data that is processed by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, one writes and makes an access request, and the commission sends back a copy of the Member's data.  The GDPR actually goes beyond that where one has the right to get a copy of the data, the right to information about how the data is being processed as well as the right to access the data.  If one looks at the recitals, that means one has to provide remote access to a secure system which provides the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data.</p><p> It looks like that the GDPR will require that we build this sort of portal.  There is a whole range of security concerns about who gets access to that portal.  If one is building a portal that will allow me to access my personal data that is being processed by the State, my number one concern is to ensure that the only person accessing that information is me.  That was one of the major challenges coming down in terms of how the State governs data.  It will be very interesting and will be challenging to see how we will build that sort of system.</p><p> In terms of governance, one of the clear messages we are getting from the European Commission is that it wants to see a minimum of variation in how member states implement the GDPR.  There are many provisions in the GDPR that allow member states to adapt to their own purposes.  In terms of governance, it does not want to see variations and would query why there is a specific provision requiring data protection impact assessments.  Its preference would be to allow the governance provisions, which are very onerous and very complex to apply to processing personal data in the State directly without any variations of this implementing measure except for one of those instances that are specifically allowed in the GDPR.  There would need to be some variation there.</p><p> The last suggestion is the need to consider creating a specific offence of illegally accessing personal data that has been processed by the State.  As members will see, the Data Protection Commissioner has been very active in prosecuting people who have accessed it from outside.  There is provision under the new scheme of the data protection Bill for two offences and I think members should look into creating an offence specifically of wrongfully accessing personal data that is processed by the State.  That would create an incentive for members of the Civil Service and public service to say that if they do not have direct authority to process this data in this way, they would be committing a criminal offence.  That will push the decision down to individuals, so that when somebody is asked to process personal data in this particular way, he or she would ask if he or she has been given the authority to do that.  Obviously, an individual does not want to be put in a position of creating a criminal offence.  I do not know if members wish to go down that route.  There are a great many offences of illegally processing of personal data and illegal processing of data and I think members should look into the regime that applies and the controls that are applied to wrongful processing of personal data in the State.</p></speech>

We are trying to deal with the heads of Bill and I welcome the presentations that were given.</p> <p>  Would it be fair to say Dr. Jennings seemed to be concerned about the lack of safeguards for citizens?  If that is a fair assessment, what would be his main concerns in regard to the lack of safeguards in the Bill?</p> <p>  Mr. Daragh O'Brien talked about the cart being put before the horse and that the focus is on data sharing whereas the initial focus should be on governance and then looking at the scope and purpose of data sharing.  Will he expand on that point?</p> <p>  He also referred to the Bill as a missed opportunity because we have not learned from past experience.  Will he elaborate on what are those past experiences?  He spoke about a cross-functional approach with a promise of efficiencies delivered upon.  Can he give me some clarity on that?  He spoke about the definition of means, and that different organisations have different interpretations of means.  I assume he is speaking about people's income, their details and so on.  How would that be problematic in his view?  When he says that we need definitions to ensure clarity of meaning, will he give us other examples where there is a need for clarity of meanings?  He stated that some of the assumptions in the Bill no longer apply.  I know he had to go through his presentation quickly, but what assumptions were being talked about?</p> <p>  I have some understanding but I am curious about what Mr. Kelleher means when he states that data sharing requires a law, that it is not underpinned by law - he specifically referred to head 4 of the Bill.  That seems to be underpinned by the very fact that this Bill will be enacted and it refers to other Bills.  Will he clarify what he means by the phrase "underpinned by law"?</p></speech>

It is an administrative scheme.  I am not saying there would be no difficulty but essentially there would be less difficulty if one turned the memorandum into a statutory instrument.  There is a clear distinction to be made between a law and an administrative scheme.  I understand from where the difference originates.  Essentially, the GDPR is European legislation.  In many European civil law systems memoranda cannot be laws; therefore, they would have laws where, in many cases, we would simply have memoranda.  In a sense, the Irish legal system is disadvantaged by this in terms of data protection.  The European law requires that one process personal data on the basis of a legal obligation that must be set out in legislation.  In this case, a memorandum will not be adequate to provide that legal basis.  There must be a law, be it a statutory instrument or primary legislation, setting it out.  If one wishes to share data between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health, there must be legislation that allows for this.  In the example I give the legislation would be a statutory instrument.  There are other examples such as the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2013 where it is set out in primary legislation.  It enables the transfer of data between Departments.  A law is required as opposed to a memorandum.  It is an obligation under the GDPR which specifies that under Article 6(3) the processing of personal data by a Government Department must only be done on the basis of legislation.  I have provided a detailed memorandum for the committee.  Where I discuss head 4 I point out that the legal basis must be set down in member state law to which the controller would be subject.  A memorandum is not a law.</p></speech>

A number of matters fall from this automatically, one of which is identity in order that one can identify individuals across the system.  The second matter is authorisation; one has to authorise people to access data.  The third is authentication to make absolutely sure the authorised person is who they say they are and can access the data, that the individual whose data are being accessed also has that right and that any access is logged in order that the individual who owns the data can find out who has been using their data.  These are the components of a system that provides security, privacy and, most importantly, trust.  If the system is not based on trust, it will fall apart.  If the citizen does not trust the State or public service Departments to handle things properly and procedurally with the appropriate governance procedures, which is demonstrable by the type of infrastructure I am describing, there will be no trust and that will be a disaster.  One cannot have part of it.  One needs the set to ensure trust.  This is not new stuff.  Other nations have had such infrastructure in place for many years and built that trust.  There is no reason we cannot use those models to build our infrastructure with the same level of trust.</p></speech>

However, that is what the GDPR seems to expect, that a person will have a right to access his or her personal data, a right to see the purposes for which his or her data are being processed and so forth and a right to obtain a copy of his or her personal data, if required.

Before sharing happens, there must be a clear definition and standards to allow for commentator interchange.  The analogy I draw is taking a three-pin plug on holidays to France.  It does the same job, but it does not work in the other area.  In that context, governance models and frameworks become extremely important for interoperability.  Parts of the governance standards and frameworks are matters such as common definitions, common meanings and commonality in the understanding of different business rules.</p> <p>  I have experience in both private and public sector organisations.  I am constrained in what I can say about projects on which I have worked in the public sector owing to non-disclosure agreements; therefore, anything I say should be taken as hypothetical and based on experience.  Let us take as an example something as simple as income.  At a point in time the Revenue Commissioners will have a different view of what somebody's income is if he or she is self-employed based on what another organisation might require at a particular time because it might view income differently.  Likewise, the calculation of income from a particular scheme perspective might differ from one organisation to another because the nature of scheme A requires particular categories of social welfare payment to be included as income but scheme B might not require these categories to be so included.  What is required to enable sharing to happen is a transparent layer from a business process and governance perspective where these differences can be understood before the sharing happens rather than after it has happened and a decision has been made to the detriment of a citizen or, alternatively, his or her unjustified benefit.  There has been comment in the media on fraud versus error in the Department of Social Protection.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is quite clear that error represents the larger proportion compared to fraud and that it is down to the definition of standards and clarity of meaning in terminology within one Department which causes problems in terms of quality.</p><p> The Deputy asked for examples of previous failures.  We referred in our 2014 paper to REACH, which was three years late and two and a half times over budget.  It did not deliver on any of the substantive benefits it promised.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General identified, the cross-boundary governance of data flows became problematic when different budget holders were calling the shots and competing in that context.  I do not have the precise quote in front of me, but it is in the submission.</p><p> The sharing or processing of data in any public sector organisation can become problematic in the absence of the governance structures and rules that need to be in place.  There are rules in place to govern the use of phone interception in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to mention a topical example.  It appears from media commentary that those rules were not necessarily enforced in all cases.</p><p> This brings me back to the point made by Mr. Kelleher and Mr. Jennings about the difference between bulk sharing and query-by-query sharing on a base-by-case basis.  The governance model needs to have sanctions for abuses of the sharing regime when the scope of sharing has been broadened.  It also needs to define clearly who can do what, with what data, and when.  When we worked on the e-draft scheme of the Bill in 2014, we identified that there was no clear definition of what is meant by sharing.  Such a definition needs to be clearly set out and supported by effective governance with clear sanctions.</p><p> The only State agency I am aware of that has a statutory basis for doing anything to staff members or contractors who unlawfully disclose data that come into their possession in the course of their dealings with that agency's data is the Revenue Commissioners.  Under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, it is an offence to unlawfully disclose taxpayer information.  If the Department of Social Protection had an equivalent provision in legislation, more rigorous attention would be paid to who has access to what and to the logging of data.  We have already heard about the need for control in the context of a governance framework.</p><p> Ultimately, two levels of governance need to be considered.  The first level involves the standards and the communication for sharing.  There is a need to ensure everyone is sharing the right thing.  When a request is made for fruit to be shared between one Department and another, the Department that is expecting to get an apple must know that it will get an apple.  It must not wind up with a bag of oranges because that would be completely useless to it.  The second level involves the sharing that can take place internally.  When larger amounts of data are available to public servants, access to that data must be governed in an appropriate way with clear sanctions.</p></speech>

We need to think about cases in which information on vulnerable people, such as children, is spread among a number of institutions.  It is one type of data when it is spread among schools, but it is another type of data when it is taken into a central shared resource.  It is like an Excel spreadsheet or a customer relationship management system.  If someone with access to data of this nature does a search, he or she might be able to find a list of all the vulnerable children or pensioners in a particular area.  Suddenly a humdrum database for the administration of education or social services becomes a source of information which might be useful to someone who wants to exploit the people on that database.  It is important to understand that the sharing of data can change the characteristics of that data.  It is not just a matter of moving it from place to place.</p></speech>

This means much of the impetus in this regard will come from Europe.  The role of the Oireachtas and the Government will be to implement controls like the assessment of the impact of data protection and the appointment of data privacy officers.  Mr. O'Brien might have more to say about what those controls will look like.  They will be driven by the European legislation in a very real sense.  The Deputy also referred to the lack of penalties.  One of the reasons I wanted to flag the possibility of creating an offence was that it might increase the understanding of public servants who are asked to share data.  The advantage of creating an offence is not that it will necessarily lead to a whole load of prosecutions, but that it will give public servants who are asked to transfer or process data in a particular way the authority to say that the existence of a criminal offence in this sphere means they need clear instructions on how they should process that data.  The big benefit of creating an offence in this area is that it would empower public servants to raise questions about these activities.</p></speech>

It is not surprising that the heads of the Bill are vague.  It is really a drafting issue.  Obviously, the definition of "disclosure" would need to be drafted appropriately.  If we are to move to the statutory instrument model, we must bear in mind that the GDPR sets out requirements for what that statutory instrument needs to contain.  If the legislation is clear on the principles and policies that have to be followed by the Minister when making a statutory instrument in this area, and on what such an instrument needs to contain, many of the concerns in question will be addressed.</p></speech>

Things have moved on since then.  The Deputy asked about the definition of "disclosure".  When we reviewed the original scheme of the Bill for Digital Rights Ireland in 2014, we highlighted the lack of such a definition.  We identified three possible categories of sharing that might take place, with different levels of risk associated with each.  We proposed three possible definitions that could be used.  Since then, we have had the GDPR and the Bara ruling and there has been a shift in the public perception and awareness of the impact of data sharing.  It would be unfair to suggest we thought the Bill was fit for purpose in 2014 or 2015.  Today, we are concerned that it lacks governance controls and definitions.</p> <p>  Deputy Burke mentioned offences.  As Mr. Kelleher has correctly said, the GDPR takes care of offences and administrative sanctions at the organisational level, but there is a gaping hole at the level of the individual person being asked or put under pressure to do a thing.  If people in such circumstances had something to point to, they would be able to say that they will carry a personal liability at criminal or civil level if they do that thing without appropriate authorisation or control.  The only comparable model is the offence of unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information by a current or serving office of the Revenue Commissioners or a contractor who processes data on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  Something like that would be a valuable addition to the Bill.  As it stands, it would be remiss of me to say it is anywhere near being fit for purpose.</p></speech>

That is a general data protection regulation so it will apply to virtually all forms of data processing in the State outside the criminal justice area.  It is the overarching framework with which this legislation must comply.  There is the historic question of whether it was adequate in 2014 and so forth.  The main point about the legislation is that it must be updated to take account of the new legal environment it will encounter after next year.  That is the key point.</p></speech>

The more we learn about this subject and the more revealed in discussion of this Bill, the more concerned we are and the more concerned individuals will be.  I take the point in particular about governance rather than sharing being the problem.  The success of this or how it is done will depend on the infrastructure that underpins and the investment made therein.  Has anybody quantified how much would be necessary in order to make this work?  Do we have any comparable figures from other states where this has been implemented?  What are the thoughts of the witnesses with regard to resources on the public services card, for example?  Why did the figures for that rise from &euro;19.8 million to &euro;60 million?</p> <p>  We do not have a great track record in this country if we remember the likes of PPARS and many other systems.  I would say we have never got it right with any of the information management systems, whether it is PULSE, PPARS or others we could all mention.  How are we going to get it right and how much will it cost us?  Why, even with something as simple as an identity card, has the cost risen so much?</p></speech>

These are very complex matters, like any information technology, IT, project, internal or external.  This is an IT project under the Government's framework that is required to build an infrastructure across all Departments, with their existing proprietary and other systems.  It is truly enormously complex.  That is the case unless it is done in a way that is standardised and scalable so once there is a beginning in place, other Departments can simply adopt a set of rules and connect.  It is like the Internet or the web in that regard, with a set a rules that allow people to join and scale up, or else it will not work.  It will cost a fortune and not work.  The next time it is attempted, it will also cost a fortune and not work.<br/><br/>That is why this legislation or its replacement is really important, as it redefines the way we think about and access data, as well as privacy, with regard to the relationship between the State and the citizen.  That must be thought through at the macro, legal, Government, technical and semi-technical level, so it will work and we can implement components between two Departments for example.  If we demonstrate that it works, we can add a third Department.  If it is not scalable and all of this is <i>ad hoc</i>, it will cost a fortune again and again.<br/><br/>The best example, albeit in a different environment and so on, is Estonian.  Coming from the Soviet Union, it had all recognised functions of the State but not the budget for 1.2 million people.  It built a very structured, open and scalable system that allowed it to build what is considered the best infrastructure for the management of the relationship between the state and the citizen on the globe.  I had the opportunity to look at that, which is what helped me to write some of these principles, and I was very impressed.  What really impressed me is its neighbouring country, Finland, after years of <i>ad hoc</i>expenditure and costs, adopted and implemented the Estonian system, which was designed to be comprehensive from the ground up.  Not only have they the right sort of legal, policy, governance and technology basis in a scalable system that Estonia had, tailored to the Finnish needs while using the same technical infrastructure, but Finland can also share data - legally and appropriately - between the two States.<br/><br/>This is a dramatic example that I would commend to the committee and ask them to have a good look at.  I am not saying everything about the Estonian model is right or perfect.  For example, do not get involved with their e-voting system, as it is completely irrelevant to our complex system.</p></speech>

However, it is extremely impressive how they have built a scalable system.  We need to bring this from the flat manila file and the fingers with rubber caps to thumb through it to the online, accessible web and digital era.  It is a huge transformation and therefore we must think not in terms of sharing files but querying distributed files to get the relevant answers.  We can get down to categorising in law what queries are allowed so people can write a series of new queries; if they can pull data to answer a query - not keep the data - they can then do some further processing.  That is what I would look for with the replacement of this Bill.  It would be very empowering but very complex, as one cannot half do it.  We cannot do a bit and say it is grand because we have a national individual identifier.  We cannot have that unless there are other components, which are trust, security in access and so on.</p> <p>  I do not know how much it would cost but it would probably cost &euro;1 billion.  It would cost several billion euro over the next three, four, five or ten years if we do not do it in an incremental, scalable fashion.</p></speech>

I do not fully understand the requirements at this point.  However, what I can speak of in general terms is the root cause of cost overruns in data management projects.  The average cost to an organisation from poor quality information is between 10% and 30% of turnover.  This figure has been tested and communicated for the 20 years I have been doing this for a living.  My good friend, Dr. Tom Redmond, one of the world's leading experts in the field, puts the figure at 30% of turnover.  The root cause of the poor quality of information can be hidden information factories, people reworking data and people using data for different purposes etc.  A key root cause is a lack of clear and common definition and understanding of where data is different or means different things in different areas and contexts.  When people run a report or do an analysis, for example, it does not work and they must redo it.</p> <p>  I worked on a project in an EU institution in 2013 where the entire motivating force for the data governance programme was that the president of this organisation had been given three different figures for the same fact.  It concerned him that his smart people could not give him a consistent figure.  The root cause of systems like PPARS going horrendously over-budget was the assumption being made about the data and its meaning and structure.  When the HSE project teams went to implement PPARS, there was an assumption that there was a contract for nurses but when they drilled into it, there were 300 or 400 contracts for nurses, depending on the structures that were put in place.  That is why projects overrun.  It is ultimately about assumptions being made about data because of a lack of clarity of governance and communication about what the data means.  Data has wonderfully fluid powers as an asset in an organisation but one is it can mean different things to different people, depending on context.  In order to tame these issues and avoid problems in any project, organisations must move away from thinking of these as a technology project where there is a business requirement stated before somebody does a bit of programming and it works.  Professor Richard Mason of the University of Amsterdam developed a model in the 1990s looking at why between 70% and 80% of customer relationship management, CRM, programmes in private sector organisations failed.</p><p>CRM systems had a horrendous failure rate in the 1990s and early 2000s.  The root cause was that it was being treated as a business strategy with a technology component.  No one stopped to look at the definition, meaning and use of information.  When organisations realised that and started doing that bit, failure rates dropped, success rates improved and end-user and customer satisfaction with the outputs improved.  Going back to Mr. Kelleher's point about trust, the ability for people to trust what was happening with the data improved.</p></speech>

That is all very useful.  I am thinking of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the confusion about digital mapping and the introduction of different bits and pieces into existing systems that are not compatible, and the impact that has on the citizen in terms of delayed payments and so on.</p> <p>  I take what Mr. O'Brien said earlier about income streams being discounted in one area of social protection and allowed in another, school grants and so on.  The more he talks, the more of a quagmire I see.  As a committee, we need to slow this down and get it right as much as our scrutiny can allow in terms of comparables. </p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien referred to the need for open and scalable models so that trust can be built up.  It is crucial in the management of the relationship between the State and citizen.  It can be wonderful, and save a lot of time and prevent mistakes, such as in our health system, but it can also lead to a lot of destruction and distress for citizens.  I look forward to expanding on this even more.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.</p></speech>

That is a positive example in an Irish context.  I am here as a lawyer.  In legal terms, it will be very expensive to build systems like this and they will require a very robust legal basis.  If we are going to invest substantial amounts of money in building systems like this, it is logical to begin with the most secure and robust legal basis, and there has to be some form of legislation setting out how the system is going to work.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct.  The legislation before the computer age did not anticipate the Internet.  It does now, and that is the idea behind the GDPR.</p> <p>  The legislation can be criticised in various ways.  It is a very clever piece of legislation and does a very good job of addressing many of the issues raised in the modern digital world.  How it applies in practice will be known from May of next year.  It will be very interesting over the coming years to see how all of this will actually work in practice.  A very clever model for regulating the Internet, modern social media, profiling and so forth has been developed.  It addresses a lot of issues and it will be very interesting to see how it works.</p></speech>

One of the key elements of Revenue is that they have a very strong culture of guarding their powers over data and guarding the data over which it has powers incredibly carefully because, ultimately, everything it does, in particular in the self-assessment context, is based on trust.  If people stop trusting the taxman, there is a concern that will undermine the ability to use automated online systems and result in a return to the 1980s.  My father is ex-Revenue, and I remember Revenue audit work in the 1980s and the pressure people working in the public sector were under at that time.</p> <p>  In terms of whether the legislation is keeping pace with change, it is worth bearing in mind that European law is principles-based, rather than technology-based.  One word one will not find in the Data Protection Acts, the current directive or the GDPR is the word "computer".  It applies to physical and electronic records.  In that context, the legislation is keeping pace with change. </p> <p>  As Mr Kelleher said, the GDPR is a very clever piece of legislation because it creates some interesting governance requirements and structures and makes it an offence not have them in place.  That is a very strong evolutionary step in the legislation.</p> <p>  In the context of public sector data sharing, it is important that any legislative framework that is put forward to underpin that sort of sharing reflects the theme and ethos of principles-driven legislation within a very strong governance component, rather than focusing on a linear enabling of technology.  That is where we have found problems in the private sector with data sharing, the integration of datasets and introducing customer relationship management systems or integrating 11 different customer views.</p> <p>  One of the key learnings from the private sector is that there is no such thing as a single view of the customer.  There are different perceptions of the customer as they interact at a point in time.  How best to represent the relationship is the next challenge from an information management perspective in that context.</p> <p>  To speak to the Senator's question, the law will always lag behind to an extent, in terms of how it is enforced or supported.  From a European and Irish context, it is principles-based.  In the first instance, referring to the principles and doing what feels right in the context of the principles is usually a good rule of thumb. </p></speech>

The next issue that arises is whether practice is keeping up with change.  There was an old system of practice &ndash; one could call it data governance - namely, the system of manila folders, archives in each Department and a very strict set of rules about who could handle the files, how long they were to have them for and when they had to return them.  There was a system to manage how that information was used.  Branches, such as Department of Social Protection branches, were run under a particular framework.</p> <p>  We now find that there is no strong framework or digital equivalent of the manila folder.  There is no standard unit by which things happen.  There needs to be a framework to deal with that.  It is not just a legal issue.  Rather, it is very much a practical issue in terms of how the public service is administered, costs are managed and the trust of the public is maintained. </p></speech>

A person can put such information on a phone, a USB stick or whatever.  If one wanted to walk out with the records of 25,000 people 30 years ago, people would notice the filing cabinets were missing.  We need to at least get to a point where we have the ability to count the existence of filing cabinets in an electronic context, from a security and control perspective.</p></speech>

Is there a danger that regulation in the Internet age will lead to people abusing the principles-based system?

If there is any looseness in this, then Plato is right.  People will find a way of slipping through the cracks and abusing the system.

One cascades from principle to policy to procedure to evidence to enforcement.  Mr. Kelleher will forgive me for straying into his territory a little here.  The lesson we can learn from the banking sector is that in the absence of an evidence-based accountability system - the GDPR is brilliant because it has this John F. Kennedy sentence in it - it is the obligation of the data controller to be responsible for compliance with principles, and to be able to demonstrate compliance.  That little John F. Kennedy sentence, like saying that if we land a man on the Moon, we have to bring them back safely to the Earth, sets out a challenge in the second part.  That is where clear governance structures are essential in organisations, both public and private sector, for handling personal data.</p></speech>

Some were looking in on Thursday when we were asking various questions of our witnesses.  Data sharing in itself is possibly a very good thing if the rules and the governance are there.  We have all benefited from technology and the internet.  I would have been a beneficiary of Dr. Jennings as a student of University College Dublin, UCD, when the internet was only starting and one was still looking at exam results on walls and ringing people to find out what was happening.</p> <p>  Technology is a good thing but the message coming loud and clear from today, to summarise it, is that this particular Data-Sharing and Governance Bill is not fit for purpose as far as all the witnesses are concerned and that we should really just be sending it back to the Department and saying to improve its efforts and to address the concerns that we and the witnesses have.  I made points on Thursday and I am not going to repeat them all.  One wonders how things can happen.  If somebody wins EuroMillions, suddenly 60 or 70 people have just had a look at that person's file, because they were interested.  At least there was a record that people had done it.  How can 950,000 breath tests can just appear on a system without a record?  Maybe somebody somewhere knows.  Maybe a record exists and that will all come out.</p> <p>  Dr. Jennings referred to biometric security.  Are we talking about people in social welfare offices and so on having to provide their thumbprints before they can input or access systems all the time?  The greatest security is trust.  Unfortunately, Irish society has seen systems break down and not work the way we would have expected them to work, whether banking, or personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, or various other systems.  That undermines our capacity.  There are simple things like passenger information.  One could be looking at the bus and it could suddenly vanish.  It is as simple as that in one way.  That is data one relies on and then it is not reliable.</p></speech>

That is the job of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I think the message from all here is that it is not fit for purpose and not where it should be, and that the Department needs to address our concerns and the witnesses' concerns.</p></speech>

It is an honour to have him here and I thank him very much for attending.  The Commissioner is accompanied by Ms Vilija Sysaite, Mr. Marco Valletta, members of the Commissioner's cabinet, Mr. Gerry Kiely, head of the European Commission Representation in Ireland, and Ms Paola Colombo, director of DG SANTE, food and veterinary office.  Members of the health committee are joined by some members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Midday is an unusual time for our meeting, so we hope our other members will arrive.</p> <p>  I invite Commissioner Andriukaitis to make his opening statement.  We asked that he might address particular issues including EU procedures for the purchase of drugs and pharmaceuticals; arrangements for cross-border health care, particularly for Ireland in the aftermath of Brexit; medical research and developments in health care; and the EU Commission position on the uptake of vaccinations.  I understand the Commissioner may also speak about veterinary, agriculture and food matters.</p></speech>

Once again, we woke up to terrible news this morning.  My heart and my thoughts are with the victims of the Manchester attack.  We also think of the families of the victims in France.  It breaks our hearts.  It is very painful for all of us, but we will show our solidarity in the face of this terrible terror.  Once again, we will be ready to come together and show our solidarity, especially in such a turbulent time.</p> <p>  I am very happy to be in this House for a second time.  At the beginning of my mandate I started to visit national parliaments.  I achieved my goal of visiting all the capitals in two and a half years.  I visited all 28 member states, capitals, national parliaments and Governments.  I took the opportunity to have discussions with non-governmental organisations, industry, unions and youth organisations, and I am happy to say that today I understand much more in terms of what is happening on the ground.</p> <p>  It is a pleasure for me to be with the members today.  In two and a half years our work has been to promote jobs growth and Jean Claude Juncker's investment agenda.  In that respect, I would like to raise again the question of the economy, especially, I am sorry to say, the health economy.  I am very happy to have two portfolios, namely, public health issues and food safety, both of which help us to keep people as healthy as possible for as long as possible, guaranteeing the possibility to fight against risk factors, to reduce risk factors and to provide safe food.  It might be much better to provide more healthy food, but we will discuss today our options in that regard.</p> <p>  I started with three Ps - promotion, prevention and protection, and of course promoting good health by encouraging health communication and physical activities, as well as supporting healthy living and working conditions.</p><p>I remind members of the common obligation to prolong our average life spans by two years and to have the goal of healthy ageing.  Can one imagine achieving healthy ageing without the possibility of introducing evidence-based public health instruments and moving forward by keeping an eye on promotion, protection and prevention?  This is evident from the first slide.</p><p> On the second slide, it is very important to see the relevant instruments.  Today, the main risk factors are alcohol, tobacco, salt, sugar and trans fats.  Of course, there are mental health factors and anti-stress measures to be considered.  The slide refers to pricing policies and marketing policies and it alludes to how to reduce problems.  Availability and consumer information, especially product labelling, are instrumental.  It is a matter of how to provide evidence-based public awareness and school-based education.  All these instruments are in our hands.  I am very happy to learn, in having good debates with the members' Government, that it is providing such a Bill addressing alcohol and that it is making it possible to address childhood obesity and providing instruments to guarantee the possibility of fighting against tobacco.  We are happy to support Ireland and promote its activities to help it achieve its ambitious goals.</p><p> May I consider tobacco?  I know very well that Ireland is on the way towards fully transposing the tobacco products directive adopted in 2014, thanks to the Irish Presidency.  In 2013, the Irish Presidency was very successful.  There was keenness at that time to introduce a tobacco products directive.  Today, there is a good opportunity for member states to decide how best to introduce the directive into their law.  Ireland is championing this.  Timely transposition of the directive was achieved and ambitious tobacco control measures were taken on plain packaging.  I thank Ireland for this.  It is a really good example.  Today, three countries - France, the UK and Ireland - have introduced plain packaging.  We know very well that 21% of Irish people smoke, which is below the EU average of 26%.  Of course, it would be good to achieve much more.  I very much welcome Ireland's proactive approach, for which I am thankful.  I am ready to disseminate Ireland's good practices around all member states.</p><p> The second issue concerns obesity and alcohol.  I acknowledge Ireland has many problems with binge drinking among young people.  At age 15, some 16% of Irish boys and girls have been drunk at least once, with immediate negative health effects and a risk of future addiction.  I, therefore, welcome Ireland's continued commitment in this area, such as the action plan on youth drinking.  </p><p> We need a stronger approach to promote nutrition and physical activities.  Obesity is increasing across the EU, and Ireland is no exception.  More than one in three European schoolchildren are overweight or obese, putting them at great risk of type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases late in life.  Promoting healthy lifestyles and introducing preventive measures do not need to be expensive but they require political will.</p><p>Policy makers have an opportunity and responsibility to add important values in this respect.  I am a big fan of supporting all Ireland's steps in this direction.  Of course, I know very well that we had a good conversation with the Government about that to see how to move forward and achieve some new steps.</p><p> I draw attention to the health care system and sector.  Today, I know that Ireland is on the way to presenting new primary health care reform, drawing attention to possibilities to improve primary health care and to see primary health care colleagues as gatekeepers in this very important area.  Of course, the community-based approach is a very big one.  We provided information about health at a glance in all 27 member states.  Today, we are on the way to presenting a schematic of the analysis in the field of health and the state of health in the EU.  We will, together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, present such a report at the end of this year.  It will be very useful for members of parliaments to read those reports and see how to improve our national health care systems.  I know that the Oireachtas will see possibilities to strengthen financial management and also possibilities to introduce e-tools and use ICT platforms to encourage the health care system to be more efficient.</p><p> Our aim is to develop expertise on performance assessments of health systems, to build country-specific and cross-country knowledge to help inform policies at national and European level.  This is designed to inform and support and not to make recommendations because it is very clear that one must follow subsidiarity.  Subsidiarity is to allow member states to provide their own instruments, but we are ready to assist, help, advise and propose good practice examples from different countries.  This case is very important to draw attention to health technology assessment issues, because it is about access to more than treatment.  It is about possibilities to help people achieve effective treatment.  Also, as members of the committee know, it is also a possibility to co-operate in clinical trials, inviting researchers, industry and the pharmaceutical industry to gather and to see how to assess what innovation is, how it is caused, which economic and social consequences there are, which medical consequences there are, and how to see possibilities to achieve socially acceptable prices.</p><p> Pricing issues are very high on the agenda.  We know very well that health technologies today cost more and more money.  If one compares it to our phones, they are cheaper and cheaper.  On the other hand, our medical equipment has higher and higher costs.  How do we address those issues?  We know very well it puts pressure on our public finances and the resilience of health care systems.  We need to have a single way to co-operate, provide methodologies and to have instruments on how to assess those technologies and discuss issues about costs and economic effectiveness.  We need to have a permanent mechanism at EU level for health technology assessment.  As the members of the committee know, we have European Union co-operation on health technology assessment.  Ireland is very active here.  We see possibilities to move in such a direction and are ready to present our final results of the impact assessment at the end of this year.  We will elaborate at a gathering of all member states on a concept of a permanent mechanism of health technology assessment.</p><p>Today, we have joint actions from time to time, but this co-operation is not stable.  We need to move forward.  </p><p> Another very important issue is the cross-border health care directive.  I want to raise the possibility of using cross-border health care instruments.  All countries must have national contact points.  We all have problems with patient waiting lists and it would be good to raise awareness among patients.  Yesterday, I had a meeting with some doctors who raised questions about this and why more people did not know about the cross-border health care directive, which is in place.  The national contact points must provide information on, for example, how to reduce waiting lists by using the opportunities for treatment in different countries.  I can only see one way to do this and that is for countries to co-operate.  The European reference networks, which were launched in March this year, are a very good example.  Here in Ireland, there are European reference centres which belong to 24 pathologists.  It would be good use the tools and e-technologies available to encourage governments to provide more European financial instruments so that by the end of 2018 the European reference network is a workable network.</p><p> We need to use the connecting Europe facility money, Structural Funds, and Horizon 2020, all these different resources, to encourage countries to co-operate and to find opportunities to present virtual consultation, virtual possibilities to provide diagnoses and treatment, and to use e-prescriptions, patients records and patients images.  It is a very important area.  It would be good to do our best to fulfil our obligations in practice by 2019.  I am one of you - the members - and we are together in one team.  We have a good opportunity to build new ties from 2017 and to build more coherent European networks, thereby guaranteeing that people with rare and low prevalence diseases can achieve treatment in proper time.  This is very important.  </p><p> The next issue relates to the circular economy package.  This is about food waste, the agriculture sector and the possibility of introducing national action plans to tackle food waste.  I had a meeting with Irish activists, FoodCloud people and slow food activists, in Ballymaloe.  They are very active in the area of food waste.  We waste 88 million tonnes of edible food every year.</p><p>In Ireland, approximately 1 million tonnes of edible food is wasted every year.  It means we have a lot of problems in terms of reducing it.  Our target is to halve food waste to 45 million tonnes by 2030.  It is up to us but there are many possibilities to use our resources properly, feed our animals, provide food for those in need and, of course, to change regulations to reduce the regulatory burden and provide methodologies of how to measure food waste in all chains of food production.  We are ready to move forward in this direction because we have established the European Union Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste.  There is an obligation on us to measure and monitor food waste, provide guidelines to facilitate food donation, optimise safe use of food in feed and promote better understanding and use of date marking.  We established the EU food platform last autumn and in June, there will be a second round of the food waste platform and we will discuss these issues with all the operators and NGOs.   As the committee knows, we have obligations to achieve our sustainable development goals.</p><p> Let me stress a few points on a very important topic, which will be very high on the agenda here.  Yesterday, we had meetings with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and discussed these matters.  Animal and plant health issues will be big in light of Brexit.  We will have to deal with those questions because they are very complex and technical but we must find possibilities as to how to achieve a result.</p><p> As the committee knows, prevention is better than cure in this area.  This is also true in respect of human life.  We will be proactive in fighting crises and in implementation.  The new animal health law adopted at the end of March 2016 will bring significant improvements to the existing European Union animal health legislation, contributing to long-term competitive sustainability.  Implementation of the new law is a lengthy and complex task, requiring a series of Commission Acts detailing measures to better prevent and eradicate devastating animal diseases.  These acts will also support the use of modern technology in disease surveillance and detection.</p><p> We also have a new plant health law, which helps us to ensure we are best prepared to deal with future outbreaks of plant pest and also that our territory remains properly protected from the entry of non-native pests.  The new regulation will introduce more proactive rules for early detection and eradication and more tools and actions to allow the EU to adopt a more proactive policy against the entry of pests from other countries.  It will harmonise the rules concerning certification of plants and plant products and specify the responsibility of producers to the EU legislation authorisation.</p><p> We have many important topics on our agenda.  Health is a very difficult area in all political sectors.  It is very difficult to encourage member states to fulfil their obligations. The Lisbon treaty asked us to be very comprehensive and to have a more holistic approach.  It is very easy to use these words but it is very difficult to implement them in real life.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

As I said to you earlier today, we are in the process of developing a report on the future of our health service.  Our health service is quite fragmented.  It is very inefficient, with long waiting lists for procedures, long waiting lists for outpatients appointments and difficulty in accessing diagnostics.</p><p>We are trying to move to a different focus in our health service, from a focus on hospital-centred services to community and primary care-centred services.  We have looked at many European countries in terms of how they organise their health services and what their structures are.  We seem to be out of line in that we do not have a universal single-tier service.  In your experience across Europe, what is the effect of a universal single-tier service?</p></speech>

Finland decided to very actively combine its efforts in social care and health care, uniting its budgets, uniting its instruments and discussing how to guarantee community-based approaches at local level and how to create teams.  The patient is in the middle.  Secondary health care providers and management teams are at another level.  They use IT tools.  The Finns invested a lot in eHealth instruments.  They have joined social care budgets, local community instruments and budgets and health care budgets and have created community-based models and networks.  They are innovative and have pilot projects.  This required changes in the constitution, of course.  They decided to centralise slightly their health care facilities, especially at regional level because they have a lot of hospitals at community level.  They tried to go from community hospital care to primary care centres, which are community-based instruments, and of course to combine with regional hospitals.  This took three years and was very difficult.  They are now on their way to adopting final legislation.  I would happily recommend looking at the Finnish experience at the moment.</p> <p>  Spain and Germany, of course, are federal states, but in Spain there are also some states which have introduced community-based principles and methodologies.  Some countries, in central and eastern Europe, have so-called systematic connections between primary, secondary and tertiary care.  They innovate to improve IT instruments and platforms and eHealth instruments and this helps them to reduce the number of hospital beds.  Of course, it is very difficult and painful.  I mention centralising regional capacities, especially in tertiary, high-level specialised medicine and monitoring.  Only Finland decided to join social budgets and social instruments with health care budgets and it would be a good example to look at in more detail.  </p> <p>  We are ready to assist you and to analyse and provide information.  We would be more than happy to co-operate with you and to draw attention to some pilot projects that might help you achieve results.</p></speech>

Is there a big variation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#G00400"><p>Today we have mostly mixed models, which are all very much interconnected.  At the moment, there are five big classic models: the Bismarck model; the Beveridge model; the Mediterranean model; the Scandinavian model; and the central and eastern European financial model.  Some combine a state insurance composition with budgetary instruments.  Such mixed models are more successful.</p><p>Sometimes one hears about many social problems, with some social groups who cannot be insured.  In some areas, one must guarantee stable financial flow.  If there is no sustainability, there is no chance to monitor services.  I would draw the committee's attention to the Lithuanian model, which is an example of a successful mixed model and which was assessed by the World Health Organization/Europe.  The Finnish model is a very important step forward and it combines compositions from the insurance side and the budgetary side.  For a smaller country, it is much better to have a mixture and to see how to achieve better results.  This is because one can never be sure about the coverage of insurance or about the need to have the possibility of providing public financial flow in areas to guarantee sustainability.</p></speech>

It is good to see Commissioners touring member states.  There was a reluctance to do this some years ago but I am delighted to see it is a growing trend and long may that continue.  I have a few questions.  How does the Commissioner feel about the possibility of having an EU-wide health regime where basic fundamentals would apply in all countries?  This is the case in the United States, for instance, and I am not making a direct comparison, but there are some rules that apply across every state in the United States while others do not, thankfully.  How well could the Commissioner see something like that working?</p> <p>  My other question is on animal health and the issue of pharmaceutical residuals in animals.  To what extent has that been curtailed effectively?  Have we got to the stage where antibiotics are being carefully used that their use does not in any way jeopardise human health?  To what extent does the Commissioner see improvements taking place in that area, with the view to ensuring that Europe's animal health is the best globally?  Its traceability is, I presume, the best and will continue to be so.  Does the Commissioner see any threats to that?  </p> <p>  On the issue of human health, I notice that Ireland is about half way down the good side of most of the graphs the Commissioner showed us today.  How does he see the use of antibiotics and other medicines across Europe affecting people's health in the future?  Have adequate steps been taken to ensure that we do not have overprescribing or overdosing and that we not inherit the worst aspects of what can follow as a result?</p> <p>  The Commissioner also mentioned the environment, which is, of course, very important to all of us.  How does he see Europe marrying the objectives of high quality food production and attaining high quality health standards with complying with environmental requirements around greenhouse gases, etc.?  I do not want to ignite the debate, which can get quite flammable from time to time, but we all have to eat, no matter where we are.  Some people will always have dramatic responses, such as telling us to stop eating or stop producing food.  We cannot do that.   Does the Commissioner see the European Union reaching best practice in terms of the environmental balance?</p><p>The buying power of the Single Market has been mentioned at this committee on numerous occasions in respect of various drugs, both new drugs and existing drugs that have gone off patent under the eight-year patent rule.  Does the Commissioner see the European Union, across all the member states, getting the best value for money for these drugs and for new technology in the whole area of drug production?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#J00200"><p>Commissioner, there were five main topics there.  Perhaps you would like to start with the first one, which was the European-wide health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#J00300"><p>These five topics could take five hours to answer but I only have a few minutes.  First, I will address the question about the harmonisation of basics around the EU.  The Lisbon treaty was very clear on subsidiarity, that it was up to member states to decide on their health care and on the basic standards to be covered by national health care systems.  We do however have the cross-border health care directive and the European Court of Justice decision in the case of Kohll <i>v.</i>Luxemburg.  This was a very important decision on cross-border health care that ruled that the rights of patients to access treatment in different countries must be respected.  This helped us to start the cross-border health care directive.<br/><br/>The directive in turn raises questions as to how to reimburse services from one country to another.  If patients are going from Ireland to Lithuania this means that there must be a reimbursement agreement between the two countries.  Such principles of the reimbursement of basics are enshrined in the health care directive.  When we ask countries to dedicate some public money guaranteeing payments for patients going from one country to another, they must be ready to guarantee financial coverage of their costs.  <br/><br/>We have a very good example of cross-border health care directive co-operation between France and Belgium, which decided to adopt some areas in which cross-border health care is achievable.  They provide ID numbers to people in particular cities along the border in France who then have free access to go to the other side in Belgium and have medical treatment and services there.  This is then automatically entered into accounts for the national reimbursement system which are then calculated between France and Belgium without involving the patients.  This is a brilliant example of how IT tools such as electronic identification and signatures can be used in an absolutely secure manner to guarantee access to treatment.  This means that the countries involved have to discuss a lot of reimbursement compositions and issues and technically speaking this is very time-consuming.  They have done it however, and from 40 km either side of the border people are taking the opportunity to use each other's facilities.  This means that, step by step, we are moving closer and closer on some basics and on possibilities to understand different financial mechanisms which will provide some instruments to help us guarantee access to modern treatment.</p><p> A further issue concerns the European reference network.  If I am here in Dublin and have a very rare disease - there are now 6,000 diseases on our list - I have the possibility of being treated in Warsaw in Poland.  This means that we need common treatment technologies which will be acceptable to medical doctors and medical societies.  We then have to consider how we can guarantee payment from both sides.  As we move forward, step by step, we will see possibilities to destroy the silo mentality in every country and in this way achieve more and more in practical ways.  </p><p> The third question concerned cross-border health care threats.  It means pandemics and vaccines and, of course, possibilities to buy vaccines together and to harmonise countries' vaccination calendars.  Again, it means money.  Today there are more than 30 million people working in different countries with their families, which is very challenging.  For young families moving from Italy to Poland, for example, they have one vaccination calendar in Italy and another in Poland and their children fall in between.  We ask member states, say, France, to realise in practice how they can harmonise vaccination calendars so as to keep children vaccinated.  They are not citizens in the countries in question, but they are living there with their parents and need to be covered by vaccines.  I again ask Ministers of the member states to discuss vaccination calendars and how to move forward to avoid such silo mentalities.  In the Single Market we have common goods, common movement and a lot of infectious diseases.  If we are not ready to understand we are obliged to address these issues from Lisbon to Helsinki, it will be a disaster.  There are 4,000 cases of measles in Romania, for example.  There are also cases in Spain because the movement of people is very intensive; it is not like what it was 20 years ago when the Schengen agreement was not in place.  We need to change the silo mentality and step by step see more harmonisation.  This is not because it is legally binding but because of the reality in which we will address these issues together.</p><p> I will ask my team to say something about the position on animal health because they are very much involved in dealing with the matter.  The director of our food and veterinary department is Ms Paola Colombo.</p></speech>

We are in charge of auditing and inspecting the control system on food safety, animal health, plant health and also human health and medical devices.  We carry out these activities both in member states and non-EU countries.  The general position on animal health in Europe is quite good.  We also have some emergencies, but we are containing them very well.  </p> <p>  The Deputy's question was about the general use of antimicrobials.  I am a veterinarian and my view is that we are dealing with these issues very seriously.  At European level, we have legislation prohibiting the use of antibiotics as growth promoters.  We have on the table important legislation dealing with veterinary medicines and medicated animal feed.</p><p>This legislation is unfortunately not progressing as quickly as we had expected.  This is, however, probably the only missing link in effectively fighting antimicrobial resistance.  Overall, we are already very much ahead internationally compared to other trade partners in fighting antimicrobial resistance in animals and in the veterinary field.  We could do even better if this proposal were to be adopted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#L00200"><p>Let me add a little bit.  We have two guidelines on the proper use of antibiotics in the veterinary field.  Those guidelines are tabled.  Next, I do not know if we are finished or not but we are on the way to finishing guidelines on the proper use of veterinary  antibiotics in the human field.  It will be covered in a proposal to be made to all 28 member states.  Second, this new legislation requires that some antibiotics may only be used in humans.  This will reduce the use of antibiotics in the veterinary field.  We will see how to encourage our veterinarians and medical doctors to co-operate in understanding that some antibiotics must be dedicated solely to human treatment.</p> <p>  We also have big problems when dealing with out trade partners, the third countries, where residues of antibiotics in meat is the main challenge.  We will detect those residues, and if they are present we will reject those goods from the European Union market.  Of course we always raise questions about antimicrobial resistance and other treatment issues when we make bilateral deals with the US, China, Brazil or India.  It is always on our agenda.  Of course, it is a very difficult question.  We propose, for example, that our trade partners introduce common obligations to reduce use of antibiotics, hormones or growth-promoters in their food industries.  There has not been significant progress but it is on the table.  We will discuss those issues between the EU and Mercosur countries.  Of course the committee knows very well that our audits detected residues in pork in Brazil for example.  We do not allow Brazil to export pork to the EU because of ractopamine, which is banned is in the EU.  We will not allow Brazil to send such pork meat to the EU.  I have a lot of tensions and problems on my table in the area of residues.  When we speak about animal treatment, there are very strict rules about which animals are allowed in the food chain and which are not.  They must quarantine piglets for six months or more to guarantee that residues of medicines are not in animal blood.  We allow our control institutions to be very tough on those issues.  </p> <p>  The Deputy raised questions about food providers, food re-formulation and the possibilities to reduce food waste.  He also spoke about healthy food and how to change our behaviour and encourage people to eat more healthy food, not just safe food.  Sometimes we have very safe food but with a lot of sugar, salt, trans-fats, additives, different preservatives and flavourings.</p><p>Such products are good for staying on the shelf.  There is long chain of food production.  How can the food chain be reduced?  How do we guarantee the shortest journey from the farm to our tables?  How do we provide assistance to different operators to avoid such a production chain and deliver fresh food to our tables?  We also must look at food waste issues in those production chains and encourage the use of more fresh, healthy food, for example, through schemes for milk, fruit and vegetables.  Those schemes are a very good example.  They are financed by EU instruments.  Children in our schools have the right to have fresh vegetables, fruit, milk and milk products, using Structural Funds.  I encourage members to be active in those areas because public procurement rules will be changed to allow for effective actions in this area.  In the same line, we have a common voluntary agreement with our food industry to reduce the amount of sugar, salt and trans fats, but that is the industry's obligation.  We signed such an agreement in Amsterdam to reduce the number of those risk factors in our food during the Netherlands' presidency of the Council of the European Union.  </p><p> There was a question about new treatments and incentives to create new business models, especially in the area of rare diseases, new anti-microbials and new medical devices.  I am very happy that today we have good instruments in our hands in the innovative medicines initiative.  It has provided more than &euro;1 billion to industry, health researchers and clinicians to organise seven clusters.  They are dealing with rapid diagnostic tests.  This year, we awarded funding to an excellent diagnostic tool which helps to diagnose upper respiratory tract issues.  Using markers, it can determine whether they are caused by a virus or a microbe.  It is very effective.  If it achieves mass production, it will also be good for our primary care facilities as they will be able to immediately diagnose whether it is a virus or not and avoid prescribing unnecessary antibiotics.  It is a very excellent opportunity.  Of course we provide a lot of new incentives.  We started an initiative called adaptive pathways with the European Medicines Agency, EMA, to ease registration of new effective drugs, especially in the area of orphan diseases.  Have I covered all five issues?</p></speech>

I think you have covered them all, and in less than five hours too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#M00300"><p>I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his presentation.  Many of my questions follow on from those of Deputy Durkan.  I am a pharmacist by profession so my view might be a little bit skewed and biased.  I would like to follow on from the Commissioner's comments on antibiotics in pig meat.  For a long time I have had an issue with powdered antibiotics being put into feeds for chickens and pigs in Ireland, in what to my knowledge has been a fairly unregulated manner.  One of the issues I have is that oral medicines in Ireland, including oral antibiotics, are subject to a 0% rate of VAT while injectable medicines are subject to a 23% rate of VAT.  For me, there is something wrong when a product such as a bulk antibiotic is not subject to VAT but a vaccine is subject to 23% VAT.  I have inquired about it and I have been told that how we apply our VAT rate to products is decided at EU level.</p><p>Does the witness have any thoughts on that?  It seems to me bizarre that it is almost incentiving a product by not having VAT on it.  Perhaps I am looking at this from a naive perspective, but if there was VAT on oral or powdered antibiotics for bulk feeds, there would be a better method of tracking how much is being used.  If it was per kilo or whatever, one would be able to quantify how much is actually being used in the market.  Does the witness have any views on that?</p><p> The witness covered the antibiotic resistance issues quite well in response to Deputy Durkan's questions.  There is no need for me to repeat any of that.</p><p> I have a family member who is a vet and I was born in rural Ireland.  Therefore, I have quite an interest in agriculture.  Another thing I have an issue with in light of Brexit is hormone beef coming from Brazil and Argentina, which seem to be the main countries producing high-level hormone beef.  In light of Brexit, one of my concerns recently was that a UK supermarket had on its shelves only British beef.  One of my concerns is how to get a message to the public.  If a supermarket says that this beef is cheaper, to the consumer that is a good thing because naturally people do not want to spend as much money.  I have an issue with the fact that perhaps we are not getting out the message that just because it is cheaper does not mean it is as good.  There is a complete difference between hormone beef and the effect it has once ingested and assimilated and non-hormone beef.  Has the witness any plans for marketing to the consumer within the EU states that cheap is not always best?  Some of us know about this, but I think there is an issue in disseminating that information down to the person pushing the shopping trolley around the supermarket.</p><p> My second train of thought this morning is in regard to vaccination.  Again, the witness covered it very well.  It is something that is quite prevalent in Ireland at the moment.  We have a serious problem in Ireland with anti-vaccine groups with online agendas.  They are gaining a lot of momentum.  We had the ex-Dr. Wakefield from the UK touring Ireland recently with his anti-vaccine agenda.  It has caused a lot of damage.  I am sure the witness is aware of our falling vaccination rates, from about 95% for the MMR down to about 92% now.  We have a huge issue with our HPV vaccine rates in Ireland.  Can the witness, given the EU context, give us any advice on how to counteract that?  Are we in Ireland specifically exposed to this sort of "fake news", for want of a better term, or are other countries experiencing the same sort of negative campaigning against vaccines, which is clearly very serious?  I have said it here many times.  People on trolleys and waiting lists will be the least of our worries if there is a measles outbreak like there has been in Romania and in some of the Iberian area of Europe.</p><p> Regarding antibiotic resistance and the over-use of antibiotics, is the witness monitoring the excretion of antibiotics through urine, human or animal, into the water supply?  Is he monitoring what sort of levels we have?  In Ireland, we are all moving a little more towards rainwater harvesting.  We are trying to deal with our waste on our own site  Is the witness looking at the levels of antibiotics that are excreted by humans into our clean water supply?</p><p> It is the same with pork and chicken.  Are we making our consumers aware of the complete difference between a chicken that is pumped full of hormones or chlorine and a chicken that has not had that sort of a life?</p><p> To sum up, my questions are really about disseminating the information from an EU context to the person pushing the shopping trolley around the supermarket.  Has the witness any advice on how we can deal with the negative vaccine campaigns?  There is also the issue of the VAT rate on oral antibiotics.</p><p> With regard to orphan drugs, we have had a lot of difficulty in this country.  I do not think that anybody can deny that it is the issue coming down the track for us.  The witness knows as well as I do that the orphan drug issue was not relevant in the past because there was not the seed capital to get the research going initially.  However, people are now coming together globally, getting the data together and producing the orphan drugs.  States can be held to ransom to some extent for a very high-price drug.  Has the witness thought about this?  Has he any views on that  might be done to curtail the drug spend?  I understand Orkambi is going to cost this State &euro;300 million annually.  We have a unique relationship in this country with cystic fibrosis.  I am fully supportive of Orkambi being given.  However, if there were ten drugs like Orkambi, we would be in a very serious financial situation where the annual price of a drug could be the same price as building a hospital or whatever.  These are major pressures on Ireland's finances and obviously on European finances.  I ask the witness to give me a little bit of information on that.  If he does not have the answers here, I am willing to follow up for answers.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I am not aware of this situation but we can look into it and perhaps come back to the Deputy.</p> <p>  I will cover the second question as well on hormones and getting information to the consumer.

It will perhaps be more than likely available on the shelves in UK supermarkets.  Is that going to happen or do the witnesses know yet?  That is my concern.  Is hormone beef going to be located in the UK between Ireland and the rest of Europe?  I am aware that we do not have hormone beef in Europe.</p></speech>

In Europe, one of the things we do not question is the prohibition of using hormones in meat.  When we do our audits in countries like Brazil or Argentina, where this practice is authorised, to carefully check which guarantee they can offer us.  We allow the split system and a completely separate way of tracing back animals that have not been treated with hormones.  In Europe, I would be surprised if it was brought into question by any one.  It is a sort of a credo.  It is something we are no longer discussing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017052300002#O00800"><p>I will continue.</p><p>It is important that members listen to those who are directly responsible.  I hear many rumours that people can buy beef with hormones in the EU market.  That is fake news and it should not be disseminated.  There were big attacks against me when we discussed TTIP issues between the European Union and the United States.  Many NGOs opposed me and Commissioner Hogan because they were blaming us, saying we were ready to diminish our food safety standards.  Nothing will happen with food safety standards because they are clear.  The committee must understand we do not have a one-way approach but two ways.  I have pictures on my phone of restaurants in New York, for example.  We are not using beef laced with hormones, antibiotics or GMO feeds.  This is about EU standards which are acceptable in Brazil and the United States.  It means that we can be proud to say our food safety standards are being applied around the globe.  Producers are keen because consumer information is a much more powerful instrument.  We are sending our audit teams.  For example, we do not allow beef to be sent from Brazil, except from 20 establishments.  Beef from four of the biggest has been stopped because of food fraud.  We have figures and the volume of beef coming to Europe decreased very much in one month because of our restrictive measures.  Reference was made to chicken.  It will be good to once again assess the situation on the ground here because nobody can use antibiotics as growth promoters in the European Union.  It would be a disaster for producers.  It is a rumour.  We immediately send teams to carry out audits because it is against the law.  It is a big problem because there are legal consequences.</p><p> When members speak about AMR, I refer to veterinary medicine and medicated feed.  There are two Bills on the table at the Agriculture Council and I ask Ireland to be active on them because we need to finalise adoption between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.  The Commission's proposal is to stop the use of antibiotics in medicated feed because of the possibility of using antibiotics in feeding animals.  It means that only in treatment and only if there are indications from a veterinary point of view they should be used.  Beef with hormones is not allowed into the European Union and we will ask our services directorate to provide additional information.</p><p> On vaccination and the anti-vaccine movement, I encourage my colleagues, the medical doctors, to be ambassadors for vaccination and vaccinate themselves.  I vaccinate myself every year, together with Ministers.  Last year the Polish Minister and I vaccinated ourselves against influenza to set an example.</p><p>We are ready to do the same again and we disseminated photographs through social media and so on.  I have asked our scientists to be more vocal and to provide knowledge to all in society because there are so many rumours opposing vaccination.</p><p> The anti-vaccine movement use strange messages relating to autism, which are terrible.  They are responsible for the deaths of children in Spain, Romania and Berlin.  It is painful to understand that today we are not even in touching distance of a measles-free Europe.  Shame on us and shame on me.  I will do my best and ask all members to stay strong and come together to promote scientific-based arguments to all society, otherwise it will be a disaster.  We are, of course, using awareness campaigns with the WHO and Margaret Chan.  It is important to see how different countries behave.  Anti-vaccines in Brazil are weak because of the Zika virus, yellow fever and death.  Old people ask us to provide new vaccinations.  Brazil is measles free.</p><p> It was the same with ebola.  I was in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea when the ebola outbreak started.  People asked us to help and provide a vaccination but at that moment we had no tools.  We provided money and today we have vaccination.  We dedicated &euro;46 million to create vaccines against Zika.</p><p> Reference was made to antimicrobials in water, which is an important issue.  We are in the final stages before presenting a new action plan.  We have taken a topic about the environmental composition of monitoring of antibiotics.  Nobody knows how many people use antibiotics in Dublin and monitors residuals to see which are going out.  No one is controlling the antimicrobials in sewage and water and we have no understanding.</p><p> There are problems in big cities not only because of animals but because of people using antibiotics.  There is a concentration of large farms, factories, hospitals, and cities and we must draw attention to water, sewage, the environment and how to detect situations.  We establish a so-called consortium of laboratories.  More than 30 laboratories have joined up and we asked them to monitor soil, water and environmental issues and to report the picture to us because at the moment we have no clear evidence.  We have enshrined it in our new action plan and we have asked the European Environment Agency to be responsible for creating a monitoring system for water, soil and the environment.  Big harbours and airports also have AMR bacteria.  We must control ways of transmission, otherwise it will be a disaster because the EU is open, particularly in respect of trade.  We need a system of monitoring ways of transmission and the Deputy's points are high on the agenda.</p><p> Orphan drugs is another issue.  Today we have many instruments.</p><p>As the committee will know, there is paediatric medicines regulation which helps us to introduce more business models to help the industry to provide new treatments.  Why?  Let us say there are 10,000 people suffering from very rare diseases.  Can one imagine how many industries would be keen to produce medicines if there were no market incentives or strategy?  The provision of innovative medicine initiatives incentivises industries to join forces with academia and clinicians.  There are more than 400 hospitals that deal with rare diseases.  The instruments encourage the establishment of consortiums.<br/><br/>It is important to draw attention to pricing.  In stimulating smaller countries one can get them to sign and use and put money into joint procurement agreements to use scale of economy to buy orphan medicines together.  More than 18 countries are ready to co-operate, especially in the area of hormone treated beef, HTB, and vaccination in which we have found success.  We have a very detailed plan to help them to use joint procurement agreements to buy modern vaccines.  Of course, they are very costly and it is especially very difficult to tackle hepatitis C, but we will use our resources in only one way.  We need to encourage countries to work together because scale of economy helps to reduce prices.  Cyprus, Malta and Lithuania have no chance of covering all of the costs involved.  There is, therefore, only one way to succeed.  Ireland must co-operate with other countries in that regard.  Today we have a strange picture.  There are 28 markets, which is fruitful for the industry.  Interestingly, having one single market is much more powerful when there is <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. </i>One can play the game and make a profit.  My advice to everyone is, please, co-operate.  We are ready to help Ireland.  We can teach it how to deal with the industry because we can advise from our side.  Countries, especially smaller ones, need to work together.  For me, the answer is crystal clear.</p></speech>

I know that it is a great challenge to deal with health care issues across the European Union because there are various traditions and ways of dealing with issues.  I wish to talk about a cross-border health care issue.  I was a Member of the European Parliament from 2007 to 2009.  I headed up the European People's Party group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.  I am, therefore, very familiar with this topic and I am greatly concerned about Brexit.  There is cross-border health care provision between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Our biggest issue when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union will be trying to build the same connections with other countries in Europe.  Has this issue been considered?  As Dr. Andriukaitis is a heart surgeon, he will know that every year more and more there is sub-specialisation.  It applies no matter what area of medicine one considers, whether it be orthopaedics or heart surgery.  Has this issue been assessed to see how we can improve co-ordination in accessing health services, especially for those in smaller countries with rare medical conditions?</p><p>In smaller countries it is unviable to have someone that has sub-specialised.  Let us say four people have a particular complaint in this country and, therefore, it would be unfeasible for the expert to operate out of Ireland.</p><p> I wish to talk about co-ordinated medical training.  Ireland is very much tied to the UK in terms of medical training.  The UK has been very dominant in terms of medical training in, for example, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Sudan.  As a result a number of doctors from those countries work here because their medical training is very much tied to the UK model.  Has a unified medical code and training process in Europe been considered?</p><p> I wish to discuss the European Union's working time directive.  I have received complaints from medical practitioners, particularly from those who work in hospitals.  As much as 90% of trainee doctors comply with the working time directive.  Many of them have complained that they have not gained the expertise that they require as a result.  Let us say a person starts his or her shift at 8 p.m.  He or she will be busy for the first three or four hours but he or she will not gain experience in the remaining hours.  The hours must also be worked over a shorter period.  Four or five years ago people worked 60 or 70 hours a week but might literally not work in real terms.  They were a presence in hospitals but they did not have real work due to everything being in order.  What is Dr. Andriukaitis's understanding of the working time directive in EU countries?  How do trainee doctors acquire the necessary skills if they do not put in the hours?  </p><p> I would like to discuss co-ordinated research.  As much as 70% of the people who conduct research, especially people from outside of the European Union, end up working in the US.  Europe does not seem to have a co-ordinated approach to medical research.  The 28 member states should get their own people to conduct research and bring in external experts.  We allow an awful lot of research to be based in the US and, in turn, the US dictates the market and everything else.  Has this matter been considered?  </p><p> I wish to comment on the final topic mentioned by Dr. Andriukaitis.  Are we likely to see countries, especially smaller ones, grouping together to get cheaper prices for drugs?  Will such a policy be implemented fairly fast?  Larger countries like Germany and France are well able to negotiate better prices with the big pharma companies.  Smaller countries, like Dr. Andriukaitis's home country of Lithuania, Ireland and other smaller countries do not have the same bargaining position.    </p></speech>

I agree with what the Senator has said.  We will need to share common themes and have concrete discussions because I worry about Brexit issues.</p><p>Today, frankly, nobody knows what the reality will be because the reality is not on the ground.  Nobody knows what the concept will be on the UK side.  If it will be a hard Brexit, there will be one tactic from our side.  We need to address the issue, but I cannot imagine the possibility without a transitional period.  In my portfolio I have many problems and many questions but there are no answers at present.</p><p> Animal health was mentioned.  Today, Ireland and Northern Ireland are one island.  People are producing on one side, processing on the other and then selling into the UK.  Can one imagine a hard Brexit with customs and so forth?  I do not know how to deal with food safety standards because it is up to the UK to say which standard it will keep on its market.  At present, there are the same standards.  It is the same when speaking about the cross-border health care directive.  It helps us.  We will address how to do it.  On one side we will see how to help Ireland achieve treatments in our European centres more frequently.  The UK is very close and language, culture and tradition all play a role.  We know that very well.  We must have the discussions in this way.  Of course, I will be more than happy to communicate with the committee.  If some problems start we will see all the hot potatoes on the table and we can look at them together.  The main teams must be the same teams.  I, Dublin and Brussels must be one team.  Otherwise, there is no way.</p><p> On the other hand, we have a good opportunity to trigger and push possibilities to use European reference networks.  We must encourage countries to use the Connecting Europe Facility instrument, building IT infrastructure in reality and workability between hospitals and around all 27 member states to guarantee tele-medicine, guaranteeing immediate treatment, advice, consultations, virtual debates, virtual clinical assessment and possibilities to keep people here but consulting from different angles.  It means the Connecting Europe Facility must be on the agenda.  We need to build a workable infrastructure with IT platforms, connectors, communicators, the same electronic signatures, patient registries and data.  We need to have those issues in 2019.  This is 2017.  A lot of people in governments do not understand what this will mean, I am sorry to say, but we will address those issues only in this way - on the one hand strengthening links between Ireland and the Continent and on the other dealing with the UK in a more proper way together.  However, all things will be clear after June when the new parliament will be elected in the UK.  Then we will see their concept of the positions.  Politically, today we hear a great deal about hard Brexit, but nobody knows.  However, then we will start to do practical things immediately, addressing the issues together.</p><p> About training problems, the member's idea is excellent.  First, I wish to draw attention to the lack of medical doctors in primary care.  There is a need for 6 million doctors at present.  There is a deficit of 6 million doctors.</p><p>Second, the average age of primary care medical doctors is 57 years is one country and 62 years in another.  After five years, they will be retired.  Who will replace them?  It is nobody's care.  It is like a slow tsunami.  There is a deficit of 13 million nurses. </p><p> People refer to Pakistan and elsewhere.  The richest countries are playing a game and one sees a real mess in different countries.  There is training, of course.  The country which is the best has five high schools which are able to produce excellent nurses with good experience.  The nurses are very welcome in countries but it is a budgetary cost.  On the other hand we will ask member states if it is possible to co-operate on training issues and to understand that health care workforce planning, recruitment and retainment issues must be discussed at Council level.  I am so unhappy that we are so involved in our national problems while the tsunami is around us.  Of course, e-health is another matter to address immediately but shortages of staff cannot be addressed immediately because six, nine and 11 years of education are required, followed by training.</p><p> I agree that it is a painful topic, but mainly it is in the hands of member states, and mainly it is up to subsidiarity.  We will only have joint action by discussing health care workforce planning, training and of course the working time directive.  However, that is not in my hands.  Commissioner Marianne Thyssen is responsible for the working time directive.  I am not deeply involved in those questions.  Generally, however, our medical staff are exempt from that directive.  The working time directive does not apply to medical doctors and nurses generally, but I do not know the details.  I have to ask my colleagues from the DG for Employment, Social Affairs &amp;amp; Inclusion.  It is not in my hands.  Perhaps I will send the committee a written reply on the working time directive because I am not sure.  Generally, I know it does not cover medical doctors.</p><p> On the matter of research co-ordination, I see big possibilities and opportunities if we join our research technology development, DG RTD, with DG GROW, DG SANTE and DG ENV and if we are capable of establishing the Digital Single Market, invest in infrastructure, build possibilities to have big data and invite our research consultants, our industries and our countries to pool resources and guarantee venture capital for our research.  We must have a sustainable economic model for the development of research clusters that will be very compatible.  Otherwise, the United States is in a much better position.  It has excellent financial possibilities.  Venture capital instruments are developed at a very high level in the United States.</p><p>We lack incentives and venture capital.  Of course, the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, has a role in the risk management of projects to be leveraged between private and public capital.  The EFSI is a really brilliant instrument.  Once again, we need to know the worth of co-operation, co-ordination and responsibility, which are not empty words.  Today all are ready to sign memorandums on co-operation and co-ordination, but it is true that nobody likes to be co-ordinated.</p></speech>

It is probably the most sensitive issue in medicine and it has a knock on effect on the level of out-of-hours cover.  We are now proposing to build a health service which will be built on the foundation of primary and community care, but we will have significant difficulties in populating these services because there is such a shortage of primary care professionals, GPs, nurses and therapists.  It is a significant problem that many governments do not recognise, even though they want to transfer to a more community based system.  They have no realisation of the shortage of personnel.</p></speech>

Also if graduates from rural areas were identified and given opportunities to train to gain particular expertise required when working in rural areas, that would give a much better return than a general education and hoping for the best.</p> <p>  Will the Commissioner comment on the social determinants of health?  We concentrate on medicine, but there are so many social determinants such as education, housing and transport which feed into the health of a society.  How are they being addressed across Europe?</p></speech>

During times of austerity there are cuts, especially in public instruments, because the approach of accountants is to cut.  Only approximately 3% of public spending in all 27 member states is dedicated to addressing social determinants.  At a glance that shows that the difference in the level of access of low income and higher income groups to health care has been growing in the past five years.  The same applies when encouraging counties to use Structural Funds to invest in the public sphere to address social determinants.  Countries are mainly investing in road provision.</p><p>It is an excellent example of countries using Structural Funds on big buildings and big roads, and the reason is very simple.  One needs to understand how difficult it is to join small actors, especially to build social industry, which are capable of addressing social determinants.  One needs experts and the political will to build some clusters or platforms which invite small actors to stay and to apply for Structural Funds and to use those funds in a more effective way to solve problems related to social determinants.  Such social determinants are in real territories, in rural communities and smaller cities and regions which are depressed because of austerity and the destruction of industry in those countries.  One sees a strange picture.  It is much easier to invest in road infrastructure than solve social problems.  It is more difficult to achieve progress, but we have social instruments at EU level.  Translating it into real action is very difficult, however.  Social determinants are a major and painful issue for all of us.</p><p> The Michael Marmot report is an excellent report.  Every member has a chance to read it and I ask the Parliament and the Government to consider what action is needed on the ground on how to use the Social Funds and Structural Funds to address social determinants.  Otherwise one has no chance because there is not enough national public money.</p></speech>

We have difficulty in drawing down funds from Europe on the balance sheet and also off the balance sheet.  We are limited in the amount of funds we can draw from Europe in relation to our housing crisis because of fiscal rules which mean the funds have to be included on the balance sheet.

The Commissioners responsible for energy union, Commissioners Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and Miguel Arias Ca&ntilde;ete, speak a great deal about housing and the energy efficiency of houses, and it would be good to discuss those issues with other member states.  With the help of the European Investment Bank, it should be possible to use such European advice when discussing issues together.  We have a health programme but it deals with behavioural issues such as consumption of tobacco, alcohol, drug users and so on.  I would be happy to activate a discussion on social determinants.</p></speech>

Discussion is centring on advance directives and how people want to be managed in their later years because medical technology has moved on to such an extent that people can be over-treated and almost heroic efforts can be made to keep them alive.

We briefly touch on the specific matters which are under consideration by the committee.</p> <p>  On the matter of problems caused by casualisation of work, the University of Limerick, UL, report found the existence of zero hours work operationalised through if-and-when contracts.  These contracts provide no guaranteed hours of work and workers have a contractual right to accept or refuse work offered.  The key difficulties of if-and-when contracts for workers are an unpredictable number of working hours, unpredictable scheduling of hours, variable income, difficulties making care arrangements and a need for State income supports.  International academic research identifies similar outcomes for workers in casualised work.  We welcome efforts to provide more certainty to workers about their hours.</p> <p>  There is a critical legal issue concerning if-and-when contracts which requires policy action largely centred around if-and-when clauses in these contracts.  There is no mutuality of obligation between employers and workers on if-and-when contracts, thus these workers are not legally defined as employees.  This means that they do not have rights under most employment legislation, including the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  Employment status is a key difference between those on if-and-when contracts and those on zero-hour contracts as defined by the Act.  The UL report found evidence of people working under if-and-when contracts on a zero hours basis who have no protection under working time legislation, but little evidence of people working on a zero hours basis under contracts of employment, that is, as employees, who do have rights under the Act.  We note that International Labour Organization Recommendation 198 states that national policy should provide guidance on effectively establishing the existence of an employment relationship.  The Bill proposes to cover "workers" and this requires further discussion.</p> <p>  A second critical legal issue arises in relation to continuity of employment.  Some employment laws, such as those on unfair dismissals and redundancy, stipulate employee service requirements.  Similarly, the Bill proposes rights for a worker with no less than six months' continuous employment.  However, there can be difficulties in identifying when someone in a zero hours job has started his or her employment as his or her work can be intermittent.  Therefore, the issue of calculating continuous employment for someone doing zero hours work should be addressed.</p> <p>  On the matter of whether zero-hour contracts should be banned, we emphasise here that the term zero hours work should be used rather than zero-hour contracts.  Zero-hour contracts of employment are legislated for already but they have been narrowly defined and working time legislation does not cover the wider practice of zero hours work, that is, if-and-when contracts.  A simple so-called "ban" on zero hours work alone would not solve the problems experienced by workers.  For example, hypothetically, an employer who gives a worker just one guaranteed hour a week would satisfy a "ban" on zero hours work.  Additional regulations on working hours would be required to actualise a real ban on zero hours work.</p> <p>  On the matter of administrative implications of the Bill, any legislation which has regulations on working hours may result in some administrative responsibilities but employers are already required to have pay and hours records.  We suggest consideration be given to the Bill making exception for working hours arrangements made in employment regulation orders, sectoral employment orders and registered employment agreements.</p> <p>  On the fourth matter, should workers on low and zero-hour contracts be allowed a minimum set of hours and the right to request more hours, we should distinguish here between contracts.  A low hours contract has no universal meaning and could refer to a regular part-time contract where people have guaranteed hours.  For if-and-when contracts, the absence of guaranteed hours places workers in a legally precarious situation.</p> <p>  There are two questions concerning a request for more hours: should people be allowed the right to request more hours than is in their contract and should people be allowed the right to request more hours than they actually work?  This distinction is necessary because those on if-and-when contracts may work regular hours but this may not be reflected in their contracts and there are examples of this in Labour Court cases.  The UL report recommended those doing zero hours work should have guaranteed contractual hours based on the reality of hours worked.  A right to request more hours than actually worked may be seen as beneficial to those who are underemployed and the EC directive on part-time work noted that employers should give consideration to requests by workers to transfer from part-time to full-time work or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise.</p> <p>  In regard to whether the Low Pay Commission should review proposals on banded hours contracts for those on low pay, we are not clear on what is being suggested here exactly.  There is an argument that setting minimum wages should go hand in hand with examining hours but the Low Pay Commission would require sufficient data on working hours and banded hours if it had some remit in this regard.</p> <p>  We note other points on the Bill.  These are that the Bill does not contain anti-victimisation or compensatory measures, and it does not seem to provide for the option of mediation in the Workplace Relations Commission following a complaint, as per the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p></speech>

One was to look at the quantitative side and to conduct interviews with stakeholders.  We would very much like to have done a national survey if it was at all possible, but it was not possible in the six-month timeframe that we were given.</p> <p>  We mentioned in the report that there are difficulties in terms of there being no national data currently collected on how many do zero hours work.  That is an important point because even if we had started collecting data at the very beginning of our research, we would not have found the problem of zero hours work.  The experience is similar in the UK where significant numbers of people are now seen to be on zero-hour contracts.</p><p>The big increases have been partly explained by the statistics office in the UK by the fact that people did not realise they were on zero-hour contracts until media attention focused on them. There would have been problems even from the beginning with us asking people if they were on a zero-hour contract.  It would not have captured the level of zero hours work that occurs.  A particular feature of zero-hours work internationally is that there is a variable element to the working hours and we looked at data on that.  In terms of zero-hours work, we conducted interviews with 82 representatives across civil society organisations and trade unions.  The civil society organisations, which represented the unemployed, migrants, women and the youth, as well as the trade unions all expressed significant concern about the use of zero-hours work through if-and-when contracts.  We have examples of contracts from different types of companies which show that the use of if-and-when contracts is a problem.</p></speech>

If one considers the trends in non-standard work, some of them started before the recession.  For example, increases in the incidence of part-time work started before the recession.  In the case of reduction in working hours, accommodation and restaurants have seen the biggest drop in working hours since the early 1990s, but most of that drop happened before the recession.</p></speech>

On initial reading of the Bill as drafted I thought it would have given some rights to everybody in terms of requesting hours, but I understand from previous committee debates and reading the sponsoring Deputy's Bill that this was not the intention of the Bill and that it was meant for people who have a difference between the reality of work and their contract.  There are other measures in it where issues could be clarified.  The biggest one, which is related to the opening statement, is trying to clarify who it is protecting.  That is the initial definition of the worker, which is extremely important.  Unless the issue of employment status is tackled comprehensively, it might have only limited applicability to certain types of workers.</p></speech>

The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill recommends banded contracts.  It recommends six or seven bands.  Do the witnesses have a view on how many bands would be useful?  They may or may not know that the draft legislation the Government is working on recommends just three bands.  Do they see any advantages or disadvantages either way in that regard?</p></speech>

We noted in our report that the optimal way to sort out working hours arrangements is through collective agreements.  That is always generally preferable to legislation.  In the absence of those there will be complexities with having one-size-fits-all employment legislation.  There might be some businesses that the bands suit and others where they would not.  The important issues are that people are getting hours in which they are working and that the employment status issue is corrected.  If legislation is introduced where there is a focus on the bands rather than on who it is protecting, I would anticipate a significant number of legal cases down the road where there is a question over who it is protecting, regardless of the number of bands.  We are then leaving it to the courts, perhaps, to try to interpret who is being protected.  We are concerned that, regardless of the bands, if-and-when workers might not be protected.</p></speech>

It is the definition under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and Dr. O'Sullivan has articulated that.  However, the UK has introduced the intermediate category of worker under its 1996 Act.  It has not made life easier in terms of the status of workers or the legislation.  In fact, it has complicated it.  There is a swathe of cases at present to try and determine where people fit, whether they are independent contractors, workers or employees.  One finds in some cases that they are both workers and employees.  We must examine the status issue because it is fundamental.  As Dr. O'Sullivan said, the issue is who it is going to protect, before one gets to the bands.  If we do not examine that intermediate category and the effect it has had in the UK, in particular, given that the UK has a similar common law system to ours and similar interpretations of it, we could be creating a set of negative unintended consequences.  We must be careful.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  I also found the report they produced very useful when researching the problem in this area.  The report states that zero-hour contracts are unusually prevalent and widely used.  However, if-and-when contracts obviously are too and there is an urgent need to address this.  That is what the Bill is intended to do.  We all have been visited in our constituency offices over the years by people who are on either zero-hour or if-and-when contracts.  They do not have any stability around their working time so they do not know what hours they will be working in the following week.  It prevents them from planning their daily activities and their household budgets, getting loans from the credit union or applying for loans or mortgages.  The Bill put forward by Deputy Cullinane is important and I welcome Dr. O'Sullivan's comment that she agrees the Bill is an attempt to deal with the reality of work and those contracts.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact they have identified three areas where they believe this is problematic, did they get a sense of the extent to which this is operating across our economy and of how many workers might be affected?

The collection of that information on an ongoing basis is one of the things we believe should happen.  It is highly problematic, first, because people might not realise that they are on those types of contracts, second, because people might have been working regular hours for a number of years and still not realise that they are on an if-and-when contract, regardless of the number of hours they are working regularly, and, third, because Ireland has a narrow definition of zero-hour contracts.  What we call a zero-hour contract and an if-and-when contract are together what the UK calls a zero-hour contract.  The practice we are seeing is the same as what is in the UK in terms of the types of contracts.  That is an issue.</p> <p>  The interviewees from the civil society organisations and the trade unions expressed concern about the hospitality sector, in particular, and certain services in health, such as care work.  We also have copies of templates for contracts given by particular employer organisations which provide an example to employers of how to construct an if-and-when contract.</p><p>We see it as an indication of some of the guidance that might be given.  It is not possible to quantify it other than to say the people on the ground who are representing these people say it is an issue. </p></speech>

May I offer her an opportunity to reply to the criticism levelled against her report by some of the other presenters that it exceeded the terms of reference which were given in writing?  I am interested in Dr. O'Sullivan's comment on that.</p> <p>  Some of the larger employers - some of whom were invited to present to the committee but declined - have concluded agreements with their staff on the issues.

The Department was keen to get a picture of what was going on in the country.  It was the first study so there was a total lack of knowledge in the area beforehand.  The first thing we did as researchers was to try to define what are zero hour contracts.  One definition is in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  When one looks at the international experience of zero hour contracts, what we are talking about is zero hour work.  It would have been irresponsible of us to look at one particular type of contract and not the reality of what is zero hour work.  The intention of the study by the Department was to see if there was a problem in the area and whether protections should be extended to groups of people or not.  What we are looking at when we talk about zero hour work is to what extent the work is precarious.  Precarious work is work where there is a lack of income security, job security and where one has a lack of control over one's work.  When looking at zero hour work, to look at just the narrow definition contained in the Organisation of Working Time Act would really only have been half a report because we would have ignored the people who are living the reality of zero hour work.<br/><br/>We also tried to look at why this work is happening.  It is happening because of the narrow definition of zero hour contracts in the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Employers have said in the interviews and report that it is costly for them to produce zero hour contracts because there is compensation attached to it.  That is one of the motivating factors for formulating zero hour work under a different name.  As the first national study, we tried to do that.  We made a series of recommendations which would continue that work in terms of data collection.  <br/><br/>We understand there are agreements with some larger employers particularly in retail but there has not been any significant national study yet on how they are progressing.  There are pros and cons of having banded hour agreements.  To focus on just one particular type of employer and one particular type of sector would take away from the picture of other people doing zero hour work.  They have benefits and are one of the types of good practice, which have been used by other companies, that we recommended at the end of our report.<font color="#FF22FF"> </font>Banded hour contracts are a preferable form of working to zero hour contracts, in which there is very little balance between the flexibility of an employer and that of a worker.  Banded hour contracts give an element of predictability to workers.  It is the cause of all the problems for people doing zero hour work.</p></speech>

I am particularly focusing on examples such as a post office in Castletownbere in the Beara Peninsula or a corner shop in some rural community like the ones we all represent.  They are businesses, perhaps family-run, that are struggling.  They require a degree of flexibility and have people available to them who are happily working on an if-and-when basis.  The big retailers and big hotels can look after themselves.  They have the big resource of an in-house HR service.  I am not trying to fly a flag for any of those.  They have come in here and made their own pitch.  What is Dr. O'Sullivan's take on the small, corner shop type, family-run business that needs the flexibility of having one or two staff members to call on if and when they need them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle O'Sullivan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017052300002#D00700"><p>When we look at the possible rationale for zero hour work, there are usually two reasons given.  Those reasons are only given by the employer's organisations.  They say some workers want these types of if-and-when contracts.  They particularly cite young people and women with caring responsibilities.  In response, civil society organisations that represent women and young people are very much in disagreement with that statement.  They feel that while those groups may want flexibility, they do not want unpredictability.  The other rationale that is often given is similar to the one the Deputy mentioned.  It is that some employers may not be able to operate without staff doing zero hour work.  To that we say there are times when there can be unpredictable demand but we see it is a poor reason for having total flexibility for workers.  Having a banded hour contract provides some level of flexibility.  It does not say people have to have a particular number of hours but zero hour contracts mean total flexibility.  Internationally, it is considered to be the far end of the continuum of precarious work; it has all the most significant traits of that kind of work.  The issue was probably mentioned in a previous committee debate by Marguerite Bolger.  If we introduce legislation that imposes lesser regulation or responsibility on some types of businesses, there is the problem of creating a two-tier set of regulations or protections for people and that will not necessarily tackle the problem of precarious work.</p></speech>

There has been quite a lot of discussion here with all groups of witnesses about the six-month rule.  We have had some groups, such as ICTU, who said it should be 18 months.  The Union of Students in Ireland feels it should be six months.  We have had people suggesting 12 months.  What are Dr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on it?  We heard that for anybody doing seasonable work, six months would not be suitable and it might have to be extended to nine months or 12 months.  What are Dr. O'Sullivan's thoughts on that?  It merited much discussion by all the groups that were in.    </p></speech>

In that sense there are a number of options available for this type of work particularly when we look at the international context.  One is to stop this work from the outset so there is no opportunity for any level of flexible work for that first six months.  Some countries ban this type of work entirely.  The second option is to become quite restrictive on the number of hours.  In France, there are a set number of hours, where part-time workers get 24 hours, for example.</p><p>On the six-month rule, we tried to strike a balance where there is an opportunity both for the employer and the worker to get a sense of the type or level of work they might be doing for the first six months.  I understand the concerns about 12 months and a comment was made about protections available under the Unfair Dismissals Acts for 12 months, but there are also provisions under the Acts for exemptions, for example, with regard to the national minimum wage or pregnancy related issues.  People have raised this as a concern before the committee and said that perhaps there should be an alignment with the 12-month rule.</p></speech>

We also made another recommendation about people having a more concrete understanding of what their hours are from day one.  The European Commission is looking into that and has suggested it may come in down the road in respect of the European pillar of social rights.  The expectation that people should have a good understanding of the hours they are doing from day one is being considered at Commission level.  We tried to strike a balance where we are giving some opportunity to both, and six months should give an idea to both sides as to what level of hours they are doing.</p></speech>

In cases that came before the Labour Court such as Buckley and Sabina Murphy, reference was made to casual workers being excluded from the terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Therefore, de facto casual workers are not employees and if "genuinely casual" work is inserted in the proposed legislation, the same situation will be created again.  It would be easy for employers to issue an if-and-when contract and say this person is a casual worker and, therefore, not an employee and, therefore, not covered by the legislation.</p></speech>

It has referred to guidance for countries whereby there should be an end to precarious employment relationships.  Does the rationale for having people on totally casual work stand up?  If there is a need for flexibility, there are myriad ways of organising working time that do not require staff to have complete unpredictability of work, such as the banded hours agreements in the organisations mentioned earlier.  There are other examples.  In previous committee hearings, there were discussions about the test that should be used for people if they request hours, including objective grounds, which are used in other forms of employment legislation.  That would at least test for whether there is a need or a legitimate aim to have people on certain types of employment rather than having it preordained in legislation that genuinely casual work is a reason for people having no predictable hours.</p></speech>

The National Minimum Wage Acts and the Employment Equality Acts have a wider definition of "employee" than the Organisation of Working Time Act.  That definition follows the European Court of Justice, ECJ, definition, which is wide.  There is no single definition at European level of an employee, but the definition that has been used in ECJ cases is similar to that in the National Minimum Wage Acts.</p></speech>

The danger is if that intermediate category is created and that definition is used to bring in a category of workers, as happened in the UK, we could create additional problems.  Many researchers and legal experts in the UK, such as Keith Ewing and Simon Deacon, and Friedman, have argued that we should get rid of the definition of "employee" that exists now and bring in the definition that has been used in ECJ cases relating to the personal service nexus.  That is a wider debate.</p></speech>

At the moment, we pretty much have a zero-sum game with regard to the issue of if-and-when contracts.  The notion that there is no other way of organising hours to suit business needs if we do not have if-and-when contracts is quite a narrow way of thinking about the management of working hours when there are other examples in other countries across Europe of how it can be done.  We would caution against going down the route of the UK which had minimal regulation, making exclusivity clauses unenforceable.  We would caution against that very light form of regulation.  Legal experts in the UK say that the idea of stopping someone on a zero-hour contract from working for someone else was never a real problem to begin with, and therefore introducing that kind of regulation has not increased any level of protection for people, and the number of people on zero-hour contracts in the UK has increased.  Its definition of zero-hour contracts includes our definition of if-and-when contracts.</p></speech>

By my calculations, this committee has spent ten hours and five sessions hearing from 39 witnesses about this Bill and the wider issues that are raised in it.  That is an impressive amount of time and effort.  I thank the committee and the Chairman for the work it has put into this Bill.  I also thank all the witnesses for giving their time to evaluate the Bill as well as sharing their insights and analysis.  All contributions from all sections, both those who agreed with what the Bill is setting out to do and those who did not agree, have been read by me, those in my office, and Dr. McCabe, who is with me, and we are both thankful for the arguments made.</p><p>We have to be clear on one thing from the outset.  There is a problem with if-and-when contracts and that problem demands a legislative response.  There is no point in witnesses coming into this committee, as some have done, and pretending that the Irish world of if-and-when contracts consists of nothing more than students training to be doctors or lawyers, and employers doing them a flexible favour.  The employers&rsquo; groups did themselves no favours by putting forward such a facetious line.  Mr. Tim Fenn of the Irish Hotels Federation, said, &ldquo;The first thing we would suggest is that this Bill be forgotten about.&rdquo;  In the words of Senator Reilly, &ldquo;there has to be a realisation that there is a problem&rdquo;.  We may disagree with how to address this issue, but no reasonable person can dispute that there is an issue and problem that needs to be addressed.  The problem the Bill sets out to resolve is that of a person consistently working hours that are not recognised in a contract.  As I have said from the beginning, I am happy to see changes to the Bill as it stands so long as that key objective is still realised.</p><p>Having gone through all ten hours of transcripts, I feel that there are three core issues raised with regard to the Bill that I believe to be valid and which were put forward in good faith.  The first relates to the use of the word &quot;exceeds&quot; in section 3(1).  This was raised by Ms Marguerite Bolger, SC, and Ms Cathy Maguire, BCL.  Both said that they strongly welcomed the Bill and what it seeks to do.  Ms Bolger made the point that the Bill as worded could be interpreted as giving an employee the right to hours in excess of those currently worked.  As I have said on numerous occasions, this is most certainly not the intention of the Bill.  Ms Bolger suggested replacing the word &ldquo;exceeds&rdquo; in line 30 to &ldquo;reflects&rdquo; to put it in line with the overall intent.  I have reflected on this and I am more than open and willing to support such a change being made if the committee is agreeable.</p><p>The second issue relates to the look-back period for calculating the appropriate band for the employee.  My Bill gives a period of six months, which is in line with the University of Limerick study recommendation.  I understand that representatives of those who carried out that study were here today as well.  The committee heard from various witnesses who criticised the six-month look-back period as too short to take into account seasonal factors.  Other witnesses thought that anything more than 12 months would be excessive.  I accept that the six month look-back period may be too short to take on board seasonal factors.  I am willing to see that changed and I suggest that it could be a period of nine months.  With that in mind, section 3(1) would then read, &ldquo;A worker, or his or her trade union or a representative acting on his or her behalf, shall be entitled after a period of no less than nine months of continuous employment with his or her employer, to request in writing of his or her employer to be moved to a weekly band of hours, as per the banding of hours set out in the <i>Schedule</i>where the band requested [reflects] the hours average worked weekly in the previous nine month period.&rdquo;  I feel this reflects a reasonable balance between the rights of the employee and the rights of the employer.  No one is asking for additional hours in this Bill.  All that is being requested is a contract that reflects the reality of hours worked.</p><p>The third issue raised is that of a refusal of a request for a move to a new band of hours on objectively justified grounds.  Again, I feel that the issues raised with regard to how the Bill, as it stands, deals with this have merit, especially with regard to the current test of &quot;severe financial difficulties&quot;.  As a result, my office and I are working on a formula of words that will move to give the Bill a test on objectively justified grounds, as per the intent in the Long Title.  With the Chairman's permission, I will get back to the committee with this formula of words.</p><p>One point was raised that I feel does not warrant a change in the Bill.  On the issues regarding the obligation to provide information on overall availability of working hours, I believe the employers&rsquo; organisations simply showed up their outright opposition to the Bill rather than raising any valid criticism.  Section 5 as it stands places an obligation on an employer to display the work roster for the following week &quot;such that the notice is reasonably likely to be understood by the workers concerned&rdquo;.  The Bill says that this roster &ldquo;may&rdquo; be in English or Irish, and in other languages where required.  It does not say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be in English or Irish, and in other languages where required.  The key issue is that the notice is such that it is understood by the workers concerned.</p><p>The obligation is to display a roster that is understood by the workforce.  We do not want rosters that are not understood by employees.  Unless Irish employees believe in putting up notices that are not understood by workers, a practice that would negate the reason for a notice in the first instance, the purpose of which is to be understood, then I fail to see how this be claimed as such an onerous burden on employers that it would lead to the immediate collapse of the business and-or bankruptcy, as claimed by the employers representatives, or lead multinationals to flee Ireland for foreign shores, where they presumably would have to put up notices in languages other than English.  This type of nonsense approach benefits nobody.  </p><p> As already stated, I reject the comments made by witnesses that there is no need for this Bill and that if-and-when and contracts are all sweetness and light: they are not.  There are other issues that were raised in the course of the five hearings, including the need for additional sanctions where an employee is penalised for requesting a move in banded hours, which I am happy to discuss, along with the comments that I have just made.  </p><p> I thank the committee for its work in scrutinising this Bill and I am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Before I invite members to put their questions, the committee as a whole is in agreement that there is an issue around if-and-when contracts and zero hour contracts.  The fact that the Government has published heads of a Bill on the issue in the past week supports that there is an issue.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane that some of the organisations who appeared before the committee were of the view that there is no issue.  Every member of the committee agrees that there is a problem in this area.  Senator Reilly has asked me to pass on his apologies.  He was here for the first session of the meeting but he had to leave to go to the Seanad.</p></speech>

We are open to supporting that, the reasons for which I set out in my opening remarks.  There is no Bill that is brought forward by either Government or Opposition that is perfect.  On the last occasion I was before the committee I made clear that the intent of this Bill is simple: to ensure that after a reasonable timeframe - I am open to suggestions as to what is a reasonable timeframe - a person's contract would reflect the hours they work.  Any Bill, whether brought forward by an Opposition member or by Government, requires amendment to perfect it.  </p> <p>  A number of the legal witnesses that have come before the committee were clear on their support for the intent of the Bill.  They recognised that the intent of the Bill is genuine and that we are trying to address a problem but they have raised a number of legal concerns in regard to some aspects of it.  I have dealt with the three issues that we felt were the most problematic for them from a legal perspective, namely, "objectively justify grounds", in respect of which we are willing to accept an amendment to deal with that issue; that the word "exceeds" be substituted with "reflects", which again is a reasonable request; and, the six months versus nine months timeframe.  In regard to the constitutionality of the Bill, for a Bill to pass it has to be constitutional.  We want the Bill to be constitutional.  Legal experts will have their opinions and have given them.  We have accepted some of their criticisms around shortcomings in the Bill and, as I said, we are more than happy to accept whatever amendments might be tabled.</p></speech>

We are more than happy to review the wording of that section to see how it can be adapted to fit within this Bill but we were not in a position to have that work completed for the purpose of this meeting.  It was helpful to know that there is strong and robust case law at an Irish and European level in terms of wording that could strengthen this Bill.</p></speech>

The committee's engagement with them was one of the best we have had.  It was very constructive.

If it is an issue of definition that can be resolved.  Ms Bolger and Ms Maguire were very constructive.  I suppose they were wearing their legal hats and wanted to ensure the definitions in the Bill are consistent with the definitions set out in other Bills.  We took the view that State employees are already covered by collective agreements.  We were trying to frame a Bill that would get cross-party support.  We would be willing to examine definitions in the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003 or the Minimum Wage Act 2000 around "worker" and "employer".  We are flexible on that issue because any change in that regard would not take away from the substance of the Bill.  In essence, any-----</p></speech>

We can agree on the definitions issue because that will not take away from the substance of the Bill.  It is an issue we do not have a difficulty with in terms of amendments.</p></speech>

It seems to me that 12 months is the norm in terms of the cycle of most businesses.  There is not much difference between nine months and 12 months.  Why was the nine months timeframe chosen given business norms are 12 months?</p></speech>

As stated by the Chairman, the Government has since produced heads of a Bill to deal with the issue, which recognises that there is need for a solution to this problem.  We worked off the University of Limerick study, which recommended a six month look back period.  We developed a Bill which reflected recommendation No. 4 in its study.  Since then, there have been multiple hearings on the Bill by this committee, the transcripts of which we have read and so we are aware of the constructive criticisms of the legal experts.  My understanding of their observation is that the timeframe should be no longer than 12 months.  In other words, 12 months would be the maximum.</p><p>We felt all along that six months would be appropriate.  However, as employers' organisations and others stated six months would be too short, we felt nine months could be a compromise.  Again, once we get support for the principle of the Bill, it will be a matter for the committee and its members in the first instance to decide what they believe would be the appropriate length of time.  I refer Deputy Niall Collins back to the recommendations made by the University of Limerick.  That is where it came from.  The university conducted the study which looked at what would be the most appropriate timeframe.  Its view was that it should be six months.  As I said, the legal representatives were seeking a maximum period of 12 months.  I gather there were differences of opinion among some of the other delegates.</p></speech>

As Deputy David Cullinane would not have been privy to this, when we met the University of Limerick study representatives, I questioned Dr. Michelle O'Sullivan again on the timeframes of six months, nine months, 12 months and whatever other timeframe might be suggested.  She reiterated the figure of six months.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that ICTU had its position, but there is a recognition by Mandate, a union that represents the vast bulk of workers actually in the if-and-when contract bracket.</p></speech>

Everybody involved in the committee who has listened to the delegates recognises that there is a massive problem with if-and-when and low-hour contracts.  I thank Deputy David Cullinane for his Bill which is very progressive.  He has come back to what he said on the first day that he was open to amendments.  A number of issues were raised by previous delegates.  Some were genuine, but I think others were not.  I agree with the comment made by Deputy david Cullinane that the employers' groups had done themselves no favours.  I said it to them myself.  They said they had a lot of problems with the Bill, but they had come with no solutions to how they would fix them.</p> <p>  I specifically want to mention four issues on which Deputy David Cullinane said he was open to change.  One is the display.  Some of the employers' organisations turned it into a massive problem, as though they would have to have translators in each company or business to make signs.  They complicated something that was not that complicated.  The words the Deputy used were not the ones they were using either.  I welcome his clarification in that regard.</p> <p>  A timeframe of nine months is probably a change with which most of us could agree.  The Deputy had inserted a figure of six months in the Bill.  ICTU was looking for a longer timeframe.  I know that Mandate also wanted a period of six months.  I hope a timeframe of nine months might be acceptable to most of us.</p> <p>  The Deputy clarified that he would change the word "exceeds" to "reflects", which is good.  It was causing a lot of concern for some.  I am particularly pleased also that the Deputy said he would come back with a formula of words to deal with the financial difficulties of employers.  I wanted to make a quick comment on it.  I again thank the Deputy for his presentation.</p></speech>

I recognise the contributions made by the employers' organisations.  I know that I made some strong criticisms in my opening remarks.  With other members, I attended a briefing given by some of the employers' organisations on the heads of a Government Bill.  Similar arguments were made against that Bill that I believe were disingenuous, facetious and an attempt not to recognise that there was a problem.  It was Seanad&oacute;ir James Reilly who made the point in asking what was wrong with somebody having a contract that reflected the hours they worked.  It is a simple and basic right to which any employee should be entitled.  There now seems to be political support for it which was not the case in the past.  I welcome that advance.  The employers' organisations are, however, not in a space where they are even able to accept that it is a right workers should have, regardless of whether it is a Sinn F&eacute;in or a Government Bill that progresses.  We believe our Bill should progress because it has the ability to deal with the issue.  Teachta Maurice Quinlivan asked if we were willing to work with others and accept amendments.  We have demonstrated a willingness to do so.</p> <p>  The logic and the policy, that a worker should have a contract reflective of the hours he or she works, should be provided for in law.  At a previous hearing we heard examples from workers.  Mandate carried out a survey of workers on if-and-when contracts and the logistical and obvious problems they were causing for them.  The findings of the survey were presented to the committee.  We know that such contracts have an impact on workers in being able to plan their week and not being able to take out mortgages because it is their contract that is looked at, not the hours they actually work.  There can be exploitation and workers can be penalised if they ask for a contract that is reflective of the hours they actually work.</p> <p>  One of the issues raised by the legal people was that we should look at the penalties in place if any worker is victimised.  If we provide for banded hours, regardless of how many bands there will be and whatever the length of time, we must ensure employees will not be victimised.  That is not provided for in the Bill, but we will amend it to reflect that position also.  It was a welcome addition by the legal people who appeared before the committee.  </p> <p>  I have dealt with the six-month time period which I still believe is appropriate.  Obviously, we are willing to compromise and suggested a figure of nine months if others felt ta longer time period would better reflect seasonal hours.  Others have argued for a timeframe of 12 months and some have suggested a figure of 18 months.  It is a matter for the committee to sort out.</p> <p>  On displaying rosters in a language or a way that is understood by a worker, when one thinks about it, they are just numbers and days.  How onerous is it to ask an employer, especially of a large number of staff who might be from the same country, to have a roster that covers seven days?  To be frank, some of the issues raised were a little disingenuous and red herrings.  They were an attempt to take away from the substance of the Bill.  Again, they are issues that have been raised by trade unions.  It is a simple right that workers should know they hours they will work in any given week.  People have to organise their lives, make child care arrangements and deal with different issues.  The majority of those on if-and-when contracts are women and in low-paid jobs.  They deserve certainty.  It is not unreasonable for a worker to know in advance the hours he or she will have to work the following week and have them displayed.  That is a reasonable request.  It is one of the reasons we were insistent on that element of the Bill remaining in place.</p></speech>

Once that date is reached, the Bill will be placed on the Order Paper under the heading of Order for Committee Stage.  Amendments to the Bill may only be tabled on Committee Stage after the D&aacute;il has referred the Bill to the relevant select committee.  It is unusual, as the clerk said to me, that it has come before us after First Stage.  I just want everyone to be clear in his or her head that amendments will not be tabled at this stage.  At this stage we are engaged in detailed scrutiny of the Bill.</p></speech>

Following the hearings we have held, there is now cross-party acceptance that there is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.  That in itself is a significant achievement.</p> <p>  What frustrates me is that looking at the Deputy's presentation, it is clear that the Bill is workable and, most importantly, can be effective.  I stress the word "effective".  I noted that the representatives of the University of Limerick had a particular concern about the continued use of the term "casual work" in the heads of the Government's Bill and how it could even be defined.  I know that the heads of the Government's Bill have only just come out, but does Deputy David Cullinane have views on the continued use of the term "casual work" in the Government's Bill?  I certainly have a concern that, while we might be doing away with or restricting the use of if-and-when contracts, there will be a new category of contract that will still enable employers to employ people "casually", which would mean that employees would not be protected by the legislation we badly need.</p></speech>

The issue of casual and precarious work is real.  Many issues have come up in the hearings which are not dealt with in this Bill.  For example, there is the issue of whether an employee should have the right to seek additional hours.  I would support that.  However, this Bill is not a miscellaneous, catch-all Bill.  It is not trying to solve every problem.  It is a Bill that is simply trying to deal with one particular problem, and we were very clear, up front and honest about what that was, which is that a person's contract should be reflective of the hours he or she does.  I am supportive of fixing the issue of casual work, how that is defined and how we deal we deal with the issue.  It can be solved by policy initiatives and by different forms of legislation.  The University of Limerick recommended looking at collective agreements because in some of these sectors they do not exist.  There is also the issue of the right to be a member of a trade union and access to collective bargaining.</p> <p>  There is a whole suite of legislative solutions I want to see put in place to strengthen worker's rights.  I have published a report on low pay, casual work, precarious work and a living wage on behalf of this committee in the past, so there are a set of agreed proposals that could be used to examine some of these details.  They are all important issues, but not all of them can be dealt with in this Bill.</p> <p>  The issue of casual work is massive.  Flexible contracts suit some people, and there are some workers who actually want flexible contracts.  We are not telling workers that they cannot have a flexible, short-term contract.  We are trying to deal with situations were workers have been exploited by doing, for example, 30 hours a week for three, five or ten years which are not reflected in their contracts.  There is a big difference.  It is disingenuous to argue that this is an attack on flexible work and flexible contracts.  It is not.  If a worker wants that, he or she is entitled to it.</p></speech>

I see that the Government's heads of Bill has just four bands.  The first band is from one hour to ten hours.  Are there any concerns about that?  How effective would a Banded Hours Contract Bill need to be in order that a worker could avail of securing the hours he or she works?</p></speech>

My concern with the Government proposals is that the bands are too broad.  What we do not want is a Bill that on balance would negate the value of it and would make it almost irrelevant.  I have a concern that we could be presenting a possible solution which is not a solution at all.  If there is no disagreement with the range of bands we have proposed, which go up in five-hour increments, why can that not be the way forward?  That is a better fix to the problem rather than having bands that are too broad and do not solve the problem for most workers.</p></speech>

We might end up with legislation that looks like it is fixing the problem but is in effect toothless.  As Deputy Cullinane has said, no one from any of the groups objected to the bands that were in the Bill.  It is important that whatever way we move forward - one hopes with Deputy Cullinane's Bill - that we protect the bands that are in place there in order that the legislation is workable from the worker's point of view.</p></speech>

They were working on the basis of the Bill as it is, which has yet to be amended.  If the Bill were amended along the lines that some of the employment law specialists suggested, they would be more supportive of progressing this Bill rather than simply amending an existing Bill.  A stand-alone Bill is merited.  The logic of this Bill is clear and it should proceed.  To be quite frank, if it does not proceed, it will be for political reasons.  If there is cross-party support for the principle of it, let us progress this Bill, make the changes necessary, perfect it as outlined by some of the witnesses and get it done for the workers who need to be protected.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me to attend the committee today to discuss the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016.  I welcome the opportunity to be here with the members.  I know the committee has put a considerable amount of work to date into consideration of the Bill and has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders over the course of recent months.  The committee is to be commended on the approach it has taken in this regard.</p> <p>  I will first explain the Government position on the Bill.  Members will recall from last summer that when it was debated on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Government did not support it for the reasons which I and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, explained in detail at the time.  In summary, the Bill, as drafted, is flawed, lacks balance and does not achieve its stated aim.  Moreover, it would have very significant adverse consequences for employers across the economy, including job losses.  In contrast, the legislative proposals recently approved by Government for priority drafting represent a balanced response to the commitment in the programme for Government to address the problems caused by increased casualisation of work and, very importantly, to strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  I will elaborate on these proposals later.</p> <p>  Let us start with the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill.  What is wrong with it?  The Bill does not focus on low-paid vulnerable workers.  Instead, it requires that all workers in every sector of the economy be given additional hours on request, unless the employer can prove severe financial difficulties.  Under the Bill, employees could keep asking for more hours every six months.  They would have to receive the additional hours until the employer reaches the point of severe financial difficulties.  It does not matter if the employer does not have the work.  The effect of this provision is that the employers would find themselves having to appear before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court attempting to prove severe financial difficulties.  The right to seek more hours kicks in after six months in a job.  The six-month reference period is too short to take into account the normal peaks and troughs of a business, including seasonal fluctuations, and it would produce skewed results.  I ask the committee to think about someone working during a busy summer season from April to September.  At the end of this period, he or she would have the right to get more hours than he or she worked over the summer and get those increased hours for the upcoming low season of October to March.  This does not make sense and would cause untold difficulties for many businesses.</p> <p>  One of the problems highlighted in the University of Limerick study was the issue of employees whose contract of employment does not reflect the reality of the hours they work consistently.  There may be, for example, employees who have been working 30 hours per week consistently for many years but whose contracts only state ten or 15 hours per week.  The Government's proposals include measures to make contracts reflect the hours people actually work.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill does not.  Instead, it would require employers to give extra hours to employees that they did not have to begin with.  This is totally different and does not address the problem identified by the University of Limerick study.</p> <p>  Further, the Bill makes no allowances for employers in the following situations.  First, they may have no more work to give.  This Bill would require them to increase hours until they reach severe financial difficulties.  Second, they may be worried they might lose contracts due to Brexit, for example.  They must give extra hours until they reach severe financial difficulties.  Third, they may be setting aside funds to expand.  It does not matter.  Extra hours would have to be given whether needed or not.  I know the committee has already discussed the test of severe financial difficulties at one of its earlier meetings with a number of experienced barristers practising in the area of employment law, one of whom referred to it in the following terms.  The severe financial difficulties test "imposes such a disproportionate burden on an employer that there is a real risk that the legislation will be struck down as unconstitutional".</p> <p>  While I acknowledge that the Bill may be well intentioned, I must point out that it will have adverse impacts across the economy and jobs will be lost.  I ask the committee to think about an employer with 100 hours of work to give per week and five employees each working 20 hours.  Through this Bill, they would have to be put on a higher band if they so request.  If they move to 25 hours each per week, that is 125 hours per week, 25 more than the employer has to give.  One could expect one of them would have to be made redundant.  This pattern could keep repeating itself every six months under the Bill.</p> <p>  The other major issue with the Bill is that it requires every employer covered by it to display notices in their workplaces.  These notices have to show the number of hours being allocated to workers in the next week or month and the relevant bands.  These notices will have to be in English, Irish and any other languages as required.  This is clearly a significant additional burden that would apply to every employer, even if everyone works full-time and there are no rosters.  The Bill requires this from every business ranging from the corner shop to the largest multinational.</p> <p>  In addition to the aforementioned flaws, the Bill does not deal with a range of issues encompassed in the Government Bill.  Overall, while the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 may be well meaning, it is misconceived, flawed and inappropriate.  There is a very real danger that employment will suffer and competitiveness be damaged if the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is passed.</p> <p>  Having addressed the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, I wish to outline what the Government proposes to do about banded hours, low-hour contracts, zero-hour contracts and related matters.  I think everyone in this room would have empathy with employees who cannot access mortgages or even loans from credit unions because their contracts of employment do not reflect the reality of their hours worked.  We would also empathise with people who may be in low-paid, insecure employment and those who are not informed of even the most basic terms and conditions of employment within a reasonable period of starting a new job.  Further, we know of people being called in to work but who do not receive the promised hours.  These are the key issues which have been identified as needing to be addressed.  This is why the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and I brought proposals to Government in this area in response to the commitment in the programme for Government to address problems in this area.  I am very pleased to say the Government approved our draft legislative proposals earlier this month and the draft heads of Bill have been referred to the Office of the Attorney General for priority drafting.  It is very important to understand that our proposals are the result of extensive consultations.  These include a public consultation carried out by my Department following the University of Limerick study on zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts as well as a detailed dialogue process with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, over a period of several months.</p> <p>  Regarding banded hours specifically, our draft legislative proposals will ensure employees on low-hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over an extended period.  The proposals provide for the creation of a new right for an employee to seek to be placed on a band of hours.  However, after much consultation and consideration, we propose a reference period of 18 months.  This is sufficiently long to allow for the normal peaks and troughs of businesses, including those subject to seasonal fluctuations.  It also reflects that the academic year does not match the calendar year. so those working in the education sector can avail of these proposals also.  I note that the definition of "worker" included in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill excludes teachers, which I accept may be accidental.  Our proposals also provide a mechanism for a review of the arrangement after a period of 18 months, that is, after the employee has sought and been placed in a band of hours in exercise of their right under this proposal.</p> <p>  One provision that our proposals share with this Private Members' Bill is that an employee will be able to seek redress through the WRC.  Redress will be limited to being placed in an appropriate band of hours.  This is to prevent vexatious claims.</p><p>The proposals include reasonable defences for employers to refuse an employee's request where the facts do not support the employee's claim, significant adverse changes have impacted on the business such as the loss of an important contract, emergency circumstances, for example, the business has had to close due to flooding, or where the hours worked by the employee were due to a genuinely temporary situation, such as cover for another employee on maternity leave.<br/><br/>Some employers in the retail sector already have banded hours arrangements that work well and the Government does not wish to interfere with them.  Therefore, the proposed banded hours provision will not apply to an employer who has entered into a banded hours arrangement through an agreement by collective bargaining with employees.<br/><br/>The bands in our proposals are kept deliberately wide to provide flexibility to employers and employees.  Our draft legislative proposals cover much more than just banded hours arrangements.  They also address four key issues.  First, they ensure workers are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and, in particular, their core terms at an early stage of their employment.  Currently, 15 terms of employment are required to be given by employers to employees within two months.  The UL study recommended that all 15 items be given on the first day.  Following consultation, we consider that to be excessive.  Instead, it is proposed that employers must inform employees in writing within five days of commencement of employment of five ordinary, albeit core, terms of employment: the full name of the employer and employee; the address of the employer; the expected duration of the contract regardless of whether the contract is temporary or fixed-term; the rate or method of calculating pay; and what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the employee's working day and week will be.<br/><br/>This proposal is a better solution than putting rosters in prominent places in the workplace in both Irish and English as suggested in the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  Under our proposals, an employee will have to be told early in his or her employment what the working day and week will be.  The proposals also provide for the creation of a new offence where an employer does not provide the proposed statement of the five core terms of employment within one month of commencement of employment.  Strengthening the sanction for non-compliance will help to promote better work practices and provide greater clarity around the essential elements of the employment relationship for both the employer and the employee.<br/><br/>Second, our proposals strengthen the provisions around minimum payments to low-paid, vulnerable workers who may be called in to work for a period but not provided with that work.  It is also intended to introduce a floor payment of three times the national minimum wage or three times the minimum rate set down in an employment regulation order, ERO, to compensate low-paid workers who are called in to work and then sent home without the work promised.  Most people in this room would sympathise with a cleaner who got a text to come in to work for a six-hour shift and got the bus in only to be told there was no work for him or her that day.  Under our proposals, that cleaner would receive three times the &euro;9.75 minimum wage, which is &euro;29.25.  This is to discourage employers from the unscrupulous practice of calling employees in to work unnecessarily and not paying them.  However, our proposals are balanced and include reasonable defences for employers, for example, in emergency situations.  Unlike the Private Members' Bill, this proposal is specifically targeted at low-paid vulnerable workers.<br/><br/>Third, our proposals prohibit zero-hour contracts in most circumstances.  To this end, the proposals will provide that an employer will no longer be able to engage an employee on a contract within the meaning of section 18(1)(<i>a</i>) or 18(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 where the stated contracted hours are zero, unless it is genuinely casual work, emergency cover or short-term relief work for the employer.  It is also proposed to delete the phrase &quot;zero hours working practices&quot; from the title of section 18 of the Act.  This proposal is to avoid the contagion of an increase in zero-hour practices in this jurisdiction.<br/><br/>Fourth, I note from the transcripts of previous committee meetings that this Private Members' Bill has been criticised because there is no penalisation provision.  In our proposals, it is intended to provide against an employer penalising or threatening to penalise an employee for exercising any right under the proposed legislation.  Members will be aware that I have referred the draft legislation to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for consideration as to whether it wishes to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Bill.  I appreciate that the committee may not have had an opportunity to consider this question, but I would welcome the opportunity to engage further with members on the Government Bill.  In any event, I look forward to the constructive contributions of the committee in advancing these proposals through the Oireachtas to ensure the legislative provisions in this important area of employment rights are enacted as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I cannot support the Private Members' Bill as its provisions are not workable in practice.  The Bill would place too onerous a burden on all employers, especially start-ups and microenterprises.  As Minister of State with responsibility not just for employment rights matters but also for small business, I am acutely aware of the need to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable workers while encouraging a climate in which businesses can survive and grow.  I thank members for their time and look forward to taking their questions on this issue.</p></speech>

The Minister of State's criticism of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill in the first part of his statement has me confused.  My understanding of Deputy Cullinane's Bill is that if a worker works an increased number of hours, the Bill provides in legislation that the worker may request his or her contract to reflect those additional hours.  However, the Minister of State seemed to say that an employee can just rock up to an employer and make that request without having worked the additional hours.  That has me and probably other members confused.  Will the Minister of State clarify?</p><p>My second question relates to the reference period of 18 months <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>six months.  I put this question to Deputy Cullinane, who appeared at the meeting before the Minister of State as the sponsor of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  What of the normal business cycle?  Businesses prepare their accounts on an annual basis and most budgeting runs on a 12-month cycle, not necessarily the calendar year.  Businesses prepare their accounts based on a certain year end, which could be at any point in the calendar year, so their accounting years do not need to run from 1 January to 31 December.  Will the Minister of State clarify his criticism of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill?  He cited an employer with 100 hours of work to give to five employees at 20 hours apiece and the employees seek to increase that by five hours.  It does not seem to make sense.</p></speech>

I will deal with the second issue, the 18-month period, first.  The UL study suggested a six-month period.  We have consulted significantly with IBEC and ICTU and 48 submissions were received regarding the study.  Doing that was important.  Most of those who made submissions were players in this field.</p> <p>  We decided on an 18-month period in the first instance because we needed to take account of seasonal fluctuations and normal ups and downs.  Take, for example, Waterford, where the Chairman is from, and Tramore.  If an employee works at a seaside resort, that may only be on a seasonal basis and he or she might not work in October, November and December.  Therefore, using a six-month period would not give a true reflection of the hours that person worked.  The same can be said of teachers or others in the education sector whose year is different.  We picked 18 months because it takes into account the academic year as well as ups and downs.</p><p>We believe it gives a true reflection of the hours that person worked over that 18-month period.  I think that was accepted by ICTU and IBEC as reflecting the reality of the time the person worked.  That is why we stipulated that 18-month period.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  I can only state what the Bill provides regarding the six-month period.  That person would get extra hours if they wanted to get into a band.  It is open to that person to do that every six months.  That would put considerable pressure on employers and could put them into severe financial circumstances.  They would have to go to the WRC to prove they are not in a position to do so.  That is what the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill provides for.  We believe it is poorly drafted and not what was supposed to be set out.  It was supposed to put people in banded hours that would reflect the hours that person worked over a prolonged period of time.</p></speech>

They can do that after a six-month period.  That certainly means they can keep doing that all the time.  That would not reflect the reality of the hours they worked because they would be in the higher band all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-23a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017052300002#M00600"><p>Let me clarify by reading from section 3, to which I referred earlier.  It states:</p><blockquote>A worker, or his or her trade union or a representative acting on his or her behalf, shall be entitled after a period of no less than 6 months of continuous employment with his or her employer, to request in writing of his or her employer to be moved to an increased weekly band.</blockquote> <p>It states quite clearly that a worker would have to be in work for six months.  The Minister of State would not be privy to this because we would have discussed it with Deputy Cullinane earlier.  Most of our discussions have focused on whether it should be six, nine, 12 or 18 months.  Deputy Cullinane accepted that he would move it to nine months.  Deputy Niall Collins pushed for 12 months.</p><p>I believe stipulating 18 months would have adverse implications for students.  A student spending 12 months in Limerick, Cork, Dublin, Waterford or wherever might be on a low-hour contract or an if-and-when contract for 12 months but might end up studying somewhere else the following year and might have to go into employment in another section for another 12 months.  For example, my daughter has been in Mary Immaculate College in Limerick for two years.  She comes back to Waterford to work at the weekend.  If she decided to work in Limerick and then went on for her masters in Cork or Galway, it would have an effect.  I agree with Deputy Niall Collins that we should have a 12-month cycle.</p></speech>

I accept what the Chairman says about students, who do not have continuous work.  That is a reflection of the type of work they are doing.  Based on the submissions received and the consultations we had with IBEC and ICTU, there was broad agreement from all sides that 18 months was an acceptable period to assess the reality of the hours people have worked.  It is up to students themselves to be placed on a band of hours.  Some students like flexibility and some students may go to America.  While it is no reflection of the students themselves, it is difficult to assess where they are because they move from job to job.  Our legislation is geared to the low-paid workers, the most vulnerable people in our society.  To be fair to Sinn F&eacute;in, that is what it has tried to do in its Bill.  The sentiment of the Bill is to try to look after low-paid workers, but that has not happened in that Bill because it is flawed.  We have looked at the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill and the UL study.</p> <p>  I apologise that it has taken so long, but we must get the legislation right.  Employment legislation, in particular, takes time and cannot just be changed immediately.  The consultation with ICTU and IBEC took place between September and March.  We believed we needed to get that legislation right and needed to get the main players onside.  This is the agreement we came up with.  I understand the Chairman's point on students, but this Bill is geared towards people who are in continuous work, the low-paid workers whom we want to protect.</p></speech>

He said:</p><blockquote>... all workers in every sector of the economy be given additional hours on request, unless the employer can prove severe financial difficulties.  [My problem is with the next bit.]  Under this Bill, employees could keep asking for more hours every six months.</blockquote> <p>That is not stated in Deputy Cullinane's Bill.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could show me that.  I have read the Bill and it clearly does not state that.  It states that people will get the hours they actually worked previously and not that they will get extra hours.  They will get hours that they have proven they have worked over that number of months.  The Minister of State is claiming they could then look for extra hours every six months.  That is not the case.  Where is that stated in Deputy Cullinane's Bill?</p></speech>

Maybe the Bill was rushed and was prepared with undue haste, resulting in these measures not being taken on board.  The labour affairs section of the Department had to take on board the input from IBEC and ICTU as well as the UL study.  We need to take all these into consideration when preparing employment legislation, which is complex.  We need to look at every aspect of it to ensure it is constitutional and provides protection.  We need to have a balance to protect employees and ensure employers also have their rights.</p></speech>

I will give one example.  From his own written notice here, he quotes from the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill and says these notices will have to be in English, Irish and in other languages, as required, when the Bill actually states, and I quote, "the roster may be in English and Irish, and in other languages where required".  If the Minister of State cannot even read the Bill properly he is not in a good position to come in here and tell us about how important the details are.  It is a complete misreading of the Bill.  I will try and be constructive because it is embarrassing for the Minister of State to have put that in writing.</p> <p>  I want to deal with the Minister of State's proposals and I wish to clarify three or four points.  The first is can the Minister of State clarify whether this Bill will exclusively prohibit zero hours working and if there are exceptions, what exceptions will these be?  The second point relates to casual work because he references casual work in his heads of Bill.  My concern is that the term "casual work" can be used, as it currently is, to effectively stop workers from being protected.  I wonder has the Minister of State a definition of the term "casual work" and if so, could he share it with us?  Would he accept the importance, if he does not have a definition, that it must be very tightly defined?  Finally, the Minister of State did not explain in his last answer why it is better to have four bands rather than seven, particularly when the first band is worthless.  The band between one and 10 hours does nothing for any worker.  I am puzzled because, as the Chairman will confirm, we have had opinions from all parties, left, right and middle, and no one had an issue with the bands in Deputy Cullinane's Bill.  Will the Minister of State clarify if he indicated that ICTU was asking for four bands?  I can tell him from speaking to ICTU that is not my understanding.</p></speech>

We are not the only one.  These are experts who came in here today saying that.  We want to be helpful in this.  I would say that to the Senator.  He raised this in the Chamber last year in a Private Member's Bill.  We sent it here to the committee to be dealt with but we have taken time to look at his Bill and it is flawed.  Why would we make bad legislation?  Why would we take the time over the last 12 months to prepare legislation in regard to low hours and zero hours and banded hours without the assistance of the professionals we have?  We had the main players involved with this as well, we took submissions - there are 48 submissions - in regard to the Bill.  We believe it is good legislation.  It is gone to the Office of the Attorney General, it will be drafted and hopefully come back for the Government's approval, which will probably happen in the next few months.  On the question of the Irish and English language and the other languages which may be used, once that is put into a Bill, one can take any interpretation one likes out of it.</p></speech>

We do not believe it is necessary.  On the legislation we are proposing, we are saying that if one wants to protect employees in their employment, that on the first day when they get a job, the employer has to provide five pieces of vital information which covers what the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill wants to put into the roster. These include the name and address of the company, because one might be working for someone else they do not know about, the length of time they will be working, whether the contract is permanent or temporary and the hours they are working.  The employee will have all this information in the first five days of commencing employment with the company.</p></speech>

Suppose there are people from 20 or 30 different countries, with different languages working for a company, which is very evident nowadays because a lot of people who work on the minimum wage are people from other nationalities.  That can happen a lot.  It would be confusing the situation.  It puts more work on the employers when they could be doing better things.  We believe the fact that the employees are getting this information at the commencement of work is the proper way to deal with the type of business that the Senator has referred to.</p> <p>  There are a lot of interpretations of what is meant by the term "casual work".  I cannot define casual work as it is at the moment.  There was not that much reference to casual work in the submissions we received.  </p> <p>  On the exemptions in the zero hours, the Senator spoke about general causal work.  That is for emergency situations where somebody has been called in and they are needed for an extreme emergency and also short-term employment relief.  We have to have faith in the WRC in all this, and the Labour Court as well.  That is important.  They will not be fooled by an employer incorrectly stating that the work is causal.  There are various different areas.  If one looks at if-and-when contracts, there are different interpretations of what is meant by that, and what is regarded casual work.   Take the example of the hospitality sector, which is something with which we are all familiar.  Take a wedding in the Senator's area where they employ casual workers.  They might have to give them 24 or 48 hours notice to come in for a wedding or funeral, for example.  They would be regarded as casual workers.  They would not be full-time employees for that company.  That is what they are.</p></speech>

In theory, there is no definition of casual work.  However, it is generally accepted that it forms part of the Organisation of Working Time Act.  The issue can be dealt with on another day as it does not come under the remit of this Bill.  We should deal with the contents of this Bill.</p></speech>

No.  Does anyone else wish to comment?  No.</p> <p>  We are not discussing the new Bill today but I have a query about the rate or method of calculating pay.  The Minister of State mentioned five points that are very good for a new employee.  Will the information provided to a new employee state whether he or she is working a week-in-hand, a forthnight-in-hand or a month-in-hand?  Sometimes new employees are confused by the fact that that aspect is not clearly stated.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the matter in terms of his Bill.  The five points of information provided include the full name of the employer and employee; the address of the employer; the expected duration of the contract; what the employer reasonably expects the normal length of the employee's working day and week will be; and the rate or method of calculating pay.</p></speech>

In some cases they must work a month-in-hand.  I ask that the information is stated in the terms and conditions of employment given to employees in their first week.</p></speech>

Employers will be given some time to ensure that an employee has the information.  All of us must ensure that employees have the information within five days.  We think it is not a big thing for the employer to do.  The employer must provide 15 elements within a two month period.  We are saying these five points are basic issues.  There are no cost implications for the employer.  Some employer representatives have argued that five days is too short a period.  Again, the period has come from the consultation process.  I must emphasise that we consulted ICTU and IBEC and found all of the submissions very useful.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the select committee for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Private Member's Bill.  This Bill was brought forward by Senator Ivana Bacik.

This is a very important Bill for the Labour Party.  As the Minister knows, the originator of this Bill was the current President.  It was Michael D. Higgins who initiated the original version of this Bill.  It goes back a while.  The spirit of the Bill, with which we all agree, is very important for the people who are affected and the Bill allows them to collectively bargain in respect of their employment, be they musicians, actors, journalists.  It does have a dramatic impact.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor for supporting this Bill and bringing it through in a speedy fashion.  May I ask that she uses her influence to see if we could get this Bill to Report and Final Stages next week?  If the Minister could facilitate the passage of the Bill, it would mean the Bill could be concluded.  As she has seen it could go through quickly.  The Labour Party Whip has had discussions with the Chief Whip who suggested that she could facilitate us if the passage of the Bill would take less than an hour.  I would appreciate if the Minister could use her office to do that.</p></speech>
