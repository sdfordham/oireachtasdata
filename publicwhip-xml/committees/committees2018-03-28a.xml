    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him and his officials for attending.  The purpose of this meeting is to examine the Revised Estimates.  Although the committee has no role in approving these, there is an important ongoing opportunity to make the process more transparent and engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance matters.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates is intended to assist the committee in focusing on what the Department has committed to achieving in terms of outputs and outcomes, considering whether the performance targets included in the Estimate are a sufficiently complete description of the services provided by the Department and whether those targets strike the right balance in terms of the needs of society.  We also consider whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether those allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p>  I thank the Department for preparing the briefing notes.  As the meeting started, we received some speaking notes from the Minister.  I thank him for those.  I also thank the committee secretariat, particularly Ms Brenda McCauley, for preparing a document for the committee that will help members debate the matters we need to and offer more detailed analysis.  I propose to proceed by programme and subhead.  I remind members and officials to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his support so far.  I will refer to the briefing document that has been prepared by the Department to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimates.  We will commence with programme A, which is dealt with on pages seven to 18 in the Department's briefing and C4 to C7 of the committee secretariat briefing.  In posing questions, I ask each member to clearly indicate the subhead he or she refers to within the programme and to limit the questions to one subhead at a time, allowing other members with questions on the subhead to speak before moving to another subhead.  Does the Minister wish to make an opening statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for taking the Estimates.  We are in a period where we are seeking to rebuild in education after a very difficult time, which we all acknowledge.  We are in a position to expand the number of teachers we are employing and in the past two years we have seen approximately 5,000 extra teachers deployed.  In particular we have looked at areas like special education, and we have a new system in place that is working well.  We are looking to the future to further enhance the provision for special education and we are focusing on the restoration of funding to further and higher education.  We have significant ambitions in areas like apprenticeship, which traditionally have been poorly developed in Ireland.  They fit with the new opportunities that are emerging.  We have a fresh plan in the disadvantage area.</p> <p>  This is a time when we are trying to address many areas of importance in order to achieve the goal we set that by 2026 we would have the best education and training service in Europe.  It is a realistic ambition.  We saw recently that our ten year olds are the best in Europe with regard to reading and mathematics.  We have a good quality of education and good teachers.  I know there are always matters that members will want to raise but we are in a period of rebuilding.  We are also in the fortunate position that we have an expanding young population.  It is stabilising at the primary level now but significant growth can be anticipated at second and third level in the coming years.  In a young and vibrant economy, education has a vital role to play in shaping economic and social progress in the coming years.</p><p>I thank the committee for its work in the field of education.  It is crucial to our future and I appreciate the contribution this committee is making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#C00200"><p>I refer to programme A, first, second and early years education, on the current side.  I do not want to delay the meeting but I do have some questions.  I acknowledge that contained within that are the commitments in the confidence and supply agreement in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio and guidance counsellors.  It is welcome that the pupil-teacher ratio will drop to 26:1 at primary level next September.  The commitments in respect of guidance counselling are being met under the confidence and supply agreement.  I acknowledge that.  That is important.  They are both crucial issues on which the Government is delivering on foot of the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il.</p> <p>  There are many other issues in education.  The first one the Minister is going to hear much about next week is the salaries of newly qualified teachers.  That comes under the subhead of salaries and allowances.  There may be an obvious answer to this question but I will ask it.  Is there scope within the budget this year to cover any possible change to the salaries of newly qualified teachers?  In that context, will the Minister comment on what the Taoiseach said yesterday in the D&aacute;il?  I think the Minister was sitting beside him.  I refer to the possibility of opening up negotiations on the salaries of newly qualified teachers after the conferences.  Is that something that is planned and likely to happen?  Is it something that is going to be announced next week or perhaps here today?</p> <p>  On capitation and grants payable to schools, primary and post-primary, effectively those payments are static.  There is a minuscule increase despite the number of pupils going up quite a lot.  Will the Minister acknowledge that it is difficult for schools to cope at the moment because of the static nature of the overall grant?  It means parents are forced to fundraise and some schools can fundraise better than others.  However, all the time, schools are put to the pin of their collars, so to speak, in regard to operating with the current costs.  I will not talk about capital at this point but I will later on.  I refer to the current costs of insurance, extra ancillary help etc.  Schools are finding it really difficult.  Has the Minister any plans to increase capitation and grants?</p> <p>  I want to highlight another issue that is a disgraceful indictment, namely, broadband.  While the Department states that 100% of post-primary schools have access to high-speed broadband, the number of primary schools with access to high-speed broadband was listed at 23% in 2016.  Last year, there was a target of 33% and this year there is a target of 37% of schools.  That is extraordinary.  I would like the Minister to comment on that because we get this all the time as constituency Deputies.  The schools are finding it increasing difficult to operate without broadband.  Some programmes can be delivered online to assist teachers.  Teaching methods can also involve online resources.  It is also frustrating when people see broadband being put into a local village but not being extended slightly up the road to the local school.  What discussions has the Minister had with his colleagues in Government, but also with Eir and other providers as well, such as SIRO, about providing that crucial resource to schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#C00300"><p>Like Deputy Thomas Byrne, I wish to refer to pay restoration.  I see the circulated document gives a figure for pay restoration.  There is a budgetary allocation that includes provision of &euro;236 million for salary increases to more than 106,000 whole-time equivalent staff numbers under the various pay restoration agreements.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the figure he is working with?  We all heard what the Taoiseach said yesterday about possibly going into further negotiations.  It is a similar question, but on whether that figure is negotiable.  I think it can only be negotiated in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  When we were asked if we had any particular issues, I indicated I was interested in special education.  I refer in particular to the new model and what the financial implications might be.  In the circulated document there is a figure of 100 additional resource teachers to be appointed from September 2018.  It says that is to meet the needs of new and rapidly developing schools and funding is also to meet the costs of teaching posts in special classes in special schools.  All of that is welcome.  However, I just wanted to get a sense of whether and how the new model was affecting the financial resources towards resource teachers?  Are the figures growing in largely the same way as they would have under the old model or is there a change?  It may be more of a policy issue, but I would be interested in how the new model is working in schools.</p> <p>  Special schools are also under particular pressure because we have so many special classes now.  That is a good thing.  Many children are able to go to regular schools in special classes.  I refer in particular to children on the autism spectrum.  However, that means that children in special schools sometimes have greater needs.  How are those extra posts allocated?  We do have figures on special needs assistants, SNAs.  I do not think there is any need to ask a further question except to note that they are continually rising, as they have done over a number of years.  Again, that is responding to need.  Is there a ongoing review of the SNA system?</p> <p>  On the curricular reforms, particular at junior cycle, is extra funding required for subjects like well-being for example?  Is there a specific extra allocation in that area and for the other curricular reform areas?  I think they are in the figures but whether they are specifically anywhere in the figures, I am not too sure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#C00400"><p>Like the previous speakers said, the elephant in the room is pay equality.  I understand there may be some moves towards that and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday on possible new talks on the issue.  It is something that needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency.  Are the Taoiseach's comments an indication that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work?  We know it cannot be done overnight.  The recent report shows that.  However, would the Government be willing to indicate a timeline for the delivery of equal pay for equal work?</p> <p>  I have read today, like other Deputies, that, alarmingly, we do not have enough junior certificate home economics teachers to examine the practical element.  It is going to delay it, which will cause stress for the students involved.  Will the Minister outline the measures he is taking to address that issue or how will that effect the budget Estimates here?  On career guidance counsellors, I do welcome the additional 100 posts.  That will bring us to 500 of the 600 posts cut having been restored.  However, that is based on the number of career guidance posts needed in 2011.  The Minister in his opening statement referred to an expanding young population, so surely we should not be working towards a number for career guidance counsellors that was needed in 2011.  It is 2018 now.  We should be looking at delivering one guidance counsellor per 500 students at this stage.  We are not going to achieve that if our marker is the 2011 number.  What is the Minister's intention to deal with that?</p> <p>  On the superannuation subhead, A8, and indeed in C10, in each of the past two years we have had to vote through a considerable Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year in respect of superannuation payments for teachers.  I see this subhead is down 5% and 7% for the equivalent at third level this year.  Does the Minister anticipate that we will be looking at a similar increased Supplementary Estimate come the end of 2018?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1343" speakername="Tony McLoughlin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#C00500"><p>Rather than repeat some of the questions that have been asked, I will say that I welcome the increase in the number of SNAs.</p><p>How many additional special needs assistants will be recruited by the end of 2018?  When is it envisaged that the 100 additional resource teachers will be recruited?  Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated for the development and implementation of a new model of speech and language therapy.  How will this money be spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#D00200"><p>I fully agree with my colleagues on the issue of pay equity.  If we want to have the world-class education system to which we all aspire, we must have the best people in our classrooms.  We must support teachers by providing for pay equity and restoring middle management positions that were removed in the past because the lack of such positions is causing problems in schools.</p> <p>  The 1% increase provided for capitation grants is small given the growing school population.  In two schools in my constituency, capitation grants are not paid for 150 pupils because the schools are considered too large.  This approach is wrong because small and large schools face particular challenges.  I welcome the funding allocated for the pilot model for in-school speech and language therapy because it is badly needed.</p> <p>  On special educational needs, are there plans for developing a student-teacher ratio for special needs schools?  This issue is referred to in the Minister's briefing document.  While additional funding has been provided for resource teachers and special needs assistants, children with special needs living in urban areas and in counties close to Dublin cannot secure places in mainstream schools.  This is a serious problem at primary and secondary level.  If the Department is satisfied that sufficient funding is being provided to pay the salaries of resource teachers and special needs assistants, it must also provide matching capital to enable children with special needs to attend their local mainstream school.</p> <p>  The briefing document provides for funding for additional school bus routes.  Will this result in greater flexibility regarding eligibility for attendance at a school of choice?  I invite the Minister to respond to the questions members have asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#D00300"><p>Deputy Thomas Byrne acknowledged the progress we have made in areas such as the pupil-teacher ratio, guidance and resource teaching, for which he is a strong advocate.  These improvements have been significant and I welcome the Deputy's support for them.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of newly qualified teachers.  Negotiations with teachers, which took place within three months of my appointment, delivered significant improvements.  As a result of these changes, which were rolled out in January 2017 and January 2018, approximately 75% of the pay gap for newly qualified teachers and teachers has been closed.  A new entrant to teaching will now earn &euro;36,000, which is a significant improvement.  I acknowledge that this is a continuing source of concern for the teacher trade unions and creates tension in the workplace.  For that reason, this matter was specifically listed when the most recent public service pay agreement was negotiated.  While no specific provision was made in this area, it was listed as an area in which a process should commence and a process commenced last October when the teachers' unions entered into the agreement.  As agreed in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, a report was laid by the Minister for Finance around St. Patrick's Day setting out the costs of addressing new entrant pay across the public service.  It is in the context of that report that the Minister indicated he would start discussions with the trade unions, including the teacher unions.  The issue is not a sectoral one but extends across the public service.  I understand it is intended to commence discussions on the matter shortly.  Deputy Catherine Martin indicated that the Government has not set timelines or pathways.  As has been signalled, this is the start of negotiations.</p> <p>  Capitation levels are without doubt an area of pressure for schools.  While we are providing a significant increase in funding of &euro;450 million this year and we provided a similar amount last year, it still comes down to many competing demands for the money available.  In the past two years, we were not able to make provision for an increase in capitation, although we made provision in other areas such as investment in digital resources, the pupil-teacher ratio, guidance and special needs.  There has always been competition for resources.  I am conscious, however, that capitation needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  While I do not have figures with me on broadband, we started from a poor base in primary schools in 2014-2015.  High-speed broadband is now available in 1,100 primary schools, which, as the Deputy noted, is approximately one third of the total.  We hope to connect another 400 schools this year, with further schools being added in subsequent years.  While HEAnet does the connecting up of schools on behalf of the Department, it still depends on the roll-out of national programmes that can be accessed by schools.  I fully agree that an upgrade is required in this area because high-speed broadband of speeds of 30 Mgbs or more needs to be delivered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#D00400"><p>May I query some of the points the Minister made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#D00500"><p>I suggest that we allow the Minister to respond first.  Members will have another opportunity to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018032800002#D00600"><p>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked to what the figure of &euro;236 million relates.  It covers pay restoration, not only for new entrants but also other elements.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for the work she did when she was Minister for Education and Skills.  During her term, she implemented a pilot programme and gained acceptance for the new approach, which I fully support.  The new model provides a better, more integrated service for children with special needs and encourages the whole school to take an interest in children with special needs.  It is good for children with and without special needs and encourages leadership in schools to be more creative in the use of available resources.  This model presents a win-win scenario in that it moves away from the requirement for diagnostic testing which was a source of inequity in the scheme.  On the basis of the work that was done, we rolled out the new approach nationwide from this year onwards, while also providing more resources for special educational needs.  This year, for example, provision was made for 900 additional resource teachers to ensure we had the capacity to roll out the new model without creating losers and in such a way as to meet the demands of appeals and so on.  As the Deputy noted, provision has been made for 100 additional teachers in rapidly developing areas as well as provision for normal demographic expansion.  While the scheme will not grow as rapidly as it did under the old model, schools will be geared up to have the resources to meet their needs.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan also asked what action was required in the area of special needs assistants.  The National Council for Special Education is carrying out a review of best practice and  I understand it has examined the position in 33 different countries.</p><p>It is working to come up with proposals that would offer a better approach to supporting the requirements of children with special needs, for some of whom a special needs assistant is not the only requirement.  Deputy McLoughlin raised the development of a pilot speech and language therapy programme.  That pilot programme is a first toe in the water of having a speech and language therapy service delivered within schools, whereby speech and language therapists would support schools in order that both special needs assistants and teachers could help deliver a speech and language service to children in the school.  There are many gains to be got from that.  It is a toe in the water of how that can be done.  It is only a pilot programme at this point.  </p><p> On the issue of special schools, we are making provision for the allocation of additional teachers to special schools.  A pupil-teacher ratio operates within schools.  It is made up of different ratios depending on where pupils are on the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, ranging from mild to more complex.  There is an pupil-teacher ratio underpinning the allocation to special schools in place.  It reflects the complexity of the children they are dealing with.  If there is a higher level of complexity, they would be seeing a higher level of resources.   </p><p> On the junior cycle reform and well-being programme, we committed to the allocation of the equivalent of nearly 600 extra teachers to provide professional time to allow the junior cycle to be rolled out, including the well-being programme.  It was a significant investment of resources to underpin that.  The well-being programme is being rolled out from this year.  It starts at a 300-hour programme and it is hoped that will build over time.  There has been a warm welcome for the programme.  Most teachers and schools recognise the difficulty in this area.</p><p> We have made provision for additional recruitment of home economics teachers for St. Angela's College in Sligo for the past two years.  There is a recognised deficit there.  We are making other provisions to address teacher supply issues generally and we had the first meeting of a teacher supply group this Monday to address that issue.</p><p> On the issue of the career guidance service and where it is heading, we are conducting a review of it this year and we will examine how effective it is.  The review will also examine how young people get access to career information and if we should be looking at other channels of information for young people.  It seems that the way in which young people get access to information is more complex than we thought and perhaps there are other initiatives we should be taking to get good career information into the hands of young people, as well as career guidance counsellors who have other roles to play.  There may be other ways we can address that.</p><p> On the issue of superannuation, we will have to meet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and discussions are taking place with that Department.  Our forecasts of expected superannuation are accurate but we need to have an agreed provision with that Department.  Discussions are taking place in the context of next year's Estimates to deal with that.</p><p> In response to Deputy McLoughlin's point on the number of special needs assistants, this is the first year in which we have moved away from an assessment of requirement for special needs assistants that had to be conducted in the spring-summer part of the year, after which Government approval was sought, which was the old way it was done.  This resulted in late notification to schools as to when special needs assistants were being allocated.  We changed that this year.  Last year's budget made provision for 1,090 special needs assistants, the anticipated provision that will be needed for this coming September.  We will be in a position to notify schools earlier as a result of not having to go back and get a separate budgetary provision.  </p><p> The Chairman raised an important issue about middle management.  Significant progress on the issue of middle management was made this year.  We made provision for 2,600 additional assistant principal posts mixed between primary and second level.  That was on foot of a new approach to the appointment and deployment of middle managers in schools, which will be more flexible.  This is the start of building a stronger middle management, which will be important for the challenges we have to address in schools and which are becoming more complex.  There will be more flexibility in the way responsibility is given to such middle managers, how they report and record progress and so on.  A more professional approach is being taken to middle management, and responding to that we have invested in 2,600 additional posts at assistant principal level.</p><p> On the issue of the availability of places for children with special needs and the capital provision for that, our Department is very responsive to needs in this area and it gets special access to capital.  As approximately 80 additional special needs classes are being provided each year, the provision is growing very rapidly.  It has more than doubled in the past four or five years.  The experts are here but, as I understand it, the breakdown of that is that 60% go to mainstream, 20% to special classes, and 20% to special schools.  At this time of the year, people are considering what is the appropriate placement, assessments are taking place, there is engagement with special education needs organisers, SENOs, and so on.  I can understand parents being anxious at this time of year but, by and large, we are meeting all those needs.  There can be a difficulty in placing individual children and that takes time.  Of foot of a recommendation of the Chairman's party, we will be introducing a measure whereby the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will have the power to require a school to open a special needs class in the event that schools are not co-operating.  By and large we are seeing that level of co-operation.  The number of special classes has increased from 540 to in the region of 1,200 in the space of five or six years.  That is a very rapid expansion.  It is moving from being at primary to now being at second level, reflecting that children are being retained into second level, which is what we are trying to achieve.  Those the issues the members raised.</p></speech>

He should indicate whether he will make such a statement at the teacher conferences next week.  There has been enough talk about this issue.  The parties in the D&aacute;il, except for Fine Gael, are united on this.  What the unions or, more importantly, their members will be seeking is a commitment that this Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform want this and that it will happen.  Moreover, they will want to know when it will happen.  That needs to be set out clearly in the D&aacute;il and at the teacher conferences next week.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the inclusion of a provision in the schools admissions Bill for which Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed.  We indicated that we would not support that Bill unless that specific issue was addressed.  The Minister has graciously agreed to include a power in that Bill, namely, to give the  National Council for Special Education the power to mandate schools to open special classes.  That power will be included in the schools admission Bill.  In this Estimates document, that Bill is listed as a 2016 output outturn.  It is now 2018 and we still have not come anywhere close to finishing that legislation.  That reason for that is that the Minister has not come back with his amendments from the Department.  He has not set out his final position on that Bill.  There are many important issues with that Bill but a crucial one for us is the one the Minister mentioned.  The Bill is listed in this document as a job that was done in 2016, but it has not been done.</p><p>It is nowhere near done.  It is not the fault of the Oireachtas.  We have done our job but are waiting for the Minister to come forward with his final amendments.  Perhaps he could outline the current position with regard to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016.  What is the delay?</p></speech>

I asked whether the comments made by the Taoiseach yesterday indicate that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work.  The Minister mentioned that a review of career guidance posts is under way and suggested that students might be able to access vital information in other ways.  Another aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor in the school is often forgotten even though it is essential.  The career guidance counsellor is the only trained member of staff to whom a vulnerable child with mental health difficulties or family difficulties can turn.  I respectfully request that when the Minister is reviewing this area, he should not confine his considerations to the career advice aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor but should also pay attention to the counselling aspect.</p></speech>

I accept that progress has been made in the past decade.  There is a lack of forward planning in this area, however.  I would like to mention a specific case in which an ASD unit was opened in a primary school - Scoil na Naomh Uilig, Newbridge - but, eight or ten years later, no such provision was made in the secondary schools in the community.  Having spoken to my colleagues from around the country, I have no doubt that this situation is mirrored elsewhere.  Solutions tend to be found at the last minute.  They are cobbled together in the run-up to September - perhaps just six months in advance - to try to resolve the issue.  I do not think the section 29 system is the right system to use because it puts schools in difficult positions and creates adversarial relationships between parents and schools from day one.  There could and should be much better planning to ensure children with special needs who have had the opportunity to be in mainstream primary schools - I agree with the Minister that this is the best situation for such children - get the proper type of follow-through at second level.  We still have an awful lot of work to do in this regard.</p></speech>

Some time ago, I tabled a parliamentary question on the subject of section 29 appeals in respect of expulsion, suspension or admission.  The figures I received in reply, which are on the record of the D&aacute;il, show that children with special needs are disproportionately more likely to be users of the section 29 system.  It is utterly disproportionate.  I think it could be up to a third although I do not have the figures to hand.  The number is massive.  I agree with the Chair that there needs to be a change in this regard and I certainly will be highlighting that.  The stories we hear in this regard are heartbreaking.  Children with special needs and their parents are disproportionately affected in this regard.  The number of them who are obliged to resort to section 29 appeals is much greater than would be expected on the basis of the numerical amount.</p></speech>

It is very difficult for parents and family members.  It is difficult for the schools as well.  We want a solution that works for schools.  They should not be put in a position where they are forced to do this.  It has been proposed that the NCSE should be able to make plans with schools for what will happen down the line.  In some cases, there is uncertainty from month to month about where a child will be placed.  There has to be a better system out there.  I will hand back to the Minister.</p></speech>

A cost has been indicated.  The Government has indicated that it will start negotiations on foot of that report.  That is the current situation.  I have to say that all of these pay cuts happened before I became Minister for Education and Skills.  Indeed, some of them were initiated when Deputy Thomas Byrne's party was in government.  There is no superior moral position.  I sat down immediately and negotiated a reduction of 75% in the gap.  We got a series of improvements for new entrants, not only on pay but also on earlier permanent contracts.  As the Deputy mentioned, I have negotiated posts of responsibility for people.  We are continually seeking to improve the position of teachers within our system.  The issues still have to be negotiated.  The &euro;200 million cost of this has not been provided for.  The Taoiseach has signalled that it has to be negotiated.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 has been delayed.  It has been delayed because the committee has raised three important issues, which are not easy to resolve.  The first of these issues is the use of religion in admissions policies.  Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned the second issue, which is the need to make provision for special needs.  For example, we are looking at whether the NCSE should be in a position to require a school to open an ASD unit.  The third issue is access to Gaelscoileanna.  These complex issues have required a considerable degree of complex work by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  I assure the Deputy that there is no unnecessary delay.  We are doing our very best to move this important legislation forward.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy Catherine Martin that I recognise the much wider role of guidance counsellors in providing guidance and counselling in respect of education and career options.  We are looking specifically at the career area to ascertain whether we should be thinking about additional things in that regard.  We want to see whether there are ways of supporting and building on resources outside the school system that could be very relevant and supportive.</p> <p>  I must defend the approach to special education that has been taken by the NCSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  Resources were increased by 40% during the most difficult years this country has experienced.  Provision for children with special educational needs has been expanded rapidly.  The NCSE works with parents and experts to identify the best placements for children.  When additional special needs units have been required in schools, they have been built at breakneck speed in public service terms.  The provision in this area has been more than doubled in the space of a small number of years.  The capital branch of my Department gives this area priority for funding.  The NCSE recognises that some of the models that are in place are not fit for purpose for the long term.  It has brought parents and stakeholders with it throughout its pioneering work in designing new models that are robust for the long term.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was involved in the difficult process of planning, which has worked.  We need to do the same in respect of other needs, as well as teaching needs, which children have when they come to school.  I appreciate that there are difficult cases.  I absolutely accept that.  Historically, very little provision was made in this area, but we have moved on and it is now a major priority.  Of course it is of great concern every time a child has difficulty getting a placement.  Deputies raise such cases and section 29 appeals are made.  We have a strong independent system under the NCSE.  We have given the NCSE its independence.  It advises us and we act on its advice.</p><p>We are seeking to make sure that every child with a special need has his or her needs met.  We have shown that the resources are going in to back that up.  </p></speech>

It is just extraordinary.  The comment should be withdrawn by the Minister.  A Government decision is required, not a decision by the trade unions.  The teachers' unions rejected the pay agreement at the time.  Perhaps the Minister will give us more details on those pay talks, to which I am not privy, and the suggestion that the unions did not fight for this.</p></speech>

We committed to a system of collective agreement within the public service.  That means the trade unions negotiate for the entire public service, right across every branch.  We do not have separate negotiations for some parts of the public service because they are intricately related.  We cannot give increases in one area without recognising the knock-on effects in other areas.  The work the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has done recognised the issue of new entrant pay is an issue right across the public service.  He set out what the cost is.  Some of that cost is in education but much of it is elsewhere.  He indicated he will sit down with the parties involved and discuss it.  As with every issue, if extra money is to be found for one thing it has to come away from somewhere else.  That is all I am saying.  There will have to be give and take on all of these discussions.  We cannot make any one thing an absolute requirement.  That is why we have negotiations and why we have collective agreements.  All of the public service unions recognise the value of these agreements to give certainty.  They are making provision for pay increases.  The trade unions decided in the negotiation that the lowest paid should get great priority.  That is the way the structure of the agreement was - there would be increases for everyone and they would be weighted more towards the low paid.  That is what they sought to negotiate.  We have to accept that was the approach that was taken.  It also recognised there are outstanding issues on new entrants' pay and to areas where there is difficulty recruiting.  Separate processes have been established for both of those and those processes are now in place under the agreement and they are proceeding.  As the Taoiseach indicated, following that report by the Minister there will be discussions and negotiations starting in the near future.</p></speech>

Traditionally, apprenticeships were in male-dominated areas.  As members are aware, they were mechanics, engineers, electricians, plumbers and so on.  What we are doing now is developing an entirely new suite of apprenticeships.  The 27 traditional ones are there still and we are seeking to develop over 50 news ones.  They are at various stages of development and 11 have gone live.  In those, we already see much more significant female representation.  The traditional trades are still the dominant element of the overall make-up of apprenticeships and that is what is reflected in the low participation.  The work we are doing will make it easier for women to get into traditional apprenticeships but will also broaden the scope of areas where apprenticeships can be obtained.  We have the ambition to very significantly change those numbers over the coming years.</p> <p>  A review of the national training fund is being undertaken.  It is due to be completed before summer.  The issue of the surplus is slightly different.  We can only spend in accordance with what is permitted under the fiscal rules.  The fact of a surplus in a particular fund does not allow us to spend it.  Under public spending rules, it is spending that is restricted.  We cannot run down a surplus and not regard it as spending under the spending rules.  The spending rules still constrain us.  It is being reviewed and the issue of how it is handled in a budgetary context is being examined.  Now that we are expanding the NTF and looking for additional contributions from employers, we want to ensure the purposes to which those funds are being put are transparent in the way they are reported and that their impact is shown.

Is it part of the SOLAS budget or the Department's budget, for example, to build Dunboyne College of Further Education in my constituency?  There are others.</p></speech>

It is an issue I have highlighted on numerous occasions in the past and, quite frankly, the same issues remain.  There is general underfunding of the third level sector.  What plans does the Minister have to increase funding from the State's purse?  Even if we look back at the Cassells report, whatever option is chosen at whatever point in time in the future still will require substantial extra resources from the Government.</p></speech>

With regard to subhead C11 on student grants and support, despite an overall increase in the budget attributed to the higher education sector this year, there has been a fall in the funding allocation under subhead C11 with regard to student support.  Why is this the case?</p> <p>  Last week in the D&aacute;il, along with other Deputies, I raised the fact that the lack of investment in student support is resulting in third level institutions pushing more and more of the burden onto students.  We saw this recently in the Trinity protests with regard to supplemental examination fees.  Only today we have seen that next year, the privately owned Shanowen Square in DCU will charge up to &euro;9,000 for nine months' accommodation.  It is not right and something needs to be done because the students are feeling too much of a burden because of a lack of investment and they are being forced to carry the cost.</p></speech>

Part of this is being funded through the national training fund.  There has been a significant increase in the higher and further education budget over the past two years.  There is, of course, the issue raised by Peter Cassells on whether we should move to a new income contingent loan scheme, and I know the committee recently wrote to me about this.  This clearly is another strand.  In terms of the issue of providing, as Peter Cassells sought, additional State funding and additional funding from employers, we have moved forward with this.  We have also indicated that over the next two years there will be additional increases on these from the Exchequer and the training fund source.  We are going ahead in making provision for additional funding.  We are also reforming the allocation model, so the way in which money will be allocated will be more equitable and more effective in promoting expansion and the goals we have set for the higher education system in terms of access and meeting skill needs.</p> <p>  In terms of the longer term, of course we have committed in the ten-year plan to a &euro;2.2 billion increase in the investment in capital at higher level and this is a massive increase.  As committee members know, the Exchequer fund provision up to the mid-term capital review was only &euro;110 million in Exchequer and &euro;200 million in public private partnerships.  This is a massive expansion of our commitment to the future investment in third level facilities on the capital side.</p> <p>  With regard to SUSI and grants, although we made some changes to improve the terms of access to grants, the main thing is the changes in the economy.  They are means-tested schemes and the proportion of people who are qualifying is down slightly as a result of the reduction in unemployment.  There has been some reduction in grant holders as a result of this but there has been no restriction in the terms of access in any of these areas.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, it seems the Minister does not have enough money to meet the demand for school places and, in particular, to meet the commitments his predecessor, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made in 2015.  Very little progress has been made on this particular capital plan.  The number of projects, as listed in the Estimates, which the Department has completed has dropped dramatically in recent years.  In 2015 there were 936 small extensions and upgrading of facilities in primary schools and this dropped to 600 last year.  In post-primary schools it dropped from 269 to 200.  This is a dramatic drop in works carried out in primary schools in the two-year period and a large drop at post-primary level.</p> <p>  There is also not just a creeping back of prefabs but a dramatic expansion of them under the Minister's reign, at the time when it is recognised my former colleagues, Batt O'Keeffe and Mary Coughlan, made progress to try to replace prefabs with classrooms.  Ruair&iacute; Quinn as Minister certainly spoke about it and some progress was made, but under the Minister's watch, the number of prefabs rented increased by 25.7% in one year, and it is an even larger increase since 2015.  What is the Minister's answer to this?  It is a disgraceful situation that it is happening.</p> <p>  I have to say I do not think the Department is at the races, with all due respect to everybody, on the increases in population.  I see it in my constituency.  I had reports today, for example, of Oldcastle, which is a rural town, where the secondary school is oversubscribed.  I never heard of that before in a rural town where there is not much other choice.  We know there is oversubscription in Dunshaughlin Community College also.  We know there is massive oversubscription in Ashbourne, and the Department has been notified by school principals in that town of their assessment of the absolutely unprecedented oversubscription.  I am speaking about my constituency because it is the one I know best, but I know Dunshaughlin has similar issues.  Not enough work is being done with regard to the houses that are being built.</p><p>A quick drive around many of these areas, whether in Meath, Kildare or Dublin, would show that houses are being built.  I am sure it is also starting to happen in Kilkenny and, perhaps, Sligo.  In towns in my constituency, such as Ashbourne, it is almost impossible to get a primary school place for a child above junior infants level.  One will not find a place for children in third or fourth class.  I am hearing from principals that it will be very difficult for some people to find places for junior infants next September.</p><p> I do not believe the Department has enough planning done and, crucially, I do not believe enough budgeting has been done.  This is shown by the substantial drop in the number of projects, the lack of progress on the schools building plan and the dramatic increase in the number of rented prefabs the Department is now using, shockingly, to deal with the issue.  We believed we had seen the last of them.</p></speech>

I welcome the introduction of physical education as a leaving certificate subject.  I find it remarkable, however, that not one request by a secondary school to build or operate a sports hall has been approved.  How is a school expected to deliver PE at leaving certificate level on an equal footing with another school if it simply does not have a PE hall?  A school in my constituency, Dublin&ndash;Rathdown, opened its doors in 1980 but, almost 40 years later, it still does not have a PE hall.  How many second-level schools do not have PE halls?  I have asked this question before.  I do not get a direct answer to parliamentary questions.  I am told that if a school does not have a hall, there are facilities for it in the community.  The school in my constituency is a DEIS school and it cannot afford to hire a bus to go to a community centre or swimming pool.  It should not have to use part of its double period of 80 minutes to do that.  It is not putting the school on a level footing with others.</p> <p>  I presume that, in the pilot programme the Department is running with 80 schools, at least one school with no PE hall is included so the Department can monitor and evaluate the fairness of the system.  How is it fair that schools do not have PE halls?  How will that work in terms of rolling out the new PE subject?  Has one of the schools with no PE facilities been chosen for the pilot programme so that  it might be evaluated?  This needs to be done in order to ensure the fairness of the system.  I just do not know how it works.  It is not fair on teachers or students.</p></speech>

Approximately 80 pilot schemes are in place.  I was very disappointed that there is none in my area.  I highlighted that to the Minister.

That is a substantial increase, of over 50%, since 2012.  For the period 2019 to 2021, a further &euro;70 million is being provided for the average of those years.  We are expanding, therefore.

We are providing places at double the rate that obtained when the Deputy's party was previously in government.  We have expanded.  Of course there are demands.  There is a growing number of children, particularly at second level, but also at primary level.  This is a period of very high demand for additional resources for new buildings.  We have had to prioritise new places above and beyond other areas of desirable capital expenditure.  That is why PE hall provision is not part of our capital expenditure programme at present.  As part of the capital plan, however, we have recognised that both PE halls and laboratory facilities require investment.  We will be investing but it will not be in the medium term.  In the immediate term, 80% of money must go towards getting places for the children who are coming through.</p> <p>  I have acknowledged there is more use of prefabs but there will be a programme of prefab replacement from 2019 onwards.  We have to use the money made available each year as best we can.  I assure the Deputies that we are investing more money and delivering significant major investments.  We have 200 new schools.  There are currently 85 projects under construction or progressing to construction this year.  Therefore, projects are continuing to flow through.  We never hand back a ha'penny of the money that is allocated to us.  We make sure that every penny in education capital that is allocated is spent.  That means building a supply chain of projects that are ready to roll.</p> <p>  On the issue of schools where there are demographic pressures, the Department is currently undertaking a demographic exercise to consider not only population trends, child benefit claims and the number of children in preschool but also the local authority housing projects that are in the pipeline, and it is factoring these data into the assessment of where new schools and new school accommodation are needed.</p></speech>

In the context of asking local authorities about housing developments, does the Minister know the nature of the question asked?  I have been told by local authority sources - I have not seen the letters so I should obtain them through a freedom of information request - that the Department asked how many developments with more than 100 houses were taking place.  Was that the question, or something along those lines?  It certainly would not be relevant.  There are many developments with smaller numbers of houses.  That is the word coming back to me.  There was certainly a lot of discussion among councillors in Meath on that particular point.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that the Minister and his officials spend every penny.  It always happens with this particular budget.  The truth, however, is that land costs will potentially eat up a considerable amount of the budget because they are rising all the time, as are construction costs.  Has the Minister told his colleagues in the Cabinet, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that he just does not have enough money and that, while he is spending every penny he has, the system will not be able to cope and is really falling back.  Has he asked for more money to deal with this?  It does not look like the Minister has done this.  The capital budget is greater than it was a few years ago but it is in the same ballpark.  The figures look similar.  I acknowledge there is an increase but it has been eaten up.</p> <p>  I am absolutely shocked about the position on prefabs.  The former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, famously had an official prefab replacement programme but so did other previous Ministers, Mary Coughlan and Batt O'Keeffe, although theirs was more under the radar.  The latter two individuals replaced a lot of prefabs also.  It is shocking that another prefab replacement programme must start because the number of prefabs has shot up dramatically.</p></speech>

We secured a commitment to provide additional money in each of those years.  As many as 85 projects will go through this year, and 340 projects have been completed which provides an additional 125,000 places.  That proves we are executing a programme but of course we could do more.  We would bring forward investment in physical education, prefabs and so on if more money was available.  In terms of the Estimates each year, we have won more money and we are using that money effectively.</p> <p>  I acknowledge, as the Deputy has mentioned, that site costs and building costs are rising.  That situation puts pressure on all budgets so we must cut our cloth according to the measure.</p> <p>  In terms of the resources that we receive, we must prioritise each year.  I think we are using our money as effectively as we can.  We have experimented very significantly with new methods of building to get more efficiency.  We have used the Office of Public Works, OPW, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, rapid build and the educational training boards, ETBs.  We have used a range of sources to ensure that our building programmes are executed effectively.  The Department is innovative in its approach.  </p> <p>  I am conscious that we can make valuable investments.  On a positive note, over the next ten years as much as &euro;8.5 billion will be spent on the schools investment programme.  That is a very significant financial commitment.</p></speech>

Can the Minister confirm whether all of those schools have a PE hall?  It would be useful if the Department compared the educational experiences of children who attend schools that have a PE hall with a school or schools that have no PE hall.  I ask the Department to make that comparison.  In advance of the official roll out of the new subject to all of the second level schools, will his Department conduct an audit so we can establish the exact number of second level schools that do not have a PE hall?</p></speech>

The Minister has used a new word for cuts.  He said the word "cut" at one point, which is what has happened with the capital budget.  Despite the number of places increasing, he said that we would have to "cut" our cloth according to the measure but, subsequently, he returned to using his buzzword "prioritise".   Prioritise is the new word for cuts.  The Department is not building as many PE halls, laboratories or school buildings as heretofore.  It is a priority rather than a cut, which is a new one on me.  He must approach his Cabinet colleagues and tell them that his Department is under pressure and, therefore, needs more money.</p> <p>  Yesterday, in a response to a written parliamentary question that I tabled, a list of seven schools was provided.  The schools have had to apply for planning permission on a second occasion because the original planning permission lapsed.  My attention was drawn to the matter because two of the schools are located in my area of County Meath.  They are: Whitecross national school near Julianstown and Lismullen national school.  I know I should not say anything about open planning files but both of the schools have had to apply again for planning permission.  The Department has blamed many people for the problems.  The fact that schools have had to renew planning permissions is a damning indictment of the capital programme. </p></speech>

Also, it has proven difficult to secure leases for some chosen sites.  Recently, a school was granted planning permission in my constituency.  Despite the fact that 15 years have elapsed since an agreement was reached, no lease has been signed for a site located in Monasterevin, County Kildare.  Therefore, meetings with local authorities are very important, particularly in terms of the growing demand for school places in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Meath, Cork and Galway due to growing populations.  Choosing the right site is crucially important.  We must ensure there are no impediments to building once a budget has been sanctioned and planning has been granted because tenders can be issued.</p></speech>

We have developed a very close working relationship with local authorities so that a protocol is in place.  They developing areas, identify sites where schools are needed and inform us because we are a notifiable party.  When they consider planning applications they notify us of their intentions or of the planning applications that have been submitted.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne has said, we consider the big projects or the projects funded by the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We consider instances where substantial money is being put in to release projects.  All of that information is taken into account when considering whether additional resources are needed, or get sites designated by the local authority or, indeed, acquired.  All over the country we have experienced difficulties working with local authorities.  Even with everyone wanting an outcome there are difficulties when acquiring or nailing down sites and it is a challenge.</p> <p>  On the issue of selecting schools to participate in the PE pilot scheme, Deputy Tony McLoughlin has raised this issue in the D&aacute;il.  As 360 schools applied for just 80 places the steering committee had to select schools in order to make sure there was a balanced mix of schools.</p> <p>  I will revert to Deputy Catherine Martin with a reply to her question on whether there is a school or schools participating in the pilot scheme that have no PE facilities.  In order to quality for participation the schools had to prove they had the facility to execute the programme.  I would say that a school that was not in a position to execute the programme would not be considered for the pilot scheme.  The pilot scheme is just the first phase and we want to test the model.  </p></speech>

We need to test some of the examination methods because new methodology will be introduced due to the way the subject will be examined.

We had a really interesting and good engagement with the European Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, a few weeks ago and we have spoken to fellow parliamentarians about an initiative from the Dutch Parliament on demanding more transparency in the context of Council and institution documents.  Dr. Cross has done some interesting work and research in this area, so we are looking forward to the engagement today.</p><p>Before we commence, I must advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Cross to make an opening statement and then we will have a question-and-answer session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Cross" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation.  I will address the issue of transparency and speak on the research I have done on this topic in the European Union and the Council of Ministers in particular.</p> <p>  Let me set out the context and what we mean by transparency, which will give members a grounding in the concept that will help the discussion.  The definition in the literature is that transparency is the availability of regime relevant information.  It is about the link between the internal politics of the European Union institutions and outside audiences, be they citizens, the media or indeed national parliaments.  There is an idea that there should be an ideal level of transparency that would allow outsiders to monitor the internal politics of any institution.  This ideal would give us information as outsiders about what is said at any given meeting, who said it, when it was said, why it was said and, probably most importantly, where information on all of the above can be found or, ideally, easily found.  The second point is that transparency on its own is not enough.  It is certainly a prerequisite for accountability but it does not guarantee it.  Just because we have information does not necessarily mean that decision makers will be held accountable.  It is certainly a prerequisite for doing so.</p> <p>  What is the EU's regulation on transparency?  It is the famous Regulation (EC) No. 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents states that all EU institutions should release all records relevant to the decision that they make and do so in a timely fashion.  When one reads it, one thinks it will lead to a very transparent decision-making process, but in Article 4 of the regulation, the exceptions are listed.  Most of the exceptions are pretty reasonable.  There are exceptions to transparency when it might affect: the public interest regarding public security, defence and military matters, international relations, the financial, monetary or economic policy of the Union or a member state; the privacy and the integrity of the individual; commercial interests; court proceedings and legal advice and inspections, investigations and audits.  There is also this idea that transparency can be denied when it is in the interests of protecting the institutions' decision-making processes.  That is a broad exception and it is used all the time to deny access to information.</p> <p>  How is this regulation being applied over time?  This is a figure taken from some research I did with a colleague that was published in 2015.  Members can see from the slide the position on Council transparency over a period.  The graph shows the percentage of documents that existed that were released at any given time.  Our first dotted line is when the Regulation (EC) No. 1049/2001 is agreed.  It came into force in May 2001.  As members will see, there is a significant drop in censorship over time at this point which we can relate to the regulation.</p><p>As we move from 1999, there is a decrease in the level of censorship and thus an increase in the level of transparency.  It only goes up to 2010, but I have no reason to think the picture has changed too much.  We see that, on average, between 80% and 90% of the documents produced by the Council are released.  This gives the impression that it is quite transparent, but I argue that that is probably not the case in practice.  We have access to the documents, but whether they are useful is an open question.  <br/><br/>The second graph indicates the number of days between a document being drafted and being released.  Again, the first two lines indicate where the transparency regulation came into effect.  We can see that at this point there is an increase in the timeliness of the release of information.  Therefore, we certainly had more timely access to records by 2001.  However, as we move through the years between 2001 and 2010, we see that, on average, there were still probably about 300 days between the drafting of a document - when it was available internally - and when it was publicly released.  As members can imagine, if takes 300-odd days, on average, to gain access to information, it will not be very useful in trying to keep up with negotiations that are current.  <br/><br/>What have been the overall effects of the 2001 regulation?  We certainly have more information than we had before, but as we have seen, records are not supplied in a timely manner.  As an outsider, this makes it really difficult to follow what is going on in the institutions.  <br/><br/>A second issue is that records fail to explicitly link the positions taken at meetings with the individual delegations that take them, that is if the positions taken are recorded at all.  If we look at the documents released, usually they are just drafts of the legislation under consideration, without much information on the positions delegations are taking.  That is problematic also.  <br/><br/>If an outsider wants to find information on ongoing discussions at the Council of Ministers, he or she must go through the document register which is Byzantine in nature.  I spent the time doing my PhD battling with this website and still do so today.  It is not intuitive.  It is difficult to navigate for someone who does not have the time and patience to go through it.  In practice, the level of Council transparency is not very high, despite the fact that all of these documents are available.  <br/><br/>Moving to the Ombudsman's recommendations, the good news is that the Ombudsman has flagged a lot of these issues.  The Ombudsman's report points out that records tend to be released after negotiations have finished when it is too late to do anything about a decision.  It also flags the overuse of the LIMITE status of documents, a way the Council it uses to keeps documents to be used for negotiation purposes only away from the public eye until a decision is taken.  The Ombudsman has flagged that there is inconsistent recording of delegations' positions.  Therefore, even when someone gain access to a given document or record, it does not tell him or her which delegations are taking which positions.  I have spoken about the Byzantine nature of the document register.  On the basis of these findings, the Ombudsman recommends that the Council take a more systematic approach to recording delegations' positions and needs to develop clear criteria for the use of LIMITE status and review documents given LIMITE status before negotiations conclude rather than looking after the fact at releasing them.  <br/><br/>What is my reaction to the report?  If implemented, would the recommendations actually improve the position?  It is important to note that there might be positive and negative effects.  Let us suppose we increase the level of transparency such that the Council gives better access to records and has better systems for recording delegations' positions.  Potentially there are positive effects because the increase in the level of transparency will increase the potential for publicity, for example, by outside media taking an interest in proceedings.  This, in turn, will help to advertise the decisions being made in a timely fashion and provide potential for accountability on the part of decision makers.  It would go some way towards addressing the potential democratic deficit about which we often hear in EU decision making.  <br/><br/>Another potential effect of increasing the level of transparency is that when actors take positions and know they will be on the record, they will generally be more credible.  Therefore, it would be harder to back away from position taken publicly.  Perhaps that is something we want.  <br/><br/>There would also be negative effects.  Increasing the level of transparency means that when decision makers are in meetings, they will know that there is a potential audience monitoring ongoing negotiations.  This would provide incentives to grandstand and take artificially extreme positions because they would be playing to a domestic audience.  This, in turn, could make reaching a compromise difficult.  If we want to have an efficient EU decision-making process, we want reaching a compromise to be easy.  <br/><br/>Another effect is that it could push the real negotiations outside the committee room.  If decision makers know that proceedings of a meeting will be on the record, what tends to happen is that they will broker a deal outside the room beforehand, go in and announce it.  Therefore, the quality of deliberations in the room can suffer.  <br/><br/>What about having less transparency or maintaining the <i>status quo</i>?  It would have the opposite effect.  If there was less transparency, there would be no potential audience and fewer incentives to grandstand.  This would be good and make reaching a compromise easier and there would be delliberations of better quality.  The negative effects also involve the opposite.  Less or no transparency means no potential publicity, no accountability and less democratic decision-making.  These are the things to consider when taking a position on transparency in negotiations at the Council and in general.  <br/><br/>What can I conclude?  The 2001 regulation has certainly worked.  The Council is more transparent than it was.  Is it transparent enough to hold decision makers accountable for the decisions they make and the positions they take?  I would say almost certainly not, given how the system is run.  Should the level of transparency be increased or should we pursue or advocate for increased transparency?  As I said, there would obviously be trade-offs and it would depend on one's perspective of them, but, in general, I argue that increased transparency would be better because it would provide for accountability.  We will always have exceptions in place.  That will allow for extreme situations where one needs to protect the decision-making process, but, in general, the Council should be encouraged to be more transparent and provide information on ongoing decision-making processes in a timely manner.  It is important to note that on its own transparency is not enough.  Just because we have access to information does not mean that citizens will become more engaged.  It is potentially the case that it could happen.  If someone is interested, he or she can find this stuff, but that is not a solution to the problem of the democratic deficit.</p></speech>

It was a most interesting presentation.  If those of us on the outside looking in and arguing for greater transparency had access to every document related to the European Union, would we be able to cope?  It is my view that we probably would not.  From Dr. Cross's use of the website, is it meta-searchable?  Can we cross-reference one search word to drag documents from the different parts of the European Union?  Is such a facility available?  If it was, what would the pick-up be?  I know that Dr. Cross studied for his PhD, but what about the nerds and keyboard warriors sitting in their bedroom late at night looking for things to prove once and for all that it is all a conspiracy and that "they" are out to do us one way or another?  I know that the Ombudsman has worked hard on the issue of transparency, but having attended European meetings, I can say that given the sheer volume of documentation produced - as I see Dr. Cross nodding his head, he obviously agrees with me - a person would need to be able to zone in on a specific topic just to follow it to hell and back.  Dr. Cross said it all for me when he said that on its own transparency was not the solution to the problem of the democratic deficit.</p><p>The democratic deficit is the current threat to the European project.  If we had every document under the sun, conspiracy theorists would still believe something was being held back.  When one is negotiating, one has to hold documents back.  Has Dr. Cross come to any conclusion as to how this will serve the public?  Moreover, does the public actually care? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#C00200"><p>I welcome Dr. Cross to the meeting and thank him for coming.  He has put a lot of work into this matter.  I can only offer my own practical experience.  It has been some time since I was in the Council of Ministers but I had responsibility, delegated by the Government, for the Single European Act, SEA.  At that time, I was not fond of too much transparency and scrutiny.  The British Government was represented there at the time, and we went around the table to deal with issues.</p> <p>  The situation then was that one went to Brussels the night before a Council meeting.  One would be briefed by the Irish ambassador and the advisers from each Department relevant to the negotiations.  The talks could concern an educational matter, such as recognition of qualifications.  They could concern telecommunications or freedom of movement of goods and services.  All sorts of derogations would be discussed.  The United Kingdom Government worked very well with the Irish Government on issues in regard to which we were basically in the same situation.  We worked together to get results.  Frankly, I do not know if too much transparency would be of great benefit to the member states.  However, I understand circumstances have changed and there is far more transparency now.  The late Dr. Garret Fitzgerald once said to me that when writing his memoirs he was sorry he did not keep all the documents from European Union negotiations during the Irish Presidency of the EU Council.  I said to him that nobody would want to read them, quite frankly, because they are boring documents, and there is an unbelievable amount of material.  I understand there is a bit more transparency now.</p> <p>  I do not know whether audio or visual recordings are made of meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Dr. Cross might be able to answer that.  I do not know whether such recordings available, which would be very transparent.  Many county councils, including Roscommon County Council, now record their entire meetings.  What happens at that level is very transparent, and it has changed the structure of the council.  I was watching a meeting the other day, and I was quite impressed by the contributions of the members when the cameras were there and the meeting was being published online.  What is happening there now?  I do not know the current situation.  I was in Brussels when Dr. Cross was completing his PhD.</p> <p>  This is an interesting and complex area.  People want more transparency.  That said, different countries have different approaches.  In the case of some Scandinavian countries, everything is agreed in discussions with Ministers before they go to Brussels.  There are no doubts about their decisions.  Denmark is one of the countries with very strong views.  What the Danish Government does and does not do is very transparent.  That is just my observation and  I would like to hear Dr. Cross's views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#C00300"><p>I thank our guest for carrying out the study, and for the presentation of his information.  My question concerns the benefits of total transparency in this area versus the negatives.  While it might contribute to democracy in one sense, it might create problems in another.  It has been suggested from time to time over the years that the more transparency is required, the less people in executive positions are inclined to take decisions and put their name on the line.  Is there a danger that a greater degree of transparency might slow down what is an already relatively slow process at European level?  Would the bureaucrats that we regularly complain switch from moving slowly to not moving at all?</p> <p>  Alternatively, they might move more quickly to seize the high ground on positions where it might not necessarily be beneficial to the member state.  For example, my colleague made reference to Danish and Swedish positions on certain issues.  Some years ago in this room I asked a delegation from Sweden how they reacted to a decision taken at the Council of Ministers.  I found out that the Swedish Minister was mandated by the European affairs committee in his homeland.  To my mind, that was not of any great benefit to the rest of the European Union.  We must consider how the Union works, and whether it works for the benefit of the entire Union, having regard to each of the constituent bodies, or works at the behest of a member state and its own particular, perhaps parochial, interests.  There would a danger of parochialism in those circumstances.  In the course of his examination, did Dr. Cross find evidence that a member state could influence decisions taken at meetings of the Council of Ministers to a huge extent, above and beyond their status?  I am worried about that, as I have previously expressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Cross" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#C00400"><p>I will start with the questions of whether just having access to information is enough and what we do with all of this information.  The <i>status quo</i>is that the provision of records is almost like an information dump.  The records are not well linked.  The European Parliament is slightly better, in that one can carry out meta searches and find the areas one is interested in.  The Council does not have this facility.  It provides records in permanent document format, PDF.  They are generally not searchable.  They are available in a document register.  Users can carry out keyword searches, but because it is not a very advanced document register, one invariably gets a thousand results for every search.  It is hard to sort what is relevant from all the other information.  It is almost as though by providing so much information the institution is becoming less transparent, because it is not clear what is relevant and what is not.  That is definitely a problem, and I think the EU Council could do a lot better by having a more intuitive search function to help explore the information than it does now.<br/><br/>If the whole process was made more transparent, could it be misused?  This recalls the famous image of the hacker sitting in his bedroom, looking to undermine the Union.  I do not think there is that much nefarious information in the documents as they currently stand.  Of course, the European Ombudsman is proposing to change that and wants positions to be better recorded than they currently are, and for the identities of those taking positions to be recorded.  That could give more information to individuals with nefarious ideas.  However, if the actors involved are taking positions that are against the public interest, that should be public information.  The overall benefit of making the process more transparent probably outweighs the costs. <br/><br/>Moving onto Senator Leyden's observations, I note that there is a difference with negotiations at the highest level, for example, those pertaining to the SEA.  Generally these are treaty negotiations and things like that.  They are never going to be very transparent, and that is because room for compromise is needed.  Access to that information will never be provided in a timely manner.  I would not endorse doing so, because I think it would do more harm than good.  It would open up issues that need to be negotiated in closed door settings, at least where high-level decisions are concerned.  However, we are not just discussing those negotiations, but also negotiations over secondary legislation, which I would say is much less politicised but also has a very important impact.</p><p>A huge percentage of Irish legislation now comes from Brussels, as we know.  We need information on how that was decided and whether our representatives fought the good fight, got their way and managed to influence people.  We do not have that at the moment.  We have no idea.  It is difficult to hold decision makers accountable for decisions.  That is true across the board whether one likes the decision or not.  </p><p> On the question of whether Council meetings are recorded, they are.  Anyone interested in such things can watch the proceedings of the European Council on its website.  However, if this was actually done, it would show some of the positive and negative effects of transparency that I mentioned in my opening statement.  The delegations will stand up and read out prepared statements.  There is no deliberation going on.  All the decisions have been taken outside of the room.  This is just representatives standing up and reading out positions.  Then there is a vote.  However, it all is pre-ordained, almost.  It is not very informative for anyone trying to follow how decisions are made.  </p><p> It is a pity because in theory, providing public access to these meetings is a good thing.  However, the effect is that decisions are taken outside of the room and then prepared statements are read out.  That is probably part of politics at the highest level.  Generally, what happens at the ministerial level is that much of the details have been threshed out by the working groups and the committee of permanent representatives, COREPER, beforehand.  We know little about how those decisions are made in those contexts and having a bit more transparency around those meetings would be very informative.  </p><p> The Scandinavians tend to be quite transparent.  They are used to the process of transparency and would say it is a better way of running Government.  The French have a different idea on transparency and access.  As has been said, there are these different cultures of transparency in Europe.  That is certainly the case.</p><p> On the costs and benefits on total transparency, Deputy Durkan is absolutely right.  When decision makers know they are on record, they are sometimes more reticent to take positions than they would be in closed-door settings, which can be problematic.  However, it can also be a good thing because at least we know the positions they are taking when they take them.  The point is that there is a trade-off in this regard and one must figure out what is one's position on that.  As for whether it can slow down negotiations, yes there is a lot of work extant suggesting that if transparency is increased, it can have a negative effect on the efficiency of decision-making processes.  We are back to the idea that when decision makers know they are on record, they are more reticent to take positions.  However, perhaps that is a good thing.  Perhaps the EU to date has been too good and too efficient at making decisions and it is putting out legislation that has not been debated properly and of which the public is not aware.  If the process was more transparent, and they were aware, then maybe these decisions might not be made.  That is another thing that has to be weighed up.  Efficiency has its costs as well.  It can lead to legislation and decisions that do not reflect the will of the people and what the citizens would be interested in.</p></speech>

Dr. Ivory presented to us a while back about the future of Europe and promised to return when IBEC had finalised its position and thinking on the issue.  We are glad to have him back here today with his associates.  Before we begin with Dr. Ivory's opening statement, I have to remind everybody of the rules of privilege in this Parliament.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I ask Dr. Ivory to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The debate on the future of the EU 27 has gathered significant momentum since the Commission published a White Paper on the future of Europe a little over a year ago.  The position of Ireland and Irish business in this debate is critical, particularly given current and upcoming challenges posed by Brexit.  I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee again to present IBEC's document, "Ireland in the EU: A dynamic future", which sets out the priorities of Irish business for the future of Europe.  IBEC launched this document in Brussels last week at a joint IBEC-EPP event in the European Parliament, hosted by Sean Kelly, MEP.  The event, with over 300 guests, was addressed by some of the EU's most influential figures, including: Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament; Jyrki Katainen, European Commission Vice-President for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness; Phil Hogan, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development; and Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit.  Mr. Julian King, European Commissioner for the Security Union and former British ambassador to Ireland also attended the event.  IBEC is the only Irish business group with such reach and influence and Michel Barnier restated his deep commitment to working with us to reach the best possible outcome in the Brexit negotiations.  Following the event, IBEC had a series of meetings with the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU and the European Commission, including with officials responsible for engagement with Ireland under the European semester process.</p> <p>  IBEC has been closely monitoring the debate on the future of Europe as it unfolded over the last year in Brussels and across EU capitals.  We carefully analysed the Commission's White Paper and subsequent reflection papers.  I was pleased to address this committee following President Juncker's state of the EU speech last September to outline our initial thoughts.  Since then, IBEC has met with the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, and her senior officials on several occasions to discuss Brexit and the future of Europe.  We took note of the Taoiseach's address at European Parliament plenary in Strasbourg where he was the first EU Head of State to outline his Government's position on the future of the European project.  Throughout this process, IBEC has been in constant touch with our members, ensuring that Irish businesses are up-to-date on the future of Europe debate and, indeed, that they recognise the value of contributing to this crucial debate at such an important juncture in the EU's history.  We truly believe that this is an opportunity to shape the future of the EU, which has a profound effect on our entrepreneurs and consumers alike, the way we do business, and the way we, as both Irish and EU citizens, live our lives.  A key issue will be to identify how, together, we can all work to achieve shared objectives.</p> <p>  The paper that I present to the committee today encapsulates the carefully considered views of IBEC members from SMEs to multinational corporations and across all sectors of Irish business and industry.  The resounding view of our members is that membership of the EU, both today and in the future, is of huge importance both for their individual businesses but also for the Irish economy.  One key message of our paper is that the EU is not broken.  Despite all its challenges, the EU remains a model of global success.  Now is not the time for a major change in direction and now is not the time to be distracted by a protracted debate about the constitutional architecture of Europe.  Instead, we must use the institutions we have to effectively deliver a better, more prosperous future for all our citizens.</p> <p>  In this context, the EU must continue to focus on positive reform.  We need greater cooperation in areas where there is a clear collective benefit and where the EU can deliver added value.  That also means less integration in areas where member states are best placed to act and to tailor policy to different country needs.  To be more precise, the major underpinning of our report is that all EU policy should be carried out with a few core principles at its heart.  First, all EU legislation should be crafted with reference to the innovation principle.  Innovation underpins the success and prosperity of the EU, especially the Single Market.  We believe that all EU policy should be designed with the innovation principle at its core, meaning that whenever policy is developed, the impact on innovation is fully assessed.  The principle should be applied by EU policymakers and legislators to ensure that any new policies and laws help to foster and facilitate innovation rather than hamper it.  For Europe to lead the world in science, technology, design, medical advancements, etc., we need to ensure the Union provides a suitable environment for the development of new ideas which bring economic and societal benefits.   The innovation principle should therefore ensure that new ideas are stimulated, not stifled in the EU.</p> <p>  The second area we emphasise involves the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which are key tenets of the EU treaties.  IBEC believes these principles should continue to be championed by EU policymakers into the future.  The distribution of legislative responsibility between the member states and the EU is a critical issue for Irish business and our partners across Europe.  We want the EU to act only in those areas where it has a proven value-add, and to refrain from legislating in those areas which are matters of member state competence.  In this regard, we welcome President Juncker's recent initiative to establish a task force on subsidiarity and proportionality and encourage this task force to engage with business to fully understand the potential impact of regulation on economic growth.  The future EU should continue to fully respect member state sovereignty and intervene only in the areas where the EU brings added value.  The principles I have just mentioned should be seen as a common thread which is woven through policy cycles of all EU-led initiatives.</p> <p>  Further to these core principles, our report outlines six areas of priority, or guiding principles, which we have the identified as areas where the EU can add real value.  While those priorities are outlined in greater detail in the report, I enumerate the six as follows to provide the committee with a flavour of what is involved.</p> <p>  First is an EU that unleashes the potential of the Single Market and digitalisation.  We want the EU institutions to build on what has already been achieved and complete the Single Market and digital Single Market.  This is also true for the capital markets union, the banking union and the economic and monetary union.  Completion of these big wins will allow for economic growth, job creation and a rise in living standards for our citizens.  Second is an EU that leads the world in trade and investment.  Ireland is the perfect example of how globalisation can bolster an economy.  We have benefitted hugely from having an open approach to international trade, become a leading exporter, and benefit from multinational investment in a wide range of sectors in a relatively short period of time.  The EU should continue with this open approach, building international partnership with strategic investors, pursuing ambitious free trade agreement in a balance manner.  This includes ensuring trade in services is a top priority when it comes to free trade agreements.  It also means that a new trading relationship with the UK should be as close as possible to current situation.</p> <p>  Third is a dynamic EU that embraces a competitive taxation policy.  The EU must respect member state sovereignty when it comes to decision-making on all taxation matters.  A competitive taxation policy will ensure that member states have the tools to keep their economies innovative and competitive.  Supply chains, business operations and transactions are now global and increasingly Internet-based.  Any change to current taxation arrangements should be carried out at a multilateral level to mirror this, such as through the OECD's BEPS project.</p> <p>  Fourth is an EU that respects member state competency to design labour market and social policy.  Having too much labour and social policy catered for at an EU level will leave citizens feeling disenfranchised and isolated from policymakers.</p><p>The EU should continue to ensure that member states have autonomy in designing bespoke labour market and social policy which can best consider nuances in societal culture, local labour market realities, demographics and citizens&rsquo; needs. <br/><br/>Fifth is an EU that champions better regulation.  Poorly designed policy, legislation and regulation add to the cost of doing business and are obstacles to job creation, growth and prosperity.  This can be remedied through the Commission&rsquo;s continued commitment to the better regulation agenda, promoting better and more effective legislation across the EU institutions.  We are asking that the EU institutions continue to use platforms such as the REFIT programme to ensure that regulation is designed in a way which is growth enabling and does not infringe upon competitiveness in the EU economy.<br/><br/>Finally, the sixth priority should be an EU that ensures fiscal rules are in tune with all member states.  The individuality of member states&rsquo; needs should be considered at European level.  Each state has a diverse and nuanced set of requirements which should be considered by EU policymakers.  We want to see a robust, rules-based approach to spending, but capital investment projects should be treated significantly more favourably.  This is of particular import in the current Irish context.  Ireland needs to invest more now in essential infrastructure to ensure we are well equipped to face current and future challenges in vital areas such as housing and transport.  The EU&rsquo;s policies should reflect this.<br/><br/>Of course, how the EU divides its finances is ultimately the best indication of where its priorities lie.  An essential element of our future of Europe paper is IBEC's positioning on the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, of the EU, on which the Commission will publish its first proposal in May for the post-2020 period.  IBEC has three key priorities for the MFF post 2020.  The MFF post 2020 should be big on big things and small on small things, and dedicate money only in areas in which the EU has real value and can achieve tangible results.  IBEC believes that the EU should increase funding in research and innovation.  The EU needs to be a global leader when it comes to spending on research, development and innovation.  Currently, we are lagging behind our international competitors when it comes to research intensity, spending only 2% of GDP on research and innovation compared with 3.6% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.  This needs to change if we are to maintain global competitiveness and lead the way in new technologies. Spending on research and innovation must be bolstered in the MFF post 2020.  We also need to uphold current commitments to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP,<i></i>and other areas of traditional spending which have a proven added value.  The EU must not underestimate the importance of spending in these traditional areas.  In the Irish context, continued commitment to the CAP is essential not only to ensure the quality of the produce which is essential to our food and drink sector, but also in protecting our rural communities and bridging the urban-rural divide.  Of course, a major challenge to the MFF post 2020 will be the significant drop in contributions once the UK exits from the Union.  How this shortfall is made up is ultimately a political decision, but we are asking that the EU pays close attention to the three aforementioned priorities.<br/><br/>It would be impossible to speak about the future of the EU without mentioning Brexit.  Indeed, the departure of the UK from the EU presents an unprecedented and profoundly unwelcome challenge to the Europe we know, but we also believe that the UK will continue to be a vital partner in our future relationship with the EU.  In that context, I wanted to restate IBEC&rsquo;s priorities for Brexit.  First, it wants a smooth exit, and not a cliff edge.  Second, comprehensive transitional arrangements should be in place.  We welcome the progress that was made at last week's European Council in this regard.  Third, IBEC wants the closest possible relationship with the UK in the future.  There is much detail to be worked out to achieve this.  Finally, unique Irish challenges must be addressed, such as the Border issue between the North and South.<br/><br/>This year marks 45 years of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU.  Since joining in 1973, our economy and society have experienced many challenges and faced many hurdles.  Ultimately however, EU membership has helped Ireland build an open and resilient economy.  Irish businesses enjoy unfettered access to the world&rsquo;s largest single market.  Irish citizens can work and live freely in any other EU member state and Irish companies can employ talented people from across the EU.  Trading in the EU bloc has also helped Irish companies avail of market access opportunities in previously untapped global markets.  Irish farmers have benefited from CAP funding, which in turn has supported the development of a world-class food and drink sector.  Being part of the EU has also helped Ireland become the dynamic innovative economy that it is today in areas such as biopharmaceuticals, medical technology and services, particularly computer services.  Irish business remains committed to the EU project and we are proud to help shape the conversation as to how the EU will continue to grow and develop into the future.<br/><br/>I thank the members here for their work on this important committee and I look forward to engaging with them further as the debate on the future of Europe continues to mature throughout the coming weeks and months and into the new legislature of the European institutions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#F00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  IBEC is a very dynamic organisation, and many former members and employees are playing a very important role in European affairs at the moment.  It is a great training ground for people.</p> <p>  This document, Ireland in the EU: A Dynamic Future - The Priorities of Irish Business for the Future of Europe, is very well presented.  It is very easy to read and is a great document for people who are involved in negotiations, including the Government.  It serves as a handbook of the facts and outlines the benefits of Ireland's membership of the European Union for the past 45 years.</p> <p>  There is no point in further regretting what is happening with the UK, but I am confident that there will be an agreement at the end of the day that will benefit North and South.  It is absolutely in our interests, as we all know, and there is a great deal of goodwill towards us from the other 26 member states of the European Union.  This committee, through our Chairman and our secretariat, have a very active role in relation to the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC.  We are meeting Georgians later today, and our Chairman is meeting another ambassador as well.  We have very close relations and friendships with them and regularly have negotiations and discussions.  Our committee has just returned from a meeting in London.  We attended from Sunday until last night.  We met Members of the UK Parliament and Members of the House of Lords.  That is the kind of work that is being done here regularly.  In politics, relations are vital, and direct one-to-one contact, not just phone contact, is essential.</p> <p>  I am interested in the finding that 90% of IBEC members believe that future membership of the European Union will be important for their businesses.  That is a fact.  Some 65% of others also feel that way.  A very high percentage of people in business realise the benefit of access to that market of 475 million people once the UK leaves.</p> <p>  The only other problem that arises is the potential for a trade war.  That has been averted so far.</p><p>As the witnesses know, negotiations between the United States of America and China are under way and they will have serious repercussions for those regions.  This may, in turn, have a knock-on effect.  A trade war would be damaging to the whole world.  It is a case of back to the future.  The United States of America has a very open economy and it has been a most successful economy.  Perhaps it has not kept up pace in certain respects - for example, the changes in the field of competition.  Nevertheless, IBEC is probably monitoring this situation and international news relating to it very carefully.  The first concern was that there could be a tariffs on alcohol - bourbon and other American drinks - and that this would have repercussions for the Irish drinks industry.  That would be a most regrettable situation, so everything that can be done to avert it must be done.</p><p> It is very important IBEC has an office in Brussels and links all over Ireland and into Brussels, the most important place.  IBEC could mount a most successful seminar, meeting all the key players.  The witnesses should have no doubt about the impact such events have on the decision makers.  Irrespective of meetings with the Government, Ministers, Deputies, Senators and so on, having a non-governmental agency such as IBEC there representing industry is vital.</p><p> I say "Well done" to Dr. Ivory on his presentation.  There is an ongoing discussion regarding the issues raised.  IBEC has published this document already, but the presenting of it today - and the witnesses' presence has been recorded all over the House - is a very good step in the right direction.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I have no real questions because all the answers are in this document in a very comprehensive way.  I welcome the witnesses and urge them to continue their excellent work on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018032800002#G00300"><p>I am not known for my brevity but I will do my best.  Like Senator Leyden, I welcome Dr. Ivory and his colleagues to the meeting and compliment IBEC on the continuously and consistently positive role it has played in the commercial life of this country and in its relations with other European and non-European countries.  IBEC continues this role, which is a theme that runs through this report.  I take this opportunity to compliment IBEC and the business sector for the ability they have shown to identify the issues, never to be negative and to put forward suggestions in a way that makes it possible for them to be accepted by others.  I wish to go quickly through the positive reforms to which we will all contribute and the need to recognise the needs of individual member states.  The only downside of this is that if we resort to the individual preferences of all member states, it will be very difficult to find a consensus.  I emphasise that in those areas there is a tendency for member states - and the people within member states - to adopt a them-and-us attitude and, instead of taking ownership of the European project, to stand offside and consider Europe as if it is something they should criticise from without as opposed to reforming it positively, like IBEC does, from within.</p> <p>  I have similar concerns about the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  I hope it is not the thin end of the wedge to target individual member states, particularly smaller ones like Ireland.  I am concerned that, for example, an area that is recognised as the total preserve of the individual member state has now been dragged into the area of competition and state aid and is being examined by other EU Commissioners.  We know there is a report pending which will have an impact in respect of the so-called Apple tax.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a jealously of the 12.5% corporation profits tax this country has enjoyed and promoted recently - indeed, promoted for other countries.  We do not wish to restrict it to ourselves.  This is very important because the smaller countries have difficulty enough competing with their bigger brothers.  In the old days, the bilateral trade agreements always benefited the bigger countries.  That was the way it was.  A certain well-known global politician some time ago said it is a good deal when his country wins.  That does not augur so well for the trade negotiations which we hope will be positive.</p> <p>  Dr. Ivory's comments on the MFF are correct.  We need to keep the pillars in place that have worked well and on which we depend and not to allow ourselves to be hustled by those who might suggest to us that it is not democratic or that it does not give us all the same chance.  Each individual member state across Europe has different requirements, and that is as it should be because they are in different geographic locations.  For example, it is not so easy for us to get through the centre of Europe without taking an aircraft or a ship.  Most other European countries, with the exception of the one that is now leaving, do not have this problem at all.  It is of huge economic benefit to be able to sit into a truck and drive where one wants to drive to, even outside the Union if necessary, to Moscow and so on.  We cannot do that.  We should never allow it to be underestimated that we are an island nation which, it appears, will be located off the coast of another island that will no longer be a member of the European Union.</p> <p>  The final point I wish to make concerns Brexit.  I compliment IBEC's comments on this and references to it in the report.  I believe that the Irish economy has the resilience, the ability and the stability to meet the challenges ahead.  There are challenges ahead, but I believe we can meet them.  We must be cautious and careful not to take steps which might damage our competitiveness and our access to the European markets and might bring us back to a greater dependability on our next-door neighbour, notwithstanding the good relation we have with it and the need to keep that good relationship in the future.  It is of equal importance that the European Union has a relationship with the UK after Brexit that is such that it will benefit both.  If it does not, the European Union is at stake and will disappear.  If a country leaves the Union and benefits trade-wise as a result, no country worth its salt will want to remain behind, so we will all be in trouble then.</p> <p>  The point I am trying to make is simply that there is a lot at stake but I believe we will survive and believe that the island, North and South, which IBEC has emphasised time and again, is important.  There is a tendency to believe that by some kind of shuffle this will disappear in the latter stages.  It will not, nor could it, nor should it.  This island has benefited greatly from the peace it has enjoyed over the past 20 years or so.  It will benefit greatly in the future from the continuation of that peace.  There are those who might see an advantage for a time to draw lines not in the sand but critical lines that would impede the trade and commerce taking place now and which will continue in the future.  That would be a very dangerous and retrograde step.  In that context, we must always keep in mind where we came from.  What we have now is immeasurably better, regarding both Europe and the North-South relationship in this country, and we should strive to keep it, improve it, develop it and encourage its evolution because the alternatives, from what we have seen, are not great.</p></speech>

I wish to respond.  I thank the members for the very gracious comments they made about IBEC's work and our document.  We focus not only on the policy coherence and the evidence-based recommendations we make, but also on communicating those in the most effective manner to have the greatest impact on behalf of Irish business, particularly at a European level.</p><p>There has been a very good response to our communication documents and the evidence we put forward in the policy recommendations.  I thank the Deputy for his very gracious comments.  </p><p> We continue to have grave concerns about the CCCTB proposal and the action taken by the Commission in this area.  The proposal has been talked about for many years at European level.  We expressed our concerns vocally in our meetings with the European Commission last week and other fora and continue to work on the issue with our strategic business partners at a European level.  I agree with Deputy Bernard J. Durkan that our concerns are shared by other smaller member states which also believe these initiatives are to the disadvantage of member states with small domestic economies and to the advantage of member states with much larger populations and domestic markets.  We continue to voice our concerns in Brussels about the development of these proposals and our objections to their adoption in their current format.  </p><p> One of the key aspects of our report which I have mentioned is that taxation matters should be determined at member state level in the context of member state sovereignty.  In that regard, we are also very concerned not only about the proposal on digital taxation but also its timing.  As Senator Terry Leyden mentioned, relations between the European Union and the United States are very delicate.  In that context, we have grave concerns about the proposal on digital taxation which was issued last week by the European Commission.  In conjunction with our business partners in Europe, we have made very clear our view that issues such as digital taxation should be dealt with at a multilateral level through the OECD which has been proved, through the BEPS process, to deliver results.  That is where we believe these conversations and actions should take place.  We are very concerned that the European Union might consider taking unilateral action before that conversation has been completed at the OECD.  We believe it is worth giving proper consideration to these issues.  We recognise that the world is changing, that digitalisation is a feature of all economies and that these issues must be considered.  We need to come to a better understanding of them and IBEC is working with its partners in the business and industry advisory committee at the OECD to try to do that.  We are working to arrive at a better understanding of digitalisation, how technology, global supply chains and digital trade work.  We will be travelling to Paris in April for some detailed meetings with the OECD in that regard.</p><p> Senator Terry Leyden made reference to the potential for a trade war between the European Union and the United States, something about which we are very concerned.  IBEC has made submissions on it, as have our sector associations which are very concerned about any list of retaliatory products being drawn up by the European Commission.  Senator Terry Leyden specifically mentioned bourbon, but exports of Irish and European whiskey to the United States exceed, by a factor of five, European imports of bourbon from the United States.  We believe it would be a very high risk strategy to get involved in a tit for tat trade war.  We have spoken directly to the Commission about this.  I have also spoken to the officials who are putting the list together.  IBEC and its sector groups have made formal submissions to the Commission and have raised the issue at our meetings with it.  The week before last our CEO, Mr. Danny McCoy, and the executive director team of IBEC travelled to the United States for a series of meetings with strategic business partners, including the US Chamber of Commerce.  We also had a meeting with the Taoiseach when he was in Washington.  IBEC had meetings with the US Department of Commerce and the Unites States trade representative, USTR, to emphasise our particular concerns about the direction of US trade policy and to reaffirm our long-term commitment to having a strong relationship between Ireland and the USA, as well as a strong relationship between the European Union and the USA.  We have been encouraging our strategic business partners in the United States and the officials of the Administration whom we meet to try to ensure the United States will continue to take a leadership role in seeking to have open trade and investment across the world.  This is an area in which we will continue to work.  When our CEO met Mr. Wilbur Ross in the Department of Commerce, he made these very points to him and his officials.  We are pleased that a decision has been made to temporarily exempt the European Union from the measures President Trump and the White House have introduced or are about to introduce.  However, we believe the temporary nature of the exemption means that there is still significant work to be done.  We will be working closely with our colleagues at European level, as well as the European Commission, on this issue.  We will also be working with our contacts in the US Administration in Washington and New York.</p></speech>

Pernod Ricard, the French company, owns the Jameson brand and Irish Distillers.  In that context, it is very important that the IBEC equivalent in France come on board through its network.  I launched the Jameson brand in Japan on behalf of Pernod Ricard.  Its growth - it is just one of many products owned by Pernod Ricard - has been massive in the United States.  Exports from Europe of Jameson whisky are among the fastest growing.  In that context, a trade war would have a very dramatic effect.</p></speech>

We have also made direct contact with the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan; his head of Cabinet, Mr. Peter Power, and other officials to make sure they fully understand our particular concerns.  We have found Mr. Hogan and his team to be very receptive.  The work being done there is positive.  We have also made our views clear to the European Commissioner for Trade, Ms Malstr&ouml;m, and her team</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The purpose of this meeting is scrutiny of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on health technology assessment and amending Directive 2011/24/EU with representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Information and Quality Authority and from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  As we are obliged to vacate this room at 1.15 p.m. I ask members to put questions that are succinct.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, Mr. Finian Judge and Ms Laura Nagle from the Department of Health; Dr M&aacute;irin Ryan and Dr. Conor Teljeur, from the Health Information and Quality Authority; and Dr. Lesley Tilson and Dr. Emer Fogarty from the National Centre of Pharmacoeconomics.  Before we begin, I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that their opening statements may be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>Before I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements, I am aware that France and Poland consider that the proposed regulations do not comply with the principle of subsidiarity and that Germany has some concerns about the proposal.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to this meeting.  I am accompanied by Mr. Finian Judge and Ms Laura Nagle from the Department of Health primary care division.  I will endeavour to set out for the committee the importance placed on health technology assessments, HTAs, in Ireland, the processes we have in place for their delivery and some considerations with regard to the Commission's proposal.<br/><br/>From a policy perspective, the Department regards the availability of high quality, timely and cost-effective HTAs as an extremely important factor in the delivery of health services.  HTAs can help provide answers as to whether medicines are a better treatment for a certain disease, whether a new scanner will lead to a better diagnosis or if innovative surgery will improve a patient's treatment.  In summary, HTA is a procedure for assessing the added value of new medicines and medical devices.  The importance of ensuring that resources are directed correctly within the health service to where they can provide the most benefit cannot be overstated.  HTAs are, therefore, a key element in the ongoing evolution of the Irish health system and one of the vital inputs used to inform decision-makers when considering whether and when to commence using a particular new medical technique or treatment, or, on occasion, when it can be considered that a treatment has become obsolescent and can be withdrawn from use.<br/><br/>Currently in Ireland, HTAs are primarily conducted by two bodies, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, the NCPE, representatives of which are here today and will be able to provide further detail on the technical aspects of HTA and specific considerations that they may have with regard to the proposed EU regulation.  The NCPE provides HTA advice to the HSE drugs group on drugs for reimbursement under the community drugs schemes.  In addition to undertaking HTA on a national basis, Ireland has long been involved in international co-operation efforts.  Currently, there are two EU HTA co-operation mechanisms, the European Commission<i></i>Health Technology Assessment Network and the European network of HTA, known as EUnetHTA.  The joint work proposed under the regulation will focus only on clinical aspects of health technology assessments.  The assessment of more specific HTA domains, including economic, organisational, ethical and decision-making on pricing and reimbursement will remain a member state competence.  Assessment of these domains could be carried out jointly by member states on a voluntary basis but this would lie outside the remit of the regulation.<br/><br/>I understand that the committee has particular queries on issues surrounding orphan drugs and drug pricing more generally.  In this respect, the Department has received the committee's report on the evaluation of orphan drugs, which is welcome and currently under examination in the Department.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions under a number of publicly funded community drug schemes, including the general medical services, GMS, the long-term illness, LTI, scheme, the drug payment scheme, DPS, and the high tech arrangement in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  In considering an application for reimbursement, the Act requires the HSE to consider detailed criteria when making decisions around reimbursement and pricing, including the health needs of the public, clinical need, cost effectiveness, potential or actual budget impacts, safety, efficacy, effectiveness and added therapeutic benefit versus standard therapies, availability and suitability, the level of clinical supervision and the resources available.  The legislation, as passed by the Oireachtas in 2013, does not make separate provision for orphan drugs.</p><p>Likewise, there is no separate provision or distinct criteria for the assessment of orphan drugs.  </p><p> HSE decisions are supported by HTAs which systematically assess whether a drug is both a clinically effective and a cost-effective health intervention.  Most new medicines, including orphan medicines, undergo HTAs.  The NCPE has a standardised process and criteria for the evaluation of pharmaceutical products, including orphan drugs.  The final decision for reimbursement is made by the HSE drugs group or HSE leadership.  I understand that one of the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s report is to change the process and criteria for the assessment of orphan drugs.  As the committee has acknowledged, this would require legislative change.  </p><p> From a policy perspective, we view the Commission&rsquo;s proposal as in keeping with the approach that has been taken for the past several years, multiplying the relatively small HTA capacity which Ireland operates through uniting with other European agencies and gaining access to the assessments which our partners have completed.  The financial support of the Commission for this HTA work is also noteworthy. </p><p> Ireland has been an active participant in these HTA co-operation mechanisms.  The regulation has been brought forward by the European Commission due to the fact that the current arrangements will expire in the coming years and a revised approach will be required for the period beyond 2020.  The proposal will see co-operation among member states on the production of joint relative effectiveness assessment reports, which are reports focused only on the clinical aspects of a particular technology.  These reports would then be used by individual member states as the basis of their economic assessments, which in turn would inform decisions on pricing and reimbursement. </p><p> In our contacts with the Commission, including during the visit to the Department of Health last November, while outlining our general support for the regulation, we have emphasised the importance of ensuring the quality of assessments undertaken by the various national bodies are of a sufficient standard.  The need for access to the relevant information from technology companies and for the HTA to be timely has also been expressed.  Our understanding is that the process of undertaking HTA will continue to be driven by the member states, particularly those with experience of HTA.  Methodologies and tools to be used by the agencies undertaking HTA will be agreed.  </p><p> There are potential efficiencies and benefits within these proposals where a small country like Ireland will be able to access, participate in and lead HTAs across member states.  This will, hopefully, minimise duplication and build a stronger HTA function across Europe.  The Department of Health recognises that Ireland has a good reputation across member states on HTAs and indeed has played a leadership role in establishing strong standards for HTA assessment. </p><p> In conclusion, there are many benefits for Ireland with this proposal including early access to robust evaluation of clinical evidence.  However, key to this is trust in the proposed joint working arrangements for HTAs across member states.  That will require adherence to and monitoring of minimum quality assurance standards for HTAs. </p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present this opening statement and we will endeavour, with our HIQA and NCPE colleagues, to address the committee&rsquo;s considerations.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by HIQA&rsquo;s chief scientist, Dr. Conor Teljeur.  We were invited to the committee to discuss the proposed regulation on health technology assessment, published by the European Commission in January of this year.  I will begin by defining health technology assessment, HTA, outlining HIQA&rsquo;s role in HTA, describing HTA activity undertaken to date and detailing how efficiency is achieved through international collaboration.  I will then describe the anticipated impact on HIQA of the proposed regulation on HTA.</p> <p>  HTA is a multidisciplinary, scientific, research-based activity that collates all of the information that decision-makers need to support evidence-based decisions.  HIQA&rsquo;s HTA process is independent, transparent, impartial and robust and aims to ensure maximum public confidence.  Health technology assessment is a tool used to comprehensively assess new and existing technologies and ensure that relevant reimbursement, investment or disinvestment decisions are informed by the best available evidence.  For the purposes of HTA, technologies include drugs, devices, procedures, diagnostics and public health interventions. </p> <p>  HIQA holds the statutory function for health technology assessment in accordance with the Health Act 2007.  The purpose of HIQA&rsquo;s HTAs is to develop independent, scientific advice in line with international best practice.  The advice is then provided to the Minister for Health or the HSE to inform a decision on reimbursement or investment. </p> <p>  Currently HIQA conducts comprehensive HTAs to inform national health policy and health service decisions.  HTAs typically address clinical aspects of the technology, cost-effectiveness and budget and resource impacts and also domains covering organisational, ethical, social or medico-legal issues.  Demand for HTA advice from HIQA greatly exceeds capacity to deliver, thus a formal prioritisation process was implemented in 2014. </p> <p>  All HTAs are undertaken by HIQA staff, with occasional input from external experts as necessary.  All HTAs are undertaken in compliance with a comprehensive quality assurance framework aligned to international best practice.  An expert advisory group comprising representation from all relevant stakeholders, including, for example, clinicians, patients, decision-makers, HTA and international experts, is convened for each HTA to inform the assessment.  Oversight is provided by the board of HIQA. </p> <p>  For HTAs on topics of public interest, a targeted and public consultation is undertaken prior to completion of the assessment.  Technology providers are also invited to make submissions on their product, which may be used to inform the HTA.  </p> <p>  The final draft report is approved by the board of HIQA and published on HIQA&rsquo;s website within one week of approval.  Examples of HTAs conducted to date at the request of the Minister for Health include BCG vaccination; smoking cessation interventions; and an ongoing HTA on the HPV vaccine for boys.  Examples of HTAs conducted to date at the request of the HSE include HPV DNA as the primary screening test for cervical screening and mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusive stroke.</p> <p>  New health technologies are frequently considered for investment in many countries concurrently or within a similar timeframe.  This offers the opportunity for joint production of HTA information, while economic models developed for one jurisdiction may be adapted to reflect health care delivery models in another.  The conduct of HTA requires substantial staff resources, but equally many of the elements of a HTA are ideal for sharing across national borders.  To minimise duplication of effort and to maximise our efficiency, almost all HTAs carried out by HIQA to date have leveraged off work conducted elsewhere by updating evidence reviews or adapting economic models.  Equally, evidence reviews and models developed by HIQA have been used by other European agencies.  Strong positive relationships with other HTA agencies enable this collaboration.</p> <p>  Since 2007, HIQA has represented Ireland on the EU-funded joint action projects on HTA conducted by the European network of HTA, EUnetHTA.  The objective of EUnetHTA is to facilitate effective and sustainable HTA collaboration that brings added value at both the European and national levels.  I am the chairperson of the assembly of EUnetHTA members and participate in the executive board.  HIQA actively contributes to EUnetHTA&rsquo;s work, for example, HIQA was the lead author of a European rapid assessment of endovascular therapy using mechanical thrombectomy devices for acute ischaemic stroke.  I also represent Ireland on the Health Technology Assessment Network.  This is a permanent network of HTA agencies established by the European Commission with the objective of fostering permanent strategic and scientific collaboration on HTA across the EU from 2020 onwards.  European collaboration on HTA across Europe has culminated in the development of the proposal for a HTA regulation, which I will now discuss. </p> <p>  The proposed HTA regulation outlines four key outputs: joint assessments comprising the clinical HTA domains; joint scientific consultations for technology developers; horizon scanning to identify new and emerging technologies; and a framework to support collaborative working, for example, HTAs of other technologies such as public health programmes and HTAs addressing non-clinical joint assessments such as economic assessment. </p> <p>  The standardisation of methods and processes and the use of common tools required by the proposed regulation will build heavily on development work already conducted by EUnetHTA.  Methods for systematic review of the clinical evidence base are already standardised internationally.  The Irish national HTA guidelines developed by HIQA align with international best practice and EUnetHTA standard approaches.  Work is already well under way in HIQA to standardise our methods and processes to the EUnetHTA framework, which will be a requirement of the regulation if implemented.  Article 22 of the regulation requires the standardisation of national HTA procedures to guarantee that the scientific evidence is produced in a manner that espouses independence, transparency and stakeholder engagement.  All of these principles are already embedded in the conduct of HTA by HIQA. </p> <p>  Joint production of assessments of medicines and high-risk medical devices will increase the availability of systematically produced reviews of the international evidence on clinical effectiveness and safety of relevant technologies.</p><p>The availability of joint clinical assessments will add to the efficiency of HIQA's processes by obviating the need for one of the key steps in the production of health technology assessment.</p><p> Scrutiny of the proposal for the regulation on health technology assessments by HIQA has raised several issues that will ideally be addressed or clarified before it enters into force.  I have outlined the issues of concern in my written statement and I am happy to answer any questions committee members may have in this regard.  I have provided an overview of how international collaboration is leveraged by HIQA to enhance the quality and efficiency of HTA.  I have also outlined the implications for HIQA of the proposed regulation on HTA.  I thank the committee for inviting us to speak and we are happy to take any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lesley Tilson" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Emer Fogarty, who is a senior health technology assessor at the NCPE.  I will briefly outline the role of the NCPE and the centre's involvement in European initiatives and I will discuss the implications of the proposed European regulation promoting co-operation in the area of health technology assessment.</p> <p>  The NCPE conducts rigorous, evidence-based health technology assessments to inform decision-makers on the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and vaccines in Ireland.  The NCPE assessment considers the clinical effectiveness and health-related quality-of-life benefits and all relevant costs, including potential savings from reduced health care resource use like hospitalisation, which a new treatment may provide and whether the price requested by the manufacturer is justified.  A budget impact analysis is also required in addition to the status of HTA in other jurisdictions.  The NCPE process facilitates submissions by patient groups who wish to have their views taken into consideration.  The NCPE will then advise the HSE on the clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and budget impact associated with specific pharmaceutical products.  The final decision on reimbursement of any drug is made by the HSE following consideration of all relevant evidence and recommendations in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p> <p>  The NCPE process is well-established and standardised criteria are used for the evaluation of pharmaceutical products.  All assessments are conducted in accordance with published general HTA guidelines produced by HIQA and internal NCPE assessment guidelines.  The pharmacoeconomic process is outlined in the 2016 framework agreement on the supply and pricing of medicines.</p> <p>  The NCPE is involved in several European initiatives.  The NCPE is committed to, and heavily involved in, European co-operation by participating in various collaborations, including the European Medicines Agency joint scientific advice process, numerous Innovative Medicines Initiative-funded initiatives and the EUnetHTA collaboration in health technology assessment.  The NCPE is a full partner to the current and final EUnetHTA joint action and is involved in the four main work packages.  These involve co-operation in the following areas: early scientific advice to manufacturers and post-market evidence generation; production of joint relative effectiveness assessments; guidelines on development and quality assurance; and implementation.  The NCPE provides meaningful contributions to many EUnetHTA outputs, such as the prioritisation of work tasks for Joint Action 3 across work packages and companion guides for the conduct of HTA.  The centre is currently co-authoring the topic identification, selection and prioritisation horizon scanning programme for current and future models of co-operation.  Furthermore, the NCPE has provided expert advice to the Department of Health regarding collaborative pricing and reimbursement initiatives at European level, including the Valletta and Beneluxa initiatives.  Overall, the NCPE has invested significant resources in co-operation on European projects in recent years and the centre welcomes the publication of the Commission proposal on the regulation of HTA.</p> <p>  On 31 January 2018, the European Commission put forward a proposal to develop a regulation around HTA.  Specifically, the proposal requires mandatory co-operation of member states in the area of joint clinical assessment.  The Commission has described the intention and scope of the proposed regulation.  The purpose is to address impediments to market access between member states, avoid duplication of work for HTA bodies and overcome the challenges of voluntary HTA co-operation by creating permanent infrastructure and funding to support joint activity.  Specifically, the proposal focuses on joint work on clinical aspects of HTA while the assessment of more context-specific economic issues and decision-making on pricing and reimbursement will remain at member state level.  Member states will continue to draw conclusions on the overall added value of the assessed health technology based on the joint clinical assessment report and the assessment of non-clinical aspects of the technology.</p> <p>  The NCPE welcomes the proposal and consider that there is potential for efficiency gains for our organisation and potentially the broader health service, if implemented in a timely manner.  However, the NCPE considers that there are several important issues that require detailed clarification before these potential efficiency gains could be realised.  These include whether it will be mandatory for pharmaceutical companies to submit evidence as part of this process.  As much of the relevant clinical evidence is held by the companies, their participation is considered to be critical.  Another factor is the co-ordination of the publication of the joint clinical assessments and the product launch date in Ireland.  Product launches and reimbursement applications are often made in Ireland some time after receipt of EU marketing authorisation.  Efficiency gains may be lost if the product launch is later than the date of marketing authorisation and reassessment is required due to the availability of new clinical evidence.  Furthermore, efficiency gains may not be realised if the primary language of the new body is not English.</p> <p>  The NCPE understands that these clarifications may not be available until after the proposed regulation comes into force and are produced as part of the secondary legislation process.  Thus, at this point it is not possible for the NCPE to confidently assume that the process will yield significant efficiency gains in the assessment of clinical effectiveness of new drugs.</p> <p>  The committee has specifically requested information on how the proposed regulation may affect the approval of orphan drug products in Ireland and the likely impact on drug pricing in member states.  The draft regulation does not distinguish orphan drugs or propose any specific processes for orphan drugs.  In its current format, the draft is unlikely to affect the approval process for orphan drug products in any way.  Drug pricing and reimbursement is outside the scope of the proposed regulation, which contains no reference to formal co-operation in this area.  The NCPE considers that the proposed regulation should not prevent or impede international co-operation on pricing and reimbursement.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today.</p></speech>

We will now open the discussion to our members.  Given the time constraints, members should make their observations and then we will get the replies.  The order of speakers is Deputy Louise O'Reilly, Deputy Kate O'Connell, Deputy Bernard Durkan and Senator Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#D00500"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will be as quick as I can.  I thank the deputations for attending.  By way of a general point, it seems that everything functions reasonably well and everyone seems to be fairly happy.  I am a little lost as to why we particularly need this measure.  Dr. MacLellan has advised that Ireland has outlined its general support for the regulation and emphasised the importance of ensuring that the quality of assessment undertaken by the various national bodies is of a sufficient standard.  Is Dr. MacLellan satisfied that the concerns or questions raised have in fact been answered sufficiently?</p> <p>  My next question is for the NCPE.  Dr. Tilson said clarification might not be available until after the regulation comes into force.  There is an element of the unknown about it.  Is there any role for the committee in communicating with the Commission to seek answers?  Are these small issues or matters of concern for the NCPE?  Can the NCPE outline its thinking in this regard?</p> <p>  My questions for HIQA are in the same vein.  The HIQA submission referred to strong positive relationships that exist already.  It strikes me that a good deal of co-operation exists as does considerable information sharing.  Moreover, much work is already getting done.  Can the HIQA deputation outline how the regulations will help to improve what seems to be a reasonably good procedure as it stands?</p><p>With regard to the concerns that were expressed, do any of the witnesses think the committee has a role in addressing those with the Commission?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#E00200"><p>I welcome the sharing of clinical information and joint clinical assessment, leading to efficiency.  In the case of a recent drug, Orkambi, as far as I know it did not get through the normal approval process and there was an intervention after the assessment.  I believe the approval of the drug was a combination of the process along with Ireland's unique relationship with the cystic fibrosis condition.  In the case of another condition or illness that might be specific to a certain group or population, is there a facility for those groups within the combined model?  Where countries have high scale manufacturing of drugs, is it built into the system that such countries would not favour their products over other countries' products?</p> <p>  My understanding is that the entire budget is together.  Last week or the week before that this committee asked about the total drugs spend.  Although the drugs spend is still very high, despite reference pricing and the arrival of generics, it appears that the savings on regular drugs have been taken up with the spend on high tech and orphan drugs.  Would there be any benefit in separating these budgets, so it is clear where we are making savings and where is the spend?  I am not sure if having a budget ceiling on spending on orphan drugs is the way to go.  There is almost a target or limit for what can be spent.  What happens if the money is all spent and an orphan drug emerges that we really want to approve?  How will we deal with that?  I take on board Dr. Lesley Tilson's comment that the research has to be in English as the first language.  It is of no use if one cannot interpret it.</p> <p>  We are under time pressure so I will conclude with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#E00300"><p>There are great potential benefits from standardisation, provided the highest standards are met.  That is obvious.  There are three issues - the possibility of reduced costs, increased efficiency and standardisation to the highest standard.  If those three conditions can be met within the proposal, my question is whether it runs foul of subsidiarity as present.  However, so do a number of other things that we were led to believe were the exclusive rights of the member states, corporation tax being one of them.  Some of our colleagues have decided to find a way around that and to encroach on that territory.  An issue arises there.  I strongly believe in standardisation and getting the benefits of EU population numbers in terms of assessment of costs and avoiding duplication.  It is and should be possible.  Does it augur in any way for Irish pharmaceutical manufacturers in terms of their access, remuneration or whatever the case may be?</p> <p>  There is no sense in introducing something that does not deal with the entire spectrum of drugs.  Given that orphan drugs, for example, are not going to be part of the parcel at this stage, one has to ask why they cannot be and when that can happen.  That is one of the issues we urgently require to be dealt with at present.</p> <p>  I strongly support the European assessment, as I have said previously at these meetings, provided we achieve the highest standards.  It would be a good exercise in democracy if our national standard bearers were to become part of that European assessment bloc so we would have national representation there as well, similar to the way the ECB has representation from the national central banks as well.  If that were done we could have the benefits of high standards, efficiency and lower costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#E00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  My apologies for being late.  I had to be in the Seanad.  The problem I am encountering is that the pharmaceutical companies are expressing their frustration to us with the process here.  In our report on orphan drugs we referred to what occurred in Scotland.  It was having the same problem and it set up a new process for dealing with it.  With regard to co-ordination with other member states, have we examined, for argument's sake, aligning ourselves with another member state as regards the processes, rather than acting independently?  I realise that we rely on the European Medicines Agency and what is happening at European level, but we still seem to have a totally separate process.  Many of the pharmaceutical companies that are based here spend a huge amount of money on research and development, but when they come through process here they find it frustrating.  I was talking to a representative of one company recently that had invested &euro;149 million here.  After making that investment, the company found that dealing with the process was very tedious and difficult compared with other member states.  The report we produced set out a number of recommendations and I note the witnesses are suggesting a change in legislation.  Can we do something to fast track the decision making process here and make it as efficient as possible?  If companies get a negative answer that is fine, but at least they know they are getting an answer.  Instead it appears to be review after review.  Can we examine that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#E00500"><p>I will start with Deputy O'Reilly's question about the confidence the Department would have in the quality of assessment and whether the assessments would be of sufficient standard.  The Department's view of standardisation is that it is critical that those standards are met.  What is proposed is building on the current work and our current work across the various EU HTA networks.  The regulation proposes the use of common tools and common standards, which we would welcome.  We were very clear when the Commission visited the Department in December that this was a red line for us, and that it would be problematic if standards are seen to be diminished around HTA assessment.  There are articles within the regulation which require standardisation, so as the regulation is further developed we will have to engage with, track and monitor that to ensure we are satisfied that the requirements in the regulation will continue to allow us to have the confidence in the standards that would be expected around HTAs across the member states.</p> <p>  I will briefly comment on Deputy Durkan's reference to subsidiarity.  I am responding on the issues to which I can respond before handing over to my colleagues.  With regard to the subsidiarity principle, we have been considering this as the proposed regulation offers potential benefits and efficiencies to a small country such as this.  It is probably small countries that will benefit most from this type of collaboration.  We are already engaged in collaboration on a voluntary basis.  The regulation is proposing to put a regulatory and legal framework behind that.  At this stage and as it is developing we see many positive benefits for us.  It gives us the opportunity to leverage the clinical assessments that are being carried out internationally and to prevent duplication.  We believe that will be useful.</p><p>It will be important that we can continue to manage the aspects that are sensitive to our own national public interests and matters relating to economic, ethical and organisational elements.  From that point of view, we hope that, as a country, we can contribute quite strongly to a stronger European health technology assessment, HTA, function.  We are very confident that we have two bodies here that have exceptional expertise in HTA and that is already recognised at EU level.  We can see by the fact that Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan is actually chairperson of EUnetHTA that this is recognised and that this regulation will provide us with the opportunity to lead on and participate in HTAs.  We are confident on that aspect.  I might ask my colleagues to address other aspects raised.  Mr. Finian Judge might want to take the question on the Department's role then we might potentially move to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finian Judge" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#F00200"><p>I will try to take the end questions on policy and the Department's role in the order that they were asked.  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the committee's role, which is a very good question.  We have the committee's report and we are also aware that a Private Members' Bill has been published on the area.  With regard to how we can take on board what the committee has to say and how to reflect it with regard to the Commission's thinking, we will examine the committee's report in detail.  As we sit in council over the next 12 months, debating this proposal line for line, we will certainly take on board what the committee has to say in its report.  That has very much been an involvement of the committee in our thinking for the next 12 months.  We will relay to the Commission, at the council groups, precisely what the committee has said in its report.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell raised this issue of Orkambi.  The answer to her question is that yes, there is a facility for the HSE, if resources are substantial, to make a submission to the Department and to the Minister in that regard.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are involved in the process.  The Deputy also raised the issue of countries favouring their own products.  In that respect, as we have discussed this proposal at council, we will ensure that there is no undue influence by any one company or manufacturer in that entire process.  Deputy O'Connell spoke about the drugs spend and breaking it down between high-tech and orphan.  In recent days, we gave a letter to the Chair of the committee where we broke down the spend between the different community drug schemes.  We can certainly work more on that if the committee wishes to see a more detailed breakdown.  We are restricted by the data collected by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in the HSE.  Deputy O'Connell's other point was on a separate process for orphan drugs.  As we all know, there is not a separate rule set in the Act as laid down by the Oireachtas for orphan drugs.  Having said that, the HSE is always mindful of the particular challenges posed by orphan drugs.  It is under active consideration.  A new committee has been established under the national rare disease plan.  There is a likelihood that that new committee will look at the feasibility or the merit in establishing new entry and exit criteria for orphan drugs.  It is up for consideration.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about piloting a separate rule set for orphan drugs.  I think I have answered that.  Deputy Durkan made a point that we should look to our EU partners and grow collaboration with them.  This is precisely the point that the Taoiseach and Minister have been making quite a lot.  We are already involved in the Valletta collaboration.  The Minister only very recently wrote to his colleagues in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria, seeking to join what is known as the BeNeLuxA collaboration.  We are trying to do as much as we can to build on the experience and power of getting into the space of joint pricing.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke talked about the pharmaceutical company frustration in the process.  There is no doubt that, post the HTA process, there can be delays in final decision-making.  Much of that delay is down to the fact that a decision from the NCPE, even one to say that it does not stand up, is a decision that it does not stand up at the price submitted.  That is a catalyst for the process to begin at the HSE level to go back to the companies involved and renegotiate price etc.  Much of the delay is because commercial negotiations are reopened and the HSE is seeking to attain the best price possible for the drug.  The Senator also raised the issue of collaboration, which I have mentioned.  I think I have covered most of the issues that were put to the Department.</p></speech>

This is a process the pharmaceutical companies finds frustrating since an assessment had already been done in other countries yet we are then going through the process again.  It takes 23 months before any answer is received and that is the source of their frustration at present.  It is not the process afterwards.  I accept what the witnesses are saying about the process afterwards and the high costs.  The Department is right in negotiating down costs.  The process there to negotiate down costs is correct but it is in the process before we get to that stage that the companies find frustration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lesley Tilson" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018032800002#F00500"><p>Could I answer on the HTA process and the timelines for it?  Our assessments are completed on similar timelines to the Scottish Medicines Consortium in many instances.  An aspect that often is not highlighted is that in Scotland, all drugs are assessed through the full process whereas we have a rapid review process.  For example, last year, we had 80 assessments of which 64 were done as rapid review assessments, which take on average four weeks at the NCPE.  Only 16 products went on to a full health technology assessment.  We prioritise very efficiently which drugs are assessed in a very detailed way and we try to reserve our resources so that happens.</p></speech>

Why do we not associate our assessment system with all countries, thereby getting the benefit of the Single Market, which I have often referred to in this context?  The Single Market is supposed to be available throughout all disciplines, not just with regard to travel or something like that, but this as well.</p></speech>

The criteria in the Act to which the HSE must adhere have been laid down by the Oireachtas.  Different countries have different criteria.  For example, the notion of cost-effectiveness could vary quite significantly from one jurisdiction to the next.  We have very defined criteria to which we must adhere with regard to our assessment for drugs.  We are looking at regional collaborations in Valletta and BeNeLuxA to see how we can collaborate on drug pricing and supply.  If one looks at this proposal from the Commission, it could be seen as a first step to try to bring it under one EU roof.  It starts with the process of clinical assessment.</p></speech>

I asked earlier if we know how the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland will be affected by having a central agency, to which we would make a contribution and which would meet the criteria relating to subsidiarity.  Those criteria would, in turn, apply across Europe.  I do not understand why we cannot do it.  There are already variations in cost between member states.</p></speech>

The work we have done already has been about piloting joint assessments.  The EC Health Technology Assessment Network and the European network of HTA, EUnetHTA, has conducted 18 non-drug assessments to date, I think, to which HIQA has contributed to eight, and ten drug assessments.  This is about having a system where all drugs that come to the market or have a new indication, as well as all high risk medical devices would be subject to joint clinical assessment once it is ramped up.  That means approximately 100 assessments annually.  The regulation is about bringing the efficiency to ramp up production.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about particular sub-groups.  When the assessments are undertaken, each country will have the opportunity to contribute to deciding how the assessment will be undertaken including highlighting factors such as particular subgroups or particular comparators that are in the national context so that they might be taken into account.  On mitigating the bias towards products produced in our own jurisdiction, each assessment team will probably consist of an average of ten countries which will contribute.  There will be a joint assessor and the rest will be reviewers.  There is oversight in terms of mitigating any bias that might creep into the process.  On the assessments being conducted through English, to date all the EUnetHTA work has been conducted through English.  Many of the European agencies publish their assessments in English and we hope that English will be the common language but that is yet to be determined.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Durkan's comments, quality assurance is paramount when it comes to health technology assessment.  We were very strong in influencing the work content of joint action 3, which is going on now, in that it would incorporate the development of a quality assurance framework in the context that if the regulation comes through that, the quality assurance framework will then be fit for purpose.  On subsidiarity, we see efficiencies in the clinical assessments being available to use across the countries.  There is obviously an efficiency there, but the regulation requires each country to adopt a common methodology which will offer further opportunities for co-operation in future.  There is also a mechanism to support voluntary co-operation so the regulation is around mandatory co-operation for clinical assessment but there is also a framework to support voluntary co-operation in other assessments.  For example, if Valetta and BeNeLuxA are trying to co-operate on the economic domains, the regulation provides a framework that will also support that work, but it is voluntary rather than mandatory.</p></speech>

From the committee's perspective, we are being constantly contacted by the pharmaceutical companies and it would be helpful for us if we had those figures and the length of time it took to process applications.</p></speech>

I had to speak in the Chamber earlier.  The HTA is to be set up across the EU by 2020.  Do entities such as HIQA currently report to any authority in Europe now or does such a body exist?</p> <p>  I note that non-clinical aspects such as cost will remain a function for member states.  Does Dr. Ryan feel there should be uniformity in the area of costs as well as other factors.  How will the sharing of information be protected within states?</p></speech>

So far, it has been about piloting the joint clinical assessments.  When we produce joint clinical assessments, they are validated by the UNnetHTA process.  UNnetHTA is a voluntary collaboration across 81 HTA agencies and institutional producers of HTA across the 28 states.</p> <p>  On standardisation of costs, the regulation is concerned with joint clinical assessment.  There are difficulties when it comes to economic collaboration.  For example, the economic model can be potentially shared across different countries but a state may need to adapt it to its own setting.  That is because it is not only about the cost of drugs or technologies differing, it is because the economic model considers all the other costs associated with the use of the therapy and also the impacts of the therapy.  If the drug reduces the incidence of strokes, for example, then we have to consider the saving associated with the reduced incidence of strokes.  The cost of managing stroke in Ireland is very different to what it is in Poland, for example, and also in Denmark because the different health care systems are set up differently and costs are different.  That is where some of the difficulty arises on cost.</p></speech>

There are some aspects that are common and there can often be commonalities in the model.  The information in respect of the clinical effectiveness is based on the international literature base, which is generally common, although sometimes one has to tweak it for one's own population.  However, on the costs of health care systems, the main difference comes into play because they are organised differently in different countries.</p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity to address the select committee on the Revised Estimates for 2018 for the Department's Vote 38.  Unlike many other Votes, the health Vote is not configured along programme lines.  While the Department is working towards the development of programme budgeting, this will take some time as the financial systems in the HSE will have to be adapted to allow for this in the context of the financial reform programme currently under way.  </p><p>The level of funding provided in the 2018 Revised Estimates will allow the Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to deliver better access, more health for families and more supports for disability, mental health and older and vulnerable people.  In addition, the welcome increase in the health capital budget over the period to 2021 will allow completion of key developments such as the new children's hospital and will ensure capital investment supports our strategic initiatives and ehealth improvements.  </p><p>The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much-needed budget increases in each of the last three years.  We are very aware that there are areas where further improvements are required and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding.  </p><p>The gross provision for the health Vote in 2017 was &euro;14.801 billion, comprising &euro;14.347 billion in current expenditure and &euro;454 million in capital expenditure, inclusive of &euro;195 million granted by means of a Supplementary Estimate.  The supplementary requirement arose due to new initiatives approved in 2017, central pay decisions, a shortfall in income and additional funding required in the State Claims Agency.  Funding was neither sought nor granted for deficits that arose in service areas which were within the management control of the HSE.</p><p>In framing the 2018 budget, the Oireachtas allocated &euro;15.332 billion in Exchequer funding for the health sector.  This represents an increase of &euro;492 million on the 2017 post-supplementary current expenditure budget and &euro;39 million, or 8.6%, on capital expenditure and recognises the Government's commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland. </p><p>The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally.  Despite welcome increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base in 2018 and beyond.</p><p>I would like to address the recently published Project Ireland 2040 and the Government's capital spending plans for the next ten years.  Capital funding for our health service has been agreed at &euro;10.9 billion for the next ten years, which is 165% higher when compared with the past ten years.  We now have a solid ambitious plan to build a better health service for the future through the combination of this significant capital investment programme alongside the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  The &euro;10.9 billion funding over the next ten years provides a real long-term opportunity to improve our health services, provide modern fit-for-purpose health facilities, increase bed capacity and modernise how we deliver services through ehealth, reformed pathways of care and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>Capital investments over the coming decade will support existing Government priority projects and commitments and will enable the roll-out of new additional capacity, guided by the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recently published health service capacity review.  </p><p>The strategic investment priorities for the public health sector in Project Ireland 2040 include a number of major investment projects and programmes over its lifetime, including: the new children's hospital at St. James's campus Dublin and the two children's outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown and at Tallaght hospital, Dublin.  The priorities also included the national maternity strategy developments, including the relocation of stand-alone maternity hospitals to acute hospital campus such as the move of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street to the St. Vincent's campus; national cancer strategy capital developments, including the national programme for radiation oncology at Cork, Galway and Dublin and the expansion of BreastCheck; building the new national forensic and mental health service hospital at Portrane, Dublin; the primary care centre construction programme at various locations around the country; and the replacement and refurbishment of community nursing units for older people and long-term residential care units and housing in the community for people with disabilities at various locations across the country.  In addition, the national development plan provides capital funding to implement the health service capacity review.</p><p>With this unprecedented capital investment in the health services we must ensure that we carefully plan and select projects.<b></b></p><p>To achieve that, we will put in place a robust method of project appraisal, assessment and selection in order to implement health strategies, including developing capacity to meet the population health needs and achieve value for money.<br/><br/>Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Department, I am committed to advancing a programme of both investment and reform for our health and social care services.  The recent Health Service Capacity Review provides an evidence base to determine the extent and nature of the capacity that will be required up to 2031.  It forecasts that by 2031, we will need an additional 1,000 general practitioners, GPs, and additional capacity requirements in primary care, acute hospitals and services for older persons for that period.<br/><br/>The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services and the Sl&aacute;intecare report, published last March, provides a framework to do that.  There is now an unprecedented level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report.  We must harness that and work with colleagues across the political spectrum and with all stakeholders to move forward on a programme of health reform.  The Government has already given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in the Department of Health.  This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The recruitment of an executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is under way.<br/><br/>It is important to note that many recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare are already policy priorities.  These include: the roll-out of our ehealth and health and well-being strategies; the development of a new GP contract and proposals for an enhanced community nursing service; further roll-out of integrated care programmes; the undertaking of a capacity review; and development of an integrated workforce planning framework.  The majority of additional funding for new health initiatives in budget 2018 has been targeted at areas identified in the Sl&aacute;intecare report such as the primary care fund, additional home care and transition beds, reduced medicine and prescription charges and targeted funding for waiting list reduction.  These actions are important first steps in a long-term reform process.<br/><br/>Work is under way in the Department to develop an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  A steering group, with representation from both the Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, has been directing this work over the past months.  Work is well advanced and the Minister, Deputy Harris, expects to bring proposals to Government shortly.  Furthermore, a memorandum will be brought to Government in the coming weeks with the general scheme for a Bill to introduce a governing board for the HSE, which is a key recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare.<br/><br/>Reducing waiting times for hospital procedures is a key priority for this Government.  The HSE has been allocated &euro;12 million for scheduled care measures, &euro;10 million of which has been ring-fenced for scoliosis and Merlin Park University Hospital orthopaedic capacity and &euro;2 million for other priorities.<br/><br/>Waiting list figures for the end of February published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, show that 72% of inpatient day case patients and 61% of outpatients are waiting nine months or less.  There was a reduction of 1,165 patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure compared to the end of January 2018 and a reduction of 7,175 when compared to the numbers waiting at the end of July 2017.  That is against a background of increasing demands on our acute hospitals which, since 2000, are carrying out four times more procedures for patients aged 65 and over and twice as many in the under 65 age group.  An additional &euro;35 million has been allocated to the NTPF for commissioned patient treatment, which brings its total budget for 2018 to &euro;55 million.  It is estimated that the NTPF initiatives in 2018 will enable the provision of treatment for up to 20,000 patients on the inpatient-day case waiting list across a range of specialties and procedures.<br/><br/>This winter has been very difficult for our health services.  During February, there was a 7.7% increase in attendances and a 5% increase in emergency department admissions compared to February 2017.  That growth in demand is well ahead of population growth and reflects international evidence that emergency department demand is driven by more than demographic factors.  This increased demand was further exacerbated in March by the impact of Storm Emma and the associated severe weather experienced across the country since the beginning of March.<br/><br/>While demand for services is growing considerably, the inpatient bed capacity to meet the demand is constrained, resulting in an 11.8% increase in the number of patients waiting on trolleys, compared to February 2017.  While fully acknowledging the need for productivity improvements and reforms across the health service, the bed capacity review outlines that in order to reach international standards of bed occupancy levels, the acute hospital system needs an immediate injection of additional beds.  It is only through continued investment in capacity, in hospital staff and in reform of our health services, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, that we will deliver better services for patients.<br/><br/>The Government provided an additional &euro;40 million for measures to alleviate the pressure on emergency departments during winter 2017-2018.  Timely discharge of patients is vital to ensuring that a ready supply of beds is available to those patients requiring to be admitted through emergency departments.  Delayed discharges are a major contributory factor to emergency department overcrowding and adversely affect patient flow throughout the hospital.  It is essential that, in so far as is possible, egress meets demand, and that hospital and community health care organisations, CHOs, processes support timely and safe discharge.  Accordingly, over 60% of the 2018 funding for unscheduled care access measures is being targeted towards providing additional social care supports.  These additional supports have been targeted at the hospitals with the greatest number of patients awaiting discharge home and will help improve patient flow in those hospitals, which will in turn help to relieve congestion in their emergency departments.  As of today, 189 additional beds have been opened this winter and further beds will open throughout 2018.<br/><br/>In the light of the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the current pressures on the hospital system, the HSE has been asked to develop a plan to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed by 1 November 2018 in order to improve preparedness for winter 2018-2019 and relieve overcrowding in hospital emergency departments.  In addition, the HSE and the Department have started the process of reviewing the winter initiative 2017-2018, with a view to providing a report in late April and ensuring the learning from this year will inform the agreement and early implementation of measures for next winter.<br/><br/>Primary care services can provide key opportunities in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare as it proposes the adoption of a new model of integrated care, centred on comprehensive primary and community care services.  In 2018, primary care funding of &euro;850 million will continue to build on the significant additional resources that have been invested over the past number of years in the State&rsquo;s primary care services.  For example, we have seen the extension of eligibility for GP cards to the under-sixes and the over-70s and the development of the diabetes cycle-of-care programme.<br/><br/>Quite significant investment has also been made in the development of primary care capacity, particularly in the therapy area, continued investment in the development of community intervention teams and enhanced community diagnostic programmes with the delivery of ultrasound and X-ray in the community.  We have also invested significantly in our primary care infrastructure providing modern, well equipped primary care centres - 114 to date - to enable patients access health care in their communities in a more integrated manner.  Capital funding of over &euro;29 million will continue to support the roll out of these centres.<br/><br/>The funding allocated in 2018 will continue to deliver these key services and dedicated additional funding of &euro;25 million therein will focus on disease prevention and early intervention, particularly through the further development and expansion of GP services.<br/><br/>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promoting care in the community, the Department is developing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services.  Pending this, the Department and the HSE are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services.  Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18 million allocated.  The additional resources made available brings the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408 million.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan provides for a target of 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.<br/><br/>Of course, there will always be a cohort of people who require long-term residential care, and the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, commonly known as fair deal, continues to provide financial assistance to those who need long-term nursing home care.  The aim of the scheme is to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<br/><br/>Mental Health remains a priority care programme for the Government.  For this reason, budget 2018 made allowance for an additional &euro;57.5 million for mental health services for 2018, inclusive of &euro;22.5 million of pay-related costs and &euro;35 million to continue to progress new initiatives.  The additional funding will help build on the work commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of community teams for children, adults, later life and mental health intellectual disability services.  It will also help to continue our move towards a full 24-7 service, with an initial focus on increasing the provision of services on a seven-days-a-week basis.  The HSE has been asked to prioritise this work in 2018 as well as develop a service response which is as seamless as possible for every service user.<br/><br/>Budget 2018 announced a reduction in the prescription charge and the drug payment scheme, DPS, monthly threshold.  Since 1 January, medical card holders have benefited from a 50 cent reduction in the prescription charge, from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 per item, and the maximum monthly cost reduced by &euro;5, from &euro;25 to &euro;20.  For approved treatments under the DPS the maximum monthly payment reduced by &euro;10, from &euro;144 to &euro;134.  This will benefit all families who exceed the threshold in any month.<br/><br/>While we<b></b>have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services in recent years, I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe, efficient health service for the Irish people.  Despite welcome increases in recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.</p><p>The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, adding to the overall cost of health above the operational costs funded to meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and on reducing costs, in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible health care within the limits of the resources that have been made available by Government each year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#D00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As we go through the Estimates for the year, it is looking at things in a historical context to a certain extent as well as everything else and trying to learn from what has been done to date as regards funding and policy itself.  In that context, the Minister of State referred towards the end of his opening statement to primary care.  There is no doubt that a couple of related issues are being discussed at other fora currently, including the GP contract, which is a critical component of the delivery of health care.  That was also alluded to in the Sl&aacute;intecare report where we talked about the transfer of services from the hospital-centric system we have at the moment to the community by way of bolstering primary care, community diagnostics, therapy and so on.  The following is an observation as much as it is a criticism.  I think often that officialdom lives in a parallel universe when it comes to what is happening on the ground in terms of investment figures showing increases in home care packages and home help hours.  When one drills down into it, one still finds huge problems in trying to deliver the very basics in terms of home help hours.  Where a person is deemed to need home help hours to get out of bed, there may only be funding to get out of bed five days a week.  As such, the person has to stay in bed two days a week.</p> <p>  We have almost dehumanised our health services in some key areas.  It is not a reflection not the people at the coalface, but it seems we do not have that ability to understand in officialdom and through the system what individuals go through in their lives.  We have to look harshly at how we assess and view cuts to services or the lack of a service in the first place and the impact that has on an individual's life.  I have an 84 year old woman whose husband cannot get out of bed himself.  They need a hoisting system and all of that is in place, which she appreciates very much.  However, she is only funded six mornings a week.  On the seventh morning, every Sunday, she has to get neighbours or friends to help her get her husband out of bed.  She only wants 20 minutes.  That is an issue that has to be addressed if we are to have any meaningful change of heart in the delivery of health care in primary and community settings.  It is just an individual case but it can be extrapolated across the whole are of home care packages, home help hours, access to diagnostics, access to therapy and all of that.</p> <p>  When we talk about primary care, which is the Minister of State's particular area, we talk about extending eligibility for free GP care.  While I opposed it at the time, I did so on the grounds that I did not think the GP services in place would be able to cope with what would be thrown at it in the context of the roll-out of universal GP care given the demographics of both the population and of GPs.  We are at the crossroads in how we look at primary care and its delivery.  We talk about it a lot but we have not resourced and funded it accordingly.  The Minister of State refers to the availability of &euro;850 million for primary care, but when one looks at what we expect that to do from a policy and demographic perspective, the two will not match and marry very well.  We will end up with a gravely abused primary care system which is incapable of delivering in the key areas the Minister of State has identified from a policy perspective or, primarily, from the perspective of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is chronic disease and illness, more diagnostics, retention of people in home or community care settings or step-down facilities.  That requires a great many more GPs.</p> <p>  I refer to the involvement of GPs in home care delivery and primary care teams and where we are with the number of GPs, the numbers who are retiring, the capacity of the primary care system in general and its funding and the tortuously slow negotiations around the GP contract, if it is even possible to say there are negotiations at all.  I am beginning to think this is just window dressing.  If negotiations are not moving between the primary actors, namely, the Department of Health and the IMO, others must intervene to push this on.  It is the central and most critical issue in terms of how we deliver care in community and primary care settings in the foreseeable future.  Obviously, we would like to see a rolling contract that is revisited on a regular basis, but we will have to get the basics right or we will end up in circumstances where no GPs are coming into the system while those who are trained and qualified are leaving.  Meanwhile, those at the other end of the scale approaching retirement age will step off because they have had enough.  We could end up with a very difficult situation in which policy refers to primary care but everybody is sent to hospital.  These are observations but they are important from the point of view of the focus on funding.</p> <p>  There was an RT&Eacute; report yesterday by Brian O&rsquo;Connell who visited Cork and spoke with GPs and families in Munster on the availability of psychiatric services.  The fact remains that child and adolescent mental health services in the Munster region are not what the Minister of State and I would like.  Certainly, they are not up to standard for those who depend on them.  We have situations in which GPs have no choice where a child attends who is at risk of self-harm, has suicidal ideation or has attempted suicide.  He or she must be referred to an emergency department.  If that is not done, the person is put on a waiting list.  That goes back to my original point about how we dehumanise the health system.  It causes trauma to the individual, the family and the medical professionals trying to deal with it that they cannot access any particular service.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred a few times in his opening statement to the number of people we require to expand the health service.  We must carry out a full root and branch manpower assessment as to what we need in our health services beyond the horizon.  We talk about training health professionals and it is seven to ten years before some are fully qualified.  It requires a great deal of long-term planning but we have not carried it out in enough areas.  We have not assessed the demographics and the demands the changing profile of the population will place on health service.  We have not determined what professionals we need to meet those demands.  That means getting involved with the training bodies and agencies to expand and enhance capacity in key areas.  We all speak, for example, about the fact that we will be older.  When one looks at investment in training in geriatric services, however, we are not crowning ourselves in glory notwithstanding the fact that we know the population will be quite elderly down the road.  That is one key area where a failure to drill down and determine what illnesses like diabetes and obesity, which are evident in the population, will mean.</p><p>We do not seem to have enough capacity to assess what our manpower requirements will be, not next year or the following year but in five, seven, ten or 15 years' time.  That is something that is never referred to in speeches or in policy other than it being said that we know we need additional doctors.  We have never carried out a detailed analysis.  The last time such an approach was taken was in the context of the Hanly report on consultants.  We need a detailed analysis of all grades - including physiotherapists and occupational therapists - right across the spectrum.  I urge that such an approach would be taken in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the funding of same or that the Department would independently get someone to carry out a detailed assessment of manpower requirements and then put in place the capacity to train them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#E00200"><p>I bid the Minister of State and his officials a good morning.  When members ask these questions, we tend to throw about 57,000 issues at the Minister, which means we tend to get very vague answers.  It is hard not to take such an approach because there are deficiencies in so many areas but if I can I will try to focus on a number of areas.  One is scoliosis.  That is something we have raised time and again.  We are not alone in that, as other Deputies, including Deputies in the Minister of State's own party have raised it.  The waiting lists are still unacceptable.  I do not think anyone would defend them.  It is not that long since the Minister was on television apologising in what I am sure was a very sincere way about it, but the waiting lists are unacceptable, in particular for those who have complex medical conditions.  The Minister had promised a detailed action plan for parents, which I suppose is just like a normal action plan but is perhaps a bit longer.  Parents have still not seen the action plan.  They are contacting me and I am sure they are contacting Deputy Kelleher and others as well to ask if we can ascertain when the detailed action plan will be ready.  When the plan is ready it could just be put with all the other detailed action plans.  What people really want to know is when the children will be treated and whether there is a plan to increase the operation of the theatre in Crumlin from three days to five.  If there is, could the Minister of State advise how many staff have been recruited to deal with that?  Given the length of the waiting lists, there is a case to be made for increasing the theatre openings to seven days a week until the crisis is over.  Could the Minister of State outline the position in terms of the recruitment of doctors, nurses and everybody else who will be needed to open the theatre for extra days?</p> <p>  That brings me to my next point.  Deputy Kelleher raised a similar point.  We all know that if additional beds are to be opened additional staff will be needed.  Could the Minister of State give an indication of the age profile of staff?  Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, theatre assistants and everybody else are coming into the system - I do not believe we are getting anywhere near the numbers needed - but at the other end people are leaving because in some instances the workplace is intolerable but there are also people whom we know will leave due to retirement, for example.  It is my understanding that there is not a plan in place to deal with the retirements.  Perhaps the Minister of State could point us to the section in the Estimates concerning recruitment and where the additional moneys for the additional capacity have been put aside.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has said it himself and the Minister, Deputy Harris, has definitely said that one could open a bed in the morning but it is just sitting there if one does not have the staff to care for the patient in it.  How much of the additional &euro;530 million is allocated for additional staff and potential pay increases and how much is just for standing still and maintaining the current level of services?</p> <p>  During Storm Emma the Minister for Health announced that &euro;5 million would be provided for additional capacity.  Could the Minister of State give us a breakdown of where the money was spent and whether money was taken from the budget for other areas and ring-fenced for that purpose?</p> <p>  It is hard to believe that there are negotiations, much less intense negotiations of any sort going on with general practitioners, GPs.  Can the Minister of State provide us with information on whether any discussion has taken place with regard to salaried GPs?  All of the reports in the media and from the representative organisations suggest there is a crisis in capacity in terms of GPs at the moment.  One issue identified in Sl&aacute;intecare is that we might look at salaried GPs to alleviate the crisis.  I understand that it would not be a panacea.  Could the Minister of State advise us if that has formed part of the discussions and perhaps give us an update?</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to 179 beds that had been opened and that a detailed plan would be provided, perhaps on 1 November, for the opening of additional beds.  Could he give a breakdown of the staffing for those beds?  Is there recruitment in the pipeline?  One cannot just fill out a form.  It is a long process to recruit a staff member at any grade into the health service, except as it turns out, administrative staff because we saw over the weekend that they are being recruited at a rate of knots, unlike health professionals.  That is not to say administrative staff are not needed because of course they are but it strikes me as a bit odd that the recruitment of administrative staff is outstripping the recruitment of front-line health care professionals.</p></speech>

I assure him that while he is busy with his ministerial ship, I will mind the ship in west Cork.  He can rest assured of that.</p> <p>  On a serious note, I see the budget for people with disabilities is on par with that for 2017.  I would have expected more progress with the transport support allowance, for example.  I know that is within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has some comments to make on it.</p> <p>  In the Minister of State's own area of mental health, I note there is a 10% increase in funding, which is very welcome and should not be knocked.  However, the Minister of State must admit that not enough is being done.  Without the likes of organisations such as Pieta House, the country would be in a very difficult place.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State think the extra 4% spend could help to tackle the waiting lists which are now at 288 for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment in Marian House, Cork?  Both the Minister of State and I have a lot of constituents who are on the waiting list for two years.  Because of the importance of early intervention, two years is not good enough.  Will some of the extra funding be channelled in that direction?</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly mentioned scoliosis.  The Minister of State put a strong emphasis on what would be done to address the issue in his speech.  A boy in west Cork was diagnosed at the age of 11.  He is now 16 and he has yet to be treated five years later.  What is happening is not good enough.</p> <p>  What resources does the Minister of State envisage being put into rural hospitals such as Bantry General Hospital in our constituency?  As he is aware Bantry General Hospital has been seeking a rehabilitation and endoscopy unit for some time.  The Minister of State might just tell me what resources will be allocated to Bantry General Hospital?</p></speech>

I will answer to the best of my ability.  I do not have the answers for all of the questions but anything I can answer I will to the best of my ability and anything I fail to answer I will come back to the members directly or to the committee with more detailed information.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher spoke about humanising the system and officialdom versus reality.  The role of politicians and politics and the role we play all day every day as representatives is to attempt to humanise it.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from.  A lot of the figures, facts, percentages and statistics tend to mask the reality and be a protective mechanism, and appear as such to us as public representatives.  Nonetheless, that is how systems are run and analysed and metrics have to be involved but I take on board the point and I accept what the Deputy has said.  Our job is to keep humanising it and bring to the fore real examples as the Deputy did, of the 86 year old lady who is in a bed and getting help six days a week but not the seventh day.  These are real challenges for the system.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what can we expect from the &euro;850 million funding for primary care.  He made the point that if we are to move towards primary care and go along with Sl&aacute;intecare, which we all accept is the way forward, it will be important.  If we are going to put such emphasis on primary care we will have to fund it accordingly, which will be a real challenge, and the Deputy will appreciate this from his years of observing the health system and other areas where he has served.  The challenge will be in trying to reorient a system away from the here and now, and the day to day pressures on the demand-led scheme, and trying to pull funding back and reorient it into a new system.  It takes time and it is a huge challenge, and the very best we can really hope for is that a lot of it will be done with new funding, and that as new funding comes on stream, a larger proportion of it will go into primary care and this is how we will slowly and, hopefully, substantially build the funding to run it.  We are aware of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point on requiring more GPs, and in my opening remarks I acknowledged that we will need up to 1,000 new GPs.  The GP contract and negotiations were mentioned by a number of members.  I understand negotiations with the IMO will recommence in the coming weeks.  They have been stalled since the end of last year.  They are due to commence with intensity and there is an expectation.  It is not for me to put a timeline on it, but I hope that by the end of the year significant progress will be made on this to substantially address the issues that are there.   There is the FEMPI issue about which the GPs are very vocal and there are a number of other issues.  The Government will make the point that in return for any additional funding new ways of doing business will be required along with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#F00200"><p>The IMO has already indicated that it is not in that space and it wants to talk about the reversal of FEMPI first and then any additional services.  I do not mean this disrespectfully in any way and I am sure that is not how the Minister of State will take it, but every time there is an intervention from a Minister or Minister of State we get further away from any possibility of there being any agreement on this.  The Minister of State does not have to take my word for it.  It is in the newspapers.  The GP service is in crisis.  Laying down markers such as this in advance of a negotiation while, at the same time, the Minister of State states he thinks it might be finished by Christmas, is pushing it further back every time.  I apologise for the interruption.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#F00300"><p>The Chairman will appreciate I will not go into this type of discussion here.  I will not negotiate the GP contract across the floor with anybody or go into its details.  I have made some points on this.  I addressed the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, over the weekend and I am merely reiterating some of the points I made to the GPs there.  It is not in my gift.  I will not be leading those negotiations and neither would it be appropriate or helpful for me at this stage to start entering into such discussions at that level.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher also mentioned child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Munster.  I am aware of the challenges, particularly in the Cork area.  One of the biggest issues we still have in mental health is recruitment, and we are blue in the face from listening to it on every Topical Issue and parliamentary question, but it is a fact.  If one always does what one always did, one always will get what one always got.  If we continue just to acknowledge that challenge and to struggle on, we will be in the same place for a long time to come.  My attitude as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health is to look at how we do what we do and look at a new way of doing it.  The future of mental health, from looking at international best practice and what is done abroad, is to look at online delivery of the service.  This is the space we need to go to.  It does not make sense for a consultant psychiatrist to leave Cork to travel to Castletownbere to see somebody given the amount of time it takes.  These are posing real challenges while we want to have a seven-day week service and availability in every area.  If we look at a model where somebody with a mental health issue can go into his or her local primary care centre where there is an interactive screen and he or she can speak to a mental health professional, whether a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist and avail of the services online, that could be a new way to revolutionise and radically look at how we deliver online mental health services.  I have asked the HSE to trial the online delivery of mental health services and to select a primary care centre where we can start to trial this.  We need to consider this.</p> <p>  There is an ancillary issue, which is the management of waiting lists.  Various people manage their waiting lists in various ways.  There is huge disparity in various parts of the country where the numbers and percentages are broadly the same, such as 70% filling of posts and a certain number of people coming through, but there are various ways of managing it.  Every list must be prioritised on an immediate basis.  If someone presents with a serious mental health issue that person must be seen immediately.  I heard the report with Brian O'Connell yesterday to which the Deputy referred.  Nobody should be told he or she has to wait seven or 12 weeks.  There is supposed to be continuous prioritisation.  The consultant psychiatrist in charge of the team is supposed to look and assess.  There are various ways to do this to deliver the service.  I am aware of the issue and, ultimately, the solution will be to continue with this.  We should not, as politicians, continue to accept recruitment is a challenge.  It is a challenge, but there are ways around everything and the online space offers enormous potential.</p> <p>  Long-term planning for staffing is something on which a certain amount of work has been done by the HSE.  A staffing skill mix has been looked at and a review was launched recently into nursing in particular.  I also take the point that we should look at the challenges that will come from a range of illnesses that will present, such as obesity, diabetes and chronic illnesses, and not just look at particular skill sets.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of scoliosis and the detailed action plan.  I will have to come back to her on that.  As she knows, there was an initiative last year and an additional &euro;10 million was put into it.  A new theatre was opened in Crumlin and its capacity is to be increased this year.  It went from carrying out 220 procedures in 2016 to 321 procedures in 2017, which is a 46% increase.  It will take time to catch up.  When one launches an initiative one does not get an immediate result and return.  It takes a bit of time.

The plan is to increase it from three to five.  I would also like information on the timelines by which this will be achieved.</p></speech>

I will address the rest of her questions as best I can, but a number of them are staffing related.  I know this is her background and interest but I cannot go into that level of detail as to how many staff are apportioned to new beds and what percentage will go on staffing.  These are operational matters and are done by the HSE.  They are not part of my remit in the Department.  If the Deputy wants to ask specific questions she can address them to me and I will ask the HSE to come back to her directly on them.  I believe the HSE will come before the committee on 6 May for its quarterly update, and its representatives will be better placed to address staffing issues.  They really do not come under my remit.</p> <p>  The Deputy sought a detailed breakdown regarding the &euro;5 million in respect of Storm Emma but I do not have it to hand.  I can ask somebody to come back to the Deputy on it.  Again, it is a HSE matter.  The Department will not prescribe where exactly the &euro;5 million will go.</p><p> We have already addressed the general practitioner negotiations and the salary of general practitioners.  I am not aware of what the Deputy described and would not be involved on that side of it.</p><p> On the staffing of new beds, 189 new beds have been opened but I would not be aware of the staffing arrangements for them or any future new beds.  Those will be operational matters for the HSE.  I am sure the HSE will answer those questions for the Deputy when its representatives appear before the committee on 7 May.</p><p> On the question on the additional &euro;530 million, the Deputy was wondering about the proportion for additional staff.  Again, I do not know.  I suppose the HSE has a standard.  I am not sure what it is.  In any new development, I assume staffing would be accommodated but I do not know.  I presume the HSE will answer that for the Deputy.</p></speech>

If the Minister for Health says he is confident that a certain number of beds are to be opened or that a certain sum of money is to be put aside and the Minister of State then comes in and says he does not know what it will be spent on, it does not inspire a massive amount of confidence.  It certainly does not do so in me.  It will not inspire a massive amount of confidence among people waiting on these services.</p> <p>  I apologise for the interruptions.  I have asked several questions related to health expenditure but they cannot be answered.  I fully appreciate that the Minister of State is here to deputise for the Minister but it is not acceptable for him to say he does not believe it is the job of the Department or the Minister to answer.  Of course we will ask the HSE &mdash; we do so when its representatives appear before us.  On the one hand, the Minister of State is telling us a certain number of beds will be opened and that there will be plans for this and that but on the other hand, when he is asked for the detail, he says it is someone else's responsibility.  I do not believe that is acceptable.</p></speech>

I do not manage or micro-manage those operations at that level, even within my own area of responsibility.  It has nothing to do with whether the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, or any Minister of State is here.  In my area, I do not micro-manage the system as suggested.  The HSE is in place to deliver the services.  It is an operational matter.  Some of the questions the Deputy has asked are clearly related to operational matters.  There are generic headline percentages that would be accommodated for any new development.  Of course staffing would be accounted for.  I cannot tell the Deputy how many staff will be required for each of the new 189 beds.  I cannot give that kind of detail.  I hope that is acceptable to the committee.</p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony mentioned mental health and the great work of organisations such as Pieta House.  To go back to the answer I gave to Deputy Kelleher about mental health, I believe the issues and challenges are similar across the country.  Pieta House does wonderful work but it is funded by my Department, as is any such organisation.  One of the issues I referred to a number of times is that the organisations do wonderful work but I am concerned that there is a challenge when somebody with a mental health issue in west Cork or anywhere else wonders whether he should go to Pieta House, Jigsaw, Lisheens House in my constituency, the Samaritans or ChildLine.  On one's best day, it would be a challenge.  When one has a mental health issue and is feeling down when trying to figure out where to go, it is particularly challenging.  One of the objectives I have set is to ask the Department to lead with the HSE to put in place one single telephone number that people with a mental health issue can dial.  The number would be universal.  One would be assigned to the most appropriate service.</p></speech>

A lot of our research shows that young people are much more comfortable texting than picking up the telephone and ringing.  These are developments we are considering and trying to grapple with.  A number of working groups have been set up within the HSE and the Department to drive forward this particular initiative so that there will be one single point of contact for those who wish to reach out to mental health services and which would refer one appropriately to the most suitable service.</p></speech>

There is a lot of work involved.  I hate setting a timeline because I may not be able to live up to it.  I am confident, however, that by the end of the year I will have very significant progress made on this, irrespective of whether the telephone number will be available then.  There are many challenges because existing services must be integrated and brought in under the new arrangement.  One is not just going to ignore the Samaritans and all such organisations, which have done superb work.  They must be brought in and an effort must be made to streamline the service.  We are meeting the challenges head-on.  There are some wonderful people working behind the scenes.</p> <p>  On waiting lists and Marian House, there is a challenge for the Department in respect of any of the organisations that are funded separately.  How they do their work comprises an ongoing challenge.  I will get Minister of State Deputy Finian McGrath to provide the Deputy with more detail on that, particularly on the waiting list at Marian House.  I will work with the Minister of State and we will send the Deputy a response on the matter.</p></speech>

I met the management there last Monday.  I met senior management from the South/South West Hospital Group.  There is a proposal, of which the Deputy has been very supportive, to develop the rehabilitation and endoscopy facilities.  Both projects have gone to the HSE and have been technically cleared.  They have proceeded to the Department and are in the mix for funding with hundreds of other applications for capital developments at various hospitals throughout the country.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the operating theatre in Bantry General Hospital is open for only two and a half days per week.  I am very anxious to have it open for five days per week.  These are the kinds of solutions required in hospitals throughout the country, not just in Bantry General Hospital.  The smaller hospitals offer unique services.  Bantry hospital is unique because it is the only remote rural hospital in Ireland.  As the Deputy knows, it has a mixture of long-stay beds, continuing-care beds and acute beds.  It is very unusual.  We will continue to work with the HSE.  I will continue to try to get the theatre working for more than two and half days per week and to have more surgeons down from Cork, resulting in more outreach.  I will try to get the relevant services up and running.  That will contribute significantly to addressing the issues in Cork University Hospital.  Bantry hospital has enormous potential in this regard.</p></speech>

I have to leave shortly.  I thank the Minister of State for attending this morning.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about online therapies.  This is interesting.  The Minister of State might follow up on what occurs in the other jurisdictions where these therapies are practised.  How are conditions triaged?  In recent years, our attitude to mental health has changed and there is not as much stigma attached to mental illness but I do not imagine that we or the Minister of State could say, hand on heart, that everybody from Bantry to Donegal is happy to talk about his or her mental health.  While I do regard the initiative as having value in taking pressure off the services, I wonder about the absence of the general practitioner.  General practitioners, who tend to have a whole-of-person approach to health care, note that if people's mental health is segregated to be dealt with by another entity, be it somebody online or a service in another jurisdiction, there is fragmentation.  We heard last week or the week before about fragmentation of services.  Having the general practitioner in the community as the anchor person for people's health care, be it physical or mental health care, has considerable value.  Is the pilot to complement existing services or to serve as an add-on, bearing in mind the increase in the diagnosis of mental health issues and the significant rate of prescription of antidepressants and such medications in Ireland at present?  We all know there are problems in the Irish health service.  I am not against the initiative but would be interested in knowing the international evidence supporting it.  How will it cascade down into the practical setting?</p> <p>  If general practitioners, in the first instance, and then psychiatrists are not seeing the genesis of mental illness and how it progresses in people's lives, will there be a deficit in education when it comes to health care professionals?</p><p>It is very hard to engage with some people when it comes to mental health.  Are we going down a road where the people most resistant to treatment will be segregated and we only sort out the people who have a willingness to engage?  I do not see how this will help that cohort of people who, whatever their personal or family circumstances, do not engage with the services.  Will the Minister of State outline that, perhaps after the meeting?  I would be very interested to hear where this is coming from.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#H00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and the statement and information he has given to the committee.  There are two or three things that came to my attention.  I am delighted to see the move towards programme budgeting.  One of my fetishes has always been comparison with the health boards, which always had programme budgeting.  Since that finished we do not seem to be able to go anywhere with certainty.  That has been one of the intrinsic problems in the health service over recent years.  It was a woefully bad decision to move away from that.  With programme budgeting, they can assess fairly regularly where they are going in the first, second, third or fourth quarter well in advance.  It cannot be done any other way because it is too vague.</p> <p>  In the area of home help carers and home care packages, there is a need for some co-ordination with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The carer's allowance is the first step to deal with situations in which older people do not require institutional care or a home care package but can benefit from being looked in on by a friendly neighbour or family member.  They can have meals prepared at crucial times and can be looked in on in the morning and the late evening and so on.  Most families have done this themselves.  Modern labour force requirements do not allow that to happen to the same extent it used to.  I saw a file last week where a person caring for a person in his or her 90th year was deemed to be ineligible on the basis the person he or she was caring for was insufficiently immobile.  The presumption is that when the person tripped and fell and hit his or her head on something, he or she would become eligible.  It is then too late for that level of care and requires either hospitalisation or institutional care.  It is quite common, as the Chairman knows.  I would like some interaction between the two Departments in that area as a matter of some urgency.  It will not cost anything and it will dramatically improve the quality of life for those who need care and will relieve the pressure on the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Waiting times are another of my hobby horses.  There are waiting times for everything and I cannot understand it.  I will never begin to understand why we have them.  It is almost as if somebody decides to pick a time in the calendar and tell people they will deal with them then.  I do not accept it.  I think it is just as easy to tell a person he or she will be dealt with next week.  Waiting lists become longer and longer as time goes by.  It is an acute system.  We need a fairly rapid response.  If we are going to be successful we need a rapid response.  I am anxious that all areas where waiting times occur, whether as a result of a lack of theatre space, lack of adequately qualified nurses in theatre, consultants or GPs, waiting times have to stop because they go on forever.  It will have to be done.  The lists will have to be caught up with and overtaken.  The question of how to eliminate those waiting times is important.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the GP contract.  We are long enough talking about it.  We need to see some progress but not in the future.  We are talking about waiting times again.  Why do we have to wait for that?  Why not do it now and have done with it?  At least then we would have some certainty in the future.  I do not want to talk about the procedure or negotiate here but it is not helpful to have a long waiting period in which we promise this in the future.  It has been long enough promised so we should get on with it and do it soon.  Let us produce something in the very near future that will indicate we are serious or not serious about it.</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to recruitment and I know the Minister of State may not want to comment on it.  Somebody approached me recently about the issue and will come back to me with further information.  There are some strange things happening in recruitment.  Administrators seem to be of greater importance than the front-line staff.  That should not be.  I know we have to have administrators but the fact is we are in a crisis and we need the people on the front line dealing directly with the patients.  We need them as a matter of urgency or else we are back to long waiting lists again and it will go on forever.</p> <p>  I have some questions for a different time.  There are a couple of little niggling parts that I am not too sure about, for instance, the issue of medical cards.  The number of full medical cards has dropped and there has been an increase in the number of GP visit cards.  We are a bit uneasy about it.  It is not always to the benefit of the patient.  I would like some comment on it.</p> <p>  I try to avoid being parochial at these meetings but when everybody else does it, I think I should do it.  My local hospital in Naas is in the picture.  The endoscopy unit extension is much wanted and has been for some considerable time.  I am anxious to clear the air, get it out of there, have it approved and get on with it.  There is also an oncology unit upgrade required as well.  It is a very busy hospital in a very important location.  To drag out what is required now only reduces the confidence of the staff in the hospital.  We need to avoid that.</p> <p>  The shortfall in the health budget has been reducing slowly but surely over recent years.  In 2014, it was something like &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  Gradually it has reduced to &euro;295 million or thereabouts.  Could we be coming to the spot where we can identify almost precisely what is required?  I referred already to programme budgeting.  I presume that as we move into that area, we should be able to get dead-headed budgeting.  We should not need to be vague.  A shortfall of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million is way off target in terms of planning in advance.  If we are going to plan for the health services in advance, we need to be more precise about the exact cost, where it will come from and where it will go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#H00300"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  Before the Minister of State answers those questions, I will put a few questions to him.  The Minister of State referred quite often in his opening statement to the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the need for health reform and the shift from secondary hospital services to primary care services.  Is there anything in the Estimates to indicate there is a start in attempting to move from the expensive secondary care services to much more practical and efficient primary care services?  Will the Minister of State point out where that is in the Estimates?</p> <p>  There is also reference in the Minister of State's opening statement to the expansion of eligibility for medical cards and free care to those under six and those over 70.</p><p>There has been an expansion in delivering medical cards to people in receipt of disability allowance.  There is now a proposal to increase eligibility for those who receive carer's allowance.  However, there is limited capacity in general practice to deliver these services.  General practice is at its maximum, yet eligibility is increasing without any recognition that there is a huge manpower crisis.  I do not expect the Minister of State to negotiate the GP contract across the floor of the committee room this morning but there is huge difficulty relating to GP manpower.  The Minister of State would have heard it at the weekend.  How can we propose to shift from secondary care to primary care if we do not have the GPs to deliver the service?  General practice is at maximum capacity and many areas are facing the possibility of not having a GP at all.  Many practices have closed their lists.  We need to move to a new model of care and the GP negotiations are critical.  They have been ongoing for two years.  The Minister of State said they are a challenge and hope to deliver a contract by the end of the year but we have been listening to that for two years.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address the accelerators to develop that contract.</p><p> Every part of our health service is interconnected, so if we fail to invest in primary care, naturally, people will gravitate towards secondary care.  Therefore, we have trolley queues, increasing outpatient waiting lists and increased waiting lists for inpatient elective care, so there is a connection.  Will the Minister of State outline his view on how those interconnections can be changed so that primary care can relieve the pressure on our hospital service?</p><p> Will the Minister of State address bed capacity?  He identified a number of capital investments in his opening statement.  One of the proposals in Project Ireland 2040 was to build three elective hospitals which would just deal with elective care and would not be overwhelmed by patients coming in through casualty departments and displacing people who are waiting for elective treatment.  It is not mentioned in the Minister of State's opening statement but it is in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p> Model 2 hospitals are coming under severe pressure regarding recruitment and retention, particularly for nurses and medical specialists, because they are seen as unattractive places to work.  There is a huge number of consultant vacancies - up to 400.  Many of those are in model 2 and model 3 hospitals.  Certainly University Hospital Kerry in Tralee is under severe pressure at the moment because it is losing three of its major specialists and is having difficulty recruiting.  Ennis Hospital is having difficulty in recruiting geriatricians, so there is a difficulty in recruiting people in specific areas in our health service.  Perhaps the Minister of State might address that.</p><p> The Estimates contain an allocation of &euro;1 million to development the Sl&aacute;intecare office and the implementation office.  Will the Minister of State refer to how this is progressing?  Regarding the funding of our hospital services, &euro;670 million comes from private health insurance.  This figure seems to be dropping because private health insurance companies are encouraging patients who come through emergency departments not to designate themselves as private patients because it will not give them any additional care.  This is leading to a reduction in the amount of money coming from insurance companies to fund our public system.  The appropriation-in-aid part of the budget is &euro;460.2 million.  Will the Minister of State let me know what this funding consists of and where it comes from?</p></speech>

I think she referred to the online service but when she spoke further, it was more about the phone line.  She said that it would be assumed that certainly the online delivery of any mental health therapy would done in primary care centres under the guidance of the GP.  I think she seemed to be concerned about that.  Of course, the GP would be central to a phone line but GPs face a challenge as well.  If someone presents to a GP, the GP is supposed to be an expert in every area when obviously they cannot be.  They are also expected to be up to date on the whole range of services so GPs would be central to directing people.  What I want to do is create that directory and signposting and make tools available to people regardless of whether people ring to find out the nearest available mental health support or go to their GP, who will also have immediate access to this directory and can direct people to the most appropriate means, because we do have an issue with people being referred.  Not every teenager who presents with a mental health issue, be it anxiety, stress or bullying, needs to go to CAMHS.  In some cases, they do not need to see a consultant psychiatrist.  There can be interventions at different levels, therapies, psychologists and so on.  It is about appropriateness and appropriate referrals but GPs will always remain central and will be the front door and first point of contact for people.</p></speech>

The idea is that a person will ring in and will just be directed to the right service.  I could probably say something smart about the waiting list but I am not going to.  Will that person be qualified or will he or she be more of a telephonist?  If somebody rings up and says he or she anxiety, which I think was the example used by the Minister of State, that person would be directed to the service.  If somebody rings up and says he or she anxiety but actually that person might have something else, the person dealing with that could be an administrative person.  Is intended that this person would be a triage person or merely a telephonist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018032800002#J00800"><p>Obviously, they are taking on a degree of responsibility when they are referring so they would need to have an appropriate qualification and they must be a triage person because they would have to be able to detect if it is much more serious than the person presenting says it is.  For example, has the person suicidal ideation?  The person at the other end of a phone line would need a level of qualification.  The challenge is actually making the directory of services available because a lot of these organisations are opening up and collecting money through voluntary activity.  Some of them are funded by the HSE while others are not.  We need to streamline that.  It is about creating the directory.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Connell's concern, the GP will still be very central and the focus of all of this and will use this directory.  However, some people will choose to ring a phone line and not go to their GP, so we are trying to cover all angles.  Is it a complement or an add-on to existing services?  Again, it is both but it is mainly to complement the existing services.  Again, it is about how we do it, what we do and doing it better as opposed to continuing to do what we have always done.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the presentation of budgets and programme heads.  I was in the Department during the week preparing for this meeting.  Some of the officials there mentioned to me that Deputy Durkan has been very consistent in his querying and challenge to have this presentation done.  The challenge is acknowledged and recognised.  Basically, it is a case of syncing the Department's accountancy practice with the HSE.  The HSE is developing a new model of financial accountancy and presentation.  Once that is done, the Department can tie into it.  I apologise that we are still on the outdated model this year but we live in hope.  Certainly Deputy Durkan's consistency in highlighting this has been acknowledged and recognised and has been instrumental in forcing the change to come about.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a very interesting point about home help, carer's allowance and tying up between the two Departments.  It is something of which I am aware as a practising politician but I am not sure I was aware of it in my role in a Department as a Minister of State.  As the Deputy knows, we are trying to devise a statutory scheme to provide home care and to make sure that people can get it as a right as opposed to the current haphazard arrangement where a lot of it is down to a postal code lottery.</p><p>As things stand, a lot depends on waiting lists, queues etc.  We want a system similar to the fair deal scheme, where everybody is entitled to the service.  People will merely have to go through the formalities of the paperwork and they will get it.  To accomplish that, several challenges must be met.  Obviously we have to upskill the workforce and make sure it is sufficient to deliver the service.  We must also ensure that there is transparency and-----</p></speech>

Why are there waiting lists?  I know the point being made.  Why can we not deal with everything today or tomorrow?  It is not all about money, but money helps.  It is about how we do what we do.  We allocated an additional &euro;85 million to deal with waiting lists for this particular winter.  Some &euro;40 million was allocated to winter initiatives.  A further &euro;11.6 million was allocated directly to waiting lists, and an additional &euro;35 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to source procedures outside of the State.  We could talk about why we have waiting lists all day.</p> <p>  I take the point that GP contracts have been waiting to begin for a while .  I am assured that they will begin very shortly.

A lot of administrators are front-line staff.  People assume that administrators are people in back offices, pushing paper around.  However, they are involved in processing medical cards and things like that.  We must think carefully about whether we want to institute a pause on the hiring of administrators.  Deputies should feel free to-----</p></speech>

Yes, that is true.  However, if we are beset by waiting lists, as we have been for many years now, there has to be some reason for it.  Maybe it is a shortage of administrators.  Maybe administrators are what we need.  I do not know, but I do know that we have to overhaul our waiting lists.  Otherwise we may as well close the shop altogether and go home.  The fact of the matter is this; if we cannot identify the snags in the system and resolve them, then we are wasting money, because time is money.  The costs of running the health service will be reduced very considerably if we can identify and remove those glitches.  It goes back to the old system.  We may ask, for example, how long one has to wait for the result of an X-ray, a scan or whatever.  One should not have to wait at all.  If time is money, then we need to know the results as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I would emphasise this point.  Some time ago, the comparison between private sector and public sector hospitals was brought to my attention.  It appears that a consultant could work a full day in the private sector uninterrupted.  If they change over to the public sector the following week, they might have a day's work, but they might not.  That might be because some part of the system is not ready.  There may be insufficient staff in the theatre, theatres may be unavailable or whatever the case may be.  All of these are serious contributory factors that make the health service less efficient, and that is what we need to address. </p></speech>

I can only speak for myself however.  If we want to be pedantic about it and talk about what administrators do, I am sure they would argue that a lot of their time is spent dealing with the political process, that is, portraying accountability, openness and transparency.  Are we to cut back on that as well?  However, that is just an aside.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also asked about Naas General Hospital and its endoscopy unit.  That is part of the capital plan that is being developed at the moment.  As I said to my colleague about Bantry General Hospital, all of those projects are currently being progressed through the national capital plan within the Department and the HSE.  Deputy Durkan's enthusiasm and support for the project is noted.  </p> <p>  The Chairman asked about Sl&aacute;intecare, its development and where the corresponding proposal is included in the estimates.  An additional &euro;25 million has been allocated to primary care, which is part of that.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has committed to bringing several specific proposals on Sl&aacute;intecare and its development to Cabinet in the next several weeks.  We will have to wait for those to come through the Cabinet before I can bring them to this committee.  Those proposals will answer the Deputy's questions about the specifics of Sl&aacute;intecare and progress thereon.  </p> <p>  On the technical side-----</p></speech>

I understand that the Minister will bring specific proposals on developing Sl&aacute;intecare to Cabinet in the next three to four weeks.  An executive director will be appointed within the same period.  That recruitment process is substantially under way at the moment, and should be completed within the next three to four weeks.  The appointment of an executive director is the starting point for driving forward the proposals that are cleared by the Government.</p> <p>  The expansion of medical cards and GP practice were raised.  As the Chairman will be well aware, there is a proposal in the programme for Government to increase the number of training places for GPs to 259.  I appreciate that it takes so many years to train a GP.  The number of training places this year has increased to 190, up from 120 trained last year.  There were 400 applications last year for those 190 training places.  That is a significant increase.  The future in the medium term looks reasonably promising, notwithstanding the challenge involved in bridging the time before those people become GPs.</p> <p>  On the topic of recruitment, I note-----</p></speech>

Increasing the number of training places for GPs does not actually address the manpower issue.  We are training GPs in order that they will emigrate because no young aspiring GP will sign the existing GP contract.  Nobody who is recently qualified is signing a new GP contract.</p></speech>

My own son was with me at the event last weekend, and he told me he would love to be a GP.  We have to ensure that we protect the future.  These efforts will be made in tandem.  We must increase the number of training places.  We cannot simply state that all new GPs will all emigrate and throw our hat at the issue.  However, we also have to reform the contract.  We must make it fit for purpose and make it an attractive career.  Those goals must be pursued together and I think the Chairman and I both recognise that.  It is not a case of doing one or the other.</p> <p>  I was recently in New Zealand, representing the country on St. Patrick's Day.  I was amazed to hear New Zealanders tell me of their high regard for the Irish medical workforce.  They see it as incredibly talented and well trained, which we can be very proud of.  They had one difficulty, however; they cannot retain these workers.  They all want to go back home.  This is the issue they are experiencing on the other side of the world.  Irish professionals come for a short while, but they do not commit.  They are not willing to stay.  That includes different disciplines, including nurses, GPs, physiotherapists and everything in between.  That is the other side to this.  The New Zealanders said to me that the Irish workforce is very mobile, even in the far-off countries to which they go.  They do not necessarily settle there but they like to go for a while.  That has always been part of the Irish psyche and make-up. </p> <p>  Bed capacity and ambulatory care have been referred to.  The move towards ambulatory care is a part of the national development plan.  It informs the decisions on where to locate elective procedures and where those hospitals will be built.  They will always be connected and related to the acute hospital but those decisions are being taken.</p> <p>  Recruitment for model 2 hospitals has been raised.  The questions mentioned are challenges for Kerry General Hospital and Bantry General Hospital.  This is a particular challenge for remote hospitals, model 2 hospitals and some model 3 hospitals.  The South/South West hospital group is currently undertaking a review of all its consultants and their particular skill sets to see where the demand is more acute and attempt to find solutions.</p><p>I discussed it with the hospital group on Monday of this week.  It assured me that the review would be completed within the next two to three months and that it would devise proposals to deal with the consultant challenges that have been mentioned.  I expect a number of recommendations from the South/South West hospital group, which I suspect will be replicated nationally.</p><p> I do not have information on insurance companies to hand but I can get someone to revert to the Chairman on the issue.</p><p> As to the &euro;460.2 million figure of appropriations-in-aid, the recovery of cost of health services provided under EU regulations is &euro;280 million and the receipts from certain excise duties on tobacco is &euro;167.605 million.  They are the main components.  There are a number of others, including recoupment from social insurance for certain ophthalmic and dental treatments, miscellaneous receipts, the Dormant Account Fund, which is &euro;2.7 million, and receipts from pension-related deductions in public service remuneration, which is &euro;3.9 million, but the bulk of the figure relates to the recovery of cost of health services provided under EU regulations.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, marine litter is a persistent problem affecting all regions of the world which needs to be urgently addressed.  Plastic, in all its forms, is a particular problem.  Due to its buoyancy, it can easily be carried by currents or blown by winds from land or seaborne sources.  It persists in the environment for an extremely long time.  It breaks down into secondary microplastic particles and there is now a growing body of strong evidence that plastics and microplastics are impacting on marine fauna.  As well as being created by the breakdown of larger items, microplastics are also entering the marine environment directly in a wide variety of forms, such as fibres, lost raw material pellets or through tyre wear.  Some marine microplastic litter is also caused by microbeads used in cosmetics, cleansing products and detergents.  A legal prohibition on microbeads has been the subject of two recent Private Members' Bills in the Oireachtas and in these debates the Department committed to drawing up legislation on this issue.  I know that members of this committee are passionate about the marine environment and all issues connected with it as evidenced by the contributions made to those recent Oireachtas debates.</p> <p>  As with many areas of the public service, the Department has faced very considerable challenges across all of its areas of operation in meeting its critical business objectives and priorities with limited levels of human resources.  Addressing the prohibition of microbeads through primary legislation is a policy priority for this Department, but staff resource issues coupled with a wide variety of other urgent marine environmental policy demands has meant that progress has been slower than anticipated.  As well as overseeing the implementation of the marine strategy framework directive monitoring programme and programme of measures and the general implementation of the OSPAR Convention, Ireland has a lead role in a number of actions under the OSPAR Convention regional action plan to address marine litter.  These include developing regulatory and economic recommendations for measures to reduce the impact of single use items on the marine environment; identifying marine litter hotspots in the north-east Atlantic; examining wastewater and storm water as pathways for marine litter, including microlitter; and developing measures to reduce the impact of expandable polystyrene in marine and coastal environments.</p> <p>  The Department is the lead Irish partner on the OCEANWISE INTERREG programme to reduce the impact of expandable polystyrene as marine litter.  We commission, support and are involved in the oversight of an array of monitoring and research programmes related to marine litter.  We are also working to develop an integrated national approach to the marine litter problem with other Departments and State agencies and are working to develop a number of measures with key stakeholders.  The Department is supporting a wide range of awareness raising and citizen activation measures such as An Taisce's world leading clean coast range of programmes and the green schools global citizenship marine environment programme and we are working to incorporate marine litter awareness into mainstream anti-litter programmes.  However, it must be remembered that marine litter represents just one aspect of our marine environmental work.  For example, we need to make progress on developing environmental spatial protection measures such as marine protected areas and also need to commence preparatory work for cycle two of the implementation of the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, such as revising our initial assessment of the environmental status of the maritime area including targets and indicators.  However, I am pleased to inform the committee that additional staff resources have now been made available and will be employed shortly on a full-time basis on marine environmental legislation with the legislation on microbeads prohibition being the priority item.  Proposals to prohibit the sale and manufacture of certain products containing plastic microbeads are included in our 2018 legislative programme and a memorandum to Government will issue within a month seeking permission to draw up heads of a Bill.  It is expected that the heads will be published by the summer.  The Bill will be put to the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity thereafter.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has indicated that he wants to see the Bill become law this year.  However, this may require choices as to which legislation is prioritised.</p> <p>  I should point out that the Department has done some work on this issue.  In  February 2017, the Department launched an online public consultation process on the proposed legislative ban.  We received more than 3,000 responses.  The volume and diversity of responses demonstrates the concern of civil society and stakeholders and these submissions are now informing our policy and legislative development.  In relation to the Prohibition of Micro Plastics Bill 2016, our primary concern is that the legislation which will be required is technically more complex and challenging than is drafted in this legislation.  As an example, as well as ensuring we have robust and future-proofed definitions of microbeads and plastic, we have to work out how the prohibition can be enforced, who will enforce it and what staffing and financial resources will be required to do so.</p> <p>  We are very concerned about the confusion between microbeads and microplastics in this proposed legislation as microbeads are only a small subset of microplastics.  As has been highlighted in previous Oireachtas debates, a national prohibition of products containing microbeads will have implications for the principle of free movement under the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  EU Commission approval will be required to obtain derogation from Single Market rules.  We are working on the development of a robust justification for our proposed national ban, which will have to be evidence based in tandem with the development of the legislation.</p> <p>  In January, the EU plastics strategy was announced and it proposes an EU wide ban on microbeads and other problematic plastic products under REACH regulations.  REACH is an EU regulation, adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals.  REACH applies to all chemical substances and places responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals, to provide information on the properties of their products and to register this information in a central database.  However, this ban may not come into effect for several years.  We will continue to work with the Commission on this issue but will do this in tandem with progressing our own national legislation.  However, to keep this in context, addressing microbeads is only one small aspect of the overall marine litter problem.  Also, while it is a priority, marine litter is only one of many categories we must address under the marine strategy framework directive and the OSPAR Convention.  These include pollution and contaminants, biodiversity and habitat loss and a wide range of other potential threats to the sustainability of our seas.  In conclusion, the Department is fully committed to addressing the issue and we look forward to the advancement of microbeads legislation within the timeframe that I have outlined.</p></speech>

It is a big problem.  The G7 summit in 2015 highlighted that this is a global challenge directly affecting marine ecosystems and potentially human health.  We are all familiar with the sight of littered beaches.  Let us look at microplastics in the context of marine litter.  They are small fragments of less than 5 mm and greater than 1 &micro;m and by weight, in some of the most polluted areas of the oceans 25% of the total mass of plastics are microplastics.</p><p>It sounds like it is a lesser problem.  However, the number of particles microplastics produce by comparison with macroplastics is much greater, as can be seen from the circulated graph.  This is significant because of the size of the microplastics.  They absorb, release and interact with pollutants that already exist in the environment much more than larger plastic particles because of the large surface-volume ratio.  Also, they release other chemicals that are inherent to microplastics, be they the monomers that make up the polymer or the additives themselves.</p><p> I have circulated among members a graph showing the pathway of microplastics, or plastic litter, in time.  As time progresses, the litter breaks down into smaller particles.  As it does so, there is an increase in the ability of these particles to absorb and interact with organic contaminants.  There is also an increase in the bioavailability of microplastics.  I refer to how many compartments of the environment they can penetrate and how many organisms they can penetrate.  Going down into the nanometre scale - there is, of course, a continuum - it is a matter of how many compartments of each organism can be penetrated.  Can it penetrate the circulatory system?  Can it penetrate a cell?  These are very different in terms of impact.</p><p> Let me refer to the types of microplastics.  Litter, such as the litter at beaches, breaks down into fragments.  There are plastics generated by machining by industry.  It could be a medical devices industry, a recycling industry or another.  Such an industry produces a lot of microplastic litter.  Synthetic fibres in our clothing are microplastics and they produce over 2,000 per wash.  This is a big input.  Astroturf pitches and roads are giving off fragments.  We are doing some work on this at present to determine the output.  The construction industry demands a lot of plastics.  There are many different plastics for insulation and piping.  This is a more diffuse source but, most likely, a large contributor.</p><p> The more primary types of microplastics are the microbeads.  Some estimates suggest that 2% to 3% of the total microplastic loading would be due to microplastic beads.  It is difficult to say.  Also to be considered are the nurdles that are used for microplastics to convert into other plastic products.</p><p> What have we been finding in the environment?  We have not been finding a lot of microbeads.  We are mostly finding fibres.  We are finding fragments.  The graph on this subject indicates, by way of grey dots, that in our first study we found 96% fibres and 0.2% microbeads.  Another large study, outlined in the slide with the red triangle, shows a figure for microbeads or spheres of 4%.  Another study, which examined the stomachs of fish, found no microbeads at all.  However, there are some freshwater studies that show more microbeads.  I refer to the Rhine and the Manchester basin.  It might be that microbeads are more concentrated in freshwater environments near high-urbanisation zones.</p><p> Most of the microbeads are plastics are channelled through the wastewater treatment system.  We find that most microplastics end up in the sludge, but some of the lighter ones go out into the receiving waters.  We know of some impacts on biota, especially in laboratory-based trials.</p><p> A range of different polymers make up microbeads.  Some are more toxic and hazardous than others.  There is a large size range.  Included are bulking agents and glitters, which do not sound so necessary in many cases.  I have an example of some microbeads from a toothpaste for children aged up to two.  I will pass it around to members so they may all see what it is.  There are up to 95,000 particles in one tube of the toothpaste.  Microbeads are in personal care products and detergents.  These contribute 2,000 to 3000 tonnes of microplastics per year.  Paints, coatings and abrasives contribute 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes per year.  This shows the volume produced by personal care products by comparison with more industrial sources.  There are alternatives.  Some companies are already using alternatives to microbeads to show they are not always completely necessary.</p></speech>

I am here today representing both myself and Dr. Audrey Morley.  Unlike Ms Mahon, we are not experts on microbeads.  I am a coastal geomorphologist and Ms Morley is a climate scientist.  Our interest in this is that we have had a number of MSc projects on this topic over recent years.  This is based on interest among our students and a more general interest in microplastics and in understanding that pollution is a problem.  When we began to examine this problem, we obviously read the literature to determine whether there was anything of note in an Irish context.  Our first study was in 2015.  Prior to 2014, there was really no published work on the Irish coastal waters or coast in this area.  From that point on, Dr. Amy Lusher, Dr. Mahon and the team in GMIT have published quite a bit of work on microplastics in the water column and in the stomachs of fish and seabirds.  There was nothing in some of the fauna that could potentially eat these.  I refer also to the shellfish.<br/><br/>It was very obvious that this was a problem internationally.  There is a lot of evidence that it is a problem internationally so we wanted to see whether it was a problem in Ireland.  Around 2015, a UN Commissioner responsible for food was visiting.  We brought her to a beach in Renvyle in County Galway to carry out an ecological survey.  When we were there, the level of pollution on the beach was very obvious.  As we were walking we said the sand looked interesting.  When we bent down and picked up some of it, we noted it was not actually sand but 100% microplastics.  Therefore, the sand on the beach is composed entirely of microplastics.  The students were very interested in moving into this area.  We were happy to supervise their projects.  The rest of my presentation is really an exposition of their work.<br/><br/>Mr. Jake Martin and Dr. Audrey Morley worked on a project in which they examined marine sediment.  On one of the cruises on the <i>Celtic Voyager</i>, they collected box cores, which are short cores of the sediments on the seabed, to investigate whether they could find any microplastics there.  Members will see from the map on the slide the location from where the samples were taken.<br/><br/>Dr. Amy Lusher from GMIT developed a set of protocols based on international best practice on how to identify microplastics.</p><p>These are just a few examples of what Mr. Jake Martin found.  Essentially one has to look under a microscope and identify every individual microplastic in a particular sample.  <br/><br/>The images on the slide on display are a representation of the box cores he collected.  The little blue ones at the top are the water column, and then one can see the sediments.  What the team found was that there were microplastics throughout the sediments down to a certain depth, which correlated quite closely to the initial production of microplastics in the 1950s and onwards.  As there is a certain amount of mixing in the surface layers due to trawling and ocean processes, the exact dates cannot be identified.  From this it can be seen that microplastics are in the sediment and in the water column.  The quantities in this area are in single figures for the most part; such as eight, nine, ten or 11 or that sort of quantity.  <br/><br/>The type of microplastics was also looked at.  The most common types are fibres and fragments.  These are essentially secondary plastics from the breakdown but they might also be primary microplastics, such as for example microbeads.  That is just a broad idea of what Martin <i>et al</i>. found.  <br/><br/>As part of a separate project this year, Christine Loughlin and Audrey Morley went out and surveyed the same areas to check for the robustness of this particular methodology and found statistically similar results.  That was really a check on the earlier work.  The earlier work was also published in <i>Nature</i>magazine, which is one of the highest impact magazines in the area.  It has been peer reviewed.  <br/><br/>As the sediments and the water column both have microplastics one might expect that fauna in these areas would ingest them, either accidentally by mistaking them for food or, if filter feeders, they might suck water out of the water column and ingest whatever happens to be in that water.  They cannot differentiate between plastic and non-plastic.  The next couple of projects were designed to directly sample some of the fauna.  This slide shows a Dublin Bay prawn.  Sonny and Morley had a look at these creatures, and took samples from the fishermen who caught them.  I should point out that Dublin Bay prawns are also present in Galway, off the Aran Islands, and these samples came from areas that were similar to those from where Mr. Jake Martin took his sediment samples.  Microplastics were found to be present and a percentage of each type of microplastic was identified in each individual sample.  Fibres again were by far the most prevalent.  For some reason there was a variation through time, and so it was not quite a straightforward process.  The earlier study I mentioned was also carried out off the coast of Iceland as part of this study and considered many more variables, including the ocean current, the sedimentology of the substrate, the presence of vegetation etc. to see which variable impacted the deposition of the microplastics from the water column.  There are many variables involved. <br/><br/>The message to take away is that they are present in the nephrops.  In terms of the depuration process, the microplastics are found in the intestinal tract, which is normally not eaten, so for this particular species that perhaps is not a serious problem.  However, there may be problems caused by toxins going into the muscle fibres of the nephrops themselves.  <br/><br/>The next study considers blue mussels, which are eaten whole in that anything within the shell is eaten.  This study was carried out in inner Galway Bay.  The sample sites are shown on the slide.  It was carried out close to Mutton Island, which is a wastewater facility and treatment outlet, as well as further along the coast in a special area of conservation, SAC, in Rusheen Bay.  In 20 samples - which does not show up particularly well in these slides, which are screen grabs from the identification process - the plastic can clearly be seen when examined under the microscope.  Going by the protocols, the number of plastics can be identified.  To validate this information would require more work in infrared spectrophotometry, which costs a lot of money and so is not available to our students.  It was not carried out in this case but is something that would need to be done at a later stage.  Many microplastics were found in the 20 samples.  There were over 5,000 individual microplastics identified by Ms Joanne Casserly in the 20 samples from this area.  That could be a very serious issue, and perhaps the Food Safety Authority should look further into that.  It could be a problem, and we would be concerned about that.  I should have mentioned that the samples were also composed from off the shelf mussels.  They were available for sale; Ms Joanne Casserly went to a shop and bought them.  The wild stocks actually had more microplastics per gram because they are smaller individuals than the farmed stocks.  <br/><br/>In summary, the evidence I have presented here suggests this could be a serious problem in our marine environment and should be looked at.  It is likely to pose a risk to human health and habitat quality, based on international research and evidence at an international level.  The evidence strongly suggests that we should be trying to reduce microplastics entering the environment.  We support the Bill, notwithstanding some of the issues Mr. Harrington pointed out earlier regarding the terminology used to describe beads and microplastics.  </p></speech>

I thank the officials and the academics for their attendance today because I believe that having this opportunity to interact with them is a crucial part of the legislative process.  I view it as a free tutorial, for which I am very grateful.  I also thank the Chair and the members of the committee for facilitating the discussion this morning.</p> <p>  The key point that emerges from the evidence before us is that there is no doubt but that there is clear evidence of the presence of microfibres and microbeads in sea life and on land, having been washed ashore.  The witnesses have presented clear evidence of that today.  The Dublin Bay prawn presented is a very distinct piece of evidence to that effect.  I believe this makes the legislation all the more worthwhile in that sense.  </p> <p>  I appreciate the point being made about the legislation I have introduced.  It deals specifically with microbeads that, according to the presentation, represent a small fraction in sea life and flora and fauna.  However, my Bill is a first or a second cut.  This is an iterative process and I am not tied to the fact that it should deal only with microbeads.  I am quite happy for it to be amended in any way to reflect the realities of the science presented before us.  If that means dealing with microfibres or any other particles present that fall into the general microplastic group, then I have no qualms about that whatsoever.  The key thing is that we are at a juncture where we are acknowledging there is a need to legislate on this issue.  It needs to be done post-haste.</p><p>My first question is to the officials, namely, Mr. Harrington and Mr. O'Connor.  They mentioned that the heads of a Bill will come before us or that a Bill is being worked on.  Can they be more specific on when that Government Bill will come before the House?</p></speech>

To recap on the remarks I made, my unit recently has been given two additional posts.  They are being appointed to marine environmental legislation with a focus on prioritising work on microbeads legislation.  The first of those resources will be arriving next week and it is aimed to have the second one within another five to six weeks.  They will be specifically employed on this particular legislation.  I aim to go to Cabinet within a month to seek approval to commence this work.  I hope that by the summer, we will have drawn up the heads of a Bill which will outline further our approach and our thinking in respect of this legislation.</p></speech>

While this not a remark directed at the officials <i>per se</i>but is more a political statement, I must state that this legislation has been in gestation since 2016.  I had hoped we would be further along the line at this stage because I have always expressed my willingness to withdraw my Bill were more robust legislation to come along.  This is a non-partisan and a non-political issue.  I want to take a bipartisan approach to this matter.  I still feel the need to ensure my legislation is kept on the books until such time as I see evidence from the Government as to the seriousness of its intentions.  That is notwithstanding the additional resources which have been allocated to this.  </p><p>I refer back to the originator of the legislation, who is Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  We are only taking up the cudgel on this.  However, we do need to see this Government legislation sooner rather than later.  I welcome the fact that Mr. Harrington is seeking permission within a month to draw up heads of a Bill.  I am anxious that the clock might tick down on the lifetime of the Government or that its mandate may expire.  It is a Private Members' Bill.  I am conscious that if Mr. Harrington is talking about the summer months for this, it then will not be long until we are into the autumn and then into 2019.  We do not know what is going to happen then.  As I understand it, my Private Members' Bill falls on the ending of that mandate.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right.  Resources have been sought internally within the Department on a number of occasions to progress this in a more timely fashion.  I need, however, to give the committee today a rounded picture of the work we undertake.  It is also included in the briefing note that we supplied to the committee.  I refer to other important work ongoing in the marine environment space.  We work closely on other research projects with organisations such as An Taisce.  That is important work in respect of raising awareness.  I would like to reflect on that.  While this legislation is not where we all would have hoped it would be, it is not that no work is being done in this particular area.  On the timescale issue, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said he would like to see this legislation become law this year.</p></speech>

I recognise Mr. Harrington is speaking for the Minister here.  However, we will have an opportunity to talk to the Minister directly about this as well and kick the tyres on his commitments.</p> <p>  I will return briefly to the science again, just for a moment.  The scientific rigour that has been applied here shows us that the research in an Irish context is nascent in the grand narrative of things.  It is from 2014 I think.  I acknowledge the witnesses probably have all been working in this area prior to this.  Can I get a sense from the witnesses as to where the Legislature needs to go on this issue?  That is pulling them from the realm of pure academic research into the realm of politics.  I directing this at Dr. Nash.  If she was designing legislation or a response to the scourge of microplastics and microbeads, this plastic pollution that is killing our flora and fauna and being ingested by human beings, where would she go, where would she start or what would she do?  It is a tough one but I just want to get the perspectives of the witnesses on it because I think it is vital.</p></speech>

We are also involved in EU projects like BASEMAN.  We are only now developing methodologies to standardise sampling microplastics in order that the studies can be compared.  I am looking at it from a larger perspective.  If we go with the legislation as is, we are missing the point in one sense.  I will use an analogy.  Everyone here has been at a GAA match.  The legislation is focusing on the umpire on the sideline as opposed to what is actually happening in the game.  It is such a small part.  It is important and I do not disregard it.  We could go home and everybody will recognise a microbead and everybody knows that it is bad.  However, by focusing our legislation on that, we are missing a huge element of the issue.  We need to have more evidence.  A lot of research is coming on board and within the next 12 months, we definitely will have a huge amount more that we can put towards the legislation.  We do not know, with confidence, where to identify all the sources, their quantities, the locations of the hotspots or how we can mitigate against it.  If we put in this legislation, we will miss a lot of mitigation that essentially could stop it down the line.  We just recently have-----</p></speech>

Looking at the evidence that has been supplied here on the fragments and the potential sources, if we focus only on microbeads, we will be missing a whole element that will feed into it.

That makes the legislative proposal before us here quite narrow.</p><p>We could legislate for microbeads, but the point is we need legislation with much broader scope because, based on the evidence before us, microbeads only represent a portion of the plastics used.  In that sense, the legislation is quite narrow.</p></speech>

We might also consider marine debris which is made up of larger objects that end up as microplastics.  There is a huge amount of research that has not yet been published.  Studies of seabed integrity are under way.  They are looking at the invertebrate animals that live in the seabed to see if they are affected.  One such study is ongoing in trawls.  We have found microplastics in several spider crabs, or normal harbour crabs.  A lot of information to be released in the next eight months will make the case a lot more robust.</p></speech>

What concerns me listening to Dr. Mahon is not only the issue of microbeads and microplastics but also the releasing of contaminants.  We are not just talking about a marine littoral problem.  We are also talking about pollution, contaminants, the impact on biodiversity, habitats lost and the effect on the sustainability of the seas.  Without a doubt, this is a serious problem.  In 2016 I introduced legislation to deal with microbeads and microplastics and start building an awareness of this issue.  Two years on there is no legislation before us other than Deputy Sean Sherlock's Bill.  The delegates have given us the evidence from their research in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  Evidence is emerging around the world and the GMIT research has been really significant.  However, we must consider the entire coastline.  This is only a sample.  I wonder what is happening in the Irish Sea, my area around Tramore and Waterford and along the northern coastline.  We need more evidence.  There must be greater support for the institutes in order to build the evidence required and we need this to be written into the legislation.  That is what my Bill would have provided for.  It would have provided for monitoring in order that the relevant information would be available to us on an all-island basis.</p> <p>  In addition, I note that this is a transboundary problem.  What is the Department doing on an international level?  Are officials working through MARPOL, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and the various international associations in pursuing this issue from an Irish perspective? </p> <p>  For me, legislation is not coming quickly enough.  I understand the Department needs resources, including human resources, to develop legislation.  However, we have a problem with macro and microplastic pollution; contaminants such as polymers; and the impact of toxins in the food chain.  It is a serious issue and we must have legislation to deal with it.  When I introduced my Bill, the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, said he would have to talk to the European Commission because of Single Market rules.  We now know that that did happen and that the Minister sought a derogation which we have not seen either.  From my perspective, the evidence is stacking up that we have a serious problem which potentially is impacting on human health.  As  said, there are so many aspects to it, including pollution, contaminants, habitats lost and the impact on biodiversity and sustainability of the seas.  We are, therefore, not moving fast enough and I am asking the Department to move with greater urgency.  Two years have passed.  We have Deputy Sean Sherlock's Bill, but if the Department has something better I ask that we be allowed to see it and soon.  We must take into consideration not only microbeads and microplastics but also the collation of data, which will mean supporting the institutes in order that we work proactively as well as retroactively to deal with what is an ongoing problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conall O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#G00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  To reassure her, one of the reasons we are so stretched is that we are working very hard to deal with the marine litter problem generally.  It is the central marine environmental concern, although loss of biodiversity and habitat is also a very serious concern.  In many respects, it is the new climate change problem.  People are realising we have created an enormous problem with this wonder substance that was developed in the 1950s.  It has the tremendous property of being able to last forever and is water resistant, etc.  It is used on a disposable basis.  These are, however, the very properties that make it problematic in the environment.  We now realise the marine and other environments are replete with this problem.  The marine strategy framework directive includes specific targets to deal with marine litter.  We are required to achieve what is called "good environmental status" using the different criteria included in the directive.  We are also working under OSPAR, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, and on different actions to deal with this probelm with the OSPAR intercessional group on marine litter.  It is a constant iterative process and new evidence is emerging all the time, to which we are responding transnationally and nationally.  </p> <p>  The legislation to address microbeads will deal with one aspect of the problem, but a range of other measures will have to be put in place in the coming years.  They will have societal implications, affect how we live and deal with things across Ireland, Europe and globally.  For example, dealing with microfibres will be problematic because in washing artificial fabrics microfibres are generated.  The plastic ropes used in plastic nets break down into fibres.  The measures that will ultimately be needed to deal with things such as this will have societal implications.  We will have to bring society along with us globally.  </p> <p>  We fully accept what the Senator is saying.  As I said, one of the reasons we are so stretched is that we are trying to deal with so many measures, but we are happy that we now have the resources to work on this specific legislation.</p></speech>

They are only part of a range of measures being looked at.  With reference to sediment, we have actually taken samples from sub-tidal and inter-tidal zones around the country.  We are about to seek tenders to have these samples analysed.  That is just one of the things we have done.</p></speech>

There are terrestrial sources of plastics pollution, one of which is manufacturing, within which there are dispersed sources.  It is the manufacturing side of the problem that we are looking at today.  If we try to tackle all of the problems in one go, we will never find a solution to tackle all of them.  We will have to proceed through introducing pieces of legislation.  That is why a piece such as this is good.  The need for evidence is clear, but there is also a need to invoke the precautionary principle; in other words, we do not need specific evidence on every part of the coast to say this is a problem.</p><p>As we know from international research that it is a problem, we should move, rather than wait for evidence, but in saying that we also need to know if the legislation will be successful.  We must monitor it as we go along to see if it is working.</p><p> Mr. Harrington has said he has two new staff resources to work on marine and environmental areas.  There is, of course, the likelihood that the priorities for the people in question will change in time such that they will be moved from particular areas such as dealing with this legislation and microplastics to foreshore legislation which has been sitting there for a while.  Marine spatial planning is coming into force and we are working on putting it together on a national scale.  We have also been waiting on marine protected areas for a while.  Therefore, I can see the new staff being overwhelmed very quickly.  If we can get focused legislation like this through in a timely manner, we could start to work on some of the other problems we face.</p></speech>

If the departmental officials take anything from this meeting it is that there is a very strong consensus in the committee that we want to see something being done in a timely fashion.  One of the values of engaging in pre-legislative scrutiny is that it allows us have these conversations to ensure the final legislation - be it from the Opposition, the Government or an amalgam of the two - will be the best possible.  I welcome all of the comments made.</p> <p>  Mr. Harrington is overstating the potential problems from a European Commission perspective when he says there will be implications for the principle of free movement.  In its engagement with the British Government on this issue, for example, the Commission explicitly stated this might not be the case and that there could be circumstances where a ban on certain products for environmental reasons could be consistent with internal market rules and that, therefore, a derogation would not be required.  It is important to note that it is not as hard and fast as Mr. Harrington's choice of language suggests.  As we know, the French have passed legislation dealing with microbeads and the British Government is progressing its own.  There are some reflections at EU level on how EU policy in this area fits into global policies.  Notwithstanding that, I am interested in Mr. Harrington expanding a little more on two comments made in the presentation.  What are his thoughts on including "robust" and "future-proofed" definitions of microbeads and plastics?  Will he expand a little more on the information contained in the briefing note?  He spoke about working out how prohibition could be enforced.  If there are even initial thoughts on that issue, I am interested in hearing them.  </p> <p>  I was quite taken by Dr. Nash's comments on the umpire analogy.  The straight question from our perspective is what would she like to see added, taking account of Dr. Lynch's point that we cannot include everything in one piece of legislation.  Could certain things be added at this point before returning to others?  This is not just about substances to be banned; there is also the concern about mitigation, on which I am interested in hearing further comments.</p> <p>  As a side point, last week we were considering another piece of water-related policy - the revised EU drinking water directive.  It is about trying to take a risk-based approach to removing things from sources of drinking water.  We have spoken primarily about the marine end of the microbeads issue.  Is there any research or consideration from the science or Department end in terms of the implications for drinking water?  It is something we might need to consider in the context of the revised EU directive.</p></speech>

What we intend to have is separate stand-alone legislation dealing with microbeads.  We are not anticipating including this piece of legislation with any other legislation such as legislation to deal with the maritime area or the foreshore (amendment) Bill.  </p> <p>  Dr. Lynch mentioned maritime spatial planning.  We set up a separate unit within the Department that is advancing work on that matter.  We have recently published a roadmap in that regard.  Again, it will not have any real impact on our achievements.  The resources we are receiving will be prioritised to deal with the microbeads Bill.  I do not see any particular change to what I have set out.  </p> <p>  Dr. Lynch mentioned marine protected areas which are also of great interest to the committee.  It is an area for which we want to provide a legislative basis.  Initially, the priority again will be dealing with microbeads.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin for his helpful remarks.  As I mentioned, I am getting a clear sense of the interest of the committee and the Oireachtas in this area.  It has been clearly noted.  I also thank the Deputy for his helpful comments on the engagement between the United Kingdom and the European Commission.  I was reflecting the initial legal advice we had received, but as we go into the matter in some depth, it may move to the scenario described by the Deputy.  We have been advised on an interim basis that there is a need for engagement with the Commission which has stated it wants robust justification in that regard.  We are all agreed that we are not going back to first principles in providing an evidence base for the Commission.  Some of our colleagues have given the results of their research.  As I see it, it is about the collation and distillation of the research and analysis that has been undertaken.  It is about saying to the Commission that there is a problem and evidence to represent the problem before proposing a legislative solution.  </p> <p>  I will ask my colleague to make some brief points on the other questions concerning the definitions of plastics and enforcement.</p></speech>

We want to ensure whatever definition we will have will encompass any potential plastic microbead in order that we will not miss something.  We do not want a manufacturer to be clever and find a synthetic polymer that could be harmful to get around the definition which we want to be all-encompassing, if possible.  We also want to take in polymers that may not yet have been developed.  That should be straightforward enough.  The UK definition is not that bad, but we are looking at the issue with our own national experts.</p> <p>  Before moving to enforcement, I will respond to one of Dr. Lynch's points about monitoring.  Under the marine strategy framework directive we must identify the good environmental status of our waters and set targets and indicators.  We must then put a monitoring programme in place.  That is extremely important.  Much of our research and the work of the Environmental Protection Agency will heavily inform what we will choose to monitor.  We need to identify the ideal candidate species to monitor and the ideal locations, etc. in order that we get a picture of what is happening with microplastics and marine litter in general.</p><p>We would envisage that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, would have a role in enforcement and that we would create the standard authorised person.  There is much legislation that provides a model for this where people can go out and take samples, look at things, analyse, investigate and so on, and then prosecute if necessary.  That would be the role but there would obviously be a financial cost attached to that which we need to factor into our considerations.</p></speech>

This is more what we are picking up from the air than what is formally available.  The European Commission recognises that the train has left the station with regard to microbeads.  Concerns have been expressed that all of these solo actions by member states on various different things are being potentially corrosive to the Single Market.  It is not that they are not justified, just that the Commission would prefer a unified step forward.  If somebody has taken this step beforehand and been at the vanguard of getting a derogation from the Commission, it makes the job easier for people following on.</p></speech>

It has been a very interesting discussion.  We will be fully supportive of a ban on microbeads but I hear the point that has been made by experts and academics today, that microbeads represent a small fraction of the problem and the issue is far broader than that.  There are two ways in which one can deal with that.  One is to broaden the Bill so that it deals not just with microbeads, but microfibres and microplastics more generally, or second, it can be a first step which opens the door and is followed quickly and rapidly with extra legislation which tackles microfabrics and microplastics.  I have an open opinion as to which is the best way to go.  The basic point is that the broader picture must be addressed with urgency, but comprehensively and in a robust way.</p></speech>

There is a large quantity of microplastics intersecting with marine life.  It is growing.  Is there a tipping point?  Maybe that is a point that could be addressed.  Is it just a case of quantitative changes or does it turn into something more serious at a certain point?  I take on board the point that has been raised by Dr. Lynch that there is a very significant presence on our coastlines in Ireland.  I welcome the Bill and that the Government is no longer opposing it.  I thought the initial reaction from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was depressing and deferred to business interests, the cosmetic industry and the European Union.  It is clear that change on this issue is unstoppable.  The debate has started, many people are engaging in it and there is a mood for change.  Some European governments have introduced legislation and the US will have a ban within two years.  Is that correct?  I think the UK is doing something similar and maybe the witnesses could clarify that.  It is important that Ireland does not lag behind on this.  It is clear that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did not want Ireland to be a pioneer on it but change is under way now and it is important that Ireland does not lag behind.</p></speech>

My Bill is very simple and it deals with a bespoke element of the entirety of the challenge - microbeads.  I am very happy to change the title of my Bill to call it the prohibition of microbeads Bill 2016 or such.  This is where the scientific research has been invaluable to us.  It really explains to us just how large the scope is and the methodology that one needs to underpin all of the research, and that work is ongoing.  The wording of my Bill is "any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence".  I allow for summary offences.  It calls for penalties if one manufactures, sells or imports.  I also set out what would be actually banned.  These are all what I would call products of conspicuous consumption.  They are not necessities.  They include a "personal care product including but not limited to a facial scrub, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste".  We are not banning those products but we are banning products of that nature that contain microbeads.  We have a scientific definition of microbeads.  My Bill is very simple.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the Government's intention, I cannot see what it is that the committee will produce that is more robust or comprehensive than this if we are dealing specifically and only with the issue of microbeads.  That is the point I really want to make.  I welcome this interaction and the bona fides of the Department officials.  I recognise the challenge.  Maybe the wording of my Bill needs work and I acknowledge that.  One could amend my Bill to say that microbeads or microplastics means plastic particles of less than 5 mm in diameter, for instance.</p><p>In one fell swoop, the legislation would remove an array of products for which there is incontrovertible proof that they find their way into water courses.  That could be done in a very short time.  That was also the intention of Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill before it was opposed.  I do not see why that could not be done at an early juncture while working on the wider issues in relation to marine litter in parallel.  The witnesses came here with the issue of marine litter very firmly in their sights.</p><p> Finally, I return to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point that the funding for research on this is something that needs to be looked at.  I will go to Science Foundation Ireland and will speak to the Minister and the Marine Institute to see if there is a mechanism.  It may be that there is a mechanism for researching this area in terms of societal challenges through Horizon 2020.  I was at the negotiating table for Horizon 2020 and recall that this was looked at as one of the societal challenges and that there should be funds available for this.  It would not take a lot of money to buttress the research that the witnesses are doing which is vital if we are looking at the entirety of the coastline of Ireland.</p></speech>

We have had a discussion on microbeads, microplastics and microfibers and what we will include in the legislation.  I agree with one of my colleagues from GMIT who said there will be a need for ongoing legislation in this particular area.  Our thinking currently is that we should proceed with the microbeads element in the first piece of legislation.  Much work will have to be done on microplastics and microfibers, specifically on what we will prohibit.  We must be very careful about those definitions.  If we can expand the legislation we will try to do so but we are currently going to hold on in the area of microbeads.</p> <p>  I do not have any specific information on the Deputy's query relating to the US, but I will get some information and return to him with it. </p> <p>  I appreciate Deputy Sherlock's bona fides on this.  We have a number of issues with the Bill to which he referred, which we outlined at the time.  I am not sure if it is a simple matter of changing the definitions.  There is much more detailed and robust work which needs to be done in developing this legislation.  If the Chairman and the committee wanted to invite us here again when we are more advanced in the development of our own legislation to discuss this issue again, we would be happy to oblige.</p></speech>

Humans can pass microplastics so we are fine.  When one buys fish, it is gutted and that is where all the microplastics are contained so they are quite safe to eat.  There are other issues around nanoplastics which are a whole other area.</p> <p>  On bioaccumulation, we can see that sea birds have died but that it mainly as a result of macroplastics, which they cannot pass.  We are specifically not looking at nanoplastics, which refers to chemicals being absorbed, but it does bioaccumulate and go up the food chain with fish eating insects, but when the guts are removed they are quite safe for us to eat.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Richard Manton and Mr. John Bailey of Engineers Ireland; Mr. Peter Hynes, Mr. Richard Shakespeare, Mr. Pat Nestor and Mr. S&eacute;amus Murphy of the County and City Management Association; and Mr. Paraig Cantwell and Mr. John Commane of the Institute of Clerks of Works.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The committee normally gives witnesses approximately four minutes for each opening statement, but there is a fair bit of flexibility.  I invite Dr. Manton to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the policy officer with Engineers Ireland.  I am joined by Mr. John Bailey, who is a chartered engineer and a fellow of Engineers Ireland.  Both of us are representing Engineers Ireland at this meeting.  Engineers Ireland is one of the oldest and largest professional bodies on the island of Ireland.  We have over 25,000 member engineers.  Our membership incorporates all disciplines of engineering, from consulting and contracting organisations to the public service, semi-State organisations and academic institutions.  Engineers Ireland awards the professional title of chartered engineer, which is the gold standard for engineers working in Ireland.  This professional badge of excellence is awarded following a rigorous assessment and is recognised internationally and in Irish law.</p> <p>  We acknowledge the work done by the joint committee and its advisers on building standards and controls.  I refer, for example, to the Safe as Houses report, which was published last December.  It is clear that we would all like to see an increase in the supply of safe high-quality housing that provides value for consumers, particularly in the ongoing climate of housing shortage.  Therefore, Engineers Ireland welcomes in principle this Bill, which endeavours to increase the delivery of much-needed units of accommodation.  We agree that bringing vacant properties into residential use, if done correctly, will help to address the housing shortage and to revitalise villages, towns and cities.  We commend the move towards co-ordinated building permitting, which we believe should be applied to all building projects.  However, we believe the Bill as drafted will have little effect on the availability of accommodation in the short or medium terms.  While we do not question the intent of the drafters of this Bill, we are concerned about its potential unintended consequences.</p> <p>  We would like to raise three main points, the first of which relates to building standards and safety.  The Bill proposes to replace the statutory requirement for a fire safety certificate, a disability access certificate and compliance with other parts of the building regulations with a works permit.  The effect of this would be to introduce a third system of building regulation compliance documentation, following SI 9 of 2014, which is known as BCAR, and SI 365 of 2015, which is known as the opt-out.  Since its introduction, BCAR has promoted a greater awareness of the need for proper design and inspection of fire protection measures.  An unintended consequence of the proposed Bill might be to relegate this awareness to a works permit scenario, with a consequent lesser emphasis on the importance of the fire safety certificate and disability access certificate documentation.  The Bill proposes to revise the technical guidance documents.  It should be noted that building regulations are minimum performance standards that are set for the safety and comfort of occupants and the general public.  We have particular concerns relating to fire safety.  If buildings approved under this system are perceived as being built to lesser standards, this could further distort the property market.</p> <p>  The second point we would like to make relates to the proposal in the Bill to impose a time limit of two weeks on a local authority to revert with the results of a pre-application assessment.  No time limit is proposed for the local authority to deliver a decision for the subsequent one-stop-shop application.  We note that no provision is being made for the local authority to seek an extension of time for the determination of the application.  There is no provision for comment from a third party.  No provision is being made to allow the local authority to seek additional information from the applicant.  We believe the failure to provide for first-party or third-party appeals of decisions could give rise to a constitutional challenge.  If the desired effect of the Bill is to be achieved, the processes needed to accommodate the above issues need to be faster and less cumbersome than the existing processes.  All the while, the time required to assess a design proposal will not be affected by this Bill.</p><p> Our third point refers to authorised persons and local authority resourcing.  The Bill outlines the role of authorised persons in enforcing building regulations and proposes the creation of a new register of such persons.  It is absolutely essential that these authorised persons are qualified and competent professionals, and that they are approved for specific activities.  For example, a structural engineer would not be competent to review an electrical engineering design.  Furthermore, the number of competent persons needed to carry out design assessments and conduct site inspections are simply not available currently in the public sector.  We would also question how the qualifications of authorised persons would be vetted before they are placed on a register.  It is probable that most, if not all, of the assessments and inspections would have to be contracted out to the private sector where there is an emerging shortage of competent professionals.  Therefore, to populate a new core of independent inspectors, and achieve the timelines outlined in the Bill, significant additional resourcing of local authorities would be required.  We challenge the assertion that the Bill would not entail a direct cost on local authorities or the Exchequer.</p><p> Engineers Ireland commends the work of those who drafted the Bill and the committee.  We believe that moving towards a co-ordinated building permit system and a greater inspection and enforcement capacity in local authorities would assist in the efficient supply of safe and high-quality housing.  However, we do not believe that the Bill can achieve this objective.  We look forward to continuing our engagement with this committee and with the Government in order to develop solutions for consumers and the wider public.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague from the land use and transport committee of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Mr. Richard Shakespeare, who is seated on my left, is the assistant chief executive of Dublin City Council.  We are also accompanied by Mr. Seamus Murphy, chief fire officer with Mayo County Council, and Mr. Pat Nestor, senior building surveyor with Dublin City Council.</p> <p>  I wish to confirm that the return of currently vacant or under-utilised upper floors to residential use is a high priority for the CCMA. We strongly support any initiative which will assist in the regeneration of urban areas and, in particular, our small towns and villages.  That said, we have concerns regarding the current proposal that I would like to share with the committee.</p> <p>  The objective of this Bill appears to be the smoothing of procedures currently in place to support the provision of residential accommodation.  The main procedural requirements that the Bill proposes to replace with a single, one-stop-shop process are: planning consent; fire safety certificates; disability access certificates; commencement notices; and certificates of compliance.</p> <p>  Local authorities are committed to facilitating the provision of residential accommodation and measures which support this goal are very welcome.  The general welcome for the provisions of the Bill from Deputies and Senators who have or contributed to the debate so far are noted.  There is clearly a perception that the current regulatory controls in place in terms of obtaining planning permission or demonstrating compliance with the building regulations are onerous and excessively time-consuming.  We do not share that perception.  We consider that the proposals may not confer advantages in terms of delivering projects and will introduce significant risk for developers in the event that their applications ultimately fail on the completion of projects.  We have included two comparative tables in our submission, one which illustrates the existing planning and building control provisions and a second which outlines the timescale for the proposed system.  We suggest that the existing systems can deliver more regulatory certainty at a faster pace.</p> <p>  The Bill proposes to legislate for entirely different functions within a single statute.  Notwithstanding the comments on combining regulatory and building control systems, the provisions of the Planning and Development Acts and the Building Control Acts were set down for entirely different purposes.  While the Building Control Acts focus on standards in buildings and construction, the Planning and Development Acts have a much broader environmental and social role beyond the built environment.</p> <p>  The one-stop-shop panel of authorised persons is expected to reach a conclusion on proposed projects compliance regarding all aspects of the building regulations in two weeks or less.  We are of the belief that this is not an adequate period in which to consider complex construction technology issues.  While a building may well have been correctly designed and significant time taken by the designers to consider these matters, it is the local authority that is expected to approve the designs as per the provisions of the proposed Bill.  This is an onerous undertaking and a fundamental departure from long-established principles and existing provisions of building control.   If there are difficulties with compliance issues and these are not resolved upon repeat inspection, a development will be deemed to be unsuccessful and the developer must revert to the established planning and building control procedures.  This would appear to place the developer in an almost impossible situation.  Having entered the one-stop-shop process in good faith, a developer could be left with a completed building which cannot be occupied.</p> <p>  It is our view that the proposed system carries little, if any, advantage in terms of the time necessary to gain approval for a project as against existing procedures and, in addition, transfers significant risk on to the owner of the works, the authorised person from the one-stop-shop panel and the local authority.  Having approved, inspected and signed off on the works, the local authority cannot expect to be immune from responsibility and liability if there is a failure in the building that results in harm to occupants, firefighters or others.</p> <p>  I again thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the opportunity of presenting today.  We are happy to respond to questions as best we can.  The two tables to which I referred earlier outline the comparison in respect of the existing system, which, since the Bill was initially promoted, has been greatly improved by the February 2018 schedule of exempted development.  The latter has taken a large chunk of the problem on the planning side out of the equation.  The comparison speaks for itself and I would be happy to go through the tables with members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paraig Cantwell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#M00500"><p>I am the chairperson for Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr.  John Commane, who holds the position of secretary.  We both work as clerks of works and building inspectors with different local authorities.  Our organisation has members throughout the country.</p> <p>  We thank the committee for the opportunity to comment on the proposed Bill.  We welcome the proposals contained in the Bill because they address the issue of vacant properties and propose their return to much-needed residential use.  Many units are located above shops and offices and they will provide a challenge in the context of being converted into or refurbished as habitable spaces.  Last year, the Government announced a repair to lease scheme to tackle similar problems.  The progress of this scheme has been poor to date.</p> <p>  We see the concept of a one-stop shop as a model which should be tried.  It is a good proposal to streamline the process and create a one-stop-shop situation in local authorities.  As a previous witness has said, three different timelines are associated with the certificates and permissions and three different Departments are involved.  The proposal seeks to reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved and make it easier for owners to renovate their properties.</p> <p>  The proposed works permit will raise some questions, particularly in the case of residential property to be refurbished above shops or offices.  It will be a challenge to comply with the proposals regarding disability access certificates, fire safety certificates and technical guidance documents.</p> <p>  Towards the end of the 1990s and in early 2000s, the number of clerks of works engaged in inspection greatly decreased.  The reduction was due to the uncontrolled self-certification by developers and builders of their construction work.  Defects were overlooked or ignored, resulting in many seriously sub-standard developments nationwide.  It is the view of the Institute of Clerks of Works and Building Inspectors that had competent clerks of works been employed, most of the current problems would not exist.  This assertion was supported as recently as last year in a reply given to Deputy Boyd Barrett during Leaders&rsquo; Questions when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, correctly identified a lack of inspections and the absence of qualified clerks of works on building sites as the main contributory factor to defective work and non-compliance with building regulations during the boom years.</p><p>It is a fact that in this country local authority inspections of the built environment are not at as high a percentage as in other countries.  We should learn lessons from the Celtic tiger years, particularly well known cases such as Priory Hall and others that had serious infrastructural and structural issues.  Despite the fact, presumably, that the work was signed off by others we still had problems.  We foresee that the problems will still exist due to a lack of independent oversight.  For that reason, we The Institute of Clerk of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland are of the view that more independent inspections from local authorities are needed to carry out these inspections.  We support more independent oversight and inspection by appropriately trained and competent personnel employed in the local authority services. </p><p> At present clerks of works are employed on major construction projects throughout the country.  Some are directly employed by the client, local authorities, health boards, Department of Education and Skills and other agencies.  Others are employed directly by architects and consultants. </p><p> It is important to emphasise the importance of additional resourcing by local authorities at administrative and technical levels as such staff will be required for the implementation of this Bill. </p><p> Clerks of works have been a core element of local authority teams over the years as well as playing an important role within the HSE, Department of Education and Skills and other such bodies on very complex projects. </p><p> Concerns have been raised by other bodies about the competence of authorised persons who will carry out the inspections under the system.  The authorised person regime has been in place since 1992 and is the basis for all local authority building control inspections.  This objection makes no sense.  If the Bill is not passed, the same regime will continue to apply.  Local authority building inspectors do not have to be registered under the Building Control Act 2007 as assigned certifiers do. </p><p> On inspection by an authorised person, we the Institute of Clerk of Works and Building Inspectors in Ireland understand what is meant in terms of the powers they have, more so than someone who is working under Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, or SI 9.  The numbers of inspections dictated by BCAR are at critical milestone points in construction before work is closed up.  Who better to carry out these inspections and report back to architects, engineers or surveyors than a clerk of works who is based on site or calling to sites at different intervals?  We are after all working together to ensure a good quality of work is achieved using correct materials and procedures. </p><p> The potential of this authorised person regime would give a local authority a panel of people who would be appropriate to the needs of whatever the inspection was and who could be ticking off the same list.  In some cases, it might be checking if there is an operational fire alarm; in other cases, it might have to call in a specialist to do something more complex.  This would effectively streamline the various processes which are all doing the same thing. </p><p> The recommendation that local authority building control be reviewed and resourced in the Safe as Houses report would align with an increased role for authorised persons as contemplated by this Bill </p><p> It follows that for a clerk of works to be an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; under the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017 they must either be an employee of a local authority or a public body or be specified on the list. </p><p> It is the Minister by way of a statutory instrument who will set out the criteria to get on the list.  Membership of the Institute of Clerk of Works - Building Inspectors in Ireland has been for many years and currently is recognised as a pre-qualifier by local authorities and other Departments for a post of clerk of works. </p><p> There must be no compromise on quality or safety as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 will still apply. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#N00300"><p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  I will make a general comment before I focus on the presentation by Engineers Ireland.</p> <p>  I wish to stress that the purpose of this Bill is never to minimise fire or disability standards and I stress this every time I speak on the Bill.  The purpose of the one stop shop is to try to harmonise three different processes into one.  The fire and disability standards remain exactly the same as they are under the Building Control Regulations today.  There is no deviation in standards but we are trying to harmonise planning exemptions, fire certification and disability certification into a one stop shop process where one can go into the local authority and get the whole thing done and dusted rather than going through three separate processes, the way it happens at present.  At no stage are the fire and disability certification standards being put at risk.  The current building control regulation applies to this work, the very same as it applies to SI 9.</p> <p>  On the issue of the local authority not having time to seek the time extensions, we are looking at existing building and from a planning process perspective, there is no public consultation.  We are not looking at redesigning the exterior of the building, we are literally talking about the reconfiguration of the interior of the building.  In relation to the planning process and third party appeal process, we have to start looking at realistic ways of how we get these buildings back into use.  We do not think there is a need for that.  Equally now the Government has come along with SI 30, which is almost identical to what this Bill is proposing, which removes most of this from the planning process also.  </p> <p>  On the local authority trying to seek additional or further information, let us look at what we have done for the development of 100 houses.  They must go through a pre-planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it is during that process that the detail is thrashed out.  Then once one submits the application there is no further information or anything else after that, but the board must make a decision in a set period.  It is in the pre-consultation period that all the work must be done.  There is an indication coming from that process that the pre-planning process does work in the development of 100 houses.  We might need to tweak this as we go forward, but the intention is to try to get this done and dusted.</p> <p>  On the issue of the "authorised person" and the qualification of such persons, we can take some information back on this.  Equally we look at the building control regulation and the qualification that applies to the signed certification process and how to those people qualify.  The come from different backgrounds and they can qualify to sign off on certification.  We are looking at the same type of person here.  We are not trying to deviate from it.  We may have to work on that aspect of it.  On the point that the public sector does not have the resources, that is correct.  That is why we said that a framework agreement could be entered into where people who have these skills are engaged by the local authority through a framework agreement.  </p> <p>  On the cost to the Exchequer, an assigned certifier costs money, an authorised person costs money so we would see a similar fee would apply.  It is up to the Minister to decide on that.  That would not be a cost on the Exchequer, the developer would have to pay for the certification process.</p> <p>  I think they are the main points.</p> <p>  In the submission from the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the CCMA raised the issue of the different functions in respect of planning and development and building control.  The functions are different but they are carried out by the one local authority and the personnel in that local authority.  I do not see why there should be an issue with joining those two functions together as one function in the future, in the interest of trying to streamline the process.</p> <p>  Section 4 of the Building Control Act allows the building control authority to grant dispensation or relaxation of the requirements of building regulations.  This Bill acknowledges that, but equally it is seeking technical guidance documents to be produced by the Department to address this issue.  At present, we have 32 local authorities, each with its own interpretation of the dispensation or relaxation in respect of fire or disability certification.</p><p>This Bill is asking the Government to produce a technical guidance document to facilitate the refurbishment of existing buildings into habitable dwellings.  </p><p> In terms of the executive function, I have no problem if there was to be a requirement that the chief executive has to sign off on this.  We all know, from our work with the local authority, that the planner or fire officer makes the decision and that the chief executive only signs a document that is presented to him at the end of the day.  If there is a feeling that this Bill is weaker because the signature of the chief executive is not required, I have no problem with addressing that.  </p><p> The point was made that the developer is exposed at the end of the day if the authorised person will not sign a works permit.  That is no different from what is happening under building control at the moment if the assigned certifier will not sign a certificate of compliance on completion.  They are the very same processes.  I believe the building control regulations, BCAR, are weak in this respect.  Disability and fire planning all has to be agreed before builders go to site.  Currently, under BCAR, if I am converting my building I can send a seven day notice, and even if I have no fire certificate or disability certification I can start providing I have applied for those certificates.  We are dealing with old buildings here, so once work commences the first certification, or the disability certification, might not arrive for two months.  The work might be completed, and it is possible that none of it is compliant with BCAR.  I believe the system we are proposing is better because all of these issues are dealt with upfront, before builders go on site.  At the moment there is a weakness in BCAR in that builders can go to site and commence construction without having a fire certification or a disability certification.  We are dealing with older buildings, which are more dangerous and more complex in terms of both of those items.  Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill is much stronger on that issue.  Since this Bill was introduced the Minister has signed off on statutory instrument No. 30 in February, so the whole planning process has been exempted from both of these situations.</p><p> There is a question of liability here, and an additional piece of work on this might be required, but we would see this as being very similar to how BCAR operates at the moment, where the public liability lies with the assigned certifier, or in our case the approved person.  They are the professionals and they sign off on that.  In my time in the D&aacute;il I have continually pushed for independent inspection.  I believe that the country needs to go in that direction.  I can ask a local authority what percentage of buildings it is inspecting.  The system in place at the moment relies on self-regulation, where the builder is paying the assigned certifier to sign off on his own work.  This Bill seeks to move towards independent inspection.  We strongly believe that this is the way it should be for everything, not just in this respect.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.352" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Bailey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#O00200"><p>I believe we are <i>ad idem</i>on most items.  It is a very good idea to have a full design completed before we get to site.  That does not happen at the moment because there are cost implications, and detailed design tends not to get done until statutory approvals have been obtained.  The Deputy mentioned an analogy between the authorised person and an assigned certifier.  We have very strong reservations about the position of assigned certifiers at the moment.  The reason for that is that we are not jacks of all trades.  I am a very specialist structural engineer and I am simply not competent to look at an electrical design or heating and ventilating.  Therefore, to ask a single assigned person - the assigned certifier - to sign off on all aspects of those technologies is not realistic at all.  We feel that if that was to be done for authorised persons they should be split into specialties, the same way as engineering and architecture are.<br/><br/>This Bill has many good points, particularly the idea that everything is signed off through a one-stop shop and having designed completed before getting to site.  They are no-brainers.  In fact, we would like to see those aspects of the Bill extended to all construction projects in the State.  We certainly agree that independent inspection, and indeed independent assessment of the designs before commencement, is a no-brainer as well.  </p></speech>

Where would the clerk of works come in?  It would lead to more inspections on-site.  We have some members who are assigned certifiers, but even outside that we feel that there are not enough inspections on sites.  That is our main concern.</p></speech>

We all know the type of work we are talking about might be a very simple or very complicated piece of construction work.  Some might not involve any construction work at all; perhaps a fabric change is all that is required.  Other projects might require detailed and numerous inspections.  This Bill offers that required flexibility.  The number of inspections that has to take place during the process will be indicated on the final approval.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hynes" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#O00600"><p>I note the opening remarks about the minimising of standards.  I presume that the intent is that there would not be any compromising on standards.  That in itself is perhaps part of the problem.  Compromise and flexibility are sometimes part of the same discussion, and part of the difficulty of dealing with existing structures is shoehorning them into standards which were written after they were constructed - sometimes centuries afterwards - without requiring fundamental change to the existing structure.  While the intent not to minimise or compromise standards at all is shared, it may be that some of the issues may require flexibility in these standards.  That is a topic that needs to be ventilated and should be part of the discussion on technical guidance documents.  Perhaps this Bill is not the arena for it.  We have to figure out what is acceptable, what combination of flexibility is acceptable, and where local discretion should be allowed to vary very stringent requirements to meet common sense situations as they arise.  Even the intent not to compromise standards is not as straightforward and simple as it might appear on first reading.</p> <p>  On the question of decisions in our system currently, decisions are made when the final document is signed.  Decisions are not made by planning officials or by fire officials but rather by the delegated person when that signature is made.  That gives rise to a concern about the liability that may accrue to certain personnel under this Bill.  We share absolutely the ambition to harmonise and streamline the processes in the best possible way.</p><p>The processes are significantly different.  There is a limit on the extent to which they can be handled by a multi-skilled team.  As a previous speaker said, the skill sets are extremely specialised and are dependent on training and experience.  They are not easily transferable from one to the other.  We would share the ambition on pre-planning and pre-planning discussion.  We have considerable experience in different areas.  If one looks at examples of best practice around the country where the planning process seems to deliver on the ambitions and objectives we all share, one will see that pre-planning is a big part of that.  We welcome the ambition to produce technical guidance documents on dispensations.  We would welcome the opportunity to contribute to that discussion.  It might take some time, but we welcome that ambition.  The key concern at our end relates to what is agreed before work starts on site.  How can it be confirmed that what has been agreed and accepted is delivered?  Part of that relates to inspection regimes.  If we take this route, an inspection regime will need to be built.  That has resource and cost implications.  The question of whether those costs would be borne by the public purse through central or local government, by the developer or by the consumer is one for another day.  Costs and resources will be required to provide for an independent inspection regime, regardless of whether this work is done inhouse or is outsourced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Richard Manton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#P00200"><p>I thank Deputy Casey for his comments.  I take his point that his intention in proposing this Bill is not to reduce standards.  It is intended that in the awarding of a works permit, standards will remain the same.  However, I would be uncomfortable with the replacement of the requirement for a fire safety certificate.  I will make a point about the current operation of the seven-day notice.  We share the Department's characterisation that the replacement of the fire safety certificate requirement would be a highly retrograde step in this new system of building control regulation.  For good reason, it currently takes quite some time to assess an application for a fire safety certificate.  There are many considerations to take into account in the refurbishment of vacant buildings.  I will not go through them all, but they include the means of escape, the types of material, the spread of smoke and compartmentalisation.  The risk that is currently associated with the operation of a seven-day notice is that someone will go through the process of being awarded a fire safety certificate at a later stage following a rigorous assessment.  We would not like to see any compromise in fire safety regulation.  We would have concerns about the awarding of a works permit if the inspection regime that is currently proposed were not up to the same standard.</p></speech>

We might have to look at the exact wording.  We are saying that the works permit will include a fire certificate and a disability certificate.  This means that the very same process which is gone through today will have to be gone through under the system we are proposing.  I will take on board the point that it is probably not realistic for this to be done in two weeks.  When we interact with people about the vacant properties all over our towns and villages that are just sitting there, we are told that the process is very complex and drawn out.  It takes a period of time.  We are trying to harmonise that without changing the standard.  Our intention is that the works permit we are proposing will include within it the current fire certificate, disability certificate and exempted development certificate.  I will take on board what the witnesses have said about time.  I appreciate that fire safety is complex and not straightforward.  It is more complex when an existing building is being retrofitted than it is when a new building is being constructed.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on some of the points made by Mr. Hynes.  He spoke about different skill sets.  Local authorities are responsible for the approval process anyway.  They show they have the skill sets we are talking about when they implement the approval process.  Fire officers, disability officers and others are using these skills every day of the week.  They are there at the moment.  We are not bringing anything extra to the approval process, but the inspection process is different.  This is where it is said that there could potentially be a cost to the State.  I remind the witnesses that builders and developers currently have to pay assigned certifiers, and we are saying that the authorised person charge should still fall to the builder.  Where is the extra cost to the Exchequer?  We have acknowledged that the expertise is not there and that some of this might have to be part of a framework agreement.  Such an agreement would be done with a local authority which would appoint an independent assessor to a project to oversee independent inspection.  That is where we probably want to get.</p> <p>  The Minister has given a commitment in respect of the technical guidance document.  That piece of work or process has already started.  Although the Bill we are proposing would not do anything different from what is provided for at the moment, we are clearly putting our hands up and saying there can be 31 or 32 different interpretations of "dispensation".  I appreciate that flexibility will be required in certain cases, but perhaps there should be less flexibility in this regard.  If the local authorities had technical guidance setting out how to refurbish existing building stock - perhaps showing how to take a number of models and develop them out - it would be much easier for them to follow than it is for fire officers to interpret how relaxed they should be in respect of one building or another.  I am saying all of this as a quick response to what we have heard from the witnesses on this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1217" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018032800002#P00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I acknowledge Mr. Bailey's point that we are <i>ad idem</i>with regard to the intent and the thrust of this Bill, which is being proposed because the existing systems are not serving the people we represent as they were intended.  He mentioned the vacant house refurbishment scheme, which was introduced by the Government last year and under which it was intended that 800 applications would be approved.  If the existing systems were serving the people adequately, we would have had 800 approvals under that scheme, but instead we had none.  We have a housing emergency and crisis.  The guidelines pertaining to the development and progression of vacant units, including over-shop units, so that they enter into the market are restrictive.</p><p>Perhaps the valid point made by Deputy Casey addresses the concerns of Mr. Hynes with regard to liability.  Mr. Hynes and his colleagues are not served well by the fact that there are no guidelines for existing buildings.  It is not right, proper, fair or appropriate that the guidelines which apply to new-builds have to be used.  This must be addressed forthwith.  I am surprised that it has not been addressed to date.  It has been confirmed here that, as Deputy Casey alluded to, it is intended is to bring together all the resources of the local authority, which is responsible for issuing these certificates, in order to ensure we no longer have all the delay and prevarication that exists at present.  As public representatives, we hear in no uncertain terms on a regular basis that things have to change.</p><p>The point that needs to be made about the system of certification is that self-certification cannot continue.  We know all about the ramifications and the lessons we have learned in that regard.  In the future, the certification would ideally be done by the local authorities.  If they had the resources and the personnel to facilitate this sort of independent certification, and were in a position to charge appropriately, it would give them an income stream, if nothing else.  They would be independent almost in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners.  This will not be possible in the absence of certification, however.  That is what we have to strive towards.  In the meantime, we are saying that the only way in which this can move forward is for it to be contracted by the local authority to assigned certifiers with relevant qualifications that make them suitable to meet the demands placed on them.</p><p>The end game from our party's perspective is to move towards independent certification run and led by local authorities and that the costs associated with it will not be as severe as they are in the marketplace today.  If one looks at the costs associated with such a system in the UK it is very favourable in comparison with the situation down here.  In order to get to that end game we have to play our part in so far as we can in improving the system.  That is why I brought forward a Bill.  That is why we invited stakeholders such as the witnesses with expertise and professionalism to have an input into it so we can instruct Government in the hope it adopts it as policy and that it is enacted.  That is the way the democratic process works, as frustrating and slow as it is.  If we can speed it up, it is our duty to do so and that is what we want to do.  </p></speech>

We all share the aspiration to get vacant, older units back into use, none more so than rural local authorities.  It is true the further we get from the skylines of the greater Dublin area, which are crowded with construction cranes, to places where they are a threatened species and still have not returned after the migration.</p></speech>

We share the aspiration.  It is a very important priority for local government to get people living back in our towns and villages.  If we do not achieve repopulation, many of our smaller towns and villages will be on a downward spiral and it will not change any time soon unless initiatives like this take hold.  We absolutely share the ambition and aspiration.  If I understand what Deputy Casey said in his last contribution, the intent is that the processes of deliberation on fire certificate disability access and exempted development, which has by and large been simplified since February, would be dealt with within two weeks.  That is an ambitious aspiration.  I do not think it is realistic in any system to expect things to be that radically transformed.  If the Bill was simply asking for the streamlining of systems to deliver those certificates as they stand in a timescale that is set, there may be a realistic deadline which we could discuss and agree and deliver on but what is set is set.  If it is set at a week, we will endeavour to deliver.  We would be happy to have that discussion.  It is a bit like the health care system.  The services delivered in ear, nose and throat care are radically different to the services delivered in cardiology care.  Would we want the two combined if we had problems in both areas?  The members can make their own choices on that.  We would certainly welcome a discussion on it.</p> <p>  On the question of technical guidance documents for existing buildings, a great deal of progress can be made on it.  We would certainly welcome the opportunity to input on it.  There is always a balance between strict conformance with standards.  When a standard is set, it is a standard; it is not a standard less 10% or 20% with the discretion left in the hands of the operative to make the call.  It is a tricky balance.  Technical guidance documents for existing buildings is an area where we could make some progress. </p> <p>  The transfer of liability for ongoing inspections to local authorities is quite a significant change from the current regime.  It will have resource implications.  If the resources are available it can be made to operate.  If that is where the Bill takes us, we will obviously try to make that work.</p> <p>  While we share the ambition, we have concerns around the timelines that have been set.  If the clarity that we have heard is that the same systems apply to more rigorous timelines, that certainly can be made to work and we would be happy to have an ongoing discussion on it. </p></speech>

I can see where Mr. Peter Hynes is coming from.  It would be a big financial burden under the current set-up with taking on local authority employees.</p> <p>  The issue of technical guidance documents for existing buildings is definitely a good idea but as Mr. Hynes said we should draw a line so there will not be grey areas.  It would have to be very clearly defined which technical guidance documents one would work to for existing buildings.  They are our main ideas.  </p></speech>

We all have the same overall objective.  Technical guidance documents would assist the fire officer to deal with the certification of applications.  It comes back to the fundamental issue of independent inspection and assigning an independent inspector.  It should be throughout the whole construction period.  We sometimes question whether we should review the opt-out clause in inspections.  Every building should be independently inspected.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Hynes a tricky enough question.  What percentage of buildings does each local authority independently inspect?  I do not think it is happening.  I think if they are reaching 15%, that is all they are doing.  That is why the thrust of everything we are doing here is moving towards independent inspection that is controlled by the local authority, either through a framework agreement or direct employment.  Most of the cost would be borne by the developer who has to pay for the service himself.  He is employing his assigned certifier but we believe the local authority should assign an independent inspector and the developer should pay that fee to the local authority, not to the assessor.</p></speech>

I do not question the <i>bona fides</i>of the Bill in any shape or form although I disagree with most of it.  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, Mr. Cantwell said inspection and the absence of qualified clerks of works on building sites was a main contributory factor to defective work and non-compliance with building regulations during the boom.  During the boom time many of the problems came to fruition and we are now dealing with the consequences of that with regard to a number of standards we have had to rightly bring forward.  Under the Building Control Act 2007, local authority building inspectors do not have to be registered as assigned certifiers do.  That is staggering to me.  It is something that would have to be included in the Bill.  It would have to be changed in the Bill.  I have a real fear around the liability it would incur in local authorities.  I have a real fear around the one-stop shop.  I do not think it has been thought through properly.  In my local authority in D&uacute;n Laoghaire any appointments that have been asked for in the Department on the delivery of housing have been sanctioned.  I do not see taking on staff being a problem in the delivery of housing but it has to be independently certified.  We need to go back to the original status where the clerk of works was involved.</p><p>As Mr. Cantwell said, due to the many specialties that exist under the &ldquo;clerk of works&rdquo; umbrella, in his statement:  </p><blockquote>Clerk of works are employed on major construction projects throughout the country.  Some are directly employed by the client, local authorities, health boards, the Department of Education and Skills and other agencies while others are employed directly by architects and consultants.</blockquote><p>If we want to amend the Bill in any shape or form or send it back to the drawing board, we must address the question of independent assessment and certification, and ensure there are no consequences for the standard of building and development, be those projects retrofits or new builds.  People must be able to move into or purchase a property knowing that it has been built to the highest possible modern standard as opposed to the standard of some of the buildings built during the boom when we did not have proper regulation.<br/><br/>I have grave concerns about the Bill, although I understand its intent and acknowledge its bona fides.  I will explore the Bill further.<br/><br/>Does anyone among the witnesses wish to respond to my comments?</p></speech>

Individuals with such qualifications are registered construction professionals, for example, chartered engineers, which we as Engineers Ireland award, registered architects and chartered building surveyors.  It is imperative that whoever assesses designs and conducts inspections on site is qualified to an appropriate level.  As the Chairman recognised, these are complex building projects and are becoming even more complex for good reason, that being, to ensure the highest safety standards.  Therefore, we would not like to see any step back from that.</p> <p>  Related to that is the type of inspection regime.  I would be concerned if there was any step back from the current level of inspection.  A point was also made about independence, but we can revert to that at another time.  The current BCAR inspection regime is based on risk assessments and assures that there are inspections at key, critical moments in the building process.  We do not want to see inspection only being carried out at the end when the key building components have been covered up and it is otherwise difficult to see what has happened on site.</p></speech>

I do not have the numbers with me, but I confirm that Dublin City Council has an inspection rate of 80%, which is probably top of the class.  The target is 15% and I understand that some counties are in the 20% to 40% range.  Mayo meets its target of 15%.  The numbers form part of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, performance indicators.  They are available, so I will be able to get them for the committee if that was the intent of the question.  The point about there being less than a 100% inspection rate is taken.</p></speech>

There should be a number of independent inspections, not just one.</p></speech>

From our point of view, that type of inspection regime is about giving the occupants of the building confidence that it has been built to a standard.  As to our number of visits, we risk assess depending on whether a building is for habitation, office work, etc.</p></speech>

They are part of the same equation.</p> <p>  On the question of small towns and villages, which are of particular concern for rural authorities, other factors need to form part of this discussion.  Trying to get our small towns and villages repopulated is partly about some kind of financial incentive to make it more attractive to move to the core of a town rather than to undertake a self-build on its edge, which has been the norm for at least two generations.  Quality of life issues also need to form part of the thought process, although I acknowledge that they cannot be addressed in this Bill.</p></speech>

I also know that groups such as Women's Aid have expressed concerns about the issue in a formal submission on the Bill.  The background to the matter is that section 60 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 introduced access to domestic violence orders for persons living together in intimate and committed relationships, replacing the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 that applied to persons living together as husband and wife.  The intention was that same-sex couples who were not civil partners would have the same access to the protections under the 1996 Act as opposite-sex unmarried couples.  The wording was taken from the definition of cohabitant in section 172 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term &quot;intimate and committed relationship&quot; was framed to provide a threshold to which the court must have regard in deciding whether to make an order.  While concerns raised by voluntary sector groups about the suitability of the wording were given careful consideration, it was decided to proceed with the amendment unchanged.</p><p>I have considered this matter further in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I am of the view that it would not be in the interest of victims of domestic violence if perpetrators could try to avoid having orders made against them by arguing that the relationship was not committed, for example, because of their sexual activity with a third party, or because the victim of the violence had previously sought to end the relationship.  This is particularly relevant to safety orders now that section 6(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill will remove the cohabitation requirement for couples who are not married or, indeed, couples who may not be in a civil partnership.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, 19 and 20 provide that the term &quot;intimate and committed relationship&quot;, where it applies in the Bill, will be amended to delete the words &quot;and committed&quot;.  To ensure protection for victims of domestic violence who are or were in an intimate relationship which is no longer sexual in nature, amendment No. 2 proposes to make clear that a relationship does not cease to be an intimate relationship for the purposes of the Bill merely because it is no longer sexual in nature.  The text of the amendment is drawn from section 172(3) of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.</p></speech>

They attempt to provide a remedy for women in situations where they need an emergency barring order in the evening or late at night when the courts are closed.  Obviously, we can envisage such scenarios and we want to avoid a situation where somebody could effectively be driven out of their home in the middle of the night and have no recourse and nowhere to go.  This was discussed at length in the Seanad, and the Government said it would look at it again.  The Minister's proposal is the Government's re-examination of the matter, and I welcome that there has been some movement on it.  By deleting the section, the Minister's proposal provides for special sittings of the District Court to issue emergency or interim barring orders after hours.  We welcome that.  The point we are trying to highlight, however, is that there are practical problems associated with that.</p> <p>  Firstly, there is the issue of cost.  There is a call-out charge payable to judges on each occasion where there is an out-of-hours hearing, and obviously there are costs related to opening the court, staffing it, closing it afterwards, etc.  Having consulted with members of domestic violence support services, the opinion of SAFE Ireland is that actually these hearings are rarely convened, for whatever reason.  I suppose it is speculating that it is for reason of cost.  Why is it that these hearings are rarely convened or rarely happen?</p> <p>  Other practical issues arise around a woman's ability to make her way to an emergency court sitting in the middle of the night when she lacks child care and so on.  I appreciate the Government is trying to address these problems.  I am not sure that our answer is the right one either.  However, these issues need to be looked at.  We have obligations under the Istanbul Convention.</p> <p>  The worry is that the Government's proposal might make it appear that there is a provision for out-of-hours emergency barring orders, but the practical reality would be that they would be out of reach to women.  Our amendments allow for a garda to make application for an order by telephone in an emergency situation.  The woman can then appear and swear an affidavit the next day and the issue can be dealt with that way.  I do not think it is a brilliant solution, but it is an attempt to overcome that problem.</p></speech>

It is clear that there is no perfect solution.  We are trying to avoid a situation where the victim is obliged to stay in the house with a possible abuser, and that for various reasons there is no quick remedy.  I am not so sure.  I would like to hear from the Minister.</p><p>As amendment No. 14 may address it, let us see what the Minister has to say.  </p></speech>

I know where they are coming from and am familiar with the issue.  Unfortunately, it is an issue that arises from time to time and does present difficulties.  I acknowledge the Seanad amendments, particularly those in the name of Senators Ruane and Black.  I do not see how I can go along in its entirety with the point raised by the Deputies for reasons that are not only obvious but appropriate.  The section provides that on request from a garda attending a domestic violence incident, a garda of appropriate rank can authorise communicating with an on-call judge to apply for an out-of-hours barring order.  There is always an on-call judge.  That is not an issue.  Judges are rostered and are on call to expect appropriate calls for sittings and action.  My officials, in consultation with the Courts Service, the Garda and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, have examined section 10 to see what improvements and adjustments may be needed to the text.  Amendment No. 14 proposes a new section 25, as referred to by Deputy Wallace, to provide for the arrangement of the out-of-hours sitting.  The new section will apply to applications for interim barring orders, protection orders and emergency barring orders but would be limited to cases where a garda actually attended an incident.  It is broad enough to include cases where a victim of domestic violence walks into a Garda station to immediately seek assistance or to seek immediate assistance.  I am proposing that this new section, which has been drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, would replace the current section 10.  To my mind, the new section is legally clearer and will be workable on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.</p><p>I have a problem with amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  The interests of justice demand that the court has an opportunity to assess the case fully and the demeanour of the applicant for any order on a face-to-face basis.  This is where I have a difficulty in respect of telephone calls, emails or what might be regarded as a less regular point of view.  We must remember that these applications are being made on an <i>ex parte</i>basis and only one side is being heard.  The respondent may not even be around and will not be on notice.  Consequently, I do not believe it appropriate or proportionate to allow for a telephone call or an email application for a barring order from anyone, given the serious consequences for the respondent and the likelihood that this person would be immediately barred from the property.  Allowing applications to be made by telephone - allowing applications that might be made in a rather casual manner where it would be really difficult to verify the identity of the applicant - would give rise to serious problems.  I also believe there could well be applications of a mischievous nature or even worse, applications of a malicious nature by parties with an involvement here.  The sections of the Bill that provide for different orders do not provide for applications for such orders to be made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Applications are to be made by the person who will be the subject matter of the order and who will ultimately benefit from the order except in certain cases where the Child and Family Agency may make an emergency application as provided for in section 12.  I have a concern that even if the amendments were to accepted, which I am not minded to do, they do not set out any criteria or threshold for a court to determine that a telephone call or electronic application would be appropriate in a particular case.  In conclusion, where there are cases in which there is an immediate risk of harm, the new section 25 proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 14, which provides for the special court sitting on an emergency basis, will resolve the fundamental issue for victims of domestic violence, which is really quick access to court and a speedy hearing all, of course, in exceptional circumstances having regard to the fact that we are dealing with an emergency application in the first instance.  </p></speech>

It talks about a garda of appropriate rank.  It does not specify or define what appropriate rank is.  It then talks about how such a garda can authorise communicating with a on-call judge.  As it does not say who they authorise, I do not understand the purpose behind it.  If an applicant wishes to make an application to a judge, they can do so on an emergency basis.  I think section 10 as drafted is a bad piece of drafting.</p><p>Deputy Wallace's amendment aims to limit the communication to telephone or secure electronic means.  On a lot of previous occasions, people would just call to a judge's house and get an <i>ex parte</i>order, which has happened previously, so I would be concerned.  While section 10 is badly drafted and should be deleted, the amendment would limit the communication even more because communication includes telephone or secure electronic means but it would limit it to these means were Deputy Wallace's amendment to be accepted.</p><p>I have the same concerns about Deputy Clare Daly's amendment because it provides it &quot;may be made by telephone or other secure electronic means, subject to the applicant&rsquo;s undertaking to swear a grounding affidavit&quot;.  Obviously, the situation with which people are dealing here arises is the middle of the night when there is an issue and the Garda is called.  If the members of the Garda believe the husband has assaulted the wife, they should and can arrest him for a criminal offence.  That is what should happen.  I share the Minister's concerns about people being able to simply apply easily for an <i>ex parte</i>order to get a barring order to get somebody out of the house in the middle of the night.  Obviously, if there is any evidence of violence, the Garda should intervene and arrest the person suspected of violence but aside from that, section 10 confuses the whole issue.  I would take it out.  </p></speech>

This was similar, although I take Deputy O'Callaghan's point that the Garda could simply arrest the person.  However, there may not have been the level of violence that would warrant an arrest.  I am not sure.  The Minister said that anyone could ring up and it could be malicious or vexatious.  I find myself in the unusual position where I am in staunch defence of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are not talking about just anybody ringing up.  We are talking about a call made by a garda who is on the scene, who has assessed the situation and who believes there is a requirement to remove the violent party from the home dwelling.  Rather than requiring a sitting of the District Court, we propose that such a garda be authorised to simply get the permission of the judge in the immediate situation by phone or email.  It was certainly not our intention to preclude members of the Garda from calling out to the judge if that is what they wanted to do instead.  Our intention was to ward off the idea of cost or logistics preventing the special sitting of the court referred to by the Minister.</p><p>Maybe we have not got the wording right and we might need to look at it again on Report Stage.  I agree there are issues.  I am a little uncomfortable with emergency barring orders being issued <i>ex parte</i>and in the physical absence of the applicant.  If the Government could give a commitment to ensure the out-of-hours sittings for emergency barring orders either do not incur a cost or that the cost would be covered, that would give some reassurance to overcome the deficit with which we are trying to deal.</p></speech>

There is no easy solution to it.  I will not press the amendment.</p></speech>

However, I need to do so in a clear and proportionate manner.  I take Deputy O'Callaghan's point about section 10.  I and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel are on the same page on this and want to ensure that adjustments are made to bring about improvement to the text.  I will examine it again because what we need is clarity, particularly in emergency situations, which are often in the middle of the night involving a tense atmosphere.</p> <p>  We must also ensure we do not blur the distinction between the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the role of the judge in these cases, as well as the need to separate entirely the judgment call of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the urgency of the situation and the role of the member of the Judiciary in deciding a case on certain circumstances.  I will examine the wording of section 10 again to ensure there is clarity.</p> <p>  As far as costs are concerned, I do not see that as an issue.  There is a roster of duty judges for emergency situations.  These are not hearings which take much time.  They can be dealt with speedily having regard to the circumstances, urgency and importance of the cases involved.  Oftentimes they are heard at short notice in the residence of the district judge.  Costs are not really an issue and I would not like it to be portrayed that emergency court hearings are in some way not accommodated because of financial considerations.</p> <p>  These are serious and emergency issues.  Unfortunately, they are becoming more frequent.  The law must respond to the needs of the citizens and the public.  That is why my feeling on section 10 is that it needs considerable improvement.  We must see what we can do between now and Report Stage, particularly in the area of clarity.</p></speech>

In an ideal world, we might have a sergeant in every Garda station but we do not, which might limit this proposal.  Section 10 does not contain such a threshold.  Will the Minister clarify this?</p></speech>

It is a valid point and we will look at it.  It is important, however, that the attending officer is of sufficient rank to be in a position to make this call.  I will re-examine the areas of the garda attending or a garda with sufficient knowledge to be in a position to exercise that call before Report Stage.</p></speech>

These provisions are included in section 20.  Order 59, rule 10, of the District Court rules provides that the clerk of the court shall give a copy of the order under the Domestic Violence Act to the respondent or send it to him or her by prepaid post.  This is set out in the District Court domestic violence rules in SI 202 of 2005.  It should be noted that if a respondent is present in the court when an order is made he or she will have been notified of the order.  This is provided for in section 19 of the Bill, which replaces section 10 of the 1996 Act.</p><p>A new subsection (3) was inserted into section 19 on Committee Stage in the Seanad, on foot of an amendment tabled by Senator David Norris and others.  The new subsection provides for the service of orders by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My officials, in consultation with the Court Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, have examined section 19(3) to see what further improvements and adjustments might be needed by the text.  Amendment No. 11 proposes to insert a new subsection (5) into section 19, to provide that a court may direct personal service of an order by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This will apply in cases where the respondent was not present, where the order was made in the absence of the respondent and where there are reasonable grounds for believing he or she may evade service, or where there is a good and sufficient reason to direct that an order be served by a garda.  I propose the new subsection (5), which has been drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, would replace the current subsection (3).  Amendment No. 10, therefore, proposes the deletion of the current subsection (3).</p><p>Are we dealing with amendment No. 11 also?</p></speech>

I have been discussing the whole basis of the jurisdiction of the District Court under current divisions and whether we might update and modernise District Court jurisdiction to allow for a broader jurisdiction.  At present, the judge of the District Court is the person who is assigned to the appropriate district.  If that person is not available there is an issue to ensure the temporary assignee has an association with that district.  It has been enshrined in our courts legislation for many decades.  Obviously, we want to ensure there is full compliance and there are not any legal or jurisdictional issues.  This is why the amendments are necessary, to avoid any doubt or legal uncertainty that might arise in the context of an application made or having been made, or a consequent or subsequent judicial review or action.</p></speech>

That obviously places a lot of obligations and burdens on the applicants.  The fact that it is specified in section 33 that it is an offence to contravene a safety order, a barring order or the other orders set out in the legislation is to be welcomed.</p><p>This amendment is probably unusual.  It seeks to make the offence of breach of a court order not just a summary offence but also an indictable offence, based on the serious nature of the breach.  If it is an offence that is prosecuted on indictment there would be a further penalty.  I am conscious of the fact that breaches of court orders are not offences, so I welcome the fact this is being made an offence without prejudice to the fact that contempt of court jurisprudence will still operate.  I am interested in what the Minister has to say in response to the proposal that it be an offence prosecutable on indictment as well as summarily.</p></speech>

I am somewhat concerned that there might be unintended consequences detrimental to victims if an offence of breaching a domestic violence order was triable on indictment and punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.  There would be adverse consequences for the availability of these orders.  Orders granted under the Bill will be civil orders.  The threshold of proof in these cases is the balance of probabilities.  This is not as onerous a threshold as for criminal cases, where the threshold is beyond all reasonable doubt.  In addition, orders are granted in most cases in the summary jurisdiction of the District Court.  There is concern that if a breach of an order attracts a punishment of up to five years imprisonment, it could have a very distinct chilling effect in relation to the granting of orders.  Respondents would be expected to contest the cases in a more vigorous manner and in the interests of justice the courts might, in certain circumstances, be less inclined to grant the orders.  I have no doubt that this would be to the disadvantage and detriment of victims and those seeking redress.</p><p>These concerns were highlighted by the Law Reform Commission in its report of 2013 entitled, Aspects of Domestic Violence.  The commission expressed concern that increasing the possible punishment for breach of a domestic violence order to five years imprisonment might well lead the courts to a conclusion that <i>ex parte </i>orders should no longer be permissible.  Of course, if that was the case it would really undermine the efficacy of the legislation.  The Law Reform Commission pointed out in its report that the purpose of criminalising a breach of a domestic violence order is primarily to deter respondents from acting in breach of the order, and also to punish respondents who are in breach of the order.</p><p>Making the breach of a domestic violence order a crime does not replace other criminal offences, such as assault, or indeed the issues referred to by Deputy O'Callaghan in a discussion on an earlier amendment where he cited An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to arrest a respondent for a criminal offence.  If an offence of assault or criminal damage is committed by a person acting in breach of an order, the other offence should be prosecuted as an additional charge.  I see that happening on a regular basis.</p><p>Criminalising the breach of a domestic violence order would not have the effect of punishing serious misconduct, such as assault causing harm.  I am concerned about unintended consequences or unintended practices that might arise.  Deputy O'Callaghan is seeking to underline the seriousness of the issue, but I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

On the face of it, it appears to give an indication of how seriously we take breaches of safety and protection orders, which is good, but we can see how the idea of a chilling effect might play out.  While it looks good, it goes against what I believe in terms of reducing incarceration.  I do not believe we should go in the direction of mandatory minimum sentences either.  I am glad the amendment has been withdrawn.</p></speech>

Deputies will be familiar with section 30 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which was enacted after the publication of this Bill.  That Bill, in the form of section 30 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, provides for a substantial amendment of Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act of 1992.  It would be simpler and clearer to make provision in this Bill for specific amendments to section 12 of the Criminal Evidence Act which defines the relevant offences to which Part III of that Act applies.  These amendments, which have been provided for in amendment No. 21, will ensure that the full protections of Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 will apply to victims of offences for breaches of domestic violence orders.  It also applies to the issues of control and forced marriage.</p> <p>  As section 34 of the Bill will no longer be necessary if amendment No. 21 is accepted, it is appropriate that it be deleted in its entirety.</p></speech>

The section will allow criminal proceedings to be brought in Ireland for forced marriage offences committed by Irish citizens or residents anywhere outside the State, subject to a requirement known as &quot;dual criminality&quot;, that is, that the act must also be an offence in the place where it was committed.  Offences committed outside the State on Irish registered ships or aircraft can also be prosecuted here in Ireland.  The purpose of this amendment is merely to ensure that criminal proceedings may not be brought in the State for a forced marriage offence where criminal proceedings have already been determined in another country in respect of the same act.  This is a standard provision in legislation where provision is made for jurisdiction for offences that may be committed outside the State.</p></speech>

These sections, as members will see, are in Part 4 of the Bill which provides for replacement of the reference to the Domestic Violence Act 1996 in existing legislation with reference to the corresponding provisions in this Bill.

I understand the joint committee wishes me to address the topic of rural transport policy.  In my statement I will focus, in particular, on public transport.  To assist me in dealing with subsequent questions, I am joined by Ms Margaret Malone who manages the rural transport programme within the National Transport Authority.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific area that will be the focus of my presentation, I would like to set in context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the National Transport Authority.  Its remit is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  I have included in Appendix 1 of my statement more detail on our role and remit.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements in place with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  They include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including the provision of the rural transport programme.</p> <p>  I will address the authority's responsibilities in relation to regional and economic strategies of regional assemblies.  Under legislation, the NTA is required to provide for a regional assembly a report on "the issues, which, in its opinion, should be considered by the regional assembly in making a regional spatial and economic strategy".  This function is set out in section 31FF of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The authority has recently made such submissions, as required.</p> <p>  On the provision of public transport services, public transport in rural areas is provided in the following ways.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provides rail services under contract with the National Transport Authority.  Changes to rail services require the approval of the authority.  Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a variety of services through its commercial Expressway services that are licensed by the NTA and through a network of subsidised public bus services under a direct award contract with the authority.  Both services serve many rural towns, with frequencies varying from several times a day to a weekly service.  Changes to the subsidised services require the approval of the authority.  Other commercial operators provide a number of town-to-town services and intercity services across the State without a State subsidy.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann or any commercial operator is required to withdraw any of its commercial services, the authority will work to ensure communities are not left behind.  Bus services are also provided under the rural transport programme.  These services are contracted by the NTA and managed by 17 Local Link offices throughout the State.  The services are primarily demand-responsive, which includes approximately 80% of all services.  However, regular scheduled services between and in towns are also provided under the programme.</p> <p>  I will address the rural transport programme or, as it is now known, Local Link.  The objective of the programme is to provide a good quality, nationwide, community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  Typical services provided under the programme include demand-responsive transport services.  The services do not operate on a fixed route but respond to requests for services by intending passengers and operate by making specific trips to pick up and drop off passengers at the door.  They can be operated by large public service vehicles, hackneys or community cars.  Scheduled fixed transport services comprise services with a regular route, stopping places and timetable.  Key features of the public transport system include completing 1.9 million passenger journeys per annum, of which 900,000 are provided for free travel passengers.  The figures include 200,000 passengers who require assistance.  The system provides for an average of 150,000 service trips annually, travelling over 11.8 million kms annually.  Over 400 private operators provide the services, using the services of almost 900 drivers.  The programme also funds the provision of once-off trips for individuals and community and voluntary groups to help to address the lack of transport as a factor in social exclusion.  Some 62% of service trips are defined as either fully or partially accessible.</p> <p>  On passenger journeys and revenues, the number of passenger journeys grew from 1.7 million in 2015 to 1.89 million in 2017, a significant change, particularly between 2016 and 2017 when we saw growth of 5.6%.  In the past two years the authority has supported the expansion of rural transport services to include regular commuter bus services.  Operating at least five times a day on a five, six or seven day a week schedule, the services are specifically designed to ensure connectivity with other public transport services.  This connectivity facilitates passengers to make onward journeys, typically to access education, employment, health, recreational and other opportunities.  I have included in Appendix 2 a national listing of these regular services.</p> <p>  I will address the funding of the rural transport programme.  Prior to its restructuring, a myriad of funding streams supported the provision of rural transport services.  Post-restructuring, there are two main funding streams from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, with the free travel pass scheme.  As in other areas, funding for the programme reduced significantly during the economic downturn.  In recent years the funding allocation has continued to increase, thereby enabling further improvement and expansion of services.  In 2015 the funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was just over &euro;10 million which has grown to an allocation of &euro;14.3 million in 2018.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides an annual funding allocation of &euro;1.5 million under the free travel scheme towards the cost of the programme.  Other sources of income for the rural transport programme include fare income and the provision of transport services for other organisations such as the Health Service Executive which are funded separately by the relevant organisations.</p> <p>  The authority has recently produced its rural transport programme strategic plan for the period 2018 to 2022.  We have copies of the plan for committee members.  It sets out key objectives both for the delivery and development of the rural transport programme in the five year period to the end of 2022.  The key priorities of the programme continue to include addressing rural social exclusion and the integration of rural transport services with other public transport services.  Nine key priority areas have been identified.  They include sustaining the rural transport programme; route development and expansion; integration with other statutory services; the accessibility of services; access for all; ensuring the rural transport programme delivers an optimum customer experience; children and young people; encouraging innovation in rural transport service provision; and monitoring the progress of the rural transport programme.</p> <p>  The authority works continually with Bus &Eacute;ireann, as it provides services in rural areas, to provide for improvements on its contracted services and is looking at the expansion of these services now that the budget for public service obligation services has increased since 2016.  The authority also promoted improvements in the regional cities which have seen phenomenal growth in passenger numbers.  These improvements cannot be sustained unless significant improvement works are carried out by the city authorities in providing for bus priority measures, particularly now as car traffic congestion is growing rapidly.  Improved town services have been delivered in Athlone following the success of the Sligo bus services enhancements.  The work in enhancing the services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently been delayed significantly as it has had to prioritise the changes required as part of its business recovery plan.</p><p>The work in enhancing the services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann has been delayed significantly in recent times as the company has had to prioritise the changes required as part of its business recovery plan.  It is expected that Bus &Eacute;ireann will complete that work shortly and that we can recommence the service enhancement work.</p><p> The authority recognises that there are many gaps in our service provision and there is a need for new services.  We have focused on the lack of services in our main towns and we are prioritising the provision of new town services in Kilkenny, Carlow and Mullingar.  These centres all have populations between 19,000 and 26,000 and all have minimal levels of service.</p><p> In exercising its functions the authority seeks to co-ordinate services to achieve the provision of an integrated public transport system of services and networks for all users.  Wherever appropriate, we seek to integrate and co-ordinate services to provide for seamless travel options where change of bus or mode is required.  This is relevant for the operation of the Local Link services, which can facilitate connection to mainline inter-urban services irrespective of the provider of those services.  In fact, the NTA is the only body that can bring modes and operators together in an integrated service pattern to provide the best service for rural communities.</p><p> A number of key infrastructural items support public transport and are required to increase the attractiveness of public transport, especially in rural Ireland.  These include bus shelters, accessible bus stops and information at stops.  The provision of additional shelters has been greatly constrained in recent year by lack of funding.  The contract for the provision and maintenance of bus shelters rests with the NTA rather than each operator.  Therefore, we are now well placed to deliver a comprehensive shelter programme.</p><p> Information provision has improved.  New bus stop poles and information have been rolled out on a pilot basis in Cork city.  Real-time information, while not available on signs at every bus stop, is available on the Transport for Ireland website and app, as well as through an SMS text messaging service.  However, our ambition to deliver in these areas has been constrained due to lack of funding.  It is expected that funding will improve from 2019.  However, the authority needs to be in a position to put in place the resources that can deliver on our ambitious programme of improvements.  That concludes my presentation.  I trust that we can answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018032800002#C00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and for their attendance.</p> <p>  I have come across many private bus operators who are operating services on a commercial basis with no subvention from the State.  They are successful in doing that but one issue they have raised with me from time to time relates to putting in place new services or enhancing the existing services by creating more bus stops.  This involves applying for licences and the process has become highly protracted.  In the past, they would get the approval of the Garda and then the licence would be approved by the Department.  Now, the local authorities are involved and there is what we call a sign-off, which is a process that brings responsibility, caution and delay in getting these bus stops in place.  It is prevalent in rural areas.  Those involved are willing to provide a service at no cost to the State.  Will the NTA look at this and realign the application process to make it simpler?  It would allow us to get the bus stops in place.</p> <p>  I accept that bus stops, especially in rural areas, are set up in places where the necessary space may not be available.  The bus may have to pull up on the road and take off again.  That is the simple fact of it and we are not going to change it.  I believe we should take that into account and allow the operators to operate that way.  The associated paperwork should be streamlined.  If the Garda approves a licence, then the NTA should take on the responsibility of approving it rather than bringing in the local authorities and having engineers involved.  The engineers are reluctant to sign off on something because they believe they are taking on responsibility.</p> <p>  I have held discussions locally with the Local Link companies.  Several issues arise.  While services have improved, I understand that there may be a re-tendering of the Local Link service.  It is probably unnecessary at this time to be looking to re-tender as it only creates more uncertainty.  It also creates a sense that people do not know whether they will be providing the service by the end of this year.  I am keen to hear the comments of Ms Graham on that point.</p> <p>  Another simple issue has been raised with me.  I was looking for maps of bus routes for Local Link.  The operators do not have maps or the capacity to create the maps because those operating the services are one&ndash;man or one-woman bands.  Three companies, comprising three people, operate in Galway.</p> <p>  Another point is that the NTA has data relating to the total integrated system of transport provision.  These operators do not have access to the data.  In some cases, it could take three months for them to do the work to ensure the service is integrated across the board.  However, if they had the data at their fingertips, they could get access to the information at the disposal of the NTA.  There is no real cost involved in such sharing of information.</p> <p>  The other issue they raised with me is the idea of related services.  While we have the Local Link and we operate an integrated service, we also have local on-call services.  The fear is that we might forget about these or that they might get lost when we are developing other rural links.  We need to ensure the continuance of the bus going out to Headford and environs to collect 12 or 14 people on Friday.  The bus brings them in to collect their pension, go to the pharmacy or the doctor, have a cup of tea in the local resource centre and get back home in the afternoon.  It allows them to get a bus to Galway if they want.  It is important that this service remains in place and is supported.  The resources of Local Link companies need to be enhanced.  They need to be given a little more help with administration staff to ensure that they are in a position to deliver as they expand services.  The associated money should be ring-fenced for three or five years in order that they know with certainty how they can plan for the coming three to five years.</p> <p>  My last question relates to the lack of railway services in rural areas, especially along the western rail corridor.  Phase 1 has been completed from Ennis to Athenry.  It has been proven in recent years that the numbers are increasing.  Under the national development plan it is intended to look at extending the service from Athenry to Claremorris in order to have a link between Galway and Mayo by rail.  What is the attitude of the NTA?  Is the authority supportive of it?  Does the authority perceive that as being something for rural Ireland that will make a difference in creating the Atlantic economic corridor?  I understand that the NTA may have made submissions suggesting that we put a greenway on this line.  What is the NTA's attitude in this regard?</p> <p>  I believe that if we are to progress development in rural Ireland, we definitely need to extend the western rail corridor for the future of development and to create connectivity for freight, tourism and commuter services.  As the NTA representatives may know, Galway city is chock-a-block and people cannot get into it.  The main clear artery from north Galway comes through the railway service into Eyre Square.  We could create a commuter service from Claremorris, Westport and Ballina all the way into Galway and have return services to these places.  Such a development would enhance tourism and all the various possible economic derivatives.  What is the attitude of the NTA representatives on that point?</p></speech>

Ms Graham said the remit of the authority is to regulate &ndash; we understand that &ndash; and develop.  What precise role does the authority have in development outside the greater Dublin area?</p><p>Has the NTA sought to amend the legislation to give it the same powers and responsibilities outside the greater Dublin area, GDA, as it has within it to make it a truly national transport authority?</p><p> It was explained that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann provides rail services under a contract with the National Transport Authority and that any changes to rail services require the approval of the authority.  Who initiates proposed changes in rail services?  Who is the person who says we recognise that we have a totally inadequate commuter rail service into Galway, for example, or into Cork or Limerick, and we need a much more comprehensive, integrated rail service that serves the real needs of people who want to travel to work by train?  Is it the NTA or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that initiates the process?  Is the NTA the disposer or the proposer of rail policy in terms of the services?  We need to get a handle on this issue.  It is similar with bus services.  For example, in many parts of the country where urban areas service rural areas, starting in the third level cities, as I call them, and towns and going out to the rural areas, there are no buses after 6 p.m.  Ultimately, whose responsibility is it to propose that we move into the 21st century and change all of that?  Is it the responsibility of the bus companies or the NTA?  In other words, does the NTA just dispose of proposals or does it make them and say this is the service that a national transport body should provide and this is what we want?</p><p> My next question relates to fares.  It is a bugbear of mine.  I think I raised it with the NTA previously.  Fares per kilometre are strangely way more expensive in the non-urban areas.  In Galway, for example, the designated urban area goes out to Barna, or in the Dublin area it has been extended to Sallins, but beyond that one is in the sticks and one's fare doubles for going one mile.  Whose responsibility is it to drive change in that regard?  I refer to equity, fairness and equality, all the terms that are the buzzwords of modern society.  Who drives change - the NTA or the bus companies?  As with the fare issue, is the NTA the proposer or the disposer?</p><p> My understanding is that a submission was made by the NTA to the greenways policy, proposing to use the railway line from Athenry northwards as a greenway, even though the programme for Government says that the Government will investigate reopening that railway line.  Will the witnesses explain the NTA's role in that and in making proposals for the western rail corridor?  Does the NTA have a view on the need to develop commuter rail into the major cities from the surrounding areas of Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Cork?  We do not have commuter rail in any of those cities other than Cork.  How does it sit to propose the demise of a railway corridor?</p><p> In 1959 the Harcourt Street railway line was closed in Dublin.  It is now the green Luas line which goes out to Sandyford.  The line used to go out to Bray.  It was all sold up fairly fast.  By 1989, 30 years later, everybody realised that was a fundamental mistake and that what seemed impossible in 1959 - that there would be massive populations around Dundrum &ndash; actually happened.  It is proposed that there will be 1 million extra in population and they will not live where the national plan wants them to live.  They will live where they want to live.  The western rail corridor and maintaining its availability for a railway line is key to the future.  The Chairman has a particular interest in the southern end of that railway line and getting decent services on it.  I commend you on that because it has enormous potential that we are not exploiting.  Limerick has endless railway lines around it that could be used for commuter transport for up to 30 miles around the city.  We need to get a clear NTA position on the railway lines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018032800002#D00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and for attending the committee today.  This is a very important engagement.  As our remit is rural and community affairs, and as representatives of rural areas, it is obligatory on all of us to emphasise the significance and importance of transport to living in rural areas.  I wish to re-emphasise that at the very outset.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the important role and function of the NTA in directing policy nationally in terms of planning and integration of public transport and transport provision.  While we recognise that infrastructure is so critical for urban transport, it is also critical for rural dwellers as well in terms of how they integrate and interact with society.  I note the NTA's role in providing direction and reporting to the regional assemblies which will have a critical role in devising strategies for long-term planning under the new planning framework.  My question to the NTA is whether it rural-proofs the planning reporting to such bodies as the regional assemblies.  Do they look at the demographics to see how rural communities, towns and villages are integrated with the larger towns that I would see as the service centres for those regional areas?  The assemblies have a critical role in this area.  The regional assemblies have the responsibility for devising planning strategy for their regions for the next ten to 20 years, but the NTA has a critical role to play in providing information that serves the entire community, both urban and rural.  I would be interested to hear the perspectives from the representatives in that regard.</p> <p>  The co-ordination of existing services is critical.  The NTA has a crucial role in terms of filling any voids or deficits that are not serviced by private operators in the transport area.  We have successful transport initiatives in various areas.  In my area in Waterford a subsidised service operates in Portlaw, for example, a town 12 miles from Waterford city.  Suirway services runs a very sustainable bus service, supported by the State through the NTA, to keep that service alive.  Local Link provides feeder services throughout rural County Waterford with much success.  That needs to be acknowledged.  However, I feel there is more potential to link rural towns and villages to other feeder services.  I would like to hear if the NTA has future plans on how it hopes to influence future planning and how it engages with the various transport providers to provide a better integrated and co-ordinated service.</p> <p>  In terms of co-ordination, I have been made aware by students, for example, who travel by train or bus, that there is often a lack of continuity of service when people are using public transport in Ireland.  For example, if they are travelling between cities, a train might arrive at one station at a particular time and the train to the next city might have left ten or 15 minutes prior to the arrival of that train.  I can provide such examples to the witnesses from the NTA.  I am just giving a broad sample of some concerns I have heard expressed.  I would like to hear how the NTA can influence all of our public transport providers, both private and public, to try to co-ordinate services so that we have consistency and continuity in services.</p> <p>  One mode of transport that we should recognise more is the two-wheeled variety, namely, cycling.  It is such a beautiful country but we do not have enough infrastructure to encourage people to use bicycles more.  That is especially important given the climate change challenges we face.  I would like to hear the NTA's vision for cycling in this country to assist people who want to cycle more in both rural and urban areas.  The NTA has an important function in that regard.</p> <p>  My final point also relates to climate change challenges.  We heard the Government announcement recently on the prohibition of new diesel engines after 2040.  Does that apply to public transport fleets in the country?</p><p>If so, what is the NTA doing now to ensure we have a sustainable transport fleet in both the public and private sectors in respect of its operation, its impact on climate change and how energy is used in this country?  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, the policy changed from being a Garda approval to a local authority approval.  As it is set out, the only legislative body that can approve the location of bus stops under the Roads Act is a local authority.  We do not have a role in approving the location of bus stops.  We have provided guidance to local authorities about how and where they should locate bus stops, particularly those associated with rural services.  We engage with local authorities to try to encourage them to ensure they approve bus stops in a timely manner but we acknowledge more work needs to be done in that area because some operators get through our part of the licensing system quite quickly and then get held up on bus stop approvals.  We are aware of that.  Unfortunately, we do not have the powers to approve bus stops.  It is the local authority that approves them.  Ms Malone might cover Local Link re-tendering.</p></speech>

The first issue was the re-tendering of the programme.  The current four-year programme has been in existence since 2014 and expires at the end of December 2018 and consequently, we will be looking at the next stage from 2019 to 2022.  In 2013-14, there was a closed call for applications.  It was not an open procurement process for a variety of reasons.  A number of groups tendered for the call and 17 transport co-ordination units, TCUs are now in existence with the brand name of Local Link.  We have been getting legal and procurement advice this time around and it looks as if we must go through a formal tendering process this time around to comply with both EU and Irish procurement legislation.  I accept there is a degree of anxiety and nervousness about what the process might be, who will come through the process and how it will reflect and take on board the amount of good work undertaken by the existing Local Link groups for the past number of years.  As we are still working on what that process will look like, we have not yet gone out to the groups to formally advise them what the procurement process will be.  We aim to be in a position to do that probably by the end of April.  We will then make sure there are any number of meetings, sessions and briefings to address concerns and will have a number of question-and-answer sessions around the country in order that everybody is very clear about what the procurement process will be.  In terms of complying with the legislation, we are looking at a request for tender process - an open procurement process.</p> <p>  Regarding the question on maps and whether access to mapping is not of as high a standard as it should be, I accept that.  We have had issues with our system for the rural transport programme, which is called the integrated transport management system, ITMS.  It has had some issues over the past number of years but I am happy to say it is in a much better place now than it has been.  Much investment, time and resources has gone into trying to resolve some of the outstanding issues.  As of this morning, before I left the office, I checked and the mapping functionality is up and running again.  There has been a delay there that has hindered the ability of some groups to design their routes and services.  In a more long-term way, we intend to integrate the ITMS more formally with the authority's other systems in order that ultimately, the Local Link groups will be able to access the same mapping information and the same layering of information the authority uses to inform all of its other planning processes.  Consequently, we are working in that direction.  </p> <p>  As for addressing social exclusion and making sure the programme does not lose sight of where it started from, the rural transport programme was initiated back in the 2000s.  It formed out of a need to address rural social exclusion and that has been a basic tenet of the programme all the way through.  We are moving into an era where we are taking on board more regular high-frequency commuter-type services and running them through the rural transport programme but there is no avoiding or walking away from the needs and responsibilities that arise from a rural social exclusion point of view.  Members will see that a large number of actions throughout the strategy we will circulate shortly are designed around addressing rural social exclusion in particular.  </p></speech>

He asked about the budget and a three or five-year budget that gives some kind of certainty.  We would also like that certainty because as we only get our operational budget on a yearly basis, it is difficult for us to plan, which also makes it difficult for the Local Link offices to plan ahead.</p> <p>  In terms of the western rail corridor, our role with regard to rail infrastructure is very specific.  We have a contract related to the provision of services and the only place where we influence the provision of infrastructure is in the greater Dublin area where we fund the capital investment in infrastructure.  The overall policy relating to the provision of rail infrastructure outside the greater Dublin area is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It manages the infrastructure through a contract with Irish Rail for the improvements on and maintenance of the infrastructure.  As an authority, we have views from a transport planning point of view about rail infrastructure because it is costly infrastructure to provide and maintain.  We obviously feel it is important for high-quality commuter services into cities.  This does not just include Dublin but the regional cities as well.  It is important for moving people on an inter-urban basis.  We need high volumes to be able to cover the cost of providing the infrastructure to make a business case stand up for providing the infrastructure but also for keeping it maintained and the value for money associated with that.  </p> <p>  We respect what was set out in the national development plan regarding the western rail corridor.  In terms of the submission we made, there is a bit of a misunderstanding when we refer to abandoned railway lines and their potential for use as greenways.  This did not refer to the western rail corridor.  That was not what we intended and we will clarify that with the particular regional assembly.  We were talking about railways other than the western rail corridor, of which there are a number around the State.  It is for those to be used as greenways.  We were not referring to the western rail corridor.  If there is a business case to support the development of rail because it is important from a public transport point of view, we will support it if it stands up economically.  </p> <p>  As for Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions about who develops bus and rail services, it is a combination.  In some cases, we develop the plans because we have our own transport planners and service planners.  We put forward proposals whether they are for the bus company or the rail company to see whether it can provide those services with the resources it has or what the cost associated with providing those would be.  In some cases, we instigate the changes but in other cases, the operators instigate the changes.  When we were set up initially, we did not have the resources to be doing the transport planning.  We are developing that service planning role far more as we have been in a position to increase our resources in that area.  Ultimately, we must approve whatever changes are mooted.  Where we instigate such changes, we obviously wish to approve them but we must check whether the operator is in a position to deliver them.  We also are open to the operator having its own ideas and innovating in services.  We would approve those services if the funding is there and if we feel it is the right service to provide.  We have been pushing for services like evening services, off-peak services and services that probably do not provide the same return in terms of fares but which we still think there is an obligation to provide.</p><p>It is the policy of the NTA to develop and improve services at off-peak times, evenings and weekends.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has made a particular request and has met us to discuss a certain service.  We are waiting for our operator to furnish us with the timetable and an outline of the cost.  The formal approval process will then begin.  We are very open to any suggestions for improvement, particularly where off-peak and weekend services are concerned.  </p><p> In regard to fares, the NTA tends to be the proposer of fare structure.  Trying to rectify and simplify the fare structure that we inherited six or seven years ago has been a difficult process.  We have focused on simplifying the number of rail fares and fare stages, particularly in the short-hop zones in city areas.  It took about five years to get some form of distance-based fare system in the commuter zone, but a lot more work needs to be done on that.  We will be doing a similar exercise on the intercity fare.  Similarly, Bus &Eacute;ireann has a hugely complicated fare structure and we are working with it to simplify those fares.  We are simplifying the relationship between an standard adult single ticket and the deductions for child or student fare in order that it is much simpler for people to understand what fares are being offered.</p><p> The argument the Deputy has made to us is there should be the same fare structure in the cities as there is in the rural areas.  We do not agree with that.  In order to function, a city requires a lot more people to use public transport than does a rural area in respect of congestion.  We therefore must encourage as many people as possible to use public transport in the cities.  Moreover, there is a greater cost associated with providing transport in rural areas than in city areas.  As such, a simplified fare structure and lower city fares allow us to provide more services to meet the congestion in those areas.  We feel there should be a different fare structure in the cities than applies in rural areas.  However, we subvent our fares in rural areas to a higher level per passenger journey than we do-----</p></speech>

It would be much better to start on the basis that there are a half a million people in Connacht and a million people in Dublin.  Is the subsidy for public transport in Connacht half of that in Dublin?  It is not.  It is about a tenth.  Of course the NTA is always going to win by measuring per passenger journey, because the people who do not have the service cannot use it and therefore are never subsidised.  It is a crazy measure.</p></speech>

We have increased the subsidy to services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann very significantly, by 50%.  The subsidy for the service provided by Dublin Bus has been reduced.  Investment in rural services has increased compared with investment in Dublin-----</p></speech>

When rural transport and Bus &Eacute;ireann are included, the figure is about &euro;53 million for 3 million people.

We do not agree with that way of analysing how public transport is delivered.  We believe it should be considered on the basis of passenger journeys.  We examine the gaps where services are needed and consider the costs of providing them, rather than what each member of population is getting.  We try to improve services where there are gaps.  The NTA or the operators identify the gaps and we fill them, where we have the funding to do so.</p></speech>

I have been outlining how we go about doing that.  We have all said that there are gaps in services.  We are trying to address those gaps and provide as much service as we can with the funding that we have.  We have had quite a bit of success in filling those gaps in recent years.  I am not saying that it is a perfect service by any means.  We have a long way to go to address the type of issues Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has previously raised with us, including evening and weekend services.  That is a work in progress.</p> <p>  I will move on to Senator Coffey's questions.  The NTA does engage in demographic projection and the rural-proofing of our proposals to the regional assemblies.  We are careful to ensure that what we put forward has due regard for demographics but also meets the needs of rural towns and villages and improves public transport in those areas.  Outside of the greater Dublin area, GDA, our role in support of assemblies arises from our statutory duty to assist and co-operate in the preparation of the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs.  We are required to prepare a report setting out the issues which, in our opinion, should be considered by the regional assemblies in making a regional spatial and economic strategy.  The eastern regional assembly is slightly different because we have special functions concerning the GDA, but for the others we set out what we believe are the transport issues that the regional assembly should address.</p> <p>  In regard to the co-ordination of existing services, we recognise that there is potential to link rural towns and services more.  We engage with transport operators continually.  If they identify gaps, we work with the operators to see if they can fill them.  If the operator is a licensed service, we see if they are willing to meet the needs without a subsidy.  Alternatively, we sometimes have to subsidise a service in order to make those links.  Our Local Link services have really been fantastic at making those links, particularly in rural areas, and we want to develop that a lot further.  If there are specific instances of a lack of transport links, I ask members to bring them to our attention because we rely on people highlighting these needs.  We will then see if there is anything we can do in that area.  </p> <p>  We recognise that we do not have enough cycling infrastructure.  Our function in this regard is focused on the cities, because that is our arrangement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>  The national development plan now requires that no 100% diesel-fuelled fleet is purchased for public transport after July 2019, so we have to move.  We were already considering moving to a low-emission fleet.  Starting this year, we hope to begin the procurement of a low-emission diesel fleet for our bus services.  </p></speech>

This is partly aimed at promoting social inclusion, but it is also intended to connect with existing services in the area, including commuter services.  It is intended that people will be able to stay out or travel into a town in the evening and get home at a certain time.</p><p>That connectivity issue is very much on our radar.</p></speech>

She said that she hopes to be able to bring forward something which the rural link companies can use.  Is there a timeframe for that?  That would make life an awful lot easier for them and it would make them more efficient in their work.  It would also give them a greater picture of what they can do to link into every other service.  It is a small thing but I would appreciate if it could be done sooner rather than later.

Ms Graham has outlined the sense that there are still gaps.  Obviously the NTA is working to improve them.  With that, I want to start off on a positive note and say that the NTA has listened to concerns about the extension of the 440 bus route, the Westport to Athlone route, which is obviously very important for County Roscommon.  It serves many towns and villages and it provides for return services daily.  We need the Local Link services to interface with that as much as possible.</p> <p>  My question is on the tendering process.  I recently met the manager of our Local Link service and I believe there is anxiety around the retendering process.  The sense I got from the discussion is that there will be a wait before further Local Link services are introduced.  Am I correct in that?  Are we waiting for the tendering process to take place before further services are introduced or can new services be introduced at the present time?</p></speech>

I would also like to emphasise the important work which Local Link services do.  For example, there is a service in Tulsk which supports a day centre and a rural school.  It also integrates locals with towns.  We obviously need to see more of that, but it is a very good example of trying to be efficient and trying to link as many people as possible to the places to which they need to go.  That was my one concern around that tendering process.  I had a sense that people were waiting to see how the tendering process progresses before further routes were introduced.  I really just wanted clarification on that.</p></speech>

I was interested to hear about bus shelters.  There are many small towns in rural parts of Ireland in which there is not even a sign for the bus stop, never mind a bus shelter.  When will that be addressed?  How much of a roll-out of bus shelters will there be?  I welcome the extra carriages which I believe are being put on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's Sligo route.  That is welcome.  We have overcrowding on the Westport route.  It does not seem to be being addressed at certain times.  There has there been talk over recent months that the Dublin to Belfast route will be going down the road towards going electric.  Why is there no talk at all about electrifying the route out as far as Maynooth and then reverting to diesel out to the west?  It does not seem that investment will be put into that.</p> <p>  On rural transport, there are some very good examples, for example, in Ballinamore.  There is a great woman, Camilla Kelly, who works on the Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon areas.  Some great projects have been rolled out which suit both people who are working and people who want to go shopping.  Why is there such a discrepancy in different parts of the country?  There can be a good system which brings people to work on a return train journey in some counties, but in other counties the system only works for the bingo run.  I mean no disrespect by that.  It needs to be done, but the system only works for the bingo run and the shopping on Friday.  Other than that there is nothing.  The system does not cater for workers or anything.  Why is that the situation in some counties?  To be honest about it, there are many places where one would not see a bus within a five or six mile radius from one end of the year to the other.  What can be done to address that?</p> <p>  On rail, I listened with interest to what was said when the western rail corridor was brought up.  Ms Graham has seen the rail review.  The document states that three different routes are for the chop.  We need to nail this down.  I am in full support of rail, but there is no good in having formulas of words and in bringing out documents which say that we will have a review and this, that and the other.  At the end of the day, the time has come for straight answers on the western rail corridor and on the line in Tipperary.  We need a straight answer as to whether investment will be given or not.  Wording in documents is not what we want.  We want either to get pounds, shillings and pence to deliver something or to move on.  Where is Ms Graham on this?  Does she agree with what I am saying?  Is she saying that this committee needs to bring in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to nail this down once and for all?  This sort of nod and wink approach has been going on almost since I was a young fella, and that is a while ago.  Either rail projects are being done or they are not.  We need to nail it down one way or the other.</p> <p>  Ms Graham touched on Dublin Bus.  The information I have is that, while rural people are being told that they will not be able to buy a diesel car in the next ten, 15 or 20 years even if they are travelling long distances, Dublin Bus is currently buying diesel buses and was buying diesel buses last year.  If I was trying to show the way in something, I would be damn sure that public transport should be the first to lead the way.  Why is this continuing?  Perhaps it is down to money.  That is fully understandable.  To put it simply, there would be nine buses where there were ten if we were to change over to the gas system.  Is this the reason?  Is it down to money?  Who is going to make the decisions on the way forward in respect of buses?  I note that Ms Graham said 2019 or 2020.  If we are bringing out documents about climate change and all this craic, which I see plenty of within the D&aacute;il, why is the State not leading the way rather than putting the onus onto the person who may have no bus, who may have to travel a distance to work in a rural part of Ireland, and who may not have the money to be changing over all this stuff?  Why is the State not showing the way first?  At least we could then point to what we have done.  That is not happening.  Will Ms Graham give me her opinion on that?</p> <p>  On the Luas or tram-type systems, I know that Dublin Airport is being touted.  State land could be had for something like &euro;200 million, rather than &euro;4 billion, which would allow the DART to shoot out to Malahide and then across, bringing in the Swords area and out towards the airport.  Why was that not looked at?  It would be simpler and quicker.  In Galway there does not seem to be a system.</p><p>I am sure the NTA is aware of the transport problems in Parkmore.  We do not seem to have a bus or a park-and-ride system set up that would help alleviate the problem.  Galway is losing jobs because of the transport situation.  When do the witnesses envisage a Luas-type system in that city, or are we living in fairyland world whereby we will say it will happen in 2030 or 2040 and we will not be here when it will happen?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions, Deputy Collins indicated to me earlier and we also have Deputy Healy Rae.  I will take everyone but we need to be short.  Perhaps the witnesses will answer our questions in writing if possible.</p> <p>  I want to come back to the rural transport programme and the one I know best is in County Clare.  Clarebus has 170 services a week and had 54,500 passenger trips last year alone.  It has 11 low-floored easily accessible buses, which are wonderful.  It operates out of Feakle in rural east Clare.  It is a wonderful organisation and I pay tribute to it.  Its fleet of 11 buses is under huge pressure from wear and tear over many years.  It bought those buses using funding.  Local Link is a national movement and it is funded throughout the country.  The organisations involved need backup to keep improving their fleets.  I ask the NTA to look at this.</p> <p>  With regard to routes, a timely turnaround is needed when a new route is proposed.  A route was proposed by Clarebus from Kilkee to Kilrush and back to Ennis.  It has been lodged for months and nothing has been heard back.  It is needed.  Will the NTA look at this?  Coincidently, another route has been proposed in north Clare, from Ballyvaughan to Lisdoonvarna to Ennistymon, Corofin, Ruan and back to Ennis.  Again it is a wonderful route, but I ask for timely turnaround on these issues.</p> <p>  I ask Deputy Collins to be mindful of the time-----</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  I have a few issues to raise and I will start with Local Link Cork because time is of the essence.  I am involved in Local Link Cork and I have seen the incredible delivery it has given to the people throughout west Cork.  In fairness, the NTA deserves praise for giving sufficient funding to Local Link Cork, but I have to say the manager, David O'Brien, and the chairman of the company, Nealie O'Leary, have delivered meticulously.  I can be very critical at times on certain things that happen in rural Ireland, but I cannot say anything about this because I never hear anybody complain.  Cork is a huge sprawling county with people from Bere Island into Kilcrohane, Ballydehob, Lisheen and Skibbereen.  A new service from Clonakilty to Kinsale was funded recently by the NTA.  It has increased many services into Timoleague, Kilbrittain, Barryroe and Courtmacsherry.  On the other side we have Bantry, Drimoleague and Dunmanway.  The service is second to none.  I concur with the Chairman, in that we have our own fleet of buses and they are ageing to a point, and this may be an area where stronger funds need to be directed going down the road, but the delivery on the ground is second to none.</p> <p>  There is one issue that-----</p></speech>

I would appreciate the NTA looking into this because in rural Ireland young people totally depend on a bus service, particularly with car insurance being so expensive.  It is nearly an impossibility for people to get on the road.  They are totally dependent on bus and rail.  Recently, I raised in the D&aacute;il the issue of a lack of rail.  We had rail going to Schull and Mizen Head and throughout west Cork in the 1850s.  I am looking to see whether we can have rail coming as far as Bandon, which would open up west Cork.  We also need to deliver a transport service for people with disabilities over 18 years of age.  They are entitled to a free service when they are aged 17 years and 364 days, but once they reach their 18th birthday they are given an automatic ticket on a bus.  Most of these people cannot go on a bus on their own.  No service is available for elderly people who are unable to travel throughout west Cork for four hours a day.  This is an area for which I would like funding to be provided to Local Link Cork.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with the committee the 2018 priorities for my Department.  I will also mention the significant programme of capital investment outlined for my Department under Project Ireland 2040 and acknowledge the hugely positive impact this will have in terms of strengthening and expanding the valuable work of my Department in supporting and promoting our national culture, heritage and language.</p> <p>  The responsibilities of my Department are broad and diverse and include the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture, the promotion of the Irish language and support of the Gaeltacht and island communities.  I propose to address the issues arising across my Department's Vote on a programme by programme basis.  In the first instance, I will provide a broad outline of the overall position.</p> <p>  A gross provision of slightly less than &euro;303 million is available to my Department in 2018.  An additional &euro;700,000 in funding has been carried over from the 2017 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures.  In broad terms, the 2018 breakdown of allocations to my Vote is as follows: &euro;167.3 million for arts, culture and film, including &euro;68.2 million for the Arts Council; &euro;45.3 million for the national cultural institutions; &euro;18 million for the Irish Film Board; &euro;10.4 million for cultural infrastructure and development and a dedicated funding stream of &euro;6 million for Creative Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s legacy project for Ireland 2016; more than &euro;47.1 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage, including almost &euro;12 million for natural heritage; slightly less than &euro;6.4 million for the Heritage Council and slightly more than &euro;5 million for built heritage, including the successful built heritage investment scheme; &euro;48.6 million for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands; and slightly less than &euro;40 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, namely, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.</p> <p>  The gross allocation for my Department in 2018 is more than 5% higher than the comparable figure for 2017 as per the further Revised Estimates for 2017 which took account of the transfer of the regional and rural functions and associated allocations to the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p> <p>  The 2018 provision allows for increases in funding across a range of bodies under my Department's remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of arts, heritage and Gaeltacht schemes.  This additional funding is targeted at key initiatives, including an additional &euro;3 million for the Arts Council, a 5% increase in its annual budget; an additional &euro;1.5 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 9% increase in its annual allocation; boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions; dedicated funding of &euro;6 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme; additional funding for a further round of the very successful arts and culture capital scheme in 2018; an additional &euro;1.5 million for heritage, including measures to support biodiversity; an extra &euro;2.5 million for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the islands; and an extra &euro;1 million for Waterways Ireland.</p> <p>  The significance of Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework and associated national development plan launched by the Taoiseach in Sligo cannot be overstated in the case of my Department.  For the first time ever, the value and importance of our culture, language and heritage are fully recognised and given equal standing with economic targets and essential infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals.  The national development plan has allocated an unprecedented &euro;1 billion for capital investment in our culture and heritage over the next ten years.  This is in addition to an investment of &euro;178 million in the Irish language and in supporting and sustaining our unique Gaeltacht and island communities.  The scale of this investment will be transformative, allowing us to renew and redevelop our national cultural Institutions, enhance the cultural offering in theatres and other cultural facilities throughout the country, digitise the national collections and support Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture.</p> <p>  Our creativity and culture investment programme will deliver on the objectives of Creative Ireland, both in terms of enhancing our cultural infrastructure and making significant investments in expanding our creative industries.  A particular focus for this investment will be in the audiovisual sector.</p> <p>  Our national heritage was specifically identified in Project Ireland 2040 as essential for enhancing the liveability of our communities and creating opportunities for tourism.  Under the plan, my Department will invest in our built heritage to ensure that the historical cores of our cities, towns and villages are protected and regenerated.  I also intend to significantly ramp up investment in our inland waterways, including in the restoration of the Ulster Canal.</p> <p>  The value of our natural heritage should not be underestimated either.  Over the next ten years, my Department will develop and implement a major new investment programme for our national parks and nature reserves.  These invaluable natural assets teach us the value of our natural heritage, as well as being hubs for outdoor activities and tourism.  In 2017 alone, 4 million visitors visited our six national parks at Wicklow, Killarney, the Burren, Connemara, Ballycroy and Glenveagh.</p> <p>  We also need to protect our natural environment.  The plan will provide for the implementation of the national biodiversity plan, protecting our unique landscapes, peatlands and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I shall both make brief remarks on individual programme areas.  We are happy to later expand on any matter that members wish to raise.</p><p> I shall commence with some details, with the permission of the Chair, on the culture programme.  A sum of &euro;167 million will be provided for arts, culture and film in 2018.  As members will know, the Creative Ireland programme is the Government's legacy project for Ireland.  Creative Ireland aims to harness the goodwill, engagement and momentum created by the Ireland 2016 programme and places creativity at the centre of public policy.  2017 was year 1 of a five-year initiative, which has already yielded positive results in both rural and urban communities with more people engaging with creativity than ever before.  The increased funding allocation for 2018 will build on the momentum by further developing the programme as well as providing increased funding to key institutions, agencies and initiatives that deliver arts, creativity and culture across the country.</p><p> The 2018 allocation for my Department's Vote includes boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions.  The combined total allocation for 2017 was in excess of &euro;45 million.  The Arts Council will receive an additional &euro;3 million this year to enhance its support to artists and arts organisations of all sizes throughout the country.  The Irish Film Board will receive an additional &euro;1.5 million to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television, drama, documentary and animation.  The work of the board is key to the successful roll out of Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme, which focuses on fostering Ireland's potential as a centre of excellence in media production.</p><p> Increasing access to arts, culture and creativity is the driving force of the Creative Ireland programme.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated to accelerate the Creative Children initiative under Pillar 1 of the programme.  The funding will be matched by a further &euro;1 million from the Department of Education and Skills.  The programme will be delivered in partnership with the Arts Council.  Similarly, the Department's funding to local authorities in 2018, to support and build on the work of the local Creative Ireland culture teams, has been doubled with a view to harnessing the energy of Pillar 2, entitled Enabling Creativity in Every Community, which saw 750 events take place across Ireland in 2017.</p><p> Culture Ireland will receive an extra &euro;500,000 this year thus enabling an enhanced culture programme to be presented across Great Britain in 2018.  The initiative will build on the unique cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences.  It will also build on Pillar 5 of the Creative Ireland programme, which hinges on extending our cultural footprint globally and highlighting our culture as a unique national strength.</p><p> The Creative Ireland programme is the implementation vehicle for a wider, all-of-Government policy on culture in Ireland.  It also links to the heritage, Gaeltacht and Irish language sectors, which all enjoy increased funding for 2018.</p><p> Funding of over &euro;47 million has been made available for my Department's heritage programme for this year.  </p></speech>

Culture Ireland also created the culture elements of the President's overseas visits to Cuba in spring 2017 and Australia and New Zealand in November 2017 at an estimated cost of &euro;50,000 for travelling artists and performers.  During 2017, Culture Ireland reached approximately 3.5 million live audience members.  There were 7 million online viewers.  There were some 450 events in more than 50 countries with Irish artists.  A total of 169 presenters and programmers were supported to visit Ireland and experience Irish arts, performing at home and generating further touring contracts for Irish artists.  It is a very important part of the Department.  As I said in my opening statement, there is a further &euro;500,000 being given to Culture Ireland this year too.  A particular highlight of our work programme is GB18.

Do we know what percentage of that was spent on, for example, High Court cases, payments to staff who alleged bullying etc., and costs such as consultants or reports that focused in on those spaces?</p></speech>

That is important.  We are doing everything we can to make sure that these sorts of issues do not arise in the future.  There was a review of the Department documentation in 2017 and we have continued to support the board.  We have had three human resources, HR, positions there.  I sanctioned three HR people to help.  One started in February of this year on an 18 month contract.  That is a HR manager.</p></speech>

It is good that the Department would keep an eye on the amount of spend on that space.  I have a more parochial matter.  We visited Trinity College as a committee recently.  We also, as a committee, visited the repository of the National Museum of Ireland in Swords.  It is the old Motorola factory in Swords where the museum holds everything that is not on display.  A number of different cultural institutions have stated that they are under pressure for storage space for the future.  I bring it to the Minister's attention that there is an old NEC factory in Ballivor standing idle at the moment which could potentially house a repository of some of these organisations if it was needed.</p> <p>  Before I finish, the film industry is an important issue.  The film industry has been wonderful in recent years in that we have seen tremendous growth in indigenous and international film.  There are a number of difficulties within the industry that I brought to the attention of the Minister before and that we discussed in this committee.  The Irish Film Board stated that it would be interested in constituting a film forum which could look at the issues concerning the industry and that it hopes to fix it.  Is it the Minister's view that it should constitute a film forum on this?  We also discussed the issue of the craft sector of that industry and having somebody nominated to the film board, which would be very useful.  If the Minister could nominate somebody from the craft sector, it would mean that that element of the film industry would be represented within the Irish Film Board and therefore would be able to get involved.</p> <p>  The Gate Theatre report has been published, looking at some of the difficulties that happened there.  I request that the Minister looks at a similar report within the film industry, or at least a survey of experience among workers in the film industry on how they have experienced their working environments, and also of the production companies and managers too.  It is very important that their experience of the industry there is understood too.  Are there any actions to be taken from the Gate report?</p></speech>

If I forget anything, he might remind me.  With regard to the Gate Theatre, we had an initiative in Liberty Hall last week which the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, ran and my Department supported.  This was called Speak Up &amp;amp; Call It Out.  It was a collaborative event to help the sector deal with the bullying and harassment claims that have happened over recent years as a result of the investigations that happened in the Gate Theatre and it was very well received.  There are learnings, in answer to the Chairman's questions, that can be had from that throughout all industries as well as the film industry.  With regard to any appointments to the Irish Film Board, that is a matter for the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  If there is somebody from the craft sector who is interested, if the Chairman is talking about an appointment-----</p></speech>

I and my Department will do what we can to support that, because we want to highlight the cultural activity we have in this country, and having the European Capital of Culture in Galway would be a wonderful way to showcase everything good about our culture.  It is important that we provide some funding for it.  I have met the chairperson of the board.  It is a very competent and proactive board which has really hit the ground running in terms of getting everything up and running for 2020.  There is much work to do.  I believe it is very important that we integrate the grassroots, local artists and people into the project.  The board is reflective of that.

They are having trouble both costing and paying for it.  Some festivals that have run for 50 years or more are now dying away because the cost of insurance is so high.  We have wonderful events such as the Patrick O'Keeffe Traditional Music Festival in Castleisland in November, the World Fiddle Day in Scartaglin, the traditional 15 August fair in Kenmare and Sneem.  Everyone can speak for his or her own place, but right around County Kerry festivals and local communities are having massive difficulty in sourcing insurance.  If the Minister could help in some way to promote these festivals and to retain our culture, it would be greatly appreciated.  Many small villages and towns now have lost many of their shops.  Some may have a post office and some may not.  Festivals are often the only way the identity of these towns can be retained, whether it is Maurice O'Keeffe Festival in Kiskeam or the Con Curtin Festival in Brosna.  They are having a massive problem in keeping these things going, and we need to assist them to promote their events in the first place and to help with the insurance.  If we lose these local events, we most likely will lose our identity, and local identity is very important.  It is incumbent on me to stress the need to help these communities which do so much good voluntary work on their own.  They have run up against a block wall now in terms of the cost of insurance.  I am asking the Minister to help these communities to help themselves.</p></speech>

My Department only has a small amount of money available, approximately &euro;50,000, and so the local authorities are best placed to look after any funding for events.  We have increased our funding to local authorities to &euro;3 million this year, which works out at around &euro;96,000 per local authority, and this represents an increase of approximately &euro;1 million from 2017.  We also fund local arts infrastructure as well.  If the Deputy knows of anyone specific who wishes to apply to the local authority for the events he is describing in Kerry, they can do that via the local authority.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Arts Council also provide significant support to major festivals.  We might also be reopening the capital arts scheme later this year, and I can provide those details to the Deputy if he would like to inquire about that at a later stage.</p></speech>

I am involved in a festival committee myself, as most of us here are.  I call Ballydehob the festival capital of Ireland.  There seems to be a festival there most weekends.  They are struggling, like many other towns through west Cork, because the festivals cannot keep going back to struggling businesses to ask for funding.  Many are going out of business in very rural parts of Ireland, or else they are paying high rates and cannot afford it.  The voluntary groups who organise festivals end up paying large sums on accounts and for insurance.  If a festival wants to have any chance of getting funding, it has to tick all those boxes, and I know some groups are paying &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 in insurance alone, before any claims, to keep the boat on the shore.</p><p> I will raise something which Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned and the Minister tried to cover in her answer.  It is a little parochial but the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is co-funding with Cork County Council a hugely successful visual arts degree which the Dublin Institute of Technology delivers on Sherkin Island in west Cork.  Over the years, it has been a major boost, not only to Sherkin Island but also Baltimore, Union Hall, Glandore, Leap, Skibbereen and all the surrounding area where students and families can fill local establishments off-season.  The Department has kept its commitment, and while I am not being critical of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and it is super to deliver it on an island where there is little activity off-season, for some reason the local authority is dithering over its &euro;20,000 commitment.  The Department has funding of &euro;167.3 million for arts and culture and &euro;48.6 million for the islands, which we will discuss more with the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  Sherkin Island cannot afford to lose this course.  The Department has been the main pillar in this, and I am asking now that it be the main building because if the local authority continues dithering the way it is, the course will be dead in the ground.  The local authority was supposed to come before the joint committee some weeks ago, but unfortunately the meeting could not go ahead because of the snow.  I hope it will be rescheduled in the near future, but I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State to look to their Department to see if it can be the main funder.  I understand that they will be unable to give me an answer now, but it cannot go on like this.  They are looking for a commitment that was given by the local authority, which unfortunately was given verbally, although there are witnesses who can prove it.  The council is now reneging on this commitment, the future of the funding is looking dodgy, and it looks as though that island will lose that course.  I would appreciate if the Department could have a serious look at it to see how they might work together to resolve this, even if it means that the local authority is back on the field again.  It would be hugely important.</p></speech>

A few years ago, I met the people who are running the project, which is excellent.  It brings the arts out to where it should be, on a very important island.  It is disappointing and I am disappointed that the arrangement where we matched funds with the local authority is threatened.  We are still prepared to do that and we want to do that.  My colleague, Senator Tim Lombard, has contacted me about this recently and I know that Deputy Collins has raised it in the D&aacute;il several times.  The AGM of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann will be on Sherkin Island in a number of weeks.  If there is anything we can do during that event, or as a side event, or if we can organise officials from the local authority in Cork to be there, my officials will be happy to do that.  The Department's officials have had meetings in an effort to do something but there is a block somewhere.  I do not know where it is.  Deputy Collins may be more privy to that information at a local level, but if there is anything we can do, we will because it is an excellent project.  It would be a retrograde step if it were not to go ahead.</p></speech>

On the decade of centenaries, we are at the centenary of the anti-conscription campaign.  That was a campaign which saw the trade unions, political parties and the church come together to organise a strike successfully against the introduction of conscription into Ireland.  Are there any commemorations to mark this event?</p></speech>

The other issue relates to Moore Street.  I, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and some others visited the buildings in 14-17 Moore Street recently.  We looked at the material health of the buildings which are currently in State hands.  Water is gushing into 17 Moore Street.  On the day we were there, there was a torrential flow of water entering the building.  It is something that will obviously affect the physical integrity of the building.  Water is also visible in 14 Moore Street, although it was far less.  There is dampness and small sections of water ingress.  The two middle buildings were dry as a bone, which one could feel, and their quality and integrity has been maintained.  Given the decision in the court case, what is the Government's plan for those buildings?</p></speech>

I will inquire into it and revert to the Deputy.  We acquired those buildings in 2015 and want to ensure that we preserve them or, more accurately, decide what type of monument we will ultimately create with them.  We will have to consult the Office of Public Works regarding the water.  We want to preserve the buildings as some sort of monument appropriate to the historic issues attached to it and the historic significance of it.  As part of his work with this committee, the Chairman will be familiar with the Moore Street Advisory Committee.  I understand that Hammersons are meeting the committee tomorrow on this and I would love to see a consensus being reached now that we have the court ruling and we have clarity on this.  Technically, we are still within the time limit for an appeal, so I do not want to say too much about this.  Our intention is to work with the advisory committee and see what we can do about curating it.</p></speech>

This is the election of 1918 which led to the foundation of the first D&aacute;il on 21 January 1919.  It would be right that the D&aacute;il or the Oireachtas as successor of the First D&aacute;il, would have a major input into what I would hope would be a very major national celebration of the founding of democracy in this country.</p></speech>

A Bill on An Gorta M&oacute;r, the Great Irish Famine, was brought before the D&aacute;il by myself and a Fine Gael backbench Deputy seeking that the Famine would have a fixed day of commemoration.  The Bill is being held up by a money message.  That is one of the difficulties many committees are dealing with currently.  This is a heritage Bill brought before this Department and it does not seem to me that a money message would be very relevant to it.  It is not looking to change anything other than fix a day so that, internationally, the Famine, which was probably the biggest event in our history, can be commemorated.</p></speech>

I hope to attend that, and I am aware President Higgins will speak at it also.  The third term of the National Famine Commemoration Committee expired in December but we are making arrangements to set up a new committee in that regard.  Perhaps it is something that could be discussed at that stage.</p></speech>

They can organise speakers and events and choose locations much easier when they know that it will be on a particular date in 2019.  It is a small change but one that would facilitate that.</p></speech>

I imagine that changing the date from year to year is probably to facilitate speakers, especially if they have An tUachtar&aacute;n coming to speak.  We also rotate the location of the event.  The Chairman's comment is a valid one and may be something we can examine.  Commemorating the Famine is very important, and it is very important that we have an annual memorial day every year.</p></speech>

Why is that the case?  It reduces from &euro;13 million to &euro;11 million in the space of the year.</p></speech>

The reason for the increased expenditure on the subhead in 2017 was to do with capital repairs and maintenance works on foot of adverse weather, floods and storms in the past quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.  It was also to facilitate the purchase of a strategic land bank adjacent to Ballycroy national park, which became available during 2017.</p> <p>  Following the review of the turf cutting compensation scheme applications, it became apparent that the 2017 expenditure would exceed the original provision and additional funding was required.  There were 2,037 applicants from special areas of conservation bogs and 254 applicants from the natural heritage area, NHA, bogs.  There were 73 additional applicants from special areas of conservation, and 318 of the NHA applications were received in 2017.  New applications each year are reviewed and assessed for payment also.</p></speech>

Canada has a wonderful system called riverine parks, which protect approximately 250 m each side of rivers, and as cities and towns develop around them, that river remains park land in its natural state.  It means there are continuous parks in cities, which enhance well-being as people can enjoy the parks.  It also protects the river basin from pollution and over development.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that if you know anyone who is cutting turf in that way the Department should be told about it.  Obviously, there is a balance between the right to cut turf and conservation and the legal obligations of the State.  If members are aware of anybody doing it, please let us know.</p> <p>  There have been significant efforts by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of the bogs within the framework of the EU habitats directive, which is the law that covers this area.  There has been a long-term compensation scheme in place to compensate active turf cutters for the loss arising from the cessation of turf cutting and we have seen the numbers fall over a number of years.  Obviously, some of the habitat is protected, particularly the raised bog, and some of it has been lost over the last 20 years.  It is a very nuanced and delicate balance to strike.  On the one hand, we wish to protect the land and, on the other, we wish to ensure that turf cutters have a livelihood whereby they can do it without affecting the natural habitat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.785" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12018032800002#H01100"><p>First, I wish to raise our national parks and especially Killarney National Park.  It is a valuable attraction along with Muckross House and Killarney House.  They are already massive tourist attractions but we must maintain the momentum.  However, that momentum is being challenged by the rhododendron and massive numbers of deer.  I understand there is a small amount of culling taking place at present, but the deer are affecting the trees and vegetation.  They are also a danger to people driving their cars on the road.  They are running amuck, especially in the Killarney park.  Sadly, they have caused loss of life for some people.  It is a serious issue that must be addressed.  With regard to the rhododendron, I believe we are losing the battle to eradicate this scourge.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned creating and protecting employment in the national parks.  The number of staff in Killarney National Park has been greatly reduced in recent years.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the number of staff for a number of reasons, including maintaining the park in the way it should be maintained.  It was given to the State a number of years ago.  At 26,000 acres, it is a very valuable property.  It is the jewel in the tourism product of Kerry.  For that reason, I am asking the Minister to provide more staff for Killarney National Park, Killarney House and Muckross House.  In addition, the number of paths in the park must be increased and they must be enhanced.  Many more people are cycling and walking in the park so we must improve those areas to ensure their safety.  That cannot be done without increased funding.  I ask the Minister to ensure that funding is sourced and protected to do as I ask so the momentum of the park into the future is protected.  Pat Dawson and his team are doing tremendous work, but they can only do so much.  They could do a great deal more if they had more staff.  Given the Minister's reference to creating and protecting employment, more staff are needed in Killarney National Park.  When the economic crisis hit the country it hit the park as well, and the number of staff went down.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the park gets more staff.</p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about turf cutting.  That is something close to my heart because my grandmother and grandfather - and my father when he started out - survived by selling turf.  We continue to cut our own turf, as many people in Kerry do from Gneevgullia, Kilcummin and Scartaglin back through Kilgarvan, Cahersiveen and all around.  It is mentioned in the 2040 plan that turf cutting will be ended by 2030.  Many people will be affected if the Government thinks it will be able to bring an end to cutting and burning turf at that stage.  One Deputy in the Chamber said that people would be better off financially if they left the turf in the bog.  Many people would be very cold if they left the turf in the bog because they have traditionally used it to heat their houses.  Other people can afford oil and other fuels but many of those I represent cannot.</p><p>It will be serious and there will be repercussions not only in Kerry, but throughout the whole country if the Department tries to implement it at that stage.</p><p> Our national park is of vital importance to the tourism product of Killarney.  We are grateful for what has taken place in recent years with the opening of Killarney House and so on.  Indeed, my father worked hard to ensure that funding was put in place to enable the House to be reopened.  In 2010, he ensured that the project was included in the investment programme for 2011 when he had sway with Government.  He had fought for it for several years.  We are glad the project is going ahead and progressing and I thank the Minister for that but, again, I urge the Minister not to forget Killarney National Park.</p></speech>

If I omit a response to a question, please remind me.</p> <p>  I already touched on turf cutting in answer to the Chairman's question.  We have no intention of ending the traditional right of someone to cut turf for domestic use, but obviously this must be balanced in any particular area with regard to the EU habitats directive.  This is addressed on a case-by-case basis.  Deputies may raise the issue with me again in respect of any specific case.  We are aware of the tradition of turf cutting and the need to balance it with conservation challenges.</p> <p>  In 2017, we spent approximately &euro;2 million on Killarney National Park.  We opened Killarney House in 2017 and that project cost &euro;7 million.  It was a long awaited development.  We have spent approximately &euro;275,000 on the gardens since they opened.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the rhododendron.  We have spent approximately &euro;1 million on clearance since 2011, including &euro;200,000 in 2016 and &euro;300,000 in 2017.  Right now, we are trying to operate a programme because it can be a total scourge.  A strategic rhododendron management plan is being prepared.  The Department has issued a tender to invite suitably qualified vendors for the term of four years to examine the matter.  As the Deputy said, we want to ensure that Killarney National Park is a place where people can go to visit.  It is difficult, costly and labour intensive to control the rhododendron but it is something of which we are aware.</p> <p>  A programme of works composed of four elements is under way.  There is initial clearance and follow-up maintenance work by contractors.  There is ongoing maintenance work by volunteers and students.  There is a rhododendron eradication management contract.  There is ongoing work by national parks staff, including co-ordination, research and monitoring.  I note what the Deputy said about seeking an increase in staffing.  We are coming through difficult times, as Deputies are aware, but I hope that as our finances improve there might be scope to increase the staffing.</p> <p>  A total of &euro;12 million in funding has been allocated for the national parks in 2018.  This includes funding for each of the six national parks and others activities.  I do not have a specific breakdown as yet for Killarney National Park, as I have not had my sectoral launch yet.  I hope to arrange that and I will let the Deputy know the details.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned Muckross House.  Right now we are investing &euro;400,000 in conjunction with the trustees of Muckross House to upgrade the servants' dining area.  That should be positive.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the deer.  I responded to a Topical Issue matter on this in the D&aacute;il not long ago.  Again, there is a balance between culling deer and trying not to slaughter deer unnecessarily, for want of a better expression.  I understand an issue was raised on Kerry radio this morning about some deer swimming to Innisfallen Island.  A total of 22 deer were culled this morning to ensure that we keep the herd at a level that is manageable.</p> <p>  There is scope for people to hold a licence under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to cull deer where necessary outside the annual open season.  In the case of deer on private property, landowners may apply to the Department for permission to cull.  Again, we want to protect them but we also want to ensure they do not cause issues or safety concerns for the people living in the area.  The Deputy had raised an important issue in this regard.</p></speech>

I thank the officials in the Department for the work they have been doing with turf cutters and their representatives in trying to find solutions to the issues.  There is a good working arrangement now between the Department and turf cutters throughout the country.  We have reached the stage where there is a good understanding of what the Department needs to do and what turf cutters want, especially those who are cutting turf for domestic use.  My engagements with the Department have been positive.  I hope we can finalise all outstanding issues in the not-too-distant future to ensure everyone is working together.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Coole Park in Gort has been included in the national development plan as one of the sites that will get investment from the Department.  I wish to mention another place, and I am being complimentary in the sense that the Department purchased some land in what is known as Cnoc Meadha beside where I am based.  I compliment the Department on its visionary approach to these issues.  The amounts of money involved are not substantial but what happens when we spend small amounts of money in such areas is that we create a tourism product that is unique.  We are probably developing assets whose potential we do not know.  They can realise considerable tourism potential in places where we do not have a tourism brand yet.  When we launch a tourism brand for the midlands, east and north, we will have products available to showcase it.  I compliment the Department in this regard.  If the Department is considering such projects, one message I wish to relay is that we do not need millions or billions.  We only need some seed money because local communities are enthusiastic about buying in as can be seen in the case of Cnoc Meadha.</p> <p>  There is general collaboration between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department in the promotion of these areas where there are fantastic opportunities for tourism.  We underestimate the fact that we have these natural amenities.  We simply need to protect and enhance them.  That is important throughout the country.</p> <p>  We are not on the Wild Atlantic Way although some of what we are doing is in the wild Atlantic region.  It is important that we brand our products in Ireland and that we create different offerings for tourism.  It does not necessarily all need to be down in Kerry or up in Donegal; some of it can be in the midlands or off the beaten track where there are hidden gems.  We simply need to promote them.  I hope the OPW, the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to work together to promote the sector.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to the committee today.</p> <p>  One point I wish to touch on is how it is great to see proof of the ending of the lost decade, to which the Taoiseach and others have referred.</p><p>Increases in funding across the board in the Department are to be welcomed after several years when there were cuts as a result of economic circumstances.  Now that the economy is being well enough managed to allow us to grow, investment in key areas is absolutely crucial.</p><p> An extra &euro;1 million has been allocated to Waterways Ireland.  Is this for specific projects or for day-to-day operations?  The built heritage investment scheme and structures at risk fund are important and I am delighted to see more money going into both.  As the Minister stated earlier, these projects involve small-scale building contractors locally carrying out labour-intensive work.  The built heritage investment scheme growing into the future is crucial.  Will the Minister expand on the built heritage element of the &euro;1 billion capital investment as part of Project Ireland 2040?</p><p> How does the Minister see the roll-out of the national biodiversity plan?  The Curragh Plains, a 5,000 acre expanse, is not a national or designated heritage area.  However, it is important from a biodiversity point of view.  What are her broader plans for the national biodiversity plan?</p><p> I have had many dealings through the years regarding Mouds bog and there were difficulties in finding alternative turf cutting sites to it.  I recognise the significant investment the State has put into the compensation for turf cutters and I hope that a permanent, long-term solution can be found for local residents and others.</p><p> The Barrow blueway has significant support in Kildare.  While it ran into some planning difficulties in Carlow and the southern tip of Kildare, a significant part of it has planning permission.  We are anxious to see this developed.  It is another example of investment in our waterways, which is good from a heritage and tourism perspective and is crucial to rural areas like south Kildare.</p></speech>

We are going to deliver a prioritised infrastructure and maintenance programme focused on areas of greatest use and benefit to ensure 90% of navigable waterways are open to navigation from mid-March to October.  We will continue to promote the existing blueway products on the River Shannon and the Shannon-Erne Waterway, as well as establishing new ones on the Royal Canal, Lough Erne and the Lower Bann.  We also want to deliver two recreational activity hubs.  We are going to continue to work with partners to provide water recreation programmes such as the Blueway 10K, Get Going, Get Rowing, Active Schools, Paddles Up and the open water swimming Couch to 5K to ensure more than 1,000 people learn a new water sport in 2018.  We will host the 2018 world canals conference in Athlone in September.  This usually attracts over 400 delegates, including international visitors and professionals.  We hope to successfully deliver year two of the 22 km greenway development along the Ulster Canal from Smithborough in County Monaghan to Middletown in County Armagh.  The inland waterways are not just an engineering marvel, but an amenity within our national tourism offering.  I intend to ramp up investment including the restoration of the Ulster Canal.</p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's comment on the national development plan and the biodiversity plan.  This will help us implement the biodiversity plan in a way we were not able to do heretofore.  The plan covers the period 2017 to 2021.  It demonstrates our commitment to meeting our obligations to protect the diversity for the benefit of future generations through targeted strategies and actions.  There are approximately 119 actions in the plan that we want to implement.  It is important that we do so.  There are several projects, such as that at Killarney House to which Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned, as well as other implementations relating to landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna, along with telling the story of man's interaction over the years.</p> <p>  The built heritage investment scheme and structures at risk fund are important.  There were 412 projects in 2017 and the priority is job creation.  In 2018, &euro;2 million funding will be allocated.  The deadline for applications being accepted by local authorities for these schemes was 31 January.  It is important in terms of assisting with the repair and conservation of structures which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts.  The built heritage investment scheme leverages private capital for investment in a significant number of labour-intensive scale conservation projects.  The structures at risk fund encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, as well as helping secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost in private and public ownership.  Up to &euro;1.324 million is allocated to the fund for 2018.  Private investment is usually 50-50, with four to five projects per county.  The quality and scale of these projects is important.  A good heritage officer in a county council helps with this too.  It is important these schemes are availed of because they feed into the wider benefit of the community as a whole.</p></speech>

I represent eight of them in my own constituency in Cork South-West.  In fairness, when the Minister of State's name is mentioned there is always a positive response.  As the old saying in west Cork goes, call a spade a spade and be straight with a person.  Having attended the AGMs of various groups on some of those islands, the one issue that keeps coming up is the falling population on the islands.  The question is when a council house was last built on an island.  Is funding being made available to islands to turn this around?  Many families would not have the finances to build a house but they are not being assisted by the local authority because the local authority says that it is not getting the funding to turn it around.  I mentioned the eight islands.  There is Dursey Island; Bere Island, which is a strong island and could take social or council housing; Whiddy Island; Long Island; Sherkin Island; Heir Island; Garnish Island; and Cape Clear.  Some of these are very active islands but their populations are falling.  Every set of statistics which is made available shows that clear trend.  There has not been a focus, however, on building council houses on islands.  That needs to turn around if we are not going to see the demise of islands.</p> <p>  Another issue is the Leader funding.  That is an issue on the mainland as well as on the islands, but the islands will survive too and they are looking for Leader funding.  The way in which Leader funding changed was a farce.  It was basically destroyed.  There are similar issues on the mainland, as I have said.  Committee groups are looking for Leader funding, but islands are also looking for it and are finding it difficult to access the funding, which was freely available before. </p> <p>  Another issue which is close to my heart, but about which the Minister of State might not be able to do much, is the famous Fastnet Rock, which is an icon around the world.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights has decided that it wants to tamper with it by dimming the light on Fastnet Rock.  It would take the range of the beam down from 28 nautical miles down to 17 nautical miles.  I take a very dim view of that decision, as does the local community.  It is our heritage and our culture.  People have told me that for hundreds of years it was the last light people saw when they left Ireland.  The next light was the Statue of Liberty.  Any movement by the Commissioners of Irish lights towards dimming this light is a backward decision.  I cannot understand it.  I know it has it nicely polished and is saying that there will be no visible difference to the structure of the building itself but it has been an iconic structure.  It is just a few stone's throws away from my own house in west Cork.  It is the wrong decision.  I know the Minister of State cannot intervene personally, but if he could it would be great.  I think it is good for me to highlight this issue and the upset which people have expressed on it.</p></speech>

We have issues around depopulation on some of our islands.  I have responsibility for the populated islands.  I am very aware of the potential on the likes of Bere Island and Sherkin Island.  Particularly in respect of Bere Island we have to look at the military heritage.  There is great leadership there in the likes of John Walsh.  There are comharchumainn right through Sherkin Island.  I was speaking to `the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, today and he is looking at attending that AGM if it suits him.  I asked him to check his diary.  Maybe we can meet up with the comharchumann down there.  There are so many other things at play with regard to responsibility for the islands.  For example the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had a special allocation of pillar 1 money for the islands.  It looked at the islands on their own.  That was a good thing.  There are a number of issues and challenges.  We have responsibility for the populated islands.  The Deputy may have ideas for ways to maintain the current population and to get more people back.</p> <p>  Arranmore got an allocation from the Department of Rural and Community Development for a digital hub.  That had a great positive knock-on effect.  In fact, one person who had been living in Scotland was thinking about moving back and bringing their business back if the broadband was available.  The islands are a big focus of the national development plan, as they should be.  I have no problem putting on the record that we should be discriminate when we look at rolling out the national broadband plan.  We have a tendency in Ireland to work from core to periphery.  We have an opportunity here to start from the most peripheral isolated areas and to work back.  That is a very black and white suggestion which probably requires a much more complex answer.  Regardless of who gets the broadband contract, I have always said that we should look at the more vulnerable places when it is being rolled out.  No doubt I will have the Deputy's support in that.</p></speech>

It is a very good partnership project involving the Department, Irish Lights, the local authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and our own Department through the Gaeltacht.  The people I have dealt with at Irish Lights listen and work with one and I recommend that the Deputy contacts them in a formal and direct way.</p></speech>

These allocations are also subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council.  The overall allocation for Waterways Ireland for 2018 is increased by over &euro;1 million to just over &euro;24 million.  More than 90% of the waterways remained open during the 2017 boating season.  Works to repair damaged infrastructure progressed throughout the year and the Shannon-Erne blueway continued to attract a significant number of visitors.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, has addressed the aspects of the Vote related to his brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.846" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12018032800002#P00400"><p>It is not my desire to put competing interests against one another with regard to funding but this goes back to my point on the Irish language and how poorly it is funded.  Waterways Ireland receives &euro;24 million for 2018, which it should, but Foras na Gaeilge has funding of &euro;13 million, which is considerably less.  As such, the Irish language is the poor relation.  I guarantee that if one asked anyone on Grafton Street whether Waterways Ireland, which covers some canals and waterways, or Foras na Gaeilge received more, they would all say it was the latter which received a higher investment.  However, that is not the case.  I made the point to Deputy McHugh but I note it to Deputy Madigan also.  Foras na Gaeilge is in trouble having regard to its funding because it is locked into a funding mechanism with the North, which has no Executive at present.  It might be a way around that problem to take some of its responsibilities away from Foras na Gaeilge and fund them through other mechanisms.  That would leave Foras na Gaeilge with its total funding intact but with fewer responsibilities to fund.  Each one of its funding responsibilities would thereby have its funding increased.  It might just be a work-around while the current system is in lockdown and the Minister might consider that suggestion.</p> <p>Blueways are a great initiative and we are very fond of them.  However, there are lots of rivers, such as the Boyne, which do not currently have blueways but which would benefit massively from them.  If there was an energy injected into the development of blueways nationally, it would be useful.</p></speech>

In his original question, the Chairman referred to the structure of the North-South institutions.  It is very important, especially as we head towards the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, to note the onus on us to protect any structures under it as best we can.  That said and while it is a disadvantage that we cannot meet with our colleagues on a formal basis, there is engagement between the finance Departments North and South.  It is very important to hold onto whatever structures are in place, especially as people are reflecting and until such time as we can sit down formally to discuss these things.</p></speech>

We also fund &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the Gaeltachta&iacute; and Gaeilge directly.  A provision of &euro;13.989 million was also funded in the 2017 Revised Estimates of the Department to fund the work of An Foras Teanga.</p> <p>I accept what the Chairman says about the importance of blueways.  The graving docks site at Grand Canal Docks is designated within city block 19 of the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock SDZ.  There are three graving docks on the site, two of which were excavated by Waterways Ireland in 2002 while the third remains infilled.  These have not been used for ship building and repair for almost a century.  There is also the extension of the Longford branch of the Royal Canal where Waterways Ireland published a feasibility study.  The Chairman is correct that blueways are important and that funding should go to those waterways.</p></speech>

It is proposed to note this correspondence.  I think we should meet with the NTA at the earliest opportunity to discuss Project Ireland 2040, National Planning Framework and its implications for transport, DART expansion, the road and rail network and designation of growth centres and so on.

Agreed.  </p> <p>  Correspondence 2018/241, is an email dated 12 March from Ms B Fitzpatrick Farrell requesting an invitation to appear before the committee to discuss the CIE pension scheme, which we discussed at a previous meeting.

Agreed.  </p> <p>  Correspondence 2018/245 and 245(a), is a letter from Mr Ronan Gill, acting chief operating officer, CIE confirming the provenance of documents referred to at the meeting of 7 March and enclosing the CIE board papers pack.  Mr. Gill also points out in his letter that the CIE Group has acceded to requests from the trade union group for "additional independent advice" and that it has consented to make funding available for such advice, which was a key request of this committee at our last meeting.

There is a consultation process under way and people need to engage in that process in a direct way.  Very often people think that they have engaged, but they might not have engaged with the statutory process.  If they do not engage with the statutory process they will not be heard where it is necessary for them to be heard.

I welcome to the meeting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, and their officials.  Before we commence and in accordance with procedure I am required to remind those present of the following information.  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Ross, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin; the assistant secretary with responsibility for tourism and sport, Mr. Ken Spratt, Mr. Noel Sheahan from the sports capital programme division and Mr. James Lavelle from the sports policy division in my Department.  There has been a lot of focus on the sports capital programme in recent weeks and I hope that we can put the facts of the matter on the record of the committee today.</p> <p>  I am going to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, to now outline the background to the sports capital programme and some of the key improvements we introduced to the most recent round of the programme.  I will then speak about the appeals process and our future plans for sports capital investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#C00900"><p>As members will be aware, the sports capital programme, SCP, is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  More than 10,000 projects have now benefitted from SCP funding since 1998.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  By the time the most recent round of the programme closed for applications on 24 February 2017, it had attracted a record number of 2,320 applications seeking &euro;155 million in grants.  Originally, it was envisaged that &euro;30 million would be provided for the sports capital programme in 2017.  However, following detailed discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister and I were delighted to increase the budget.  That allowed us to allocate a total of &euro;60 million at the end of 2017 to more than 1,800 different sporting projects.  That was an excellent result for Irish sport.  All of the details of the allocations are available on the Department's website.</p> <p>  I am aware that later today the committee will discuss funding for minority sports.  In that regard, the most recent round of sports capital funding did a very good job in that every single valid application under the local aspect of the programme and two thirds of all valid applications under the regional aspect of the programme received funding.  More than 50 different sports benefitted.  Once the applications were valid, in particular for the local scheme, funding was given, regardless of the nature of the sport.</p> <p>  A previous criticism of the sports capital programme, which was highlighted on many occasions by this committee, was the fact that there was always a considerable number of invalid applications submitted.  It was around 48% in 2012 but by 2013 to 2015 that had dropped to approximately one third and last time we got it down to one fifth.  That was as a result of a major streamlining of the application process.  For example, what was a 13-page application process was reduced to six pages and that made it much easier for applicants to submit a valid application.  However, we are still concerned that one in five applications were invalid and we want to reduce that to zero if possible in the future.  We think it would be very important to give every opportunity to future applicants to ensure that a second chance would be provided to invalid applications and that invalidation would not happen on technical grounds.  We constantly strive to improve the programme.  There is a review process after every round of the sports capital programme.  In order to bring about improvements for the next round I have embarked on a nationwide tour to meet with past, present and future applicants to the programme to hear from them.  I want to get suggestions and feedback on what they think is working and what needs to be improved.  We hope to feed that information into the process of designing the new scheme to ensure further improvement in the 2018 programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.886" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#C01000"><p>As the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has outlined, after a lot of hard work we were delighted to be in a position to provide assistance to so many worthwhile projects at the end of last year.  Inevitably though, there were some disappointed applicants who were deemed invalid at assessment stage.  In that regard, all applicants deemed invalid or partially invalid were invited to appeal the Department's decision if it was felt that an error had been made in the assessment process.  A total of 149 appeals were submitted prior to the deadlines and, of those, 35 were upheld.  All applicants under the 2017 round of the programme that remain invalid have been informed that they will be given the opportunity of simply submitting corrected documentation when the next round of the programme opens without the requirement of submitting a full new application.  I think that and other measures already outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, show our commitment to making the application process as user-friendly as possible.</p> <p>  We must always seek to improve further however, and I believe that we can make further progress in relation to eliminating all invalid applications and ensuring that every eligible organisation is aware that there is a programme open for applications.  A particular focus in this regard will be ensuring that all schools are aware of the programme.  As was done with previous rounds of the programme, a review of the 2017 round is now under way which is also examining what would be feasible in terms of the scale and timing of the next round.  I expect this review to be complete shortly and an announcement regarding the next round will be made at that stage.</p><p>The recently published national development plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to sport infrastructure in the years ahead.  At least &euro;100 million in capital funding will be provided for the sports capital programme for the coming four years.  This will cover all of our existing commitments and also allow new rounds of the programme to open for applications.  We will announce more details in this regard once the review of the 2017 round of the programme is complete.  I am also delighted that the national development plan commits to establishing a new large-scale sports infrastructure fund for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount available under the SCP.  The new fund is designed to provide a more structured approach for such funding and at least &euro;100 million is being provided.  The full terms and conditions of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months. </p><p> In summary, Government investment in sport is money well spent and I believe that the sports capital programme remains an excellent example of Government supporting the voluntary sector in a way that benefits entire communities.  We are committed to continuing to improve sports facilities and giving everybody who wants to get involved in sport the opportunity to do so.  We look forward to seeing the many successful projects under the most recent round of the programme progressing but also seeing new applicants being given the opportunity to submit new proposals as soon as possible.  We do not believe that the system is absolutely perfect as it stands.  It can always be improved.  A review is being undertaken, as is done every year.  We welcome any suggestions made by the committee for improvements which could be made in order to benefit people and include more people in sport.</p><p> I thought it would be useful to ask Mr. Spratt to address the committee and, with the permission of the Chairman, I call on him to offer a few remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kenneth Spratt" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#D00200"><p>From the Department's perspective, the fact that the 2017 round of the sports capital programme received the greatest number of applications ever presented a significant challenge.  In terms of the recommended allocations, for the first time the full scoring system and assessment procedures were published prior to the assessment of applications commencing.  The total amount of funding available was divided on a <i>per capita</i>basis and the exact amount allocated to each project was based on a formula which combined the assessment score obtained, the amount of funding sought and the total amount of funding available for that county.<br/><br/>While the vast majority of applicants were delighted to hear news of allocations, several applicants who had made invalid applications contacted the Department to express their disappointment.  The fact that we were able to make a grant offer to every valid applicant obviously magnified the disappointment.  Options for addressing the cases were considered by my colleagues and I and we believed that establishing a practical, straightforward internal appeals process would be an appropriate course of action.  This suggestion was put to the Minister and Minister of State for consideration and both were agreeable to same.  All applicants who had made invalid applications were contacted inviting them to appeal.  The introduction of the appeals process also ensures that the sports capital programme now accords with the Department's own customer action plan, which commits to maintaining a simple to use system of appeal for any of our customers who are dissatisfied with our decisions.<br/><br/>Each appeal submitted was considered by an official who had not been involved in the original assessment of that application and all decisions on appeals were also reviewed by at least two more senior officials.  While the final recommended allocations under the original assessment and the subsequent appeals process were formally signed off on by the Minister and Minister of State, I would like to emphasise that no changes were proposed to the recommended allocation amounts or to the decisions to make particular applications valid or invalid.</p></speech>

Before I open up the discussion I want to say that I acknowledge the tremendous work the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State are doing.  The transparency and accountability are hugely important.  The appeals process is extremely welcome because people can inadvertently forget to tick a box, as does happen, and I appreciate that this process gives an opportunity to address that.</p> <p>  I would like to make two points.  I am appreciate that the Minister did not necessarily mention it today, but I am aware that in his reply he can talk about weighting for disadvantaged areas, particularly areas which Pobal have designated as areas of significant economic disadvantage.  He can also talk about how he deals with that and makes sure that money gets to communities which are disadvantaged economically.  I have two other points.  One is on the question of open access to the facilities of clubs which receive a lot of money.  Are they available to other groups which might be able to use them, even if they are not necessarily part of that organisation?  If so, when?  In other words, if we are investing significant funds, people living the area should be able to use them if at all possible.</p> <p>  I do not know if other members have been lobbied on this, but we have a very active bridge club in Drogheda.  Deputy Munster will know about this.  There are recreational and social amenities which require some funding.  Thousands of people play bridge and yet these clubs do not qualify for any grant in respect of sport and recreation amenities.  It would be helpful if that could be looked at in the future.  I particularly refer to clubs which have raised significant amounts of money to complete buildings to meet their requirements.  A huge number of people are involved.  Thousands of people play bridge and they would be very anxious to be admitted into some scheme in order to get some benefit.</p> <p>  I will open discussion to the floor.  I call on Deputy O'Keeffe.</p></speech>

I apologise.  I should have called on Senator O'Mahony.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.892" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1426" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#D00600"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will be brief.  I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department for outlining the issues with the sports capital funding.  I think everybody acknowledges that it has played a key role in improving facilities for sports clubs for all the different sports around the country.  It has really made a difference and increased participation.  I am interested in the comment the Minister made about large-scale sports infrastructure.  Obviously the local sports capital fund is for smaller clubs and organisations.  Can it cater for all the minority sports which we will be talking about later?  I acknowledge at this stage the wonderful project at Abbottstown and the way in which it caters for minority sports - cycling and fencing for example.  I attended the f&eacute;ile hosted by the Connacht GAA centre of excellence a number of years ago.  More than 10,000 people were there.  The GAA put a huge amount of funding into that.  I would be interested to hear the Minster's comments on funding for larger structural projects and on what might be available for facilities to cater for minority sports right around the country, not just in Abbottstown.</p> <p>  On the appeals process and so on, we need to refer to the recent controversies, which the Minister mentioned himself.  One of the good things about the sports capital programme is that in the most recent few rounds - the Chairman emphasised this fact - the facilities funded are available at all times throughout the week and throughout the day.  On the controversy around the private schools getting funding, and on the particular case that caused the controversy, did it involve a joint application from a sports club and the school?  We heard in the media that other schools in disadvantaged areas had not received funding or had been turned down.  I presume in many of those cases it would have been the case that applications were not made.  Was that the case?  It is important to fine-tune this and get it right so that those most in need get funding first.  I ask the Minister for his comments on that.</p> <p>  The other issue I have may be more relevant to Sport Ireland.  It relates to the minority sports.  It is one of the good things about the sports capital programme that funding is given to minority sports in order to provide facilities.</p><p>The issue with minority sports arises where they are not under a national governing body supported by the sports council.  One has situations where people win international kick-boxing or billiards competitions while representing Ireland but have to fund their own travel abroad to do so.  There could be some contingency fund.  I realise one cannot spread funding too thinly and support every governing body, but I might talk to Sport Ireland about it later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.894" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1424" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I appreciate the extra funding for sport, especially minority sport.  Over the years, we looked at sports funding as being for three or four major games, but there has been a rebalancing towards minority sports in the last number of years.  The appeals process is a lot more open now.  I remember that in our first year in government, it was kind of embarrassing that once a sports capital application was deemed invalid, one had to wait five or six months to find out why.  The application system is now much more transparent and user-friendly.  Thankfully, a great deal has been done by the Department in that regard.</p> <p>  It has been a bugbear of mine over the last number of years in relation to minority sports that we talk about "one Ireland", "all-Ireland" and "Ireland together".  I was very fortunate to be at the Ireland rugby match at Twickenham.  The event was a source of great pride for the island of Ireland.  There are a lot of all-Ireland sports bodies, including Badminton Ireland, Judo Ireland and Rowing Ireland.  I notice that there is a Republic of Ireland Billiards and Snooker Association and I wonder if that sport has gone the same was as the FAI and the IFA.  We could do a great deal more to provide facilities as an island.  We talk about the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games.  There was a void for a host for the Commonwealth Games in 2022.  I felt the island of Ireland could have made a play for those games.  It would unite the people on the island.  We were very close to getting an all-Ireland hockey team to compete in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year on the Gold Coast, but it did not happen.  It is something at which we need to look.  Commonwealth youth games are coming to Northern Ireland in 2021 and one has a few areas like boxing, tennis and judo which could play a role given the level of funding that has been put into them as minority sports.  That would send a very powerful message.  We always say we would love to have an all-Ireland soccer team, but it is a two-way street.  If we want an all-Ireland soccer team, we should not be afraid to consider competing in the Commonwealth Games.  These are things we need to challenge.</p> <p>  A great deal of funding has been invested in rowing, including at the rowing centre at Lough Rynn in my constituency, which is hugely successful.  However, we could appeal to the Commonwealth Games in 2021 by opening some of our facilities for use.  It would send a powerful signal, albeit not a political one.  It is a signal that would result from the Good Friday Agreement.  Now more than ever, it should be a two-way street.  I ask for views on that subject.  We look at Ireland as one island from many sports' perspectives, although there are a few exceptions.  The sporting curve is ahead of the political curve.</p></speech>

We welcome the Minister's positive deliberations today.  My concern is the stop-go approach to the allocation of sports capital grants.  I acknowledge that the previous Government re-introduced the scheme, which was very welcome during the hard times.  However, 2017 followed a lull of over two years from the last allocations and many clubs have had to sit on the fence and wait before they could move on with their developments.  It has already gone beyond a year before the allocations for the 2018 scheme will come into play.  There is a stop-go approach and no consistency in the roll-out of the scheme.  Other Government schemes, irrespective of whether the money is spent from the previous year's allocation, are still subject to announcements of new allocations for the following year on a regular basis, i.e. every 12 months.  Here we are not too sure yet whether the 2018 scheme will be opened this year.</p> <p>  What we see is forward spending of the budget.  To be fair to the Minister, he put in an extra &euro;30 million, but that is from the budget going forward.  Will the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, give him the money going forward again and when we have our budget in October?  That is the concern I have, namely, consistency.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has already stated he is doing another review.  I am trying to be positive here.  Good leeway is being given in the allocation of grants.  Mention has been made of minority sports.  I do not play golf myself, but I am delighted that golf clubs have benefitted given that they have been through the financial woes of the past decade also.  Some of them have barely stayed open.  Golf is as good a recreational sport as jogging or walking.</p> <p>  Could we provide a separate mechanism to provide funding to schools in disadvantaged areas?  Some schools can match funding but could we provide more funding to a school with lower-income families attending which is looking for an astroturf pitch?  It might get 80% of the grant, for example, as opposed to 50%.  The evidence is the private school has more access to funding.  Matching funding is a big thing.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister is here and that there is good news.  My problem is the stop-go approach.  This needs to be put in place on a regular basis.  One can see that &euro;100 million will not go far.  It will be spent in two years, not four.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for the work they do on the vital sports capital grant, which is vital to support sporting clubs right across the country.  The Minister says there was due process and that he did no interfere with regard to Wesley College benefitting from an allocation of &euro;150,000.  It seems there is always due process.  It was due process that Stepaside Garda station was on a list also.</p></speech>

Ballynacargy boxing club, in my own home village, produced an all-Ireland champion.  It applied for changing room facilities but the application was not approved.  If the process was followed and adhered to by the Minister, then perhaps the process itself needs to change.  It is coincidental that the process always seems to benefit the only two Garda stations that were named, one of which was in the constituency of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.</p></speech>

Will there be an opportunity for people to avail of that funding?  After this session a number of representatives from the various minority sporting bodies will address us.  It would be advantageous if the Minister and the Minister of State could outline specifically how much of the sports capital programme funding was spent on minority sporting bodies.  Those bodies will speak later today about the financial challenges they face, and it would be helpful if we knew how much of the most recent sports capital programme was allocated to them.</p> <p>  The large-scale sports capital infrastructure programme was mentioned.  The standard reply I have received in parliamentary questions in the past is that it will happen in the next number of months.  Can the Minister or Minister of State be a little bit more specific about what "the next number of months" means?  It seems to be a moveable feast.  The Minister and Minister of State have said that the next round of sports allocations will be open this year, but will there be an allocation of funds this year or will it simply be opened this year with allocated funding to follow in early 2019?  </p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister is touring the constituencies and meeting with sporting bodies.  Can I suggest that he should advertise it in a little bit more detail?  When he came to my constituency, I was unaware that he was visiting, as was another Deputy.  It just so happened that two opposition Deputies were unaware of what was going on, but of course there were no political reasons for that because there is no politics involved in sports capital programmes.  Perhaps, just to be helpful, it would be courteous to drop a note to the Deputies who represent the constituencies.  They too work with sporting bodies and they might be able to encourage more people to meet with the Minister and see for themselves how open and transparent the system is.  </p></speech>

However, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister and I were delighted to increase the budget.  That allowed us to allocate a total of &euro;60 million at the end of 2017 to more than 1,800 different sporting projects.  That was an excellent result for Irish sport.</blockquote> <p>What the Minister of State failed to say was that there had been no capital grants allocations for two years.  The Minister did not decide to double the amount available, but rather doubled up on two years worth of investment.  There was no actual increase whatsoever.  He had not delivered in 2016, so only allocations that were owed were provided.  That should have been said a little bit more clearly, and the Minister of State should have been a little bit more transparent about that.  </p><p>Speaking of transparency, I have to say that this is an absolute mess.  I always thought of the Minister as somebody who stood on a platform of accountability and transparency, and who was totally against cronyism of any description.  However, he has really bought into gombeen politics.  I will explain what I mean.  Deputy Troy had outlined the abundance of facilities available at Wesley College.  Fair play to it.  It advertises as a private school and part of that is based on the attractiveness of its facilities.  I will mention the facilities again; perhaps it will resonate with people.  It has four rugby pitches, one soccer pitch, two large-scale AstroTurf hockey pitches, two mini hockey pitches, 16 tennis courts, two basketball courts, two cricket pitches, track and field facilities, a sports hall and a gym.  When the sports allocation grants were brought in, the idea was that they would target disadvantaged areas.  It was supposed to encourage participation in sport in those areas and to steer young people in the right direction, aiming to get them involved in community and sporting activity.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me, but I cannot figure out how Wesley College is in any way disadvantaged.  Perhaps the students are choking on their silver spoons.  Can the Minister please point out to me how Wesley College is disadvantaged in respect of sporting facilities?  One of the Senators was asked if Wesley College qualified for the grant because it is linked with the YMCA.</p><p>Perhaps that was just an "in" that was included in order that places like private schools could apply and justify qualifying for the grant, if ever one could use the word "justify" in this instance.  Thirty public schools were refused and nowhere in a million years would they have the same facilities as Wesley College.  They would not have a chance or a hope.  A football club with no facilities was given &euro;600.  It bought a lawnmower to cut the grass in a rented field.  One could not make it up.  A patronising signal was sent to that club that it could have &euro;600.  The Minister might say that is all it applied for but how could it apply for anything else when it has no facilities?  </p></speech>

How could the club apply for anything else when it has no facilities?  This is where the sports capital grant falls down.  An audit has not been carried out and that is one of my suggestions for the total overhaul of this sports programme.  It has never been carried out.  We have waited two years to get this funding.  There was ample time in those two years to carry out an audit of disadvantaged areas that were without facilities and that have nothing.  People must walk up the road pushing a lawnmower to cut a rented field but the Minister does not see the inequality in that.  It took two years to get to this stage.  Why could it not have been done properly?  Why could an audit of every area lacking in facilities not have been done ?  Why could those areas not have been targeted?</p> <p>  They will never be at the same level as some of the clubs and private schools that got the funding but they could be given some sort of advantage for their communities.  I read somewhere that the Minister boasted that over 50% of the funding went to disadvantaged areas and schools.  Am I correct in saying that when the Minister says "over 50%", that was actually 50.7%?  Will he clarify whether I am correct?  If that 50.7% is a boast, I cannot figure out what planet the Minister and his officials are on to think that is either socially or morally justified.  It beggars belief.  The Minister is reinforcing disadvantage and privilege.  It has never been so blatant as in this allocation.  I cannot figure out why the Minister does not get it.  The public see and are outraged by it. </p> <p>  The Minister seems to be taken aback by the outcry about this.  It is blatant discrimination and inequality in the distribution and allocation of sporting grants.  These grants were introduced to target disadvantaged areas and ensure every community had proper facilities.  We will go on to the yacht club and the golf club.  The yacht club figure was &euro;72,000.  There was no &euro;600 for the yacht club.  One of the golf clubs that received &euro;150,000 charges more than &euro;8,000 for its annual fee.  The majority of taxpayers could not afford to join that golf club, not even for a year, but the same taxpayers are forced to pick up the bill for the &euro;150,000 grant we gave out of public money.  No club or private school that is financially sufficient should come next or near qualifying for a capital sports grant.  Once something is of a private nature and is financially viable and sufficient, it should not qualify while there are disadvantaged areas that do not even have a pitch.  </p> <p>  There are school gyms where four buckets are needed in each corner of the gym to catch the rainwater.  I have some suggestions.  The Committee of Public Accounts needs to look into this.  I am sure the Ministers would not have a problem with that.  It is serious enough that the qualifying criteria for the allocations need to be looked into.  They need to be totally overhauled.  There needs to be an audit and support must given for every application because there also is a kind of inequality in the competition aspect.  A golf club that is financially sufficient or a private school that has the finances and the resources can ensure an application is correct and can put their full weight behind the application.  A local voluntary club does not have those resources.  The competition aspect of it needs to be examined and unless that is done, the sports capital grants will be a laughing stock.  The evidence from this allocation shows the Minister has moved away entirely from the very reasons this grant was set up.  The Minister needs a policy whereby an audit is the first thing to be carried out.  </p></speech>

The objective of this scheme is to widen the number of people who can participate in sport.  That includes people from all areas of society.  We are concerned about the numbers.  It is important to us that they increase over the years.  They are specifically geared and weighted toward the disadvantaged.  That is perfectly clear from some of the figures that emerged from the sports capital grants.  It is fair to say that 22 out of 44 of these schools, that is 50%, that received sports capital grants, are located in disadvantaged areas and 1,000 out of 1,800 grants were allocated to disadvantaged areas.  That is a fact.  There is room, for sure, for improvement.</p> <p>  However, the weightings, which are available, will show that a heavy weighting gives disadvantaged areas a certain edge.  I will outline some of the six criteria and weightings.  The level of socioeconomic disadvantage in the area gets a weighting of five.  The likelihood of increasing participation and or improving performance gets a weighting of seven.  The sharing of facilities gets a weighting of four.  The level of own funding available gets a weighting of five but that is skewed in a way that is actually in favour of disadvantaged people as well.  If the Deputy wishes, I will ask my officials to explain.  The level of the sports capital programme received in the past ten years gets a lower weighting because it is less likely disadvantaged areas will have had that.  The whole thrust of this particular programme is to give disadvantaged areas an advantage.  That is its whole purpose.  That can be seen in the statistics with the number of clubs and the number of schools.  That will continue and may even be accelerated.  Now, it has been said-----</p></speech>

I do not have the details of the schools here but the amounts for disadvantaged areas is 50%.  The question of more open access and opening up the schools was raised as well.  In many cases where the schools have applied, as has been said and acknowledged, they do have the assets.  In every single case, private and public, where a school makes an application, that school must involve a local club as well.  The idea is quite specifically that local clubs, which do not have access to such facilities, can share them with the schools.</p><p>We have seen high-profile cases, to which I will come in a minute, where clubs get use of the school facilities for 31.5 hours per week, up from zero.  That gives them an open access which they did not have before.  That applies to both private and public schools.  </p><p> On the issue of bridge, I note that we will be looking at the eligibility criteria for sports in our review.

I will deal with the schools issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State will deal with the issue of large sports infrastructure and minority sports.  He is better equipped to deal with those issues than I<b>.  </b></p><p>I presume the school to which the Senator refers is Wesley College.  That was a joint application, made with the Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA.  A lot of the high-profile coverage of this case emphasised that Wesley College is a private school.  That is true.  The school made the application because the Methodists are the registered owners.  However, this point should be made clear.  As a result of that particular deal, which by the way I had absolutely nothing to do with, the YMCA will have the right to use the hockey pitch for 31.5 hours per week for 15 years.  Their use is at specified times but a lot of those are peak times, including Saturdays and Sundays.  This opens the facility to a totally new community.  While Wesley of course does benefit, the agreement requires that it opens up private grounds to a community.  That is very important and it is not fully understood.  In that application, which I have looked at since the controversy erupted, it is specified that the facilities will be available to Taney and Whitechurch national schools in the area, as well as a local soccer league.  The community will benefit from this to a large extent.  </p></speech>

I am not sure but I think we are talking about something very small.  Maybe they have to pay an overhead if they are using the lighting or that sort of thing.  I do not think there is any consistent fee.  They are getting the use of the facilities for 15 years.  It is a huge benefit to the surrounding community.  I suppose the officials who made the decision could have decided not to make this allocation but they would have been depriving the surrounding community of entry and access to the facilities.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State can deal with the questions from Senator Feighan.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe asked about extending the sports capital scheme for another year.  I agree with him about this scheme.  It is a fantastic scheme.  It is phenomenal and we would like to be able to do it every single year.  One of the Deputies, I think Deputy Munster, made reference to it being missed for a year.  We deeply regret that and we are to some extent playing catch-up by going from &euro;30 million to &euro;60 million.  We are very anxious to reopen this within months.  We will continue so that people can expect funds to flow in the direction of sport on an annual basis.  I do not want to give a time commitment but I will commit to it happening.  We think it is that important for the health of the nation, including mental health, and we think that it is worth pursuing with vigour and energy.  We are committed to reopening this and to allocating another round as soon as possible.  We are going to carry out the 2017 revision first but the moment that is completed, we are going to reopen the sports capital programme for a new round.  We will need the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for that, but I do not anticipate that being a problem in any way.  This is a great scheme.  All parties approve of it.  The allocations may not please some Deputies as much as others but it is absolutely going to continue. </p> <p>  I will now deal with some of the questions Deputy Troy raised.  I want to make this clear.  I make it clear very often but maybe Deputy Troy has not been able to hear.  In the past, the process of this fund began with recommendations being made by officials.  The recommendations went to the Minister, who then made decisions.  I can tell the Deputy that those recommendations, which were made on a strict scoring basis, were not always adhered to.  In other words, an applicant could have a high score but once politicians got hold of the recommendations, they were not necessarily the top priority for allocation of funds.  Indeed people with very high scores sometimes got nothing and people with lower scores received grants.  Perhaps the Deputy will be able to conclude how that happened.  It seems to me that alterations of that sort at a political level are totally unacceptable.  Let me say that I regret that this happened.  As a result of the realisation that this was happening or in other words, that politicians were directing the funds, several independent analyses were carried out.  They found that the main flaw in the sports capital grant system was that the money followed the Minister.  Deputy Troy will be well aware of that. </p></speech>

We did not change one comma, one allocation, one place, one position or anything whatsoever, at any stage.  This is unique.</p><p>The appeals also reached the Ministers and exactly the same thing happened.  It was determined that we would not come before a committee and have it said one Minister interfered here and there and that the other interfered in another place.  It was to take it out of the political arena and as a result we had a really good scheme.  No Minister interfered, made representations or changed a single allocation of a sports capital grant.  However, we came under a lot of pressure, as members will be aware.  I have in front of me eight representations received from Deputy Robert Troy asking me to interfere.</p></speech>

Her party leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, asked me to go to Arbour Hill Boxing Club, which I did.  It is in a disadvantaged area.  It was looking for a sports grant at the time and received a grant of &euro;150,000, but I did not interfere in that process.  I went to see the club several times because it was in a disadvantaged area about which I cared.  It was worthy and doing fantastic work.  I am sure it has acknowledged the interest many of us have shown in it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, was there too.</p></speech>

It comes back again to carrying out an audit to see where the money could best be spent.  If it badly needed the use of a facility, the YMCA, through the Minister's Department, should have been informed of the sports capital grant scheme.  It should have been given assistance to make an application.  That is where the system falls down.  It is my belief, whether right or wrong, that a school such as Wesley College is given an in to apply for grants by being able to link up with the local club.  Given the abundance of facilities Wesley College has, there was no justification for it qualifying.  If the YMCA badly needed facilities, it should have been given them or it should certainly have been brought down the path in applying for them, encouraged and given the support it needed to apply for them.  It comes back to my point about carrying out an audit.  </p> <p>  The other question I asked was about the figure of 50.7%.  I know that the Minister said 50% of schools qualified.  Was it 50.7% of the overall funding available?  If so, that is an absolute disgrace, given that the scheme was set up primarily to target disadvantaged areas.</p></speech>

Perhaps she is not.  They were held throughout the country to inform people of the grants available.  To say they were not informed is a little unfair on the officials and others who promoted the scheme.  The grants were widely advertised and will be advertised more widely in the future.  In the next year, when we open the next grant allocation process, we will probably advertise more widely.  We will probably place advertisements in the newspapers and ask the Department of Education and Skills to write to all schools to inform them in case there is a gap which the Deputy has identified, but I am not sure there is because 2,000 applications is a lot.  The YMCA applied because the rule was that it had to have a partner in order to apply.  It was a good match.  If any school wanted to apply, it also had to involve a club.  It was a good arrangement.</p> <p>  On golf clubs, we need to be careful.  The Deputy has made a good and fair point about rich clubs getting money.  If that is what is happening, the issue should be looked at very carefully in the review.  It is, however, a little easy to brand golf as a rich man's sport, in which case the Deputy would be making a good point, but it is not exclusively a rich man's sport.</p></speech>

The Deputy can come back in as often as she likes.  There are many golf clubs with a small membership.</p><p>Golf is played by huge numbers of children around the country in circumstances which are not ones of grandeur or richness or anything of that sort.  They just enjoy the game.  Those children should be helped and encouraged.  Golf should not be branded in a certain way.  If children in disadvantaged areas are playing golf, which they can and do, they should be helped.  The Deputy has a good case about rich golf clubs.  Perhaps they should not be helped unless they are doing a lot for the community.  I am not sure that some of those which the Deputy has branded as elite are not actually doing quite a lot for the community.  It is something we will look at.</p></speech>

We would not have been considered a wealthy family.  She worked very hard all her life.  She took up golf in her 50s.  That decision 20 years ago gave that woman a new lease of life.  Are we now being told that people like her and so many others should not receive help?  In the rural parish in Kerry from which I come, most of the lads who play golf are building labourers - carpenters and blocklayers.  They are not the white-collar professionals that people sometimes stereotype golfers as being.  Golf has a huge role in our communities and in society in terms of sport.</p></speech>

It was not possible for the sports capital programme to happen every year.  It was abandoned in 2008.  The Fine Gael-led Government that included the Labour Party reintroduced it for 2012.  We had programmes again in 2014 and 2015.  There was no programme in 2016.  We had a programme in 2017.  It was hugely oversubscribed, partially because of the overall improvement in the macroeconomic situation and the ability of clubs not just to raise funds, but to be able to plan for the future again.  It was indicative of an improving situation overall.  What also happened was, because of that level of oversubscription, we felt that we had to take extraordinary measures to try to address the huge demands that were there.  We had 2,320 applications totalling &euro;155 million in requests for funding, but we only had &euro;30 million at our disposal.  I make no apology for the work that I and the Minister, to his huge credit, did in terms of getting that money for those clubs.  Which clubs in the Deputy's constituency would she tell that we should not have had that money?  How many of the clubs in County Louth would she tell that we should not have doubled up the money and that they should not have received funding?</p></speech>

Every application was adjudicated on by the very dedicated officials working in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They were deemed to be either valid or invalid.  The breakdown was roughly 80% to 20%, which was a big improvement from the 52% to 48% breakdown we had just a few short years ago in 2012.  After that, each application was given a certain number of points based on the published criteria set out by the Department.  Under those criteria, four different levels of disadvantage are considered.  This is linked to the Pobal deprivation index.  Depending on where an applicant is on the Pobal deprivation is, points will be allocated to their application.  This was applied directly to all applicants.  The score which the applicants got was then used in a formula, which also reflected the amount of valid funding sought by the applicants.  Using that formula, a recommended allocation was arrived at.  That was the exactly the figure which was allocated to those sports capital programme applicants.  There was no interference from the Minister of myself.  There could not have been a fairer way of doing this.  When we cast our minds back to the way in which it used to be done in the past, this was a completely new departure which was very positive for the sports capital programme.</p> <p>  As I said, every single valid applicant under the local aspect of the sports capital programme received funding based entirely on the points they received and the amount they sought.  I do not know how any Minister could have done it any more fairly than that.  It is so easy for people to say that &euro;150,000 was allocated to the Minister's backyard.  There were applicants in his backyard that did not get through the appeals system as well.  There were four invalid applications in Kerry for which appeals were sought and none of them received funding.</p><p>One of them was close to my office, in the next village over in Milltown.  It was a primary school which was found to be invalid.  There is another, Camp United, where a man who works with me is heavily involved.  They were told in black and white that they were invalid.  Another school up the road, Faha national school, was also invalid.  I would have loved to see all these get funding but they did not because there was no interference from the Minister.  Another application in Kerry, Scoil Phobal Sliabh Luachra, also did not get funding because it was invalid.  That is a black and white matter.  Officials went through the review process, for the first time, which was progress, to ensure that we did not make mistakes and stand over them as happened in the past.  We acknowledge that mistakes can be made, and we should be thorough and ensure that there is no overinterpretation or false interpretation of our rules.  That happened, 148 applicants applied for the review process, and 35 got through.  None of it was through ministerial intervention.  The list was given to us, we approved it, and there were no changes.</p><p> The cheap efforts made in recent weeks to implicate one Minister or another as having interfered in this review process have been pathetic to see when what actually happened was the most progressive sports capital programme in its history going back to 1998.  It stands up to scrutiny.  There is nothing to see here in terms of the conspiracy theories I have heard about one intervention or another.  How we did this was good work for the sports capital programme and I would stand over it any day of the week because I think what we did was fair.  The applicants were awarded on the merits of their applications and for no other reasons.</p></speech>

There is a wider issue.  We are about to publish a very comprehensive sports policy document.  The responsibility goes beyond the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the sports capital programme to provide funding and programmes for sport and participation in Ireland.  It is a discussion we need to have and it is something that we are actively pursuing.  It is very important that we have more input from local authorities and that the local sports partnerships, who do excellent work, would have a bigger role in facilitating greater involvement in sport throughout the country.  There is a role for other Departments too, including Education and Science, Health, Housing, Planning and Local Government, and Children and Youth Affairs.  There could be a collaborative approach on which they could all work with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure that this would happen.  We are always looking to improve the sports capital programme.  We recognise its huge value and always strive to make it better.  Any application process that involves almost 2,500 very complex applications from all over the country will naturally result in examples where people are disappointed, where they may not get the amount they sought, or where applicants are unsuccessful.  However, the vast majority of applicants to this round have been very happy with their outcome.  For the first time ever, we were able to give funding to everyone who was valid under the local scheme and for the top two thirds who were valid under the regional scheme.  That is 1,800 clubs and organisations, which is an enormous achievement.</p></speech>

In a previous career, I was a teacher in a school where there was no funding or one could not apply for sports capital funding as a school.  That was changed a few years ago, which was a good move.  It meant that the facilities are available 12 hours a day, that is, they do not close at 4 p.m. when the school closes.  Schools got better facilities, the children who were at the schools got better facilities and it also benefited local clubs.  In response to the controversy of whether it is a private or public school, schools should be able to tie up with local clubs regardless.  It should then be open to every person in the community to join whatever clubs are linked up with the school and benefit from the facilities.  I want to record my support for the continuation of that.  There must always be fine-tuning and reviews must be undertaken, but it is important that schools facilities would be eligible for sports capital funding and that they would, in turn, make them available for their local clubs and organisations.  That is a better use of facilities and money, better value for money and should continue.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and the officials explain a system that, thankfully, after 30 years, is now open, transparent and fair.  I remember when the lottery was launched 30 years ago.  I returned from Australia and saw what lottery funding could do and applied on behalf of my local soccer club.  I was the second in the file to apply from a local soccer club.  I remember coming to Dublin and we were told in the bar that we were getting money for the club.  We were delighted but there was no huge application process at the time.  Things have changed and I am delighted.  I have seen other Governments where Ministers delivered ten times more for their constituents as what Dublin might receive.  I want to record that I am delighted the process has changed, that it has been taken out of the political domain and that we can all make our submissions.  I thank the officials for the work they have done.  It has established a template for the future of fairness, openness and transparency.</p></speech>

Senator O'Mahony referred to the large-scale scheme.  This is something that will be put in place for projects that will typically require a higher level of State funding than the &euro;150,000 available under the local scheme or the &euro;200,000 under the regional scheme, which are available under the sports capital programme.  We hope to invite expressions of interest in the near future.  We are also looking to involving the national governing bodies heavily in that process also so that we may have a strategic approach to planning our large-scale infrastructure.  We have a provision of more than &euro;100 million for that in coming years.  While that is a lot of money, in the context of large-scale projects it is not a huge amount, so we must be very careful about how we spend it and how it is distributed.  I hope that it will be moving for the summer.  I am very anxious to get it moving, as is the Minister, Deputy Ross, because we have a huge backlog of large-scale schemes that require investment as a result of the overall situation over the past decade.</p> <p>  For clarity, there is a 30 hour a week licence agreement requirement on schools facilities being open to the public.  That is something that works very well as it ensures that projects that otherwise would not have happened at all do happen because of the school involvement.  The schoolchildren get the benefit of it during the day and the wider public gets the benefit of it at night, regardless of whether they go to that school or whether it is fee-paying.  It is non-discriminatory.  That is something that is often overlooked.</p> <p>  Senator Feighan asked about national governing bodies.  It is a matter for the individual national governing bodies in the context of the whole island or the Republic and Northern Ireland.  I think we have 45 all-island national governing bodies.</p><p>The Irish rugby team is the prime example of one such body that works well.  Again, there are sensitivities and issues surrounding this sometimes.  There are various reasons people do not go down that route.  We need to be respectful of everyone involved in that discussion.  Sport Ireland is willing to work with everyone regardless of circumstances.</p><p> Reference was made to facilities to be used in this jurisdiction for events that might be taking place in Northern Ireland.  That is a matter for the people involved.  Certainly, I do not know of anyone who has not been willing to make their facilities available.  As a result of the sports capital programme, we have been able to build up our infrastructure to be world class in some cases, and that is positive.</p><p> A question was asked about the Commonwealth Games, an issue that has been raised many times.  From a sporting perspective, the games represent another avenue for athletes and a big stage on which to perform.  In that sense the opportunity helps in the development of athletes.  Some of our Northern Ireland based athletes have the benefit of European, world and Commonwealth competition whereas other athletes representing Ireland only compete at European and world level.  There is a dimension to that.  Obviously, we are not part of the Commonwealth, so it is something around which there are sensitivities.  It is more than simply about sports.</p><p> The Vice Chairman raised a question about the sports capital programme, and the Minister answered it.  We are looking to move to an annual basis because it gives certainty to clubs.  It would probably reduce the level of oversubscription.  Since we have been unable to run an annualised sports capital programme in recent years, we encounter organisations applying even when they are not ready because they are unsure whether there will be another round for two years.  If we can give clubs and those at the coalface an opportunity to plan better, that would be better.  Certainly, an annualised scheme would be good.  It would also help phased development rather than have everyone putting in for everything all at the one time.  Clubs could choose to do phased development.  That would make it easier on the Department in matching the expectations.  It is a goal for us and we are very much on track.  We have a 2018 programme and I am confident that we will have a 2019 programme.  That would mean successive programmes for 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Let us keep that going in the future.</p><p> The question of disadvantage was raised.  More than 1,000 of the 1,700 clubs were from disadvantaged areas.  We have four categories relating to disadvantage: not disadvantaged, disadvantaged, moderately disadvantaged, and extremely disadvantaged.  We use the Pobal HP deprivation index.  Previously, the programme was based on the CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes.  This is more targeted and focused and it takes in more data in determining the level of disadvantage.</p><p> Deputy Troy mentioned a review.  Each sports capital programme has been reviewed upon conclusion.  This assessment is not any different in terms of the pros and cons, what could be done better and what is working well.  The consultation process with the recipients and the applicants is feeding into that process as well and that is healthy.</p><p> Deputy Troy asked about Longford-Westmeath.  The local sports partnership would have been informed and would have informed all its registered bodies.  Every club that was registered on the online sports capital register, OSCAR, used by the sports capital division would have been informed.  Moreover, the national governing bodies would have been informed in respect of Deputy Troy's constituency.  In future, we will ensure that each public representative is made aware of the details.  Certainly, there was a good turn-out.  We had a full room in Galway.  We are looking to try to meet as many people as we can because these are the people at the coalface.  They show up.  They have been through the system and know how it works.  We have received some good suggestions following the engagements and these will feed into the next programme.</p><p> I do not like the phrase "minority sports".  Each person's respective sport is the most important sport for that person.  Everyone involved in sport, especially the volunteers, should be commended on what they do for their country and communities.</p><p> As I said earlier, every valid application received funding under the local scheme and two thirds were funded under the regional scheme.  I have before me a breakdown of the information on who got what by sport and I can circulate it afterwards.  The information relating to who got what is already on the website.  All applications are on the website but there is a breakdown of who got what in more than 50 sports categories.  The amount received was directly proportionate to the score and the amount sought.  I heard someone complaining &ndash; the Deputy has left now - about &euro;600.  If we were to give &euro;10,000 to a club that looked for &euro;600, then we would be before the Committee of Public Accounts.  It seems that by giving what clubs have asked for or giving the amounts merited by the application proportionate to the amount sought, we are the bad guys all of a sudden.  It seems we cannot win.  We have tried to be entirely fair in how we have allocated the funding.  I can circulate the figures.  We have a list of everyone who got funding.  I can give committee members all of the information on all the sports, the total amounts they got and the number of grants that made up the total.  We can circulate the information afterwards.</p></speech>

We had duplication because of a simultaneous Committee of Public Accounts event.  I apologise for not being here for most of the session.</p> <p>  I wish to deal with two issues.  The Minister described disadvantage.  It is right that we look at things from the bottom up.  Sport plays an important role in all of our lives.  These grants are particularly important.  I understand the methodology for determining disadvantage.  However, there is also another disadvantage that sometimes does not get counted.  How does the Department consider new areas?  These areas are really collections of houses.  Often, there is little disposable income because of mortgages and so on.  It is difficult to try to build facilities from scratch where people are trying to organise community building.  Is there any mapping of needs as we develop new communities with regard to the provision of sports?  Most of our facilities have come about by virtue of raffles and various fundraising activities.  It is incredibly difficult to build everything from scratch.  How is that considered in particular?</p> <p>  The point about the optics has been made.  I am referring to the perception of assistance from the inside.  I understand there is a process and that the process is rigorous, but damage is done when there is the appearance of assistance from the inside, even if it is only in filling out forms.  What can be done to ensure this process is as publicly inclusive as possible?  What can be done to ensure this is the case even more than has been the case to date?  I realise workshops are carried out, but the very fact that forms are not properly filled in and so on tends to suggest that some people are better able to cope with the process than others.</p></speech>

All we can do is be as fair as possible, which we were.  We cannot control what people will say about it.  We feel there was not a more transparent and fairer way of doing sports capital than the way we did it in 2017.  It could not possibly have been fairer.  There are two things an applicant can do to ensure it does not have invalidation in the future and has as good a chance as possible to get all the relevant information into its application.  The workshops we had prior to the closure of the 2017 programme were very helpful.  There was huge attendance at them.  To their great credit, the officials went through the application process and how points are scored.  It is something we envisage repeating and we might have more of them for the next time.  We will give everyone the best possible chance to have the best possible application.  We did it already and it worked well.  I hope we can repeat and intensify it.  Never again will we have a situation where people will be invalidated without a second chance.  The weakest aspect of the sports capital programme has been that clubs were excluded on a technicality such as not ticking a box or not putting a folio number in a certain box or because the name on a bank statement did not correspond to the name of the club even though it is the bank statement of the trustees.  We want to try to avoid that scenario in the future.  In the 2018 round we envisage that when clubs make applications, if there are items of further information required, rather than just being invalidated as would have happened in the past, they will be written to and asked for particular items so their applications can be validated.  That is important.</p><p>While the Deputy was absent from the committee room, I spoke about collaborative approaches to sports and facilities planning and I referred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is a role to be played in terms of new developments and the provision of sports facilities.  It is something in the sports policy that we want to try to touch on.  It is important that we look at that, bearing in mind that technology is becoming more affordable such as AstroTurf, 3G and 4G pitches.  They are not as expensive as they used to be.  In a country where it rains for so many days in the year, green areas are really important.  AstroTurf and all-weather areas are hugely important for our children and all members of our community.  We can incorporate that into future housing policy.  It would be a very good day's work if we were to do that.</p><p>Deputy Troy asked about how the funding is distributed.  To move away from the years when Donegal or south Kerry, for example, got a disproportionate amount, what we have tried to do is have a system in place in which the money follows the people.  Based on census population figures for a county, the county receives a directly proportionate amount of the sports capital budget for distribution within that county.  Clubs get larger or smaller allocations depending on what points they score.  That is how it works.  The &euro;30 million was split into &euro;26 million and &euro;4 million for local and regional schemes.  That means the amount of funding that was available to each county ranged from 12% in Cavan to 56% of the overall value sought in Dublin.  That was with regard to valid applications.  When we got the increase in the budget, we were able to get &euro;56 million to distribute to all counties, which meant that Dublin's figure went up to in excess of &euro;15 million, even though &euro;13 million was valid at that stage.  There was funding to redistribute.  Dublin was the only county where 100% of the amount sought was available for distribution in the county.  Cavan went from 12% to 29%.  My county of Kerry went from 16% to 37%.  That happened because a portion of a larger amount of &euro;30 million was added on to &euro;25 million.  The surplus from Dublin was redistributed among the other 25 counties on a <i>per capita</i>basis, excluding Dublin.  That is exactly how we arrived at the allocation to each county.  What each county got was distributed based purely on the points that each application scored.  That is how it was done.  There could not have been a fairer way of doing it so long as we stuck with the per county <i>per capita</i>system.</p><p>There are flaws with the per county <i>per capita</i>system.  One of them is that when we are dealing with some counties, there is a heavy level of oversubscription, for example, in Cavan.  In Dublin, everyone who is valid gets whatever is looked for.  The points system does not count there because there is the full amount to meet the requirement.  With the regional scheme, we had &euro;4 million to meet about &euro;8.5 million worth of valid applications across 82 different applications.  That is the top two thirds of applicants.  We could not spread that &euro;4 million across &euro;13.5 million worth of applications.  It would have been spread too thinly.  What we did there was based on the points.  We had a national league table and we applied the formula in the same way we did internally in each county to determine the outcome for each applicant under the regional scheme.  It has merits in that a club is not getting less because of what county it is in or as a result of the level of oversubscription in a particular county.  It also means the allocation will always be reflective of the score an applicant gets.  That was the case for 25 out of 26 counties in the local scheme.  One of the flaws is that some counties might not have received anything in the regional scheme because they were not in the top two thirds of applications in terms of scoring.  It is worth considering whether it is a way of doing the future round for the local scheme as well as the regional one.  There are arguments for and against that.  The per county <i>per capita</i>system was introduced in the first place to stop some counties getting more than others based on who was doing the administration of the grants.  There is no system that seems to be perfect but we are trying to find the fairest way and I think what we did this time around based on what we were dealing with was as fair as we could possibly have been under the circumstances.</p></speech>

I wanted to come back in briefly because the Minister, Deputy Ross, made a charge against me and I wanted to clarify a point I made in my opening statement.  I thank the Minister for acknowledging the eight representations I made on behalf of the clubs in my constituency.  I appreciate that.  I looked very quickly on <i>oireachtas.ie</i>and found that I have raised this seven times in the past 12 months by way of written and oral questions to the Minister of State.  It is not for me to adjudicate.  The Minister of State said a process was adhered to.  I accept that but the perception is that it was not and the Minister of State did not help that perception when he put a tweet up a morning or two after the school received that funding.  If the process delivered that result, the question I asked the Minister of State is relevant.  Does he think we need to change the process?  I outlined the facilities that are available in that school and I outlined some of the other applications that were not eligible for funding.  The reason I asked the Minister of State a question about the point he made in a radio interview last week is because there were not enough applicants from disadvantaged areas in Dublin for the money that was available.  That is not right.  That is the point I was making when I asked about changing the process.  I am sorry if the Minister of State was offended.  He is very sensitive.  It is not for me to adjudicate on whether he influenced it.  Let the wider public adjudicate on whether the Minister of State had a role to play in it.  I do not care that much about it.  What I do care about, and it is the reason I asked about it on seven occasions in the past 12 months, is ensuring that less well-off, disadvantaged clubs get the support they deserve.  Unfortunately, on this occasion they did not, with the best will in the world, according to the Minister of State's adjudication on the matter.</p></speech>

Every valid application under the local scheme in Dublin got funding.  Not only did they get funding but they got 100% of what they sought and what was valid.  Other counties would kill for that sort of a regime.  In my county, we had 37% of the amount sought available and we distributed it proportionately based on the points system.</p><p>However, Dublin had 100% available to it.</p><p> It is up to clubs to apply for the scheme.  That aspect has to be improved as part of the overall network and system of planning.  As I said earlier, local authorities and other Departments need to become more involved in providing facilities.  It should not only be a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because sport, physical activity, recreation and participation have far broader consequences for all of our communities.  Within sports policy I am keen to emphasise that requirement and I believe it would be progressive.</p></speech>

There was standing room only in some.  For the 2018 programme, we need to place greater emphasis on the workshops.  They were a great success for the 2017 programme.  We should co-ordinate more closely with the partnerships already working with disadvantaged areas and target elements of the community with lower participation.  That would be a good way to ensure the Department has a broader spread in terms of the level of disadvantage represented in the applications.  Over 1,000 disadvantaged clubs received funding out of the 1,700 applications - well over half of the applications - under the local scheme.</p></speech>

When I was making a representation to him, I inadvertently wrote on behalf of a club that had not actually applied.  In fairness, he acknowledged that he was examining the application.

I will be very brief.  Sport Ireland places NGBs at the centre of its work.  It is a strategic priority.  We work with NGBs to ensure they are very strong, fit for purpose and in compliance with good governance.  Many of them are now on the road to compliance with the community and voluntary code also.  We also ensure they have financial and taxation policies in place.  We place a huge emphasis on child protection, risk management and all of those critical elements to which every governing body must sign up to ensure they have good systems in place.</p> <p>  Governing bodies provide the framework for the delivery of sport across the spectrum from grassroots all the way up to high performance.  They are a vital component for delivering on the world stage.  This morning, we allocated &euro;1.8 million to our carded athletes while earlier this year we announced &euro;10.8 million for our core national governing bodies, not counting the three field sport bodies, namely, the FAI, GAA and IRFU.  We also allocate through NGBs &euro;600,000 for the women's sport programme and &euro;7 million for high performance sports.  Through the Department, we were able to secure an extra &euro;380,000 to meet some of our critical key areas which needed funding in 2018.  These include the World Equestrian Games and Eisenhower trophy, which will be held this year, as well as the World Hockey Championships and events like that which are a real priority for us.  We were at a high of &euro;13.8 million in funding for our NGB sector but we are now down at &euro;10.8 million.</p> <p>  Obviously, we place a huge emphasis on increasing support for the NGBs which deliver for us right across the spectrum.  They deliver real quality programmes on participation.  We have seen increases in every aspect of Ireland's participation in sport.  NGBs offer a wide diversity of activity and that choice is there.  We also fund the local sports partnership and will be making announcements in that regard with the Minister tomorrow.  All of the sporting organisations we fund definitely provide the taxpayer with value for money.  As the bar is being raised in terms of compliance, there is a critical need to invest in NGBs as we go forward.  They need staff and to have the right people in place to drive organisations forward.  They need to ensure they keep volunteers involved and comply fully with all of the regulations.  They must provide leadership in sport.</p> <p>  Critically, NGBs need more core funding.  We have seen no increase in high performance funding since 2011 and our competitors are probably losing ground as more countries come into the high performance space and invest more and more.  It is a critical piece.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say this morning that one of the things he wanted to do was increase capital funding for governing bodies.  That would be critical for high performance sports leading into Tokyo to provide equipment, including boats.  There was a huge impact in 2012 when the Department provided funding to our rowers and sailors for boats and those were our two medal winning sports.  It is also a critical piece.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland and governing bodies have benefitted from dormant accounts funding at a rate of over &euro;2 million per year.  That is driven by our own Department working hard with us to ensure systems are in place to allocate that funding and make the case for governing bodies in sport.  It is money well spent and we get a great return on the investment.  We commend the work NGBs do to deliver for sport in the country.</p></speech>

We are delighted to attend.  We are here in our capacity as representatives of Irish sport.  There are 70 national governing bodies of sport which are members of the federation along with 28 local sport partnerships, or LSPs.  We were asked here today to speak about minority sport, but we do not believe there is such a thing in Ireland.  We were asked to outline the benefit all sport and physical activity and the NGBs and LSPs which contribute to modern Ireland's vibrant and diverse sporting culture.  Sport and physical activity is proven to stimulate volunteerism and promote diversity and inclusion.  We are lucky in Ireland to be represented around the world by some world-class sporting ambassadors.  To produce these sporting stars, we must invest in young talent, coach education and systems or pathways which allow them to maximise their potential.</p><p> At this stage, Irish Sport believes we need the following things.  We need investment in our sporting organisations to allow them to maximise commercial and other revenue-generating activities and deal with the increased regulatory challenges such as the GDPR and child protection.  Members may be surprised to know that up to 15% of the funds allocated to many of our national governing bodies are consumed by the cost of complying with the various regulatory requirements even before any funds are put into the sport itself.  If we want to increase participation, international research has repeatedly found that it is people, programmes and targeted marketing and communications that make the real difference and not just facilities.  I ask members to think of how the awareness of rugby, for example, is assisted by the significant investment from Vodafone or indeed about the change in perception of ladies Gaelic football since Lidl became a partner.  We have a vibrant sporting community but we do need assistance to promote the sporting opportunities that are available - never mind to develop new ones.</p><p> On sports capital, funding for sport is always welcomed by our members but funding for facilities should not be at the expense of current funding and support for people and programmes.  The investment should be strategic.  Why continue to invest in individual projects nationwide in the absence of an audit of the facilities we already have?  Our members would like to see better regional multi-sport facilities.  We would ask that VAT exemption be extended to sporting equipment, particularly equipment for people with disabilities such as hand cycles and sports wheelchairs.  We would like to encourage private giving and philanthropy to sporting bodies by bringing in the similar tax exemptions available through giving to other sectors such as art and education.  We believe the public good delivered by sport is more than comparable.</p><p> Meaningful investment in sport by Government only began in 1989, which is nearly 30 years.  We are 25 years behind the UK and some 20 years behind Australia.  Now is the time to embrace the learnings from those 30 years so that we ensure that in 30 years' time, sport is delivering even more for Ireland and her people.  To conclude, I know that the members of the committee are well aware of the huge contribution that sport can make to so many areas of Irish life: improving the nation's health, reducing anti-social behaviour, bringing communities together and, of course, boosting our national pride when our sporting heroes represent us with distinction.  In the context of the overall budget available to Government, the ask is not very large but the effect of a substantial increase in funding, such as the doubling over seven years which the Taoiseach set out as an aspiration last year, would be immense.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to engage with the Members of the Oireachtas at all times in respect of the sports capital programme and funding for minority sports.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's current high-level goal for sport is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation and by supporting high-performance sport and the provision of facilities.  We strongly believe that Tennis Ireland supports this goal effectively but probably a bit too quietly.</p> <p>  Tennis Ireland is a 32-county governing body.  We have just under 45,000 registered players with an additional figure of approximately 30,000 players who play recreationally or through programmes such as Parks Tennis, which has operated for over 40 years.  We have a strong network of almost 200 clubs nationally.  Unusually for a sport, we have an equal ratio of male and female participation.  We are a sport that actively promotes lifelong participation in sport.  We have people who play from the age of four or five up into their eighties and sometimes even into their nineties.  On average, our players play 2.3 times per week so they are making a very significant contribution to the health and well-being of our nation.  Tennis Ireland won the best national governing body, NGB, award at the 2018 CARA national inclusion awards in recognition of its Enjoy Tennis programme, which caters for over 800 people with a range of disabilities, and was a finalist in the NGB of the year category at the recent Irish sport industry awards.  We are finalising a new strategy that focuses on participation, coaching, performance, competition, visibility, commercial and governance.</p> <p>  Our income has been relatively stable over the past number of years but it is important to note that like many other sports and unlike the GAA, soccer or rugby, we do not get income from TV rights.  We do not get major grant-aid funding from international federations.  The only other area of funding that is available to us which can be exploited is around increasing commercial and philanthropic income.  We are very grateful for the funding we get from Sport Ireland.  There has been a lot of debate today around the sports capital programme.  Three things allow the environment for good sports development to happen.  The first one is facilities, namely, places to play.  The second is the type of programmes we have such as competition programmes, participation programmes like summer camps or coaching programmes to try to get people to play the sport.  The third element is people such as volunteers or coaches.  Governing bodies play a major role in those two other areas in terms of people, training and supporting volunteers and through the delivery and development of programmes.</p> <p>  Regarding what the challenge for us as a sport, and probably for all the sports represented here, if I look back on the funding we secured from Government, I can see that our core funding in 2008 was &euro;436,000.  In 2018, it is &euro;353,000.  That is a fall of 20%.  If I look at our performance funding in 2008, I can see that it is &euro;190,000.  In 2018, it is &euro;175,000, which is a fall of 8%.  That fall took place in a very challenging environment for our sport and other sports in terms of increased expectations from our players, including-  performance players or just players at clubs; volunteers; parents; the media; and Government in terms of safeguarding, governance, the GDPR, etc.  They are all really important things and we fully support those regulations but they have put a huge strain on governing bodies in terms of meeting the day-to-day costs of compliance with those regulations while also trying to develop our sports.  We appeal to Government to not just look at capital funding.  We are very grateful for that but we also feel very strongly, as Mr. Treacy outlined, that there is a need to increase funding for sport to support our performance athletes but also to help us help clubs and participants around the country.</p></speech>

The support we have received is critical to our sport's functioning.  As a niche sport represented by 100 clubs on the island of Ireland, we require further investment to maintain the levels of participation and performance we are currently delivering.  We are very proud to say that we have three current world champions and two Olympic silver medalists - the O'Donovan brothers.  Unfortunately, at this point, they will be trying to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics in boats that are four years old.  To be honest, this is a huge challenge.  We applied for funding through the sports capital grant.  Unfortunately, even though our bid was valid, we did not receive funding.  These are some of the challenges that all of the sports face in terms of the limitations around financial resources.  I appeal for further support.  I know that Sport Ireland has been very vociferous in supporting us in that area.  Increasing the levels of funding because they are still below 2008 levels, as Mr. Fahey from Tennis Ireland pointed out, is one of our key asks.</p> <p>  The second issue is the desperate need for funding for sports equipment.  The third issue concerns the ability of all the NGBs to contribute to the sports capital grant criteria.  We know intimately what clubs can have the most significant effect on our sport and where they are.  Having eligibility criteria within the sports capital grant, as we outlined to the Minister this morning, would be critical.  We all know the huge role sport plays in our nation's health.  We believe any further investment in sport is money well spent.</p></speech>

We work with the four branches, Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster, and external stakeholders, including Sport Ireland.  Badminton has been an Olympic sport since 1992, in which time we have produced three Olympians.</p> <p>  Badminton Ireland has more than 12,500 registered members playing the sport across 350 clubs.  Our sport is almost entirely gender balanced, with 49% of our members being female.  We cater for all ages, with 5,000 of our members aged 24 years and over and a further 5,800 under 18.  Badminton offers a family friendly environment for players of all ages, from as young as eight years to over 80.  We run a range of programmes and events throughout the season, from schools' events to master's tournaments.  We invest almost 60% of our annual income in development activities and a further 20% in events which cater for players of all levels.  However, like all national governing bodies, the increased administration required to ensure compliance with the governance code, the general data protection regulation and the Children First legislation has put a strain on our financial model and we expect this pressure to increase in the coming months and years. </p> <p>  The sports capital expenditure programme has been hugely beneficial for Badminton Ireland.  Through the sports capital expenditure programme in 2014, we were able to implement a schools initiative called Shuttle-Time.  The programme provides training, resources and equipment for the sport of badminton for schools, all free of charge.  It has been hugely successful since its launch, reaching more than 44,000 children and 270 schools in its first year.  That number continues to grow and has reached more than 59,000 pupils across primary and post-primary schools.  We recently launched a new initiative in conjunction with local sport partnerships to bring the Shuttle-Time programme to DEIS schools in a number of areas.  With growing concern about obesity levels in Ireland, particularly among children, we believe extending the reach of badminton further through the school system could help to improve activity levels for all.</p></speech>

We have clubs all over the country.  I acknowledge and thank Sport Ireland for the support it has given to us up to now.  For the past few years we have received &euro;63,000 in funding from it, half of which goes towards employing one member of staff, while the rest is used to run the association and assist with the cost of international travel.  As a committee member mentioned, sending people away to compete in international competitions is expensive and we can only give a very small amount from the grant aid we receive.</p> <p>  Snooker is watched by millions of people throughout the world.  The world championships will begin in a couple of weeks in Sheffield when there will be huge interest in the sport.  One of the disappointments is that we do not receive enough recognition when we win world or European championships.  We have won European and world championships for many years, but the players do not receive any recognition, apart from us.  That is a difficulty.  Snooker is not an Olympic sport, but it is included in the world games.  It does not seem to receive the recognition it needs.</p> <p>  The problems we face include trying to retain volunteers.  It is very difficult to get and keep people involved in the sport.  We struggle all the time to get volunteers.  We have tried to increase participation by involving schools, but one of the difficulties is we cannot move a snooker table around the country.  We have been trying to move fold-up tables to schools and have afternoon programmes whereby we can have three or four fold-up tables in schools to let the children become involved.  Perhaps they might then get involved in the sport later.</p> <p>  The difficulties we face include the fact that most of the clubs we use are commercial enterprises.  It is a business for the club owners and how we get them involved with the sports capital programme is a problem.  As an association, we do not own any club or property; therefore, getting funding through the sports capital programme is a problem for us.  A lot of people throughout the country play snooker, but they are not all involved with the association; therefore, we try to get the clubs to involve them to help us.</p></speech>

I will do my best to summarise what we submitted.  It was already difficult to cut it down to five minutes.</p> <p>  Ours is a minority sport, with approximately 4,000 players in Ireland.  However, we pride ourselves on being part of a family of more than 20 million throughout the world who play judo.  As one would expect from one of the world's most inclusive sports, judo players in Ireland range across the full spectrum of ages, from toddlers to players in their 70s, and we provide opportunities for them to be players, coaches, referees and administrators.</p> <p>  As the national governing body for the sport, we have received &euro;70,000 as a core grant from Sport Ireland.  Like all other governing bodies, the grant covers costs associated with administration, participation programmes, coach development, hosting events, implementing strategic plans and the employment of professional staff.  In 2017 we also received &euro;4,000 under the women in sport programme and &euro;45,000 in high performance grant money.  The money is very much appreciated and we believe it is used to full advantage in our quest for increased participation and excellence.  The Irish Judo Association could not survive without this financial support.  As an association, we raise further funds through club and membership fees, which money is quickly accounted for.  An insurance bill of &euro;28,000 will soon eat into reserves and we are not on our own in that regard.</p> <p>  Like most other minority sports, we find it very difficult to attract major sponsors to assist in the development of our sport.  The task is made more difficult by not having the personnel available to devote their full time to the pursuit of this revenue.  In the last year we have attended conferences that encourage sports organisations such as ours to attract what is termed philanthropic money, an issue that was mentioned.  It requires an initial investment and man hours, but, unfortunately, we are unable to provide either.  The money may be available, but we cannot access it.</p> <p>  The Irish Judo Association has one full-time and one-part time employee whose workload is already at saturation levels.  Ours is a voluntary sports organisation.  The board of directors and the executive are made up entirely of volunteers.  I am a teacher; the treasurer is a chartered accountant, while the secretary is an employee of a major multinational communications company.  We give of our free time because we love the sport, as do many other volunteers throughout the country.</p> <p>  Governance in sport is very topical.  As an association, we have spent a huge amount of time in an effort to implement best practice.  We find that we have to expend significant time and energy in implementing the code of governance with limited resources.  It is an extra cost which we are finding difficult to absorb.  This has resulted in staff and volunteers working across multiple roles.  Increased funding would ease the burden, but it is only part of the solution.  As a national governing body, we recognise that with funding, particularly funding from the State, comes responsibility.  We know and welcome this.  Accountability and transparency are essential in any partnership.  In my submission I mentioned the Children Act 2015, with which we are fully compliant.</p> <p>  Any increase in funding would allow us to pursue our main aim of developing the sport throughout the country.  We would dearly love to be able to employ development officers to promote our sport in schools and develop links between schools and local clubs.  During the first session of the meeting we heard a lot about links between schools and clubs.  It is only through such partnerships and pathways that a sport like ours will flourish successfully.  Partnerships are essential, be it the partnership between the national governing body and Sport Ireland in the promotion of the sport from grass roots level through to high performance level, the partnership between a school and a local club, or the partnership among clubs at provincial level to provide a pathway for players to advance into the national squad in the hope of one day representing the country at the Olympic Games.</p> <p>  An increase in funding would also enable us to provide a higher level of quality competition which would help to attract more national and international players.</p><p>Last weekend, on Saturday, 24 March, we hosted the Irish Open at the National Indoor Arena.  It was a huge success, with players from Ireland, the United Kingdom and many other European countries competing.  We received a grant of &euro;2,500 from Sport Ireland which was greatly appreciated.  It paid for the hire of the facility.  We have a great indoor arena, but it has to be paid for by the national bodies.  Hosting such events exposes our players to quality competition and better prepares them for international competitions.  Members may have heard of Lisa Kearney who qualified for the London Olympic Games.  In that regard, the cost was in the region of &euro;300,000, which was made up of &euro;100,000 in technical support provided by Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland because Lisa is from Belfast; a further &euro;100,000 in high performance funding, with the remainder coming from a variety of other sources, including fund-raising.  We have three athletes who are in a position to qualify for the Olympic Games in Japan in 2020.  We have received &euro;45,000 in high performance funding this year.  We are delighted with it, but it highlights the difficulty with which a minority sport has to cope in striving for excellence on the world stage.  There is the same difficulty for our emerging talented players.  Each year the Irish Judo Association allocates &euro;30,000 towards the cost of this programme.  Players, aged 17 to 23 years, have to self-fund the majority of their activity, which, as the father of one of such player, I know only too well.  I am sometimes called Daddy Warbucks.  Sport Ireland provides funding at high performance level but not for emerging talent programmes at national governing body level.  We have an excellent working relationship with the Sport Ireland high performance unit and understand it has a finite amount of finances to manage.</p><p> The Irish Judo Association is a 32 county organisation and recognised by the Olympic Council of Ireland as the national governing body for the sport.  Reference was made to the Commonwealth Games, etc.  In the north of the country some players are affiliated to the Northern Ireland Judo Federation, NIJF, which is part of GB Judo.  The NIJF made a successful submission to Sport Northern Ireland to fund an emerging talent programme, for which it obtained almost &euro;1 million over five years.  Many of the players included in its programme are players with the Irish Judo Association.  As the money is government-funded, all judo players resident in the North are entitled to be part of the programme, irrespective of the national governing body to which they belong.  The programme is proving to be a great success and Irish players resident in the North are benefiting greatly from it.  As an association, we have to try to provide the same for players in the other 26 counties, but we do not have the finances to do so.  The Irish Judo Association and the NIJF have a great working relationship and long may it continue.   </p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity.  I will not repeat the points made about the value of sport.</p></speech>

I also apologise to the delegates for the delay in commencing this session, but we had to deal with other committee business first.  I thank them for being here and their opening statements.</p> <p>  As rightly stated by Ms O'Connor, sport is powerful in terms of mental and physical health well-being, in reducing anti-social behaviour, in team building, in terms of leadership and in boosting national pride, as witnessed two weekends ago when Ireland won the Grand Slam and our rowers won Olympic medals.  On many sporting occasions we all are proud to be Irish and don the green jersey.  The sports we are discussing are termed "minority sports", but that is not what they are.  All of the bodies represented are sports bodies.  The level of participation for some of them is higher than for others, but that may be because some of them have greater facilities, resources, numbers of training and development officers and greater potential to recruit new participants than others.  We invited the organisations to ask them what we, as a committee, could do to support them and what needed to be done at national level.  </p> <p>  I was disappointed to hear in the opening statement made by Rowing Ireland that, despite what had been stated previously, a valid application for capital funding had been refused and that this put in jeopardy our chances of competing at the next Olympic Games in a category in which we were successful at the most recent Olympic Games.  One would expect the areas to be prioritised for investment to be ones in which we were doing well.  On that point alone, it is a pity that we did not hold this session prior to the last one because had we done so, we would have had more questions to ask of the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. John Treacy.  He has outlined that funding was cut in 2007 but is now increasing.  Approximately &euro;10.8 million has been provided for 57 national governing bodies.  It is a very small amount.  From 2001 to date, &euro;150 million was provided in youth field sport grants for three large organisations, the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA.  While not wishing to diminish the work these organisations do, there is no fairness in the allocation of funding.  I hope that in saying this I will not annoy the IRFU, the FAI or the GAA.  In her opening statement Ms O'Connor said, "We were asked here today to speak about minority sports, but we do not believe there is such a thing in Ireland."  According to Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy, outgoing Ard Sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir of the GAA, the federation represents all Irish sports and while the big three can negotiate for themselves, it works with the federation as it believes in the power of all sports.  Unfortunately, the figures support the arguement that that is not the case.  My question for Mr. Treacy is how can we balance the figures and support development officers in the respective sports in order that participants can develop and excel.  I recently met a representative of Hockey Ireland who told me that it had eight development officers in the province of Ulster and only 1.5 in the Republic.  We are not at the races.  If we want to be at them and able to compete on the international stage - I accept that it is not all about competing and that participation is equally important - we need to accelerate the funding being provided for the respective sports bodies.  </p> <p>  I regret that we do not have greater time to engage with the bodies present, but I again thank their representatives for being here.</p></speech>

In 2007-08, when money was not available and we needed money to do various things, they helped the federation to help sport.  While I take the Deputy's point, Mr. Duffy, Mr. Philip Browne and Mr. John Daly believe in the collective power of sport.</p><p>We have asked them to help the rest of the sports but given their sheer size and where they stand in the pantheon of Irish sport they get to negotiate separately.  I think that is quite understandable but they are very much behind the collective.</p></speech>

I put that question out there.  The IRFU, the GAA and the FAI have the ability to generate huge resources from their gate sales and sponsorship that, to be fair, I do not think the respective sporting bodies before the committee today have.  I accept Sport Ireland can only allocate the funds based on what it receives but given the scarce resources should we be looking at-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.1125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Roddy Guiney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#U00300"><p>I am sorry to cut across the question but, first, we could look at some simpler things to fix.  As somebody who has recently joined the federation it strikes me that if we were building a new stadium we would hire people with expert knowledge such as architects, quantity surveyors and builders.  One of the things that could be done in sport - Mr. Adams referred to it also - is that while Sport Ireland does a terrific job - Mr. Treacy alluded to as well - and there is a depth of knowledge within all the national governing bodies, NGBs, yet when it comes to the allocation of sports capital funding and other grants the NGBs are not asked for their expert opinion and there is nobody better positioned in this country than they, in concert with Sport Ireland, to have a view on where money would be best spent.</p> <p>  A second issue that frustrates the NGBs came out this morning when we had a session with the Minister.  It is that it would not take an awful lot of investment to improve the situation.  The Taoiseach talked about doubling the funding for sport over the next six years.  Mr. Adams made a point which I reiterate that very small additional moneys provided to the NGBs would make a huge difference.  As he said today, if Rowing Ireland could get an extra 10% - he can correct me if I am wrong &ndash; it could double the participation and if it could get an extra 15% it could triple the level of participation.  As a group I do not think we are asking for an awful lot.  We do have a lot of knowledge within the collective and it should be brought to bear more on what happens in sport generally.  I will get off my soapbox but one of the things about the sports capital funding that comes up again and again with our members is that they are not asked for their opinion.</p> <p>  I will give an example of a very simple thing.  One of the NGBs said to me this morning that a club got a grant of &euro;70,000 in the previous round of sports capital funding, and it is not in good standing with its NGB.  The NGBs are being asked for more and more inputs, rightly so for sport, on things like Garda vetting, health and safety, child protection and data protection.  It would be a very simple ask to put into the sports capital application form a question on whether the club is in good standing with its NGB, and by that we mean whether it is observing all of its policies.  Clubs could be forced to get a letter from the NGB confirming that was the case.  A lot of small things could be done and the group of people we represent would be delighted if they were done.  It would be a start and it would look like people are taking us more seriously.</p></speech>

To go back on a historical point, when the cuts came in 2008 the Irish Sports Council at the time sat down with the three main field sports and, essentially, what we did was we asked them to take the first cut, which was 25%.  We spoke to them and negotiated with them and all three of them said "Yes".  What we were actually doing was safeguarding the other NGBs and the three main field sports went along with the policy decision Sport Ireland had made.  People were taking it on the chin.</p> <p>  What we really need to be doing is working with the collective NGBs.  We are putting more and more rules and regulations in place and it is a huge administrative burden for the governing bodies.  We want them to have very good corporate governance in place.  We want to have risk management in place.  We want to have all the financial procedures in place, which is critically important if one is investing taxpayers' money.  We need to resource governing bodies.  One of the things that we have been able to do is start putting in professional people in governing bodies and that has made a huge difference.  Now is the time to start reinvesting in the core NGBs so that we can grow them.  If we go back to this morning's discussion on the federation, a small amount of money will do a huge amount and will really add to the participation in a wide range of sports.  Not everyone wants to kick a football or throw a rugby ball.  There are lots of opportunities and going forward we really need to strengthen the NGBs so that they can deliver.  They are delivering and the local sports partnerships, LSPs, are helping them to deliver at local level as well.</p></speech>

I echo what Mr. Treacy said in terms of the GAA, rugby and the FAI.  I worked for the FAI for 15 years and it does fantastic work around the country.  I would not take funding from those sports.</p></speech>

I often say to my staff that they should not come to me with problems, they should come to me with solutions.  One of the solutions that should definitely be explored is the betting tax.  Currently, there is a 1% levy on all bets.  In 2016 approximately &euro;5 billion was bet on a range of activities.  A total of &euro;51 million was generated from the tax and all the money went to horse racing and greyhound racing.  I do not say we should take the money off them either but if there was a modest increase of even 0.5% - if it went from 1% to 1.5% - that would bring in &euro;25 million in funding.  We must remember that betting companies generate their revenue from sports such as tennis, golf and rowing, perhaps not all the time as they do not happen every Saturday or Sunday like football or rugby but during the Olympics and at other times.  Our sports are put at risk from those activities in terms of our integrity if a betting issue arises concerning a sport or an athlete and that can brand a sport.  We feel that is a very simple and easy way of raising a significant amount of funding.  We do not get TV rights.  We do not get major funding from international bodies such as UEFA or FIFA the way other sports do.  There is a very simple, clear way to go, and we would not be taking money away from horse racing or greyhound racing.  We can let them have what they are getting at this moment in time because racing is an important industry but it is a very simple and easy way of bringing additional funding to our sport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.1132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Leacy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#U01000"><p>When we get people onto committees first they are full of enthusiasm and then when they are told that they have to develop a strategic plan and be involved with all of the other appropriate governance issues they lose interest and disappear.  Minority sports would welcome any help they could get to encourage and help people to stay on committees and to assist with governance issues.  I hope something could be done in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.1133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1426" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#V00100"><p>I thank each of the governing bodies who have come in as well as Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport.  I was one of those who proposed this would happen.  I come from a background of involvement in the majority sports of Gaelic games and so on, but there is a huge need for support as the economy recovers.  I realise the problems faced by the sports council in that they cannot spread funding so thinly that everyone gets something because then nobody gets enough.  One also has the four-year cycle of the Olympics and everything else which needs support.  The facility we have provided everyone with today is the opportunity to highlight the issues.  As Richard said, we need to come up with solutions at governing body level, Government level and Sport Ireland level.  I was glad to hear that the major sports of soccer, rugby and Gaelic have massive participation.  It is not a matter of taking from them, rather it is a matter of supporting sport.  I was amazed to hear rowing athletes are training for the Olympics not only after bringing pride to Ireland but having been so entertaining in the aftermath.  The hands of Sport Ireland are tied in terms of what they get from the Minister.  Everybody is part of the solution.  We have to get to that solution one way or the other because a small amount of extra investment would make a huge contribution to what the witnesses do, often in a completely voluntary capacity.  I have heard solutions before involving tax breaks for those who contribute to philanthropy or otherwise.  Perhaps that could be expanded.  A betting tax could produce a lot of money for these bodies.  It is not minority sports, rather it is sports which do not have the same ability as others to raise money.</p> <p>  Reference was made to grants for bodies which are not in line with the governing body.  Tennis Ireland jumped out there with 25 unaffiliated clubs.  Can something be outlined on that?</p> <p>  Does the list of funded sports ever change?  Have sports been added or removed?  I am conscious in my capacity as a political representative that where people applied to represent Ireland at billiards and their parents sought funding, none was there.  Even if the governing body is not funded, there should be some contingency fund where somebody is representing the country.  That would allow people to proceed, whatever their socio-economic background.</p> <p>  As someone who has been involved in sport all my life, I know it gives people self-esteem they might not be able to get in other areas, whether academically or otherwise.  The witnesses represent governing bodies which are giving the youth of Ireland that self-esteem.  If we need to confront Ministers to help, we have a responsibility to do it.  The points about tennis and the list of sports may be on a website but I would be interested to know if things have changed over the years.</p></speech>

We had two votes on amendments to the constitutional amendment Bill in the Seanad.  I also had to meet the Russian ambassador.  I am delighted to be back here.  I have missed a lot of the submissions, but I am delighted to see the witnesses here.  I remember going to Abbotstown to see Sport Ireland.  It opened the eyes of committee members to the work being done.  We can sit here and listen to submissions, but I realise a huge amount of work is being done by Sport Ireland to bring various sporting organisations together.  There are sporting organisations I had not even realised existed.  People assume that politicians know everything, but we do not.  I appeal to anybody out there to visit Abbotstown.  I am sure more parents and schools have gone there.  I was very proud to see how the funding had been spent and I am proud of how people have come together to do what is best for sport across the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  We have talked about a 1% betting tax.  We have discussed how online betting is a huge issue and we have wondered what the best way is to get it to go back to sports.</p></speech>

It has led to a huge growth in the amount being bet.  In one respect, it is a problem in terms of how it has become all pervasive, but something must be given back to the sports they make their money from.  While bookies provide some sponsorship, our sport has taken the view that we would not have a betting company as a sponsor or an alcohol company.  They are not appropriate for the sport we have.  We have taken away, therefore, a potential source of finance.  We do not have that many sponsors.  It is a challenge for us.  The money is being collected from online companies as I understand it, however.  Interestingly, we have perhaps the lowest betting tax in Europe.  It is 2.5% in the UK and 15% in France.  In Australia, it is 7% or 8%.  As such, there is plenty of scope there.</p></speech>

Most of the witnesses represent individual sports.  If I were starting my life again, I would probably choose an individual sport, not that I would be any good.  It was not something we were familiar with but the sporting bodies have made people familiar with individual sports today.  I cannot commend enough the work being done across the island.  I am enthusiastic about the all-island approach.  Even as between Ireland and the UK, sport unites us.  It has done so much.  Sporting bodies have been ahead of the political curve in the work they have done.  That must be recorded.  I thank the bodies for the work they have done and the sacrifices they have made.  When I was involved in football organisations, we took abuse.  We take abuse in politics too, but we get well paid for it.</p><p>Various funding is available for the island of Ireland.  What are we doing to ensure that sporting organisations are getting the most from that funding?

Perhaps 70% of the funding we generate, in terms of our income, comes from within the sport, from things like capitation fees, tournament levies etc.  Some 24% of our funding comes from Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland.  That figure used to be higher, but it is less now.  We have four part-time development officers who cover the whole island, so the level of service we are able to offer some of the clubs is probably not enough to justify the paying of the capitation fees.  There are some clubs that just do not want to pay and which want to do their own thing.  Our challenge is to encourage those clubs to affiliate to us.  If they do not, we have no mechanism - and no responsibility, I suppose - to engage with them and to ensure that, from a regulatory point of view, things like safeguarding are in place.</p></speech>

Have some of those unaffiliated clubs received sports capital grants?</p></speech>

In terms of costs, we have a model whereby a club affiliates to Tennis Ireland.  A fee is allocated depending on the number of courts a club has.  On average it costs &euro;85 per court.  If a court has three courts it would cost three times &euro;85 for affiliation per annum.  The clubs become members then, and we ask them to pay &euro;10 towards the governing body.  That allows the clubs to play in our open tournaments, leagues and various different areas.  That funding is used to run the organisation, to support our performance players, for the running of our day-to-day office activities and to run the safeguarding courses.  This year we carried out a lot of work with our member clubs around the sports capital programme.  We let them know that the programme was available, how to apply and worked with them in terms of their applications.  I sat with 20 or 30 clubs and went though their applications line by line.  That all requires funding.</p></speech>

Over the next four years, Sport New Zealand is investing NZ$250 million in the high performance sector alone.  In the same sector in Ireland, going by what has been generated this year, the investment is &euro;28 million.  There is a huge disparity there.</p> <p>  On Senator Feighan's question, Mr. Treacy and Mr. McDermott will have more knowledge of this, but every national governing body and any local sports partnership that receives funding fills out an operational plan.  The amount of money spent by that organisation is submitted back to Sports Ireland in great detail so that it can see where the money is going.  In terms of the return in investment, financially the results are there for all to see.  Sport in Ireland stimulates &euro;1.9 billion in household spending.  It creates &euro;2.4 billion in added value to the economy.  </p> <p>  A key item that has not been mentioned today is the value of sport tourism.  Many of the minority sports we speak about, the emerging or niche sports, contribute so much to Ireland's tourism offering.  Sports such as golf, cycling and angling, which attract tourists, contribute &euro;1 billion in receipts to Ireland each year.  In terms of return on investment, for each &euro;1 invested in coaching in GAA &euro;12 is generated.  </p> <p>  It is important that we see the value of physical well-being that sport generates, but the economic value of sport should be highlighted as well, as should the fact that investment in sport is returned tenfold.  </p></speech>

To my recollection, rugby league and an ice skating association have been added to the list in recent times.  Cerebral Palsy Sport was on the list but is no longer there because it did not have the critical mass of people necessary - it did not have the volunteers and ran into some financial issues - so responsibility for that has been taken on by the Paralympics Association in terms of boccia players.</p> <p>  We work very closely with Sport Northern Ireland on the high performance side and are aligned in terms of the investment in that area.  Sport Northern Ireland is very much in tune with ourselves in that respect.  That is critical; sometimes the investment from both bodies helps to fill the gaps in terms of key personnel in the high performance system.  We have lost some ground in terms of high performance.  We were investing at the correct level around 2011 and 2012, but we are losing ground because we have not been able to increase that investment while other countries have.  That is a critical piece for us.  Mr. McDermott and I have put together a document.  We believe that we should be investing around &euro;17 million in the high performance system.  We are probably investing around &euro;10 million in it currently, based on information from the Sport Ireland Institute.  To kick on in terms of high performance that is the level of investment that is required.  We cannot invest in every world championships due to the level of investment required.  We have to do what every other country does and choose our high performance sports, which are very much geared towards the Olympic Games and the Paralympics and invest in those, because we do not have the resources to spread the jam too thickly. </p> <p>  The campus has made a huge difference, and I am delighted that this committee has visited it in recent times.  It is there for everyone, is a real sporting hub, and it is really important.  The institute is available for our elite people.  Even this morning, when we made our carding scheme announcement, our elite people were there.  They all know each other now, which adds to the team spirit when the Olympics come around.  Rather than working in silos, as had been the case previously, they all now know each other.  For the smaller national governing bodies it makes a huge difference.  The Judo Irish Open was held there last weekend.  A major fencing tournament and a gymnastics event also took place recently.  We now have events that the national governing bodies are proud to bring other international federations to compete in.  That is due to the real investment in Irish sport in recent times.  Some strides have been made, but we really do need investment in current funding.  </p></speech>

My sole interest in the Oireachtas is in the area of people with disabilities and their inclusion.  Mr. Treacy has just mentioned the Paralympics and cerebral palsy.  In fact, we recently had a witness in this committee who spoke about transport, Mr. Padraic Moran, who is actually an Irish boccia Paralympian.  He spoke about the issues he faced when dealing with public transport, and we are not going to deal with that issue today.  However, there is a connection in terms of social inclusion.</p><p>My first question is for Mr. Treacy regarding his work.  Paralympics Ireland has been mentioned.  Different organisations are involved in the disability area, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and others.  I cannot list them all off, but I refer to the importance of making sure that people with a range of disabilities can participate.  Moving out from that tight focus to a more general aspect, it is also important to make the witnesses' own sports and disciplines accessible, open and welcoming in two ways.  The first is for people with disabilities and disabling conditions to participate and use the facilities as sportsmen and women, and the second is to come along and enjoy the sports.  <br/><br/>Pulling back even further, in the context of social inclusion in general, we are public representatives talking about public money.  There is never more around than there are entities looking for it.  I refer to the extent to which all of the work of the witnesses is focused on and helping improvements for people in poorer socio-economic circumstances.  This is not easy I suspect.  Sports equipment costs money.  I refer to a little fellow dying to play something and he has a skill for it but mammy does not have the money.  Some communities are able to have good physical infrastructure but others, sadly, do not.  There are three issues there.  <br/><br/>Ireland was at the first Paralympic Games held in Rome in 1960.  &quot;Paralympic&quot;, as many people know, comes from &quot;parallel Olympics&quot;, and refers to running the Olympics for people with disabilities in parallel with and using the same facilities as the regular Olympics.  One man, Oliver Murphy, who is still alive and lives in Drogheda, was a member of that team.  That Paralympics had a huge influence on the setting up of the Irish Wheelchair Association later that year.  There are all sorts of connections between people, including <i>esprit de corps,</i>confidence and people getting on.  It was mentioned that when contestants go out to the Olympics now, they know each other across the different disciplines.  The same is so important for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

One of the things the federation was looking for was a VAT exemption to extend to sports equipment.  I refer in particular to people with disabilities and modifying equipment for people with disabilities to use, such as hand cycles, sports wheelchairs and so on.  I think I speak for all the national governing bodies, NGBs, here that a lot of work has gone on, through Sport Ireland, in coaching and also the Cara centre in Tralee around modifying individual sports to include people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  I refer to GymABLE and there are loads of others.  All of the sports are engaging in that.  To be fair to all the NGBs in Ireland at the moment, they are all looking at making their sports much more holistic and moving away from the competitive elitist model to make sure there is a recreational and participatory side to their sports.  That is to be commended.</p></speech>

They are trying to get people involved in sport by knocking on doors, getting people out and participating.  That is a huge step in respect of disability sports and for people in disadvantaged areas as well.  It is a critical area now that it is happening.  Through dormant account funding we were able to do that and make that investment in recent times.  It was probably one of the casualties of the cutbacks.  We are reinvesting in those programmes again now.  It is important.  We have also been investing in the Cara centre.  It does a lot of the training around disability sports and disability training.  That is also critical for us.</p> <p>  In disadvantaged communities, the way to make an impact is by knocking on doors and getting people out by starting clubs in those communities and finding the leadership.  Many of the NGBs invest much time in that work.  On the high performance side, the Irish Sports Council made a policy decision very early on when it was getting off the ground that athletes, able bodied and from the Paralympic movement, would be funded at the same level.  There was parity.  We invest heavily in the Paralympics and those programmes.  I will ask Mr. McDermott to fill in the committee a little more on that.</p></speech>

As Mr. Treacy said, the important thing is that from the very outset of our high performance programmes, Paralympics Ireland was given complete parity.  For example, at the announcement this morning, we had a number of Paralympic athletes there who were funded under the international carding scheme.  Badminton Ireland is here today and we are delighted that it has an opportunity to bring para-badminton to Tokyo.  There are some excellent young athletes and we were delighted to meet them today.  From our point of view, we are at the stage where we do not think about it.  Our Paralympians are treated the same as our Olympians.  The programmes are hugely successful in terms of swimming, cycling, and track and field, which is particularly excellent in the throw and with Mr. Michael McKillop.  We are delighted with that and we are working with Badminton Ireland and the other sports to expand it.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we take a certain amount of pride in the fact that our Paralympic athletes and our Paralympic team are given a status and that equity both in terms of the media and with the public.  That is something which is hugely important and in which we take pride.  Our high performance programme is completely integrated and just part of how we think about how we do our business in the Sports Ireland Institute and in every single programme.  We are very happy to do that and, hopefully, they will continue to be successful in Tokyo.  However, it is high performance, so we also make sure that the rigor remains.  They have always continued to deliver.  As the committee will be aware, a major event in the National Aquatic Centre this summer will be the European para-swimming championships.  That is a big event for Paralympics Ireland to host.  It is a big challenge for it and we are delighted that it will be on the national sports campus.</p></speech>

It arranges for a mainstream approach where children and adults are trained within their own club.  Recently, however, we have opened up a club in Belfast for children with autism only.  It is a thriving club.  We recognise in judo that inclusion is very important, and I am probably speaking for everybody else here in that regard.  It is not just to do with the high performance players or those on the development programme.  We are here to develop sport throughout.  I wanted to mention that because we look on that special club as one of our success stories.</p></speech>

We work with people from five different disability groups in 65 of our 200 clubs around the country.  From that point of view, it is an area we feel passionate about.  I mentioned earlier the three things required to make a sport happen.  We have decent facilities but we could do with more indoor courts.  We do not have one in Munster and that affects our programmes, but facilities are generally decent.</p> <p>  What we lack are the people.  We need development officers, etc., who can go out and train people who can then work with people with disabilities.  Our role as a governing body is to help people to help themselves.  We are going out to the clubs and helping them to help their members.  That is what we are trying to do.  However, we do not have the staff.  As I said before, we have four part-time development officers to cover the whole country for our sport.  That is an area where we are very weak.</p><p> It is the same in disadvantaged areas.  We do not have many tennis clubs or facilities in disadvantaged areas, which is a difficulty.  However, we have a programme called Parks Tennis which we actively support.  It has been running for 40 years and has done fantastic work in disadvantaged communities throughout the country.  Once again, however, where we are lacking is in the funding to roll out and deliver those programmes.  A small bit of extra funding can help us do a massive amount in a very short time.</p></speech>

We also run a para-badminton event.  It is the second largest event we run during the year.  It is an international event.  Thanks to the use of the National Sports Campus facilities, it has become the biggest in Europe.  It attracts 180 participants from around Europe annually.  We run it in June.  It has been very beneficial for promoting para-badminton in Ireland.  We have started a para-badminton academy on the back of it and this will be run out of the National Sports Campus.</p></speech>

We would welcome it if members of the committee cared to come out and take a look.  I think they would be fascinated to watch the ability of these people.  I did not realise that the committee did tours.  We would be delighted if members would come out to our national tennis centre at some stage.

Earlier, Mr. Fleming referred to regulatory challenges, the code of governance, compliance with the Children's Act 2015 and vetting.  Is this something for John Treacy or Mary O'Connor to address this or can the witnesses see a means by which these problems might be resolved?  Issues such as governance and vetting are even having an effect on some of the big clubs and organisations because of the volunteers.  How much difficulty is this causing?</p></speech>

The difficulties we have do not relate to compliance, with which we totally agree.  The problem involves getting the time to do it.  We have just changed our constitution and that took nearly a year and a half.  I can only speak for ourselves, but I presume most organisations are the same.  The executives of the various sports cannot just do it themselves, the matter has to go back to the members and everything needs to be done properly.  In order to comply with the different regulations coming in, it almost means rewriting all our policies.  One wants to do things right.  We are on the road towards compliance and I believe we have until 1 January 2020 in that regard.  We will meet that deadline but it will mean going back to school and staying up all night doing homework and things like that because most of us are volunteers.  We have 1.5 members of staff.  Their work load is saturated currently, so we have to take it on.  The problem is time.</p></speech>

We must have full-time employees as national children's officers whereas previously that was a volunteer post so one must hire someone for that role.  Just as the Chairman has to read his privilege notice at the beginning of the meeting, there is much more bureaucracy associated with governance, including GDPR, data protection and child protection.  Soon there will also be vulnerable adult protection.  There is much more work with no more funding.  The money has to come out of something so the big challenge is redoing the policies, which is relatively straightforward - John Delaney and Sport Ireland have given us a lot of support on that - but hen we must implement them.  Doing the policies and changing mindsets is one thing; the hard part is to get all the organisations and their members to understand that it is a culture change, that it is not purely about bureaucracy and that it is about people thinking the right way in terms of social justice and inclusion - and also in terms of compliance - so that there is no need to hit people over the head in order to do what they are supposed to but that they will do it because they know it is the right thing to do.  There are a lot of costs and work involved.  There are also personnel costs.</p></speech>

For safeguarding, we now send two adults with players.  The additional adult is there to comply with the safeguarding aspect, with which we completely agree.  However, in flight and accommodation terms alone, this has added &euro;40,000 to our annual costs.  That is just by way of putting a number on it.  That does not include the people who we would have managing it at the centre and managing our clubs in order to ensure they are compliant.  That is the additional cost that it puts on us.</p></speech>

We have seen an expediential growth in the number of forms we process for our organisations.  That is important to note.  GDPR is coming down the line and will be here on 25 May.  We have been fielding many queries from concerned individuals who want to do the right thing regarding the 12 steps of compliance for GDPR.  That is in addition to the other regulatory requirements that they are trying to comply with already.  They are trying to absorb those costs.  As I noted in my opening submission, up to 15% of our members' funding from Sport Ireland is being spent on that type of administration when it could be spent on people and programmes but unfortunately it is being tied up in order to be compliant.  That is another challenge they face.</p></speech>

A specific example that arose at the federation board meeting was around GDPR whereby it was a question of whether we could employ consultant who could put some generic GDPR policy and structures in place that we could then distribute out to the 100 local sports partnerships and national governing bodies of sport.  Ms O'Connor can probably tell the members more because she spoke to the solicitors on this, but they flatly said "No, it must be done individually".  In theory, there are 100 national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships which should all be buying in a consultant for between &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 or more, depending on the size, to be fully compliant because we are not experts in the area.  Up to &euro;500,000 is now gone from a limited budget in any event, across all sports, so that is a major challenge.</p></speech>

We have always had complete support on, for example, anti-doping programmes and child protection.  The governing bodies want to work with us and we have tried to ensure that we work with all the sports.  Some years ago, there was a requirement to put in disciplinary procedures within the constitutions.  We worked so that could be done across the governing bodies at a minimum cost.  Where it is possible we do it, but it may not always be possible.  We try to do shared services and do things with the federation and governing bodies where we can but it is not always possible.  We try to address it as best we can.</p></speech>

If the different bodies are all competing at the same school gate, how does one draw the line?  I am not a parent.  However, I see parents and they are doing three or four runs every Saturday.  They are burning out their children because that is what the children want to do.</p></speech>

We are all trying to compete to get into the schools.  When I worked for the FAI, I visited a number of primary schools where we were chased off the premises and told that only the national games were being promoted there.</p><p>Thankfully, that seems to be dissipating a little.  We all try to get into the schools and we all do a lot of work in them.  We could all do a lot more in schools, but we do not have the resources.  If we had the resources, we absolutely could do it.  Mr. Adams has a great programme about which he can speak.</p></speech>

My background is in rugby and I moved into rowing.  Schools have always been very welcoming because they are so underresourced.  The schools want sports.  The problem we have is that we do not have the people on the ground to get in there and deliver.  If we had those people and they had investment, we could make this nation a lot healthier.  I have no doubt about this, but we need investment and people.  This is the key to it.</p></speech>

The target for that year was to encourage the participation of 2,500 teenage girls.  By the end of the year, we had delivered it to 5,000 girls, so we doubled our expectation and the children in the schools love the programme.  We take rowing machines into schools and the children compete against each other, and against other schools as it is interactive on the Internet.  We could be in here rowing on machines competing against someone in Cork.  It is very interactive and fun.  In 2017, we delivered the programme to 25,000 children.  That is how much it has grown in the space of three years.  It has been fantastic for our sport.  It is fantastic for the health of the nation and the health of those schoolgirls.  It is a non-traditional sport and they have welcomed it.  It is something different.  All of the sports represented here have something different to offer, and schools would embrace them if we had people on the ground to deliver.  That is the key.</p></speech>

That is my job.  There is nothing better than a governing body coming in and giving something different from the major field sports.  I may well have been in one of those schools that chased out Mr. Fahey because we were a Christian Brothers school and there was none of that ground control football in our school for a long time.</p> <p>  There are programmes out there that could get more participation.  Under women in sport, we have run a programme since October, and 800 more girls are doing judo.  Our aim is to keep one third of them and we are confident we will do so.  We do not expect that the only thing they will do for the rest of their lives is judo.  I am speaking about judo, Mr. Adams is speaking about rowing and other witnesses are speaking about different sports.  We introduce people to sport.  Some of our judo players might go to rugby, rowing or tennis, and that is what we are about also.  If we can get some for our own sport, that is brilliant, but the problem comes down to finances.  It is also getting the right people into schools.  Then we come to vetting and other issues.  We do not have any judo development officers in the Thirty-two Counties.  The only people who get into schools are those who are self-employed and earning a living.  Fair play to them because they are doing a service for us.  They are doing what we would love to be able to do, which is put people into schools, but we do not have the finances to do so.  This is not a criticism, rather it is just that there is not the money to do it.</p></speech>

Why does his organisation have a problem with volunteers?  Is it because of a cultural change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-03-28a.1179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Leacy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018032800002#Z01100"><p>People find going on committees is very time consuming.  Everyone seems to be working now and has very little time to contribute to committees.  It is not unique to us.  Everyone is struggling to retain volunteers.  More people are working and more are working later at night.  Sometimes parents bring children to events and they want us to be minders for the children for the day.  They do not seem to stay and watch the children, and this is a problem.  We have volunteers who run tournaments and parents who bring a group of children go off shopping or working.</p> <p>  The professional association in England ran a programme of putting fold-up snooker tables into schools and it worked very well.  It helped the children with mathematics because they had to be able to add up the scores when they potted the red and black balls.  They had to do this in their heads and they did not do it on their phones or a calculator.  We have one person who puts four fold-up tables into a van and runs it around to schools.  We could never cover the entire country.  We have tried to get a school to go to a snooker club in a town, but we had to fund a bus from the school to the snooker club so the children could play and see the sport.  I hope we will get increased participation from this but it is a lot of work.  As we have stated, a small increase in funding would help many of the organisations tremendously.</p></speech>

The athletes in the Six Counties seem to get better treatment than athletes down here.  Does this cause problems?</p></speech>

Last year, our Ulster branch received &pound;80,000 from Sports Northern Ireland and this year it received &pound;40,000.  The funding has been cut because there are different priorities.  The UK's focus is very much on performance in a smaller number of sports, and we have been left behind in this.</p></speech>

I live in Belfast.  We have a very good relationship with the Northern Ireland Judo Federation, NIJF.  As I mentioned in my submission, the NIJF received money from Sport Northern Ireland, but because it is government money, it must be given to people resident in the North.  Many of our Irish Judo Association players are resident in the North and they are quite entitled to that funding.  We cannot match what the players in the North get in the Twenty-six Counties.  It is totally impossible.</p></speech>

It does create additional compliance issues because we operate across two jurisdictions and they are different in terms of the regulation and compliance requirements.  This creates additional pressure on the volunteers and professional staff in each of the respective national governing bodies.  I will be honest - it is challenging at times and I will not say more than that.</p></speech>

They have been invited to avail of all of the facilities, as have several of our development players.  The third level of the national arena has not yet been developed.  There is a lovely big area that could be matted not just for judo, but for tae kwon do, jujitsu and all of the martial arts.  If we bring anyone from abroad, we have to go to local club.</p><p>Whenever we bring teams away or when our teams travel abroad, however, they go to national centres of excellence.  That would be great.</p></speech>

It relates to the value of sport to the country for our well-being, prestige, the economy and so on.  They have compared us to New Zealand with regard to population and level of activity, but we only get 10% of the budget given in New Zealand.  Is that what Mr. Treacy said?</p></speech>

In real terms, we deliver in high performance right across the spectrum of sports.  For the size of the population, we really excel on the world stage in several sports.  That needs to be said.  We are doing this against the background of Gaelic games, football and rugby, all of which are so strong in the country, but we do it with the other sports as well and that needs to be said.</p> <p>  There are critical aspects to this, such as that we need investment in high-performance training and in some capital programmes.  We need capital for high performance for the governing bodies also.  We need to kick sport on.  We need real investment in terms of the co-funding of the national governing bodies of sport.</p></speech>

By nature, sports people are resilient and driven.  However, if we got additional funding and investment for individuals and governing bodies, we would excel further on the international stage.</p></speech>
