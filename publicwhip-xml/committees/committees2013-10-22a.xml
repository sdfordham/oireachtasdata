My name is Evelyn Jones.  I am the chairperson and owner of an off-licence.  I am accompanied by my colleague Jim McCabe, national spokesperson for the National Off-Licence Association, NOffLA, who is also the owner of an off-licence; Mr. Terry Pennington, commercial director UK and Ireland at Santa Rita Estates, who has kindly flown back from Chile for the meeting; Mr. Andrew Kinsella, formerly the owner of Bin No. 9 off-licence, which ceased trading in 2012, and Ms Christine Smith, financial controller at Mackenway Distributors, a wholesale group.  The reason for such a diverse panel is to show members of the committee the co-dependence among the various sectors of the alcohol trade and how the closure of an off-licence can have a negative impact on the business of others in the supply chain.</p><p>  The producer - in this case, Mr. Pennington's firm - makes wines in Chile and Argentina.  In terms of costs involved in the production of wine, these include maintenance of the winery and vineyards, the vineyard workers, the winemakers, the wine itself, the bottles, corks, labels and boxes and the merchant costs for transporting it from South America to Ireland.  The wholesaler, represented here by Ms Smith, takes delivery of the wine and pays for its storage until it is sold to restaurants, off-licences, pubs and hotels.  The wholesaler employs warehouse, sales, delivery and accountancy staff.  It is also the wholesaler who pays the duty to customs and excise and, by necessity, this is highly regulated.  The off-licence employs store, sales and accountancy staff and is permitted in law to be open for 78.5 hours per week.  It is the final link in the chain between the consumer and the vineyard in South America.  The cost of all the jobs outlined must be met by sales revenue.  All of the costs I have just outlined must be covered by alcohol sales.  If that bottle of wine is retailed at &euro;10, including VAT, then only &euro;4.96 is left after taxes to cover all of the named costs incurred from the vine to the consumer.</p><p>  The National Off-Licence Association, which was established in 1991, represents independent specialist off-licences across Ireland. The association has 315 members in 26 counties.  They are owner-operated, located in the heart of their communities and employ the highest standards of expertise and excellence when retailing alcohol.  Alcohol is the principal product that NOffLA members retail.  Failure to adhere to licensing laws can lead to prosecution and revocation of a licence, which would mean a loss of livelihood and jobs.  It is therefore in our members' best interests to retail alcohol in the strictest manner.  It is mandatory for our members to be fully trained in how to retail alcohol responsibly.  NOffLA has developed and implemented the responsible trading certificate, RTC, and to date has trained more than 750 alcohol retailers.</p><p>  Onerous excise and legal responsibilities aside, off-licences are similar to other small retail businesses in Ireland.  Like all other SMEs, independent off-licences are suffering from rising direct costs.  In the past, many small businesses had control over direct costs.  If sales fell, a decision would be taken to reduce costs.  However, it is extremely difficult to keep a business going with rising costs.  Today, even though sales may have fallen by as much as 50%, costs are rising steadily.  Rates have increased by 20%, electricity costs have increased by 15%, water rates are up 100% as they are a recent charge, gas costs have increased by 22%, and the licence fee has doubled - that is, increased by 100%. </p><p>  While it can be argued that today is a good time to start a business as rents are lower, measures must be taken to help existing small businesses that are caught in long, expensive leases.  We recognise that from a legal perspective, the implementation of a retrospective ban on upward-only rent reviews in existing lease contracts prior to 28 February 2010 will prove a huge constitutional challenge, with implications for property rights.  Another impact is that rates in many cases will be based on a market rent set prior to 28 February 2010.  A credit for the rent differential for a lessee caught in an upward-only-rent-review lease against his or her rates bill would be very constructive. </p><p>  Also, as with most other SMEs in Ireland, the impact of the severe lack of access to credit<b></b>is critical for independent off-licences, as are the high trading costs for independent off-licences.  We urge the committee to do what it can in this area.  Declining sales<b></b>means reduced profit.  Without profit off-licences simply cannot pay core bills such as rates, insurance, electricity, employers' PRSI and wages.  The only core cost that a business can cut without being legally penalised or affecting the customer is jobs.  The staff member is let go and the retailer pays redundancy, which places a further strain on the business.  The State then has to pay unemployment benefit and has lost tax revenue from the employee, as well as the employer's tax.</p><p>  While I agree that supports are being offered for job creation, what is being done to protect existing jobs?  In the past eight months 12 off-licences have closed, costing 60 jobs.  These figures do not make headlines, yet if we were to announce the creation of 60 jobs, that would certainly make headline news.  The committee must recognise the benefits of job retention<b></b>as well as job creation.  A graduated tax credit orientated around employee retention rates and length of employment which could be off set against employer's PRSI would be helpful. </p><p>   Independent off-licences contribute millions of euro to the economy in employment rates and taxation.  Unfortunately, this contribution, like the sector itself, is diminishing.  In total there are 5,300 people employed in the industry.  This figure stood at 8,300 in 2008.  Since 2008, 544 off-licences have closed or lapsed.  Based on the current rate of closures, we expect a further 20 to 25 businesses to cease trading in 2014.  Independent off-licences are particularly vulnerable in the retail sector as they are losing market share to multiple retailers, whose profits, in many cases, exit Ireland.  The lack of a level playing field has led to large declines in sales volumes, significant job losses and business closures.  Even though sales in the off-trade are continuing to grow, accounting for almost 60% of all alcohol sales, the majority of this is confined to the multiple discounters and symbol groups in the sector, who hold 78.2% of this share.  These are the retailers that are benefiting from the shift to home consumption.</p><p>  The independent off-licence sector held 21.8% of the market share in 2012, a decline of 6.7% on the previous year.  NOffLA estimates that this figure will decrease significantly.  This is evidenced by the fact that overall off-licence sales volumes declined in quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2013, and much of this decline was seen in the independent off-licence sector.  In a survey conducted of NOffLA's members in May 2013, we found that 54% reported that turnover had decreased by between 10% and 30% in 2012, 46% stated that they expected their overall turnover in 2013 to be down, and 78% gave deep discounting and high taxes as the top two reasons for the decline in business. </p><p>  Regulation of the drinks industry is the remit of the State.  The State issues licences for the importation and wholesale and retail sale of alcohol in return for a licence fee.</p> <p>The State has a duty of care to regulate the industry adequately.  Lack of regulation allows alcohol to be sold at discounted and below-cost prices which has had a negative impact on consumption patterns.  This practice occurs in supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations where premium alcohol brands are used as loss leaders to sell other dearer non-alcoholic products and to increase their percentage market share within their own market segment.</p><p> These sales tactics, which include below-cost selling, deep discounting and aggressive and irresponsible alcohol sales techniques, including the self service of alcohol, are completely legal.  The reason they have reached such extreme levels is a direct result of the repeal of the groceries order on alcohol in 2006 and the failure of the State to anticipate the impact of its removal.</p><p> The groceries order which was under the remit of the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was a vital piece of legislation for the alcohol sector as its main benefit was to prevent alcohol being sold below cost.  It stipulated that the lowest price at which a retailer could sell goods was calculated based on the invoice price for those goods, and discounts, rebates or other deductions that were not on that invoice could not be used to lower the price of those goods.</p><p> In 2006, then Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, decided to repeal the groceries order.  NOffLA engaged with the Minister and highlighted that its repeal, as far as alcohol was concerned, would result in below-cost alcohol on the Irish market.  Regrettably, NOffLA's predictions have come true and major multiple retailers have consistently been engaged in a blood-bath battle to see who can sell alcohol at the cheapest price.</p><p> Since its removal, the following has occurred.  Deep discounting and below-cost selling is being used to attract customers to drive footfall, the result of which is the ridiculous situation where a can of beer is now cheaper than a bottle of water.  Alcohol is being retailed in an extremely irresponsible way.  Sensational below-cost price promotion is undermining duty and VAT taxation as a policy instrument in controlling alcohol abuse - the Revenue is subsidising 23% of the net cost of the promotion in the form of lost VAT revenue and the Exchequer loses out by on average &euro;21 million per annum because of this practice.</p><p> The following are other issues as a result of the groceries order's repeal.  The level of investment in the independent off-licence sector has decreased due to reduced profitability.  Manufacturers and wholesalers are being squeezed by large multiples to supply product at discounted prices.  Brand equity and quality is being affected as it is only brands with high consumer recognition that are of interest to these players.</p><p> Minimum pricing is often mooted as an alternative to a ban on below-cost selling but it will not eradicate deep discounting, aggressive alcohol sales techniques or below-cost selling itself.  A minimum price will only target the cheapest, unbranded alcohol.  The large operators are not interested in promoting little known brands.  They are interested in big brands that will drive footfall and gain market share.</p><p> It is our understanding that the groceries order can be reinstated by ministerial order by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, but we would ask the committee to look into this matter for us further.  Reintroducing a ban on below-cost selling would stop the sale of alcohol products below cost; save jobs and prevent business closures; eliminate deals promoting heavily discounted branded alcohol, such as, buy two 20-packs of premium branded beer for &euro;25; yield additional VAT to the Exchequer; and prevent the cynical use of alcohol as an enticement to purchase other grocery products.</p><p> On high-tax economy, independent off-licences are also being affected by the high rates of alcohol taxes in Ireland.  Our rates of excise are 576% higher than the EU average for wine, 280% higher than the EU average for beer and 230% higher than the EU average for spirits.  As a result of these taxes, alcohol prices in Ireland are now 62% higher than the EU average.</p><p> Budget 2013 introduced substantive increases in the alcohol taxation.  Excise duty of beer and cider rose by 22%, spirits rose by 18% and wine rose by 41%.  As a result of these increases, taxes on wine became the highest in the EU, taxes on cider became the second highest, taxes on spirits became the third highest and taxes on beer the fourth highest.  In a recent survey, 75% of NOffLA members stated that they were experiencing serious volume decline in sales in 2013 due to higher excises.</p><p> Budget 2014 also introduced significant excise duty increases and this has dealt another blow to the sector.  For example, the 2013 and 2014 excise increases represent a 61% increase in duty on wine over an 11-month period.  Prior to budget 2013, the excise duty on 1,000 cases of wine was &euro;23,600.  Following budget 2013, the excise duty on such product rose to &euro;33,357 and as of the budget of Tuesday last, this has now risen to &euro;38,237.  An extra &euro;14,000 in extra cash must be found per month per 1,000 cases sold.  The Revenue Commissioners take the duty from bank accounts on the third last working day of each month.  The impact on cash flow for wholesalers has been devastating.  The wholesaler must pay Revenue and this, in turn, has resulted in a tightening of credit terms that can be afforded to retailers and in bad debts.  An extension of credit by Revenue for duty payments would be a major help.</p><p> Another issue is the black economy.  Greater enforcement in this area is required due to these significant excise duties as, obviously, there is a benefit to be accrued in engaging in smuggling.</p><p> On cross-Border shopping, consumers will return to purchasing alcohol in Northern Ireland because there is now a significant difference between excise in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  This, coupled with a UK VAT rate of only 20% compared with our 23% rate, leads to significant savings for the consumer purchasing alcohol in Northern Ireland.  Four years ago, Ireland lost over &euro;500 million in cross-Border shopping.  This practice led to significant job losses across all retail sectors and the Border counties were particularly hard hit here.</p><p> A survey conducted on 8 October 2013, shows that a basket of alcohol products in Northern Ireland was already 34% or &euro;56.80 cheaper than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland.  The basket retailed in the Republic for &euro;223.12, while the same basket could be purchased for &euro;166.33 in Northern Ireland - a saving of &euro;56.80.  That was prior to the budget of Tuesday last in which there were more excise increases.  There is a tabulation of the items surveyed in the statement.</p><p> Consumers, particularly ahead of the Christmas period, will begin shopping in the North of Ireland again, given the substantial savings that can be made.  It is for this reason that we ask the committee to call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to reverse the excise increases this side of Christmas before the damage is done.</p><p> In a time of immense economic difficulties, NOffLA wishes to be a constructive partner to Government.  We have engaged with various Departments because the issues that impact the sector sit with a variety of Departments, namely Health, Justice and Equality, and Finance as well as, of course, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In the past decade, our sector has been gravely impacted upon because of the disjointed decisions that have been taken in the various Departments without examining their impact as a whole on the other aspects of our business.  This approach does not enable us to plan and invest in our businesses in the long term.</p><p> To support the survival of the independent off-licence sector, we come before the committee today to ask for its help in the following areas: make it illegal for alcohol to be sold below cost; reward employers for continuing to employ existing staff - a graduated tax credit orientated around employee retention rates and length of employment which could be offset against employer's PRSI would be helpful here; help retailers to cope with the rising direct costs of business - a credit for the rent differential for the lessee caught in an upward-only rent review lease against his or her rates bill would be constructive; an extension of credit terms for excise payments would be helpful; and restore the equilibrium of prices between the North and South of Ireland - we ask the committee to call on the Minister for Finance to reverse the excise increases before Christmas.</p><p> The elimination of below-cost selling also offers an alternative revenue-raising option to policy makers that is realistic and achievable, and this is under careful consideration in the UK.  These policies will ensure that the viability of the indigenous off-licence sector is sustained, protecting much needed jobs and businesses, and that alcohol is retailed in the most responsible manner possible.</p> <p>The recommendations I have outlined will benefit not only the independent off-licence sector but also the Exchequer. </p><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to present this statement on behalf of the independent off-licence owners of this country.</p></speech>

At present we are doing much work on the independent retail sector in general and its future, and this information will feed into that work.  We will probably engage with her on the matter again.  I have long believed there is an imbalance between independent retailers and large multiples, and this information further proves this.  The difference in this case is that we are dealing with a drug.  The call made by Ms Jones at the end for more cohesion and co-ordination in policy responses is well put.  If any other agency or group had had 544 closures in three years that would have made headline news.  It is clear that there is an issue.  Is the association purely made up of independent retailers, or are any of the multiple supermarkets or off-licences members of NOffLA?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Pennington" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013102200007#G00500"><p>I will try to answer the question in context, as a wine producer.  At Santa Rita Estates we are very focused on investing from the vineyard to the bottle, but we also invest heavily from the bottle to the consumer, thereby investing in the market.  In terms of the wine market specifically but also in terms of retailing, our business is very focused on what we term to be sustainable, which for us means three things.  It is about environmental consciousness, it is about social responsibility - both of which include ensuring products have indications of provenance, something ever more sought by Irish consumers - and it is about economic viability.  To answer the question, for us, economic viability is about making choices.  In Ireland, traditionally we have had a very strong independent sector that gives consumers diversity, offers education and, above all, creates competition in the channel.  I would argue that up to a few years ago this was a fairly good model.  However, within Europe we are facing the same pressures.  For us it is about choices with regard to investment and where we put the money.  In countries that are developing it is very important for us to support smaller businesses.  To give some sort of perspective, we employ people directly and indirectly in this country, and in 2013 we will have invested more than &euro;1 million in marketing that is not price-related.  I believe there is a commitment from producers to support the different channels.  If we work with only one segment of the market it will become purely a pricing proposition; members have seen the consequences of that.  Even in a model such as this we recognise that duties will stay in some capacity, so it is about making that a platform where different segments can survive.</p><p>  In reality, we have seen consolidation in markets such as the United Kingdom.  To give some rough statistics, 92% of the take-home market for wine is controlled by nine players.  The independent sector has almost disappeared, and this trend is becoming almost irreversible.  There are some seeds in other categories - some small independent trades such as craft butchers and so forth - but, as producers, we need those categories in order to survive in this market.  They need the platform to trade.</p></speech>

Yes, we supply all channels.  The route to market we use is an importer - sadly, not Ms Smith but somebody very similar - an indigenous Irish business which takes the cases and redistributes them into the market, to restaurants, hotels, bars, specialist wine shops and big retailers.</p></speech>

The Irish shopper is looking for value.  Our concern is that the more we push the price agenda the less control we have over the provenance of the product.  We are directing people.  If I may take our best-selling product, which is sold in the shops owned by Ms Jones and Mr. McCabe, as well as by major retailers and in restaurants, around 15% of today's price for that product is for the actual wine in the bottle in a retail shop.  The State takes more than 45% and the balance goes towards distribution and everything else.  Of what is in the bottle - I speak of a premium product that costs &euro;11 - 15% goes towards the work we do, from the vineyards to the vinery.</p></speech>

Surely it all depends on the price of the bottle of wine.  The duty price is fixed in this country.  If it is increased by 50 cents on the bottle the same price applies whether the bottle costs &euro;20 or &euro;5.</p></speech>

Let us take a specific product and do the exercise.  It is a fixed-duty rate irrespective of the price of the bottle of wine.  If I take an average price point in the market, in 2013 it is approximately &euro;7.50 for a take-home-outlet bottle of wine.  Even if I talk about a bottle costing &euro;11 - one of mine, which I know intimately - 15% of the price of that product goes towards what we put in the bottle.  The other 85% goes on taxes, freight, distribution and profit margins for others.</p></speech>

I ask the same of Mr. Pennington, although he may not wish to comment, which is understandable.  There may not be this pressure from the independent sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christine Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013102200007#G01600"><p>I would say there are different kinds of pressure.  The pressure to which I think the Deputy is referring - namely, that from the larger operators - does exist.  I would look more at the pressure we were put under last year following the budget for 2013, published on 5 December.  We were put under pressure to source cheaper products because the average price of a bottle of wine, as Mr. Pennington noted, is &euro;7.50.  We were hard pushed in this regard to find product we could sell to the retailer that could be on the shelf selling at &euro;7.50, because we have certain quality values in our company.  The pressure did not come so much from the direction mentioned in the Deputy's question; it was about finding a product that has good enough quality which we are happy to sell, so it arose from the pressure of the tax.</p><p>  The excise duty is crippling everybody and we are in the middle of it.  We are the people who actually have to pay it initially, who finance it.  That is quite challenging, as members can imagine if they consider that every 1,000 cases of wine we sold this time last year cost us &euro;23,600 in excise duty.  What we remove from bond in month one we pay for just before the end of month two, when the Revenue Commissioners takes it by direct debit through the bank.  There is no way out of that.  In order to sell a product we need to know we will have the money in two months' time to be able to continue withdrawing from bond.  In order to do that we have had to tighten the credit terms we impose on the independent off-licence sector.  We do not have a choice about it because we are stuck in the middle.  It is not about making extra profit but about sustaining our own businesses.</p></speech>

In terms of levelling the playing field, one of the aspects we have been looking at is the notion that the big multiples, which have massive floor space and everything that comes with that, should be subject to a higher excise rate than the smaller operator.  It would be done on the basis of space.  The aim would be to level the commercial playing field, but there would also be a public health focus.  Is that something the delegates would consider?  What suggestions would they make in terms of taxation treatment?</p></speech>

Up to about three years ago our licence renewal cost &euro;750 per annum - that is, &euro;250 each for beer, spirits and wine licences.  The idea has been mooted that somehow the licence fee could be related to turnover or floor space.</p> <p>I have analysed the matter and tried to come up with a licence fee that reflects the volumes sold by the larger multiples.  To be honest, I found it very difficult, based on the volumes that they achieve, to come up with any meaningful fee that would have an impact on the way they sell alcohol.</p></speech>

With the increase in excise and the practices that go with it, everyone is now engaged in a race to the bottom.  We would like to think that we are more artisan in what we do.  Supermarkets may have larger spaces but our smaller shops have a greater variety of products.  However, we are now losing that aspect, especially in the wine business and even in the craft beer business.  About a year and half ago we pushed very hard for local craft beers but then the multiples hopped on the promotion immediately.  Before we knew it they had big spreads in newspapers advertising craft beers.  Of course we can always try to be innovative and up-front, but the multiples catch up and surpass us, and that makes our business very difficult.</p><p>  The race to the bottom is getting worse due to the tax system and below-cost selling.  We struggle to provide a &euro;7.50 bottle of wine in our shops for various reasons.  The number one reason is quality and the second reason is that we would not make any money.</p></speech>

As members can imagine, it is difficult for us to provide a bottle of wine for &euro;7.50.  If consumers demand a bottle of wine costing no more than &euro;7.50, for example - and they do - the quality of wine will decrease.  The tax is the same and the distribution costs are the same, so the quality of the product will decrease.  It is reminiscent of what happened with beef burgers recently.</p></speech>

I am no longer a member of the National Off-Licence Association for the simple reason that I went out of business last year after ten years of trading.  I had a fully licensed wine shop on the south side of the city.  Luckily, I had a very loyal group of consumers who supported me for a long time because they appreciated and valued my service, the quality of wines and even the role that I played in the local community.  Earlier, we mentioned SMEs in general and their value.  My business reached the point at which even my good customers acknowledged that even though my wines were great and they loved coming to my shop and really wanted to shop with me, there was a gap between the prices they saw in the Sunday newspapers and the prices of my products.  It meant there was no point in my selling a bottle of wine at &euro;7.50 and waiting for a customer to enter my shop to make &euro;1 if I was lucky.  The price gap became too wide.  Nobody in the independent trade expects to sell his or her products as cheaply as the supermarkets do, because they will always be cheaper.  People are willing to pay a premium, but not when their disposable incomes are lower.  There is only so far they can be pushed on price in such circumstances, and the same applies to all markets.  I do not know of any other sector in which there is legislation that puts SMEs at such a disadvantage.</p></speech>

Including myself, I employed around six people on a full-time and part-time basis.  Between 2007 and 2012 my business was down between 35% and 40% but I managed to get some movement on my fixed upward-only lease from my landlord.  Rates were the only cost that increased; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council increased my rates by 10%.  Even if the figure had increased by &euro;1,000 I would have had to sell &euro;5,000 worth of wine in order to recoup that sum.  I have reached the point at which I wonder whether anything will change.</p><p>  I may no longer be a member of the industry, but between 3,500 and 5,000 people still work in the industry in small businesses.  People have suggested that I lodge an appeal with the county council seeking a reduction in my rates bill, but it would cost me money to do so.  When rates keep increasing, one must decide at some point whether it is worthwhile to continue in business.  Unfortunately, instead of being a collector of VAT and a payer of taxes - both PRSI for staff and income tax - I ended up being unemployed.  As a small business person I received no income because I had no rights in that regard.  I could not draw any welfare payment.  I found myself unemployed for the first time in 25 years.  There has been one small benefit.  I managed to secure a place on a Springboard course, which proved successful, because I am glad to say that I am back in employment.  However, instead of contributing to the Exchequer I ended up, for the first time in 25 years, drawing from it to the value of a course that may have cost between &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000.  I came here today because I do not want to see other members of the association in the same situation.  The following applies also to other sectors but particularly the drinks industry.  It seems to me that a particular disadvantage has been built into the legislation that affects small business.</p></speech>

My business was located in Clonskeagh.  For a period, there were three or four multiples situated within one or two miles of my business.  Market share means everything to multiples.  Even in a tight market one can see that more multiples have outlets that are decreasing in size.  In the meantime, multiples are locating on Morehampton Road.  I used to attract people from Ranelagh, for example, to my shop.  Over the past four to six years, four or five new multiples have been established in Ranelagh.  The competition is to do with market share, so the low-hanging fruit are the independent retailers, in my view.</p></speech>

She said that changes in the industry have led to credit terms being tightened for the independent sector.  Does the same apply to multiples?  Is the independent sector more vulnerable due to its smaller market share?  Is there an additional pressure on independent retailers with regard to credit?  Have credit terms tightened across the board?  Does it vary with the type of business?</p></speech>

Perhaps we have been more flexible with such businesses and let credit out when we could afford to do so.  The way the multiples work is that terms are agreed at a certain time and a business gets its cheque, whether it is from one shop or another - perhaps I must leave them nameless-----</p></speech>

I wish to raise a few issues.  First, rates are a concern for every small business in the country.  We have discussed this matter a lot.  The challenge is that if we increase it by 1% it is of little benefit to a small business, so we must work out what percentage works best.  A lot of work has been done on the matter and consideration has also been given to profit margins, turnover and other challenges.  The commission that sets the rates has examined the matter for the past year and is due to report very soon.  I empathise with the delegation and know that rates are a huge problem throughout the country, especially for small businesses.</p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise is that of below-cost selling.  Is the delegation aware of what the Minister for Finance said recently about below-cost selling?  A case with regard to below-cost selling in Scotland was taken to the European Court.  The Attorney General has said that legislation cannot be introduced due to the case pending.  If legislation were introduced now we could not implement it until a decision is reached on the court case in Europe.  If the decision is favourable, the Minister has said that he would have no problem changing the provision in order to prevent below-cost selling. I would like to hear the views of the delegation on the matter.</p></speech>

What we are referring to is the ban on below-cost selling encapsulated in the Groceries Order, which was repealed in 2006.  They are two different things.  A minimum price will target alcohol at the very cheapest end of the market, including non-branded alcohol.  Such alcohol is of no interest to the large operators in our market.  They are interested in premium branded alcohol that they can discount in order to attract footfall into their operations to sell other grocery products, petrol or whatever.  They are two different issues.</p></speech>

Economically, in any sector that does not fit.  I do not understand why, if one wants to buy premium alcohol products, one is only doing so below-cost because one cannot purchase them through the normal channels at these prices.</p></speech>

In those days there was the concept of resale price maintenance.  The objective was to protect the trader, whether big or small, and the customer lost out.  I am beginning to hear sounds from the group to the effect that it wants to go back to protecting itself against the interests of the customer, which I think from the point of view of the economy I think would be a huge mistake.  Some of the figures provided are very interesting.  The prices between Northern Ireland and the Republic are dramatic and such a gap cannot be in the interests of the Minister for Finance because we must be losing out to a considerable extent on that basis.  Lower prices are wanted by the consumer.  I am in favour of below-cost selling and I am an enthusiast, whether for alcohol or whatever else.  I recall selling Zip firelighters below cost.  Another time it applied to bread and there were howls from the bakeries.  When it applied to milk, there were howls from the dairies.  It appears that whenever someone is selling at a low price, the only people who do not howl are consumers.  We live in a market economy, in which I am a great believer.  This morning I attended a lecture in Dublin Castle given by a representative from the Competition Authority.  He talked about the various efforts being made by different groups which were illegal where, even by accident, one colluded to ensure the price of one product increased.  I suggest one is almost in danger of doing something like this when one argues for a ban on below-cost selling.  I am not showing sympathy to the delegates.  I actually believe sympathy has to lie with the consumer.  If the consumer wants lower prices, he or she will go to a particular outlet.  If he or she gets a better service - I know from Mr. McCabe's business that one gets a considerably better service there than in the supermarkets - on that basis he or she has to make the decision as to whether he or she wants lower prices or a better service.  The successful retailer will be the one who manages to get the balance right.  I am not sympathetic to the movement to increase prices because as soon as alcohol prices go up to a fixed level, the same will apply to bread, milk and everything else.  I am perhaps acting as the only voice for consumers as I have not heard any other voice representing them.</p></speech>

Second, responsibility for the retail of alcohol in Ireland is vested within the remit of the State.  The State has a responsibility to implement strategies that allow alcohol to be retailed in a responsible manner.  The problem lies with the State; we are the collateral damage in respect of its failure to regulate the retail of alcohol adequately since 1990 when the system of regulation was dismantled bit by bit.  We are where we are today because of its actions regarding the retail of alcohol.</p></speech>

We are operating in a non-monopoly environment where the large multiples are not necessarily offering lower prices but certain items as loss leaders and profit-taking on other items.  Certainly consumers are better off in general on price, perhaps on one at one moment in time, but in general they are worse off because there are fewer suppliers offering fewer price options.  Therefore, in the non-monopoly environment towards which we are moving, the consumer becomes the price taker.</p></speech>

As a view from somebody who is resident here but operating outside the State on a global basis, the consumer has a second level of competition or competitive pricing in Northern Ireland, given the new regime of excise duties that has been introduced.  Certainly it is advantageous from our perspective to trade more with Northern Ireland and to have consumers go and buy our products there.  Today one can buy one of our products at about 20% cheaper, if we apply the new duty rates in the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland; therefore, the consumer can go and benefit.  My choice for the 1,000 families who work in the company with which I work, that we have to support and make sustainable is whether we continue to invest in the Republic of Ireland or whether that investment can be spent better elsewhere.  Our sincere hope is that we will spend it in this market in supporting responsible retailing.  Competition is good.  I agree fully with the Senator on that point, but I fear we are pushing consumers out of the State.  Not one cent spent on a bottle of wine or beer in Northern Ireland will be brought into this country.</p></speech>

As a Deputy elected in 2011, I would not be so familiar with the debate on the groceries order at the time.  It is a matter on which the committee might hold a discussion to see what was the rationale at the time and whether it can be considered or what are the ins and outs of that area.  Without giving any personal view on it, I support the call for a debate on that.</p><p>  As somebody who is not particularly a connoisseur of alcohol, certainly not of wine as I do not drink wine, it makes sense for me to go into a multiple, small petrol station or small shop to buy the drink that I want and buy whatever else I want.  There is that difference, as somebody who knows what he wants.  It is different if one is a connoisseur of wine who checks out the various brands.  I understand that.  It is merely my personal view that there is the extra service or convenience and the extra products provided not only by multiples but by the small service stations where one can get what one wants and get the few extras.  That is merely one point of view.</p><p>  I suppose the pubs would have their own legitimate concerns.  No more than NOffLA, they would argue that it is NOffLA and the multiples that are impacting on them and closing down the rural pubs, although in that regard there are other issues, such as the smoking ban and, more important, the drink driving issues.  NOffLA is here blaming the multiples as having the impact on its businesses.  Quite clearly, there is an issue overall.</p><p>  On NOffLA's concern about higher taxes, the role of Government and legislators is to look at the other aspects of this, such as the health aspects.  I have not met any politician who has stated anything other than that we want to reduce the level of irresponsible consumption of alcohol.  The issue here relates to the multiples promoting more irresponsible sales of alcohol.  The pubs might say the independent retailers, if they offer lower prices than the pubs, promote the irresponsible consumption of alcohol and then the pubs would be the good guys which charge higher prices and provide whatever else, such as food.</p></speech>

We operate within the market in which we are allowed to operate and even the largest multiple in Ireland operates within that law.  It is a question of whether the committee thinks that those standards that prevail currently are adequate and responsible and how it expects to address the issues of, for want of a better term, "alcohol over-consumption" when that is permitted.</p></speech>

Much of it is price driven.  Clearly, there is a social and health aspect.  I guess it is a multifaceted problem.  However, they all are connected.  The only point we are making is that there is not legislation in place which supports those large businesses to the same extent across other sectors and other categories, and its impact probably hits harder.  It hits pubs but hits us harder.</p></speech>

We are not.  We are here as sellers of alcohol.  It goes back to Deputy Kyne's point.  We are in a regulated business.  Alcohol is our business but, unfortunately, we are in a situation where all those outside alternatives are affecting our business.  If alcohol was regulated better, then we might find a supermarket selling its bread or whatever at really low prices.  Unfortunately, the supermarkets are subsidising by using alcohol to get consumers in.</p><p>  We work with health bodies and the Department.  Commentators say it is amazing to see the off-licence sector sitting beside Alcohol Action Ireland, but we both have the same aims at the end of the day.  We are meant to be responsible retailers.  We are meant to do certain things because of Government regulation and all we are trying to do is that.  The difference between us and, say, the butcher is that we are under this regulation.  It is not fair to keep alcohol, bread and whatever side by side and speak side by side as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Christine Smith" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013102200010#K01200"><p>I will respond on two points.  First, I understand from the point Senator Quinn made that he felt we were perhaps losing sight of the good of the consumer by wanting to reduce prices.  As somebody in business, I would say that the consumer is our eventual customer and we want to keep the consumer happy.  It is not in our interests to not please the consumer.</p><p>  Personally, if I might speak of my family business, we all are passionate about what we do.  As a wholesaler, I am in the middle of the chain, but we deal with people somewhat like the company that Mr. Terry Pennington is with, Santa Rita Estates in Chile.  Also, we deal with many smaller family producers in France, Spain and Italy which all believe very much in the skills they bring and the expertise they have developed over the years.</p><p>  I note the encouragement given in the supermarkets to artisan food producers, whether cheese makers, artisan bread makers or those adding value to fish and selling it in a different way.  Such artisans are being encouraged, particularly in Ireland, by the multiples.  There is one multiple in particular that really has a policy of helping Irish indigenous businesses.  If this was not alcohol - the fact that the product with which we deal can be misused and can be abused and it is the misuse and the abuse that leads to the social problems, the medical problems and the health forum - and if it was not misused or abused in the first place, one is dealing with what is a product of agriculture which is part of Ireland's produce base.  Wine is a different product.  We do not produce it here, but in France the wine business is an important part of the agriculture sector.  Those with whom we deal are all passionate about what they do.  It is an honest business making a good product.  We buy it from them, bring it in and sell it on to the retailers and restaurant owners and it is the consumer who benefits from that, perhaps from the quality of our selection or whatever.  I cannot take sitting down the suggestion that we are losing sight of what the consumer wants.</p> <p>We want to look after the consumer.  In regard to what Deputy Kyne said, perhaps I might draw attention to something all members are very familiar with, namely, that NOffLA has worked very hard over a number of years to come up with a programme for responsible selling of alcohol.  One does not get that from the multiples.  NOffLA does its very best.  Given that the industry is regulated by the Government - I would argue not sufficiently regulated - NOffLA definitely plays its part in the responsible sale of alcohol through the training it encourages staff to take, ensuring that in every off-licence that is a member there are a certain number of people who have done the training and are accredited.  We should not lose sight of that.  We are all here as responsible people.  Alcohol gets a bad name because of abuse and misuse.

Alcohol is estimated to cost the State some &euro;3.5 billion a year, which works out at about &euro;3,300 per taxpayer.  We are dealing, therefore, with a significantly costly and possibly dangerous product and for that reason its treatment is significantly different from that of any other product in the market.  That is why off-licences came about, with a special licence to sell the product.  All of a sudden there has been a proliferation which extends to fuel stations and multiples.  It is my view that alcohol should be removed from those two spaces.</p><p>  I refer to the market structure in Ireland in respect of multiples and groceries.  In 1977 there were 14,000 groceries but in 2007 there were only 7,000, so there has been a vast reduction in the number of grocery competitors in recent years.  The type of competition occurring at present is reducing the number of competitors.  Tesco and most of the international players take a higher profit in Ireland than they do in other markets because they charge a higher margin on most of their products than they do in other markets, facilitated by loss leaders.  This is not of benefit to the consumer in the long run.</p><p>  I have been saying until I am blue in the face, at this committee and in other places, that unless we create a level playing field with the North of Ireland we are always going to have this problem, with leakages from one part of Ireland to the other.  As an island, we need to sit down together when we prepare our budgets.  The North is looking for fiscal powers to be able to deal with excise duties, VAT, etc.  We see this in other markets - for example, in the area of fuel, with the money spent in tackling fuel laundering.  As an organisation, has NOffLA ever considered sitting down with both jurisdictions and asking them to focus together on levelling the playing field for retailers so that we do not have this scenario?  At present what is happening is a swing in one direction in regard to currency and tax, which means a boom town on one side of the Border, but there are also swings the other way and boom towns on the other side.  That is not a sustainable pattern of growth or development.</p><p>  There is also the issue of rates.  Rates should be profit-based.  It is ridiculous that a business person who is making a loss or is barely surviving is charged exactly the same per square foot as Tesco, which is making massive money in this country.</p></speech>

I travelled to Belfast on 2 September for a meeting of the public health commission based on a joint report on alcohol policy that was commissioned on a North-South basis.  It was at the invitation of the pubs of Ulster.  The publicans showed up, as did the off-licences, the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland and its equivalent in the North, and the Department of Health in the North.  Nobody showed up from the Department of Health in the South, however - there was not a sausage.  This shows a lack of respect for the people who are trying to retail alcohol in a responsible manner.  Surely somebody from the Department of Health could have shown up for that meeting.  We are finding there is a negative profile of the alcohol industry, but we do not make the rules; we play by them.  Pillorying the sector is not fair.  Regulating the drinks industry is in the remit of the State, and it should do so.  We welcome regulation and have no fear of it.</p><p>  The second question was about rates.  Mr. McCabe will say some words on that issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right.  Although all of us have suffered over the years, the rates have gone up in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, in some instances by 20%.  Like the Deputy, I cannot understand why this is the case, although I know the background, which is related to rents.  I have two tenants and am also a tenant, but because I am a retailer I can talk to my two tenants and be rational.  We can look ahead and work together.  I have talked to them about the future and we can work as a team.  However, because my landlord in my other establishment is bankrolled - in the sense of being owned by the bank - there is no discussion.  Some effort must be made here.  I realise it is a constitutional issue and there are problems with legislation, but in a landlord-tenant situation where the tenant can show improvements have not been made and things have not gone well during a particular period, both landlord and tenant can and should work together.  However, when there is pressure at the back of it all, from a bank or an institution, it is very difficult because then there is also pressure on the landlord.  It is very difficult to have movement in that area.  Looking ahead, the landlord-tenant situation should be similar to a business in which people work together for the future.  That is not happening, and it should be examined.</p></speech>

I know this from the off-licences in my county.  However, there are some that sell alcohol to underage drinkers.  It is not my desire to put any further financial pressure on the delegates, and I realise that most underage alcohol consumption comes about through outlets other than the ones represented here, but one idea that could be mooted in this regard is for alcohol products to be stamped at the point of sale with an indelible mark that shows the date, time and location of sale.  There could be a video camera over the register.  Then, if a young person were found with a bottle or a can, a garda could easily tell that it had been sold in X or Y off-licence at such and such a time and see who was behind the register at that time.  If an adult bought the product and gave it to a child outside, his or her identity could be discovered.  I realise the desire of the delegates is not to seek extra costs, but what would be their view on the use of such creative measures which could help to stamp out underage drinking?</p></speech>

We maintain there is already far too much legislation which is not being enforced.  If one is under 18 years it is an offence to purchase alcohol - prosecute.  It is an offence to purchase alcohol for somebody who is aged under 18 - prosecute.  It is an offence to be drunk in public - prosecute.  It is an offence to be drunk in a retail premises - prosecute.  There are all these laws in place - we are coming down with them - yet nobody is enforcing them.</p></speech>

I have an article from Alcohol Action Ireland which points out that if we were to introduce below-cost selling for alcohol the law would be extremely complicated.  There are issues with regard to transport, VAT and duty, so what would be the actual below-cost price?  There would be similar issues.  The article highly recommends the minimum pricing model as the way forward, stating it would benefit moderate drinkers, restrict harm to social health, be good for business, decrease workplace absenteeism and bring about significant savings to the State from alcohol-related health and crime costs.</p> <p>The article also stated that small retailers and off-licences would be put on a level playing field with larger multiple retailers and larger retailers could not simply absorb the price increases, as can happen with other pricing policies.  Is Ms Jones saying that is not the case?</p></speech>

The only way to proceed would be if one were to implement a minimum price that was so high as to impact upon premium branded product.  We support minimum pricing.  We have nothing against it, but it must be recognised that it will not address branding and discounting by the multiples.  They are not interested in cheap alcohol.</p></speech>

It is premium branded product.  It is not one&rsquo;s basic product that is manufactured at a low price that attracts consumers to purchase other more expensive grocery product.  The impact of minimum pricing will not work.  It will put people out of Aldi and Lidl and into the more mainstream supermarkets.  They will be delighted with minimum pricing.</p></speech>

I communicated with Fiona Ryan on the difference between below-cost selling and minimum pricing.  It is easy to get confused by the two concepts but if one is talking about the very cheapest alcohol then one should bring in minimum pricing.  If one is talking about the cherry-picking of branded alcohol to be sold as volume deals to drive footfall into multiples, which is currently the case, one will have to look at below-cost selling.</p></speech>

If one is not comfortable with the fact that alcohol is used as a driver for footfall to sell other products then one would have to look at how it is promoted and priced.  In terms of pricing, one has a choice between below-cost selling or minimum pricing and the other issue is how it is promoted in the media and in the booklets we get through our doors once a week.

I am not in this sector anymore but I read the Sunday newspapers and I do not believe for a second that any reasonable adult does not take certain messages from the full-page advertisements in newspapers.  Only by legislation and restriction in the advertising code are they restricted to one third of a full-size page.  People can make their own judgment on that.  To me, that is an indication of some of the intent of what large business tries to do.</p><p>  To cap it all off, there is a small little logo at the bottom which says, "Please drink our products responsibly".  That has been the sop that big business has managed to negotiate with the people who control the sector in Ireland and whose responsibility it is to negotiate.</p></speech>

In a way we are pointing out what would happen if one did bring it in.  All we are saying is that minimum pricing is not the big answer we are looking for and neither is below-cost selling because at the end of the day people can get around below-cost selling.  It is a start and what will happen with below-cost selling, for example, is that retailers cannot reclaim the VAT.  At least that is something that will benefit the Government.  They can probably still get a way around selling their product very cheaply in order to get around below-cost selling.  At least we are taking steps to resolve the health problems as outlined by Alcohol Action Ireland.  We are trying to be responsible and help in some way towards better controlling the alcohol sector.</p></speech>

It is something that we have come across in different ways.  I can see it at consumer level and a commercial level.  I have seen a product for which we have exclusivity in this country on a supermarket shelf.  I know that we did not supply the supermarket with the product so one could ask how it got it.  When one does a bit of detective work one discovers that it has not been duty paid in Ireland.  One knows that when one speaks to the manager of the wine department who says how much he paid for it and one knows one cannot compete.  When one is selling such and such a product one goes in with one's portfolio and the manager responds that he can buy it for &euro;65 while my price is &euro;90 and that it would be nuts for him to buy it from me.  On examining the bottle one discovers that the capsule is a <i>capsules r&eacute;presentatives des droits</i>, CRD, capsule from France, which is an indication that the duty has been paid in France.  Once it has been paid in France it is in free circulation and there is nothing about going from bond to bond or duty suspended so it is not something that has ever had duty paid in Ireland but it is coming in and is being sold.  It is being sold by a company purporting to be a bona fide wine importer but it is the black market.</p><p>  One also hears that people in vans are quite willing to sell one stuff.  They are selling to restaurants and the off-trade.  They are selling to anyone who will buy it.  It might cost them &euro;2.50 at point of origin and the cheapest they will sell it for is &euro;36.  There is no way we could do that as it would not even cover the duty.</p></speech>

As members know, the Government is undertaking wide-ranging reform of children's services and the Bill forms a very significant part of that reform.  The reform will continue long after the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  The Bill seeks to provide the organisational context, leadership focus and accountability mechanism within which improvements can be achieved.  The reforms we are undertaking are systematic.  The creation of an agency with dedicated responsibility for the services will ensure the changes introduced are championed, sustained and capable of being built upon.  I do not need to repeat why there was an impetus for reform of children's services because there is a long history in this regard.  We believe in bringing a dedicated management system into play from the front line to the national management team, led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  The responsibilities of all personnel are exclusively focused on children and family services for the first time.  That is very important.  These services or arrangements are supported by a dedicated budget, segregated for the first time from the HSE Estimate.  Common processes and information recording are being implemented around the country to ensure consistency and service provision.  With Dr. Helen Buckley in place, we have an independent review system for serious incidents, leading to the publication of reports and management responses.  There is also the work of HIQA.  Every month or so, we receive a range of reports from HIQA.  For the first time, it is examining child welfare and protection services, which is very positive.  HIQA has highlighted some pre-existing weaknesses in this system.  I am committed to addressing these weaknesses and taking on board the points HIQA makes.</p><p>  The Bill seeks to facilitate each of the distinct elements that make up the programme of Government commitment through the creation of an agency that is dedicated solely and exclusively to children and families, that <font color="#2F2F2F">has an improved range of services to meet the needs of children and families and is subject to best practice in the discharge of its accountability to the Government and the Oireachtas.  The need for a dedicated agency recognises that the complex operational management and reform of child welfare and protection services have jostled with many other competing objectives within the large and very demanding health and personal social service arena.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Bill provides the mandate for a dedicated agency to lead the improvement of children's services.  I will not repeat the services that will be provided from the establishment date because we had an opportunity to discuss them already.  Suffice it to say they range from the child welfare and protection services, preschool inspection services, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, services related to the psychological welfare of children, existing family support agency responsibilities and National Educational Welfare Board services.  The incorporation of preschool inspection services will further promote a nationally consistent approach to the regulation of preschool services.  My amendments develop the preschool quality agenda about which I have been speaking in recent months.  There is to be a stronger regime of inspection and registration in this area and a range of other initiatives to ensure the standards we want to see in our early years services.</font><br /><font color="#2F2F2F">  Considerable attention has been paid in the drafting of the Bill to the recommendations of the task force on the Child and family Agency and, in particular, to enhancing accountability.  I hope we will have a fruitful discussion in the course of our deliberations.</font></p></speech>

I welcome its publication and the opportunity to bring it through Committee, Report and Final Stages.  I acknowledge that this is an important step forward, one that I absolutely support.  </p><p>  Let me use my opening words to reflect a concern I have.  It was not a concern I had in approaching the Bill on Second Stage but is one that has arisen in the intervening period.  I am interested in hearing the Minister elaborate on matters pertaining to R&aacute;th na n&Oacute;g, the open high support unit that has been in situ in Castleblayney in my constituency for some years.  I am concerned on a number of levels because it is very important that the new Child and Family Agency is launched on the best basis possible.  We need to ensure the high standards we, as elected spokespersons, expect are adhered to across the board and that the new agency will guarantee a significant advance in the provision of supports and care for children as problems arise.  </p><p>  I am deeply concerned about the remarks attributed to the HSE's national director of children's services.  I must record this because if I did not so, I would be remiss in my duty as national spokesperson on health and children's issues.  I refer to the advent of the directive to close R&aacute;th na n&Oacute;g following presentation of HIQA's report.  The Minister mentioned the role of HIQA in the ongoing assessment of the suitability, or otherwise, of various facilities.</p> <p>This all hinges on the issue of locking down the facility from 9 p.m. until 7.30 a.m.  While there are other issues relating to the individual residents, this lock-down is unacceptable, irrespective of any difficulty arising from the inappropriateness of placing some of the children there.  This is an open facility, yet, without any court or criminal justice system directive, the liberty of the children involved was taken from them.  The direction came from the national office and Mr. Gordon Jeyes has indicated in an interview that he supports the measure, although he denies having issued the directive.  He goes on to say any reasonable parent in the country would do the same.  I do not believe reasonable parents across the country are locking up their children, irrespective of the difficulties or issues that present.</p></speech>

I am very anxious about the intent behind the establishment of the agency.  At the end of the day, the structures will only be as good as the standards we expect and insist upon.  The directive relating to the high support units promotes the use a model of care based on relationships, emotional containment and positive reinforcement which promotes consistency, predictability, dignity and meaningful controls.  The aim is to help young people to develop internal controls of behaviour, enhance their self-esteem, facilitate the development of personal abilities and strengths and support their capacity for constructive choice, resilience and responsibility.</p></speech>

The expert group published a report in July 2012 and we have been waiting a long time for this day to come.  We had a good discussion on the Bill on Second Stage prior to the summer recess.  Many of the amendments I have submitted were drawn up in consultation with several children's organisations in an effort to improve the legislation.  I certainly hope what we are going through today is not just for show.  I hope the Minister is here with an open mind and willing to take on board suggestions from members of the Opposition, as well as from members of the Government parties.  I hope all committee members will support those amendments which would improve the legislation.</p><p>  A number of amendments have been ruled out of order because they involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I am disappointed by this because the amendments speak to several areas identified by the expert group, namely, child and adolescent mental health services, public health nurse services and childminding services.  It is disappointing that we cannot have a full and frank debate on these issues.  While I must accept that the amendments have been ruled out of order, I am disappointed nonetheless.  </p><p>  For my part, I am here to be constructive.  I have tabled amendments following consultations with various community groups and representative bodies in the child care sector.  I hope we are not here for show and that our suggestions will be taken on board by the Minister.</p></speech>

The proposed amendment is in accordance with the legal advice received.  The first print of the Bill intended to rely on the usual definition of a child.  However, various definitions are provided across various Acts such as the Age of Majority Act 1985, the Child Care Act 1991, the Education Welfare Act 2000, the Children Act 2001, the Mental Health Act 2001, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004 and the Adoption Act 2010.  The differences in what might be described as the usual definition of a child in the statutes referred to may give rise to a lack of clarity regarding the agency's remit in the absence of an explicit definition in the Bill.  The need for a clear understanding of exactly what is intended by &quot;a child&quot; is at the centre of the Bill.  </p><p>  It is the intention that services identified in the Bill such as psychology services should be provided for children aged under 18 years and it is necessary to ensure with absolute clarity that the provisions of the Bill allow for the agency to provide such services.  The definition proposed will align the definition of a child in the Bill with that in the Child Care Act 1991.  &quot;A child&quot;<i></i>will mean &quot;a person under the age of 18 years other than a person who is or has been married&quot;.  This amendment will not change in any way the definition of a child in other statutes, including the Education Welfare Act 2000.  Where the Child and Family Agency is carrying out functions pursuant to that Act, the definition of a child will be as provided under section 2 of that Act which states &quot;child&quot;<sup>'</sup> means:<blockquote>a person resident in the State who has reached the age of six years and who (<i>a</i>) has not reached the age of 16 years, or <br />(<i>b</i>) has not completed three years of post-primary education,whichever occurs later, but shall not include a person who has reached the age of 18 years.</blockquote>The effect of the amendment proposed will be to provide an explicit definition of a child to bring clarity to the issue of the remit of the agency and the services it will provide under the Child and Family Agency Bill.</p><p>  Deputy Robert Troy was not here when I made the point that I had approached the amendments I had tabled in a collaborative fashion, having listened to many of the points made by a variety of people, including the Deputy himself and Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, as well as numerous NGOs.  A number of the amendments I am bringing forward reflect the discussions with officials of my Department.</p></speech>

While I note the Minister has addressed some of the issues we have raised, I hope she will not copy the disposition of the Minister for Health who blanket-refuses any of the amendments presented by the Opposition which have been thought through carefully.  I appeal to the Minister to consider favourably several Opposition amendments that are meritorious.  I hope we will not go through the Bill&rsquo;s passage simply for the sake of treading water, as Deputy Troy has already said.

This amendment proposes to include educational welfare as a function too.  The Minister may argue the use of the term &#8220;welfare&#8221; already covers this.  However, I believe there is a need to be more specific.  The right to education is already enshrined in the Constitution.  This legalisation, accordingly, should reflect the importance of education and welfare.  This is the area where there is the greatest potential to note child welfare issues which could be addressed quickly.  The education system plays an important role in the protection and welfare of a child.  It merits particular attention in section 8.  I commend the amendment in both my own name and that of Deputy Troy to the Minister.</p></speech>

The link between school non-attendance and child welfare concerns are well known.  It is important to recognise that educational welfare services are a route for identifying other underlying child protection issues.  Greater visibility of the issue of educational welfare would help for greater buy-in from the staff of the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB.  I hope the Minister will take our concerns on board.</p></speech>

I am satisfied the terms &quot;development and welfare&quot; encompass, in this regard, any functions transferring from the NEWB.</p><p>  Educational welfare in its broadest sense is a function of teachers, schools, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  If I accepted this amendment there is a risk it would explicitly suggest that educational welfare is solely the remit of the agency.  This is not the case.  The legislation and functions as set out in this Bill will not diminish the role previously carried out by the NEWB under the Education and Welfare Act 2000 in conjunction with schools.  To be clear, the functions under that Act will transfer to the Child and Family Agency CFA.  Section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) already satisfactorily captures the concept of educational attainment by children through the inclusion of the terms &quot;development&quot; and &quot;welfare&quot;.</p><p>  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I believe even with the NEWB being an integral part of the agency that there is a need for the affirmation of the importance of educational welfare.  It is one of the most important cornerstones in the preparation of any young person.  Accordingly, it should be enshrined in the legislation as a critical element of the supports that need to be promoted and sustained through a child&rsquo;s life.  The Minister&rsquo;s expected reply does not dissuade me from the merit of including the term &ldquo;educational welfare&rdquo; in this section.  It is a requirement of the Constitution and this legislation should reflect this.  I commend the amendment to the Minister and I rest my case at that.

We cannot have that in legislation.  The legislation and functions as set out in this Bill will not diminish the role previously carried out by the NEWB under the Education and Welfare Act 2000 in conjunction with schools.  To be clear, the functions under that Act will transfer to the CFA.</p> <p>I have been examining submissions from the NGOs, as has Deputy Robert Troy, and have taken on board quite a number of points on the clarifications sought.</p></speech>

The only other point with regard to subsection (4)(<i>d</i>) concerns the education of persons with special educational needs.  Including a reference to educational welfare <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the functions of the agency would in no way suggest it was its sole responsibility.  Nobody for one moment would believe this would be the case; we have a Department of Education and Skills which has primary responsibility for it.  In this instance, the Bill states the agency shall support and promote.  This most certainly should be part of its functions.  If it is not to be accepted now, in the fullness of time it will be viewed by the new board as something which should certainly have been reflected on at this point.  It would be better to do it now rather than perhaps being compelled to do it later.</p></speech>

For a long time we have operated in silos.  Responsibility for child protection lies with social workers, while responsibility for newborns rests with public health nurses, when really we all have a responsibility when it comes to children's development.  Being overly prescriptive is to leave things out.  Section 72 explicitly states, as does section 1, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board will be dissolved and their administration, business, connections and functions will transfer to the new agency.  This is explicitly stated in sections 71 and 72 and referenced in section 8(1)(<i>a</i>).  There is no need to say something twice and we should bear this in mind.  I do not disagree that education is an integral part of development, but when we speak about child development, we are speaking about education in the home, the community and schools.  It is the function of everybody, not just a particular agency, to ensure developmental milestones are met.</p></speech>

We seek to replace the reference to the word &quot;families&quot; such that the section would read &quot;all families and the role of parents or guardians therein as integral to the achievement of <i>paragraph (b)</i> above&quot;.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>) has not been amended as we would have wished, but we are no less enthusiastic in our effort to see this change effected.</p><p>  The reference to all families is to give recognition to the reality of all family units which constitute society today.  The traditional notion of family is as might be suggested by the current wording.  It is important to refer to &quot;all families&quot; because quite clearly there are a number of possible family arrangements which do and will apply and it is very important that they are acknowledged and that there is a sense of inclusivity and recognition.  The reference to the role of parents or guardians in the family &quot;as integral to the achievement of paragraph (<i>b</i>) above&quot; is a reference to supporting and promoting, as is now the case, the continued development, welfare and protection of children.  This reaffirms what is stated in paragraph (<i>b</i>) and clearly adds that the parents and guardians of the children concerned are part of addressing these critical areas of need in a child's developmental years, that is, development, welfare and protection.  I commend the amendment and look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p></speech>

Including the word "all" in front of "families" is a reflection of the diversification of the family network in Ireland.  It is no longer the conventional family of a mother, father and a number of children.  The family home is made up of a different mixture, which is to be welcomed and acknowledged.  It is only right that we acknowledge it in drafting the legislation.  I echo what Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in stated on the issue of support and ensuring the appropriate proportional supports are acknowledged.  The family is the best place for a child to be brought up and we should at all times look to support families in every way we can.</p></speech>

I was thrilled to see a very broad definition of family on page 10 of the Bill.  It states "family" means spouse, parent, grandparent, step-parent, child, including a stepchild, grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister and any other person who, in the opinion of the agency, has a bona fide interest in the child.  I do not think this could be any more explicit or reflect the modern family structures one will find.  I am very proud of the fact that this is the definition of family the Government has chosen to include.  For a very long time families have been excluded.  This is good legislation which includes a very broad definition of family, which is to be commended.</p></speech>

As Deputy Ciara Conway has done, I refer committee members to page 10 of the Bill and the definition of family.  Section 8(1)(<i>c</i>) is sufficiently broad to capture the intent of the amendment proposed.  It is important to note that the definition of a family is broader than just parents and guardians.  We must take account of the full scope covered by the definition on page 10.  The insertion of the role of parent or guardian as integral to the achievement of paragraph (<i>b</i>) does not add anything to create or recognise a specific role for parents or guardians in supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children.  This matter is already provided for under the Constitution.  The legislative framework and other legislation relating to the functions of the agency are all framed and bound by the constitutional commitment to the family.  This provision is not required to underpin the role of parents.  As in the case of any other statute provision, it is to be interpreted within the constitutional framework, but primarily I point to the definition of family in the Bill, which is very inclusive.  It is broader than that suggested in the amendment which I will not accept for these reasons.</p></speech>

We do not have to be referred to any other section to give voice or support to any position the Minister wants to take.  This specifically concerns the functions of the agency.  As appropriate, we should make reaffirmations if this is what we believe is required.  In this instance, I believe a reference to all families is appropriate and it would in no way be undermined by the case presented.  I do not see it in any way as a contraction in terms of the wide definition referred to when we speak about parents and guardians.  Guardians can cover a range of situations and people may not be the natural parents with regard to arrangements which can be in place.</p> <p>We are equally encompassing of all of the potential situations that can and do arise that make up the reality of Irish familial life today.   </p><p> We are here today to try to improve and put the case we believe is appropriate having engaged with others who are at the coalface of child care and protection work.  We share with those who have made the case to enhance the functions of the agency and so I hold to the position that I have already articulated.  </p></speech>

I sought to insert the following new subsection &quot;(<i>h</i>) ensure the prevention of harm to a child from all forms of neglect and abuse.&quot;  Surely the provision can hardly be a charge on the Exchequer.  Surely this is a component part of the responsibilities of those we are now entrusting the new agency to, going forward.  Surely that is what all of us are about, protecting children from harm, neglect and abuse? </p><p>  We shall reach the later amendments in good time.  However, I was taken aback that my amendment No. 6 was ruled out of order.  It is beyond my understanding.  It is what I can only describe as a device that has been used, time and time again, to set aside challenging, awkward or difficult amendments from Opposition voices.  Amendment No. 6 is within the spirit of what the legislation is all about.  I do not know whether the Minister wishes to comment.  Does she share the same view?  </p></speech>

She will not be able to comment and one cannot move the amendments out of order.  All I can tell the Deputy is that the information, that he alluded to in his remarks, imposes an allocation of resources for the purpose of involving a potential charge on the Exchequer and, therefore, the amendment has been ruled out of order.

Amendment No. 8 is a consequential amendment to give effect to a realignment of subsections (3) and (4) of section 8.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new subsection (3) was included in section 8(3) of the Bill, as published, and it is restated in the revised subsection (3).  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) was included in subsection (4) but has now been moved into the new subsection (3) in a restatement of the services the agency will provide in supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families.</p><p>  The intention and effect in Section 8(l)(<i>c</i>) which provides for the effective functioning of families is for a broad enabling provision to encompass all existing HSE and FSA functions which are transferring into the agency, in addition to child welfare and protection.  The policy intent in the framing of the new agency has been to broaden the scope of the agency beyond the traditional concept of child welfare and protection to emphasise family support as an essential area of activity.  The amendment is clear regarding the obligation and clarifies that there are:<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) preventative family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children,<br />(<i>b</i>) care and protection for victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence, whether in the context of the family or otherwise, and<br />(<i>c</i>) services relating to the psychological welfare of children and their families.</blockquote>As Deputies will know, some concern has been expressed as to whether family support would be an explicit function of the Child and Family Agency.  The amendment makes it absolutely clear that family support can be seen as equally important in promoting children's welfare and protection by allowing for a range of family support programmes and earlier interventions which might obviate the need for more complex and intrusive interventions at a later stage.</p><p>  While these functions are encompassed in the enabling provision contained in section 8(l)(<i>c</i>), I acknowledge that a more explicit reference, as I have done, to family support is important in terms of people understanding the functions of the agency, the approach to the work and the range of services that can be development.  For that reason I shall introduce that amendment to section 8, to substitute a new subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) which incorporates that specific reference to family support services aimed at promoting the welfare of children.  The amendment will provide for a more explicit expression of family support services, the blended Family Support Agency Act and Child Care Act functions, and give acknowledgement to family support as a preventative strategy in the context, as I have said, of child welfare and protection.</p><p>  The particular services referred to in the new subsection (3) are without prejudice to the general application of subsection (l)(<i>c</i>) and the services that may be provided more generally under that subsection to support and encourage the effective functioning of families.</p></speech>

The amended subsection would read:<blockquote> (5) The Agency shall, in the performance of its functions demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency, accountability and consistency.</blockquote>We think that the addition of the word &quot;consistency&quot; is very important.  There has been no end of situations, that one can refer to, that demonstrate, in the past, where inconsistency has been more the norm.  I raised the issue at the outset which may not have pleased the Chairman or many others for that matter. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is there are inconsistencies in the matter of the conduct regarding so-called open high-support units.  That is just one instance, I could cite many more.  Consistency is not an idle word that has been dreamed up to create an amendment for its own sake.  I could cite any number of situations where the absence of consistency has been a matter of very clear concern to members of the committee not only in recent years but going back for some considerable time.  I believe it is of such importance that we have now a new Child and Family Agency in the offing and the critical need for performance, transparency and accountability, are hugely important, but also consistency.  I strongly recommend it to the Minister.  I believe that in her own experience, the Minister knows well that the absence of consistency has been a major problem. in the past.  Let us put it to bed now and make it abundantly clear that consistency is a critical part of what we expect in terms of the performance of the new agency. </p></speech>

Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has outlined the issue quite well.  Unfortunately, there have been many inconsistencies in recent years and decades.  It is clear from the harrowing reports compiled in that time that inconsistency and a lack of inter-agency co-operation are themes that recur.  The Minister has alluded to that on many occasions in D&aacute;il debates.  What we are seeking is to demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency and accountability, three very appropriate adjectives, on a consistent basis.  I fail to see what argument one could make for not doing so on a consistent basis and for not inserting it in the legislation.  The high standards of performance, transparency and accountability must be adhered to on a consistent basis.</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  What I would debate is whether it needs a separate expression in the legislation and what precisely the meaning of that expression could give rise to in the legislation.  In later sections the legislation places a responsibility on the agency to demonstrate to the Minister's satisfaction high standards of performance, transparency and accountability in terms of service provision.  A very strong performance framework is set out in the legislation which provides a strong basis for monitoring and evaluating all of the work, whether it is service delivery, issues relating to consistency of service provision which is necessary at a national and regional level.  We also have the development of a very comprehensive set of performance indicators to be reported on in a consistent manner from the agency.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes has already started that process.</p><p>  In regard to the points made earlier by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in about Rath na n&Oacute;g the key factor there was that decisions had be made in terms of weighing up the risk to the particular children.  At all times the best interests of those children were considered by the staff in determining the care and the decisions that had to be taken at any given time.  I would have confidence in the role the CEO of the Child and Family Agency played in those decisions.  Certainly it was a question of weighing up various risks in a unit that was originally built as a secure unit.  </p><p>  On the point about consistency, clearly if this were put into legislation, consistency in terms of the volume of location of services at any one time may run counter to important local variations in need.  We would not want to get into a situation where that local variation, which is so important, becomes a problem.  When making a decision about a particular circumstance, or particular child or a family, obviously varying approaches will be necessary and appropriate.  Consistency in outcomes is obviously to be striven for but inevitably success may look different for different children in families.  I will not accept the amendment.  The issue will be dealt with in terms of the ongoing governance and performance indicators which the agency is under an obligation to report  on a consistent basis.  </p></speech>

I do not believe that the professionals would have viewed it as in any way enhancing the critical approach they would have to their job which is about building relationships.  One does not build relationships with people one locks up at night.  I believe the word "consistency" is very important.  There are ample examples of where inconsistency has caused serious concerns.  I have no doubt in my mind that if the Minister, for whom I have the highest regard, was sitting where Deputy Troy and I are sitting today and dealing with this Bill presented by another face that she would argue for the inclusion of the word "consistency" for all the right reasons.  This is in the section dealing with the functions of the agency.  We have not moved on yet to the best interests of the child.  Consistency in relation to the functions of the agency needs to be explicitly reflected and it is not.  It is not good enough, and I do not think it wears to suggest it is understood or is implicit in this or whatever is the case.  I think we should be explicit and definite.  Consistency and the highest standards are what we expect and will insist upon in respect of the functions of the agency once established.  I believe this is a very important amendment.  Placing the word "consistency" here is giving out the right message.  I expect Deputy Troy would be of the same view that this is an amendment we would consider pressing.  It is of that importance.  I have no doubt that if the tables were reversed that the Minister would take exactly that position and I would commend her on it.</p></speech>

The problem in relation to the statutory mandate in putting it into legislation.  I believe it may give rise to difficulties of interpretation which could be genuinely problematic.  It would obviously make it justiciable.  I could suggest that in the section which gives the Minister power to give guidance to the agency that the principle on consistency is dealt with in a way that captures what the Deputy is seeking in this amendment.  That would tie it more to the performance element and the reporting back from the agency to the Minister.  That would be one place where we could elaborate on it.</p></speech>

I suggest that those guidelines would take into account the points being made by the Deputy.  I think they would do that anyway, but I suggest I can make explicit here the point being raised in the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

While I accept the Minister has endeavoured in some way to meet our concerns with her proposal, I do not accept that my concern is covered by the suggestion that this is something the Minister may or may not do.  The section refers to the power of the Minister to issue guidelines to the agency, notwithstanding the guidance provided by the performance framework, and states that such guidance may relate to additional policy guidance or changes in policy in the prioritisation of business plan commitments.</p><p>  I would have thought consistency would be a cornerstone of the agency's whole approach to its work, and not something the Minister or whoever may replace her in the future may or may not suggest - that it would be optional.  I believe consistency is not an option or something that is at the Minister's behest, as it pleases the Minister of the day.  I believe it is an absolute requirement of the new child and family agency.  While Deputy Troy will explain his position, my view is that this is something we should expect as one of the first principles of performance by the new agency and board in overseeing the functions of the agency.</p><p>  I believe that where we propose to present this in the Bill is the most appropriate place.  We are talking about the performance of the agency&rsquo;s functions and the need for it to demonstrate the highest standards of performance, transparency, accountability and consistency.  What we want is the highest standards in all of these areas, in the interest of the children who will come under the agency&rsquo;s interest and concern over time.  I hope the Minister will do better than what she has just come back with.</p></speech>

In her contribution, she mentioned that the proposal made in the amendment might somehow tie the hands of the professionals when dealing with a particular child welfare case or issue.  Obviously, there must be some latitude with regard to what interventions and supports are needed, because no two cases or remedies are the same.  However, I understand this section of the legislation to be concerned with the overall performance of the agency rather than the nitty-gritty of what the professionals are doing on a day-to-day basis.  My concern is that the agency will perform to a high standard and be transparent and accountable, and that the general principles will be consistent, more in the macro sense than in the micro sense the Minister seems to describe.  Perhaps my understanding is wrong, but I believe we are talking about consistency on the macro level with regard to the performance of the agency.  Therefore, I would be happy to see the word "consistency" inserted here and do not feel it would tie the hands of the professionals working with vulnerable families and children at the micro level.  Will the Minister clarify this for me?</p></speech>

The Deputy used the word "performance".  I believe the performance framework is where that issue should be addressed, because in that performance framework we will be talking about the need for consistency in regard to the work the agency is doing and the processes it uses.  For example, we will want to see consistency in planning for children in care, the allocation of social workers and the appointment of social workers to children in care and those in foster care.  The performance framework, which is dealt with in section 41, is where that issue will be dealt with, rather than including it in this section of the legislation.</p></speech>

The section provides that the Minister may at any time issue additional guidelines.  I suggest that consistency is of such importance that it is not an additional guideline, but something we expect from day one.  It is not an afterthought but is something that is required now.  We will fight the "may" or "shall" battle with later amendments but, with respect, I do not believe that section 48 achieves what I and Deputy Troy hoped to achieve in arguing the case for consistency.  As I said, I could bring to the attention of the Minister any number of files in which inconsistency has been a huge concern to us as voices in the interest of children over a number of years.  It is from the get-go, from day one, that we want to make it clear that we expect consistency.</p></speech>

The judicial interpretation could be varied.  I am advised it is not wise to include it in this way.  However, we clearly want consistency in the approach of the agency and its standards.  I believe the governance and performance framework areas are where this requirement can best be met.  There, it can be met in a more nuanced way that is more appropriate than can be achieved by inserting the word "consistency" at this point in the legislation.</p></speech>

We believe these are important core performance guidelines that should be there from day one.</p><p>  There is so much hope for the Child and Family Agency.  People have campaigned and worked towards its realisation over a long period of time.  We want it to be the very best it can be - fit for purpose in every way - and we want core standards and beliefs to be enshrined in all that it must aspire to.  Therefore, that the principles of equality and non-discrimination should apply.</p><p>  With regard to children, there are ample examples.  There is not only the consistency versus inconsistency issue, but the examples of inequality and discrimination affecting children from a variety of backgrounds and with different experiences of life, those from marginalised communities and those from different familial make-ups.  We want only that every child be treated equally and with the same regard and consideration.  Therefore, we believe that affirmation of the principles of equality and non-discrimination are very important indeed.</p> <p>That is the only reason for the amendment.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Equal Status Act exists and that it ensures we cannot be discriminatory to any section of society, and that is only right and proper.  This legislation would be enhanced, however, if it were clearly and explicitly marked out that the agency in the performance of its functions "shall have regard to the principles of equality and non-discrimination".  That gives a clear and explicit meaning about what the agency can and cannot do.  The agency will have to deal with families and people in society from a diverse background, whether they are young, old, black, white, ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities, Travellers, or whatever.  It is only right and proper to have this marked out in the legislation from day one.  I support Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in' s point and I fail to see why we would not have this outlined explicitly, bearing in mind the existing Equal Status Act.</p></speech>

If every principle had to be repeated in every piece of legislation the reading of the Statute Book as a whole would lose meaning.  The Equal Status Act 2012 will apply in full to the child and family agency legislation and its principles need not be restated in the Bill.  One could make the argument that if some items from the Statute Book are repeated but not others more impact is being given to those rather than to other principles contained therein.  Obviously I do not disagree that the equal status legislation should apply.  I certainly take Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in' s point about inequalities where children are concerned but there is no need to restate what is already clearly laid out in legislation and applies absolutely.</p><p>  In addition, there is the new general scheme of the Irish human rights and equality commission Bill 2012, as published, which proposes to introduce a positive duty on the public sector.  Head 36 of that legislation states that "a public body shall in the exercise of its function have due regard to the need to eliminate prohibitive discrimination, promote equality of opportunity treatment and protect the human rights of its staff and persons to whom it provides services".  Even stronger legislation is to come, therefore, about the application of this legislation to agencies, including the child and family agency.  I do not reject the amendment because I do not agree with it but the principle is already well established, the legislation is in place and applies to the agency.  It is not necessary to repeat it.  I take this opportunity to point out it applies to the agency, absolutely, and the new legislation will give an even stronger format for the application of those principles.</p></speech>

Her response does not hold, given any scrutiny of the points we have discussed, for example: "the agency shall in the performance of its functions demonstrate high standards of performance, transparency and accountability".  We might have assumed as much and would hardly expect it to perform other than to the highest standards.  That is all accepted and understood.  We could go to paragraph 9 which states "the agency shall use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner".  Why say that?  We can assume and presume that it will not be wasteful and will not discard without due consideration in terms of cost.  Either it merits inclusion or it does not.  I do not expect the agency to be wasteful or to employ resources, scarce as they are today, in anything other than a beneficial, effective and efficient manner.</p><p>  There is no consistency in the Minister's reply.  It is just a formula of words of rejection.  I record this with regret.  I believe the principles of equality and non-discrimination are an absolute imperative for inclusion in this legislation.  We have ample reason to believe this.  History shows report after report revealing that anything but equality and non-discrimination were the order of the day.  It has been a weakness of structures in the past that they have failed to heed and take note of this.</p><p>  In further areas of the Bill we will address the right of the child to be heard and matters pertaining.  We need clear understanding on the part of all concerned that children must be treated equally and in a non-discriminatory manner.  We must say this because historically in Irish society they have been treated unequally and in a discriminatory way.  All the evidence is stacked up on shelf after shelf in the Minister's office, as she knows only too well.  It is not only about scarce resources but about the standards we expect and I believe we should affirm this in laying out the functions of the agency from day one.  We want nothing less.</p></speech>

I am conscious in proposing this and the following amendment that we are not being strong enough on having inter-agency co-operation.  By inserting the word &quot;facilitate&quot; we want to ensure that we are serious about inter-agency co-operation.  I would welcome the Minister's opinion.</p></speech>

The word "promote" means to help the progress of something or to support and encourage it.  At a very minimum I see that as facilitating, therefore the word "promote" incorporates facilitating and including the extra wording does not add to the policy objective.</p> <p>This is a very serious obligation and we stated we would deal with it in the context of the legislation.  Section 8(8) promotes enhanced inter-agency co-operation in order to ensure services for children will be co-ordinated.  In addition, it will facilitate integrated responses to the needs of children and their families.  This means that there will be a strong obligation on the agency and that said obligation will include the facilitation of inter-agency work in order to ensure the services are responding in a way in which, as Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted, they did not in the past.  It is clear from all of the reports that inter-agency co-operation is an absolutely critical element in delivering effective services.  I put it to Deputy Robert Troy that the term "promote" encapsulates facilitation of inter-agency co-operation and that, as a result, the additional word is not necessary.</p></speech>

The Minister correctly condemned previous Administrations for the lack of inter-agency co-operation in this sector.  It is extremely important for us to ensure, by means of the legislation, that there will be strong inter-agency co-operation.  Successive reports have highlighted the lack of inter-agency co-operation as one of the systemic failures within the sector for a number of decades.  The Minister and I have often cited cases where issues of concern relating to vulnerable children or families have been referred to multiple agencies and where there has been no co-operation or joined-up thinking.  In addition, there were no referrals and there was a proliferation of files as a result.  The Minister has indicated her view to the effect that the word "promote" is sufficiently strong.  I am of the view that use of the phrase "to facilitate and promote" would give rise to a stronger meaning.  As stated in respect of an earlier amendment, I do not see the harm that would be done by broadening the scope of the section.  We must ensure from the day on which the legislation is enacted, there will be proper inter-agency co-operation, which is critically important.  As use of the word "facilitate" would give rise to a broader meaning, I ask the Minister to reconsider.</p></speech>

This is being done for the very reasons outlined by the Deputy.  There has been a gap and there was no statutory underpinning to support inter-agency co-operation.  We are putting in place a strong statutory provision which states: "The Agency shall promote enhanced inter-agency cooperation to ensure that services for children are co-ordinated and provide an integrated response to the needs of children and their families".  In addition, section 8(6) states: "The Agency shall collaborate with any person that the Agency considers appropriate in relation to any matter connected to the Agency&rsquo;s functions".  Therefore, collaboration is also facilitated.  The various reports to which Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred highlighted the fact that services for children were not co-ordinated.</p><p>  As indicated, this is the first occasion on which a provision of this nature is being made in child protection legislation.  I am making this provision on foot of the discussions in which we have engaged and as a result of the various reports which have been compiled and which clearly show that while many people were working with families, they were not working closely with and co-operating with each other.  In section 8(8) the word "shall" which is very strong is used and there is a clear statement on the need to co-operate.  In addition, it is stated the agency will promote enhanced inter-agency co-operation.  I understand the Deputy's approach to this matter, but I remain strongly of the view that the word "promote" is very broad, strong and proactive in meaning.  It will give rise to the outcome we are seeking, namely, inter-agency co-operation.</p></speech>

I am asking that both be included in order that the provision might have a broader effect.  The Minister is correct in that this matter has not been dealt with in legislation heretofore and I compliment her on seeking to address it now.  However, there is nothing to prevent us from making the legislation even stronger.  What the Minister has stated is not a reason for failing to strengthen the legislation.  She has often referred to what is being done in the Bill as the biggest reform of the public service that the Government has undertaken.  This legislation is extremely important and we have been waiting for it over 18 months.  All I am trying to do is ensure the system will operate in the best way possible from the outset.  I am not suggesting we substitute the word "facilitate" for "promote, rather I am advocating that it be added to the provision to broaden and strengthen it and ensure there will be no recurrence of the horrific events recounted in the report on child death and many other reports.  That is the position from which I am coming in this matter.  Inclusion of the word "facilitate" would strengthen the provision.  It certainly would not weaken it in any way.  In that context, I ask the Minister to reconsider.</p></speech>

There is a good reason to do this.  If the amendment is accepted, the subsection will read:<blockquote>  (8) The Agency shall promote enhanced inter-agency and intra-agency co-operation to ensure that services for children are co-ordinated and provide an integrated response to the needs of children and their families.</blockquote>I stand open to correction but the new agency will be one of the largest entities in the public service and have of the order of more than 4,000 employees.  It will require to follow certain principles in carrying out its functions and meeting its responsibilities.  In that context, it should promote enhanced inter-agency and intra-agency co-operation.  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure services for children will be co-ordinated and that there will be an integrated response to the needs of children and their families.  It is the latter which underlines the need for intra-agency co-operation.  I commend the amendment to the Minister in the hope she might agree that it would enhance subsection (8)</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the legislation.  There will no longer be a need for intra-agency co-operation because there will be only one agency involved.  The main reason I do not wish to accept the amendment is it implies that separate agencies will continue to work together under the umbrella of the Child and Family Agency.  The entire principle underpinning the Bill is to bring together the agencies in an integrated way in order that they will operate as one, despite the fact that they had responsibility for different areas in the past.  We are concerned with integration.  Section 8(9) states: "In the performance of its functions, the Agency shall use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner".</p> <p>One would expect that, but it is about all those different elements coming together and acting as one in the interests of a particular family.  It is no longer a matter for the education welfare section or family support section; it is about getting the best services to the family that they need at a particular time.  The term "inter-agency" makes sense because it refers to agencies outside the Child and Family Agency; however, the term "intra-agency" does not make as much sense in this section.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's amendment implies that it would apply within the agency.  "Inter-agency" captures the ongoing relationship with the public health nurses.  The intention of the amendment is that intra-agency co-operation will exist, for example, in what was formerly the Family Support Agency and the Education Welfare Board.  The goal of the agency is the integration of those services, so "intra-agency" is the wrong concept to apply.</p></speech>

We could name several agencies, and they would all fit on a single floor somewhere.  This is a huge step and one I welcome very much.  If one examines the numbers of people employed in any number of large entities within State agencies, one can see there is a need for inter-agency and intra-agency co-operation.  I do not suggest the component parts will continue to struggle, fall apart, fail to co-operate and become a single entity.  We want them to leave all those previous demarcation lines outside the new agency and be integral.  It is in the integral interest that I believe it is an addition to and an affirmation of our expectations.</p><p>  Again: "The Agency shall promote...".  This is within the agency.  It is not only its external relationships and engagements but, within itself, co-operation to ensure services for children are co-ordinated.  This will apply across the country and provide an integrated response to the needs of children and their families.  It is only an effort to see if there is the possibility of improvement.  I believe there is.  Inter-agency co-operation stands on its own merit but intra-agency is another dimension.  That is not to suggest, as the Minister may have picked up, that I am at all concerned that we will have competing entities, part of the new, amorphous mass.  However we need internally to promote co-operation across all the different newly-defined roles and functions of the new agency, and promote the very best we expect from that entity.</p></speech>

In section 50(2) the first code of governance talks about the transition issues:<blockquote><br />The first code of governance shall include details of the methods to be used to bring about the integration of the governance systems deriving from a transfer of functions to the Agency from--(a) the Health Service Executive, and<br />(b) the dissolved bodies.</blockquote>I am happy to examine this further and will return to it on Report Stage having examined the precise meaning of intra-agency and how it might apply here, if the Deputy is happy to do that, but I am concerned that it would copper-fasten in legislation a less-than-integrated approach to the agency's development.</p></speech>

On that subsection, in terms of what Deputy Troy and I said about our two consecutive amendments, if the Minister can come back with a formula we will both be happy to support what changes she wishes to introduce.

Section 9(1) of the legislation reads: &quot;The Agency shall, when making decisions in relation to the performance of its functions under section 8(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>), have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters.&quot;  That is weak.  The words &quot;have regard&quot; mean &quot;take into account&quot;, and that falls far short of everything we have addressed heretofore.  I am mindful of having been in this room over a two-year period attending some 62 meetings as a member of the all-party group that worked towards the wording of the children's referendum, and this critical area was addressed during that time.  It was part of the discourse in the very successful promotion of the children's rights referendum.  It is very important, and this does not reflect the spirit of the all-party consideration of the best interests and views of the child.  Therefore, we have put forward wording that better encapsulates the spirit of the all-party position in terms of the children's referendum and all the debate that has swirled around it since.</p> <p>So it is that we propose the deletion of the wording of section 9(1) as presented in the draft legislation, and the placing instead of the following: &quot;9.-(1) The Agency shall, in performing its functions under section 8(1 )(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) in respect of an individual child or family, regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.&quot;  There is a huge gap from the wording of having &quot;regard to the best interests of the child in all matters&quot; to a situation where we would &quot;regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration&quot;.</p><p> This has been an accepted approach to this issue.  I had understood all along that we had a cross-party understanding and acceptance that the best interests of the child were, indeed, the primary consideration in all matters pertaining to the child and its future.  I will not labour the case.  The Minister is at least as familiar, if not more familiar, with the arguments around this than any of us here.  I believe she will know the case I am putting to merit her most favourable consideration.  I believe that anything less than affirming the best interests of the child as a primary consideration is to dilute that absolute requirement, as I see it.</p></speech>

As Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, the hard work has been done.  The Minister and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in were on the all-party Oireachtas committee in this regard.  It is only right and proper that this is included in the Bill.  Nonetheless, the best interest principle could be strengthened in terms of having the "best interests of the child as a primary consideration", which would ensure Ireland is totally compliant with the European Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Given so much good work was done on an all-party basis in the previous D&aacute;il, that we have gone to the country and that the children's rights referendum has been passed, we should ensure that, while it is welcome it is included in the Bill, it is included as strongly as possible.  By including "primary consideration", we will ensure the best interest principle is inserted in the strongest way possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22013102200014#N00300"><p>Sections 9(1) and (2) must be read together.  It is very clear in section 9(2) that, when we are talking about the welfare of children, their care and safety or anything to do with the Adoption Act, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.  That is an important separation, whereby it is very clear that, in any of those issues to do with the welfare, care or protection of the child, the best interests of the child are paramount - it is actually stated as &quot;paramount consideration&quot;.</p><p>  When one is talking about the function of the agency, this amendment suggests that, from section 8(1) down, the best interests of the child should be the &quot;primary consideration&quot;.  I would have some concerns about this, and I will outline the reasons for this, bearing in mind that sections 9(1) and (2) need to be read together.</p><p>  Section 9(1) of the Bill refers to the agency &quot;making decisions about the performance of its functions&quot;.  This provision relates to the decisions the agency must make in terms of how it delivers services in accordance with priorities laid down in the performance framework set out by the Minister.  That provision is not only about decisions related to individual children in cases that involve them, but decisions on policy and strategy, for example, all of which must &quot;have regard to the best interests of the child&quot;.  Section 8(1)(<i>f</i>) states that one of the functions of the agency is to &quot;undertake or commission research into matters related to the functions&quot;.  Therefore, the Deputy is suggesting that, in that situation, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration.  I believe that &quot;having regard to the best interests of the child&quot; is strong and makes sense in terms of those provisions, while having it as a &quot;paramount consideration&quot; in regard to child care or adoption decisions is the right thing to do.  There is a separation where &quot;paramount&quot; is the guiding principle and where &quot;having regard to the best interests&quot; is the important thing.</p><p>  There is another point I would make for the Deputies' consideration.  The work of the agency may not be directly child-related in some instances, for example, in regard to marriage guidance counselling, bereavement counselling or domestic and sexual violence where a child may not be involved.  As we debated during the children's rights referendum, there is a question of the balance to be struck between these rights and the rights of others, including those deriving from the Constitution.  Obviously, &quot;primary&quot; gives a particular weighting in favour of the best interests of one individual child.  As I said, I believe the inclusion of &quot;paramount&quot;, where I have it in the legislation, is very important.</p><p>  I believe it is reasonable to ensure the &quot;best interests&quot; are considered and that decision making within the agency has a statutory underpinning for a child-centred approach.  As Deputy Troy rightly pointed out, there is a child-centred approach to the functions of the agency, which is expressed in various ways, depending on which functions we are talking about.  This seems to me the appropriate way to do it, for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22013102200014#N00400"><p>Section 9(2) is very particular.  It refers specifically to functions under the terms of the Child Care Act 1991 or the Adoption Act 2010, and very rightly makes the point in regard to "paramount consideration".  With Deputy Troy, I have put down a further amendment in regard to section 9(2) on which we will reflect in a few moments.  However, section 9(1), which we are seeking to strengthen, refers quite particularly to sections 8(1)(a), (b) and (c), which we addressed some time back in today's debate, and it would "have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters".  The two sections are most definitely not addressing the same issues and, while I acknowledge that subsection (2) is incorporated in subsection (1), subsection (2) deals with a whole other array of issues outside the terms of the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010.  Therefore, I believe that having "regard to the best interests of the child in all matters" in terms of section 9(1) falls far short of what should be there.  It is not contradictory in any way, nor is the language competing, for us to change section 9(1) to "as a primary consideration".</p><p>  The Minister then went on to section 9(2) in the context of the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010, where the term is "paramount consideration".  I suppose one could argue that "paramount" gives it an even stronger connotation.  However, I have no doubt in regard to all of the other matters that pertain in regard to children, and which the agency will have responsibility for outside the terms of the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010, that we need to affirm in the strongest possible terms the "primary consideration" of the best interests of the child.</p><p>  I believe this is what is required.  The term "having regard to" does not, of itself, compel in terms of decisions made or outcomes arrived at.  There could be situations where decisions were taken where the best interests of the child were clearly not the end result in any consideration.  That simply would not be tolerable, in my view.</p> <p>This is about children.  What was wrong in the past was that children's interests were not given primary or indeed paramount consideration.  I welcome the use of that phraseology in section 9(2).  It is long past time they were given primary consideration and not just regard, never mind 'due regard'.  People could claim they had given regard to the interests of the child - in order words, taken them into consideration - but that does not of itself necessarily mean that the outcome was in the best interest of the child and that other competing interests were not given precedence or preference.  I do not want to see a situation in which competing interests have preference over the best interests of a child, who cannot fight his or her own corner or represent himself or herself as we would wish.  We want to see not only the best interests of children confirmed but their voice and views fully taken into account.  That is what my amendment No. 15 seeks to establish.  I think we need to start off at the best possible point, which in my view means moving from the words "have regard to the best interest of the child in all matters" to "regard the best interests of the child as a primary consideration." in section 9(1).  I thought we had all arrived at that consensus some considerable time ago.</p></speech>

That is why the text is currently phrased as it is.</p><p>  I would like to consider this amendment further and I will examine the question of how it interacts with the function of the agency.  Given the broad range of functions the agency has and the broad range of services it provides, I have very strong legal advice that the consideration of other rights may come into play and that the wording "have regard to the best interests of the child..." is the appropriate formulation.  It is a key issue with regard to children.  The wording of section 9(2), which states that the agency shall "regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration" is very strong.  I would be prepared to have further discussion on this on Report Stage if the Deputy withdraws his amendment.  I believe it is a critical issue.  As I have stated, I have very clear legal advice that the formulation I have arrived at is the appropriate one for the range of functions and services to be provided by the agency and the competing rights of the family, parents and other service users that may come into play.</p><p>  I feel that we have the strongest legal formulation for the rights of the child at the core of the agency.  I am prepared to examine this again and come back on Report Stage for a further discussion.</p></speech>

This is not about trying to create engagement.  My sincere belief was that all of us - not just Deputy Troy and myself - had reached this point.  I proudly applauded time after time the evidence of shared intent across all political views in these Houses to arrive at the best position in the interests of children.  That is the reason I welcome and will support the passage of the Bill.  I want it to reflect what I believe we have all embraced over a considerable period.  Having checked with Deputy Troy, I know we are both agreeable to withdrawing the amendment in our names at this point, and we reserve the opportunity to resubmit an amendment on Report Stage.  If the Minister wishes to engage with us in the interim to explain her position, we can re-evaluate whether we need to do that.</p><p>  I do not believe that my proposed section 9(1) will be in conflict with section 9(2), which affirms that the interest of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  I do not believe the two are mutually exclusive.  That would not be my understanding of it.  I commend the wording to the Minister, but on behalf of Deputy Troy, I will withdraw it.</p></speech>

I believe that is important.  We are making it clear there are a number of scenarios that would and could present in which the legislation would be a central focus of consideration of the child's interest, whether that be in a court setting or otherwise, and we would expect nothing less than paramount consideration of the best interests of the child.  I think it is self-evident.  Deputy Troy might like to add to my contribution.</p></speech>

It must be recognised in the Bill that the agency will be working with children and families in a wide range of settings under the legal framework of the Child Care Act 1991.  In that context, the wording in our amendment, "whether in proceedings before a court or otherwise", would give a very explicit meaning.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment today, I hope she may consider it in conjunction with the previous amendment and introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991 is explicit in this regard with respect to the application of best interest and covers any action of the agency in the context of fulfilling its functions under the Act.  This includes arrangements in respect of the adoption of a child in section 6.  The consideration of best interest in court-related proceedings is a matter for the relevant court or relevant decision-making body.  Section 24 of the Child Care Act states:<blockquote><br />In any proceedings before a court under this Act with regard to the care and protection of a child, the court, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, shall--(<i>a</i>) regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration</blockquote>while section 19 of the Adoption Act 2010 states:<blockquote>In any matter, application or proceedings before(<i>a</i>) the Authority, or<br />(<i>b</i>) any court,relating to the question of the arrangements for the adoption of a child, for the making of an adoption order or for the recognition of an inter-country adoption outside the State, the Authority or the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</blockquote>  I am satisfied the provision I have made has intended effect in section 9 of creating a child-centred approach to decision making, while restating the specific requirements for paramountcy in certain specified processes.  I do not see a reason to restate the provision relating to proceedings before a court or the adoption authority in the current Bill.  Therefore, I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-10-22a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE22013102200016#P02700"><p>That is okay.  I move amendment No. 17:<blockquote><br />In page 13, lines 33 to 36, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:&#8220;(3) The Agency shall consult when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under <i>section 8(1)</i>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) where relevant, and ensure that due consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation processes undertaken.&#8221;.</blockquote>My amendment seeks to substitute section 9(3), and the important language employed, which reads:<blockquote>The Agency shall, when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under 35 <i>section 8(1)(a), (b) </i>or <i>(c)</i>, ensure that consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation processes undertaken.</blockquote>My view is that the word &quot;consult&quot; is critically important and also &quot;due consideration&quot;, not just &quot;consideration&quot;.  The original subsection needs to be strengthened.  The real intent of members here, across the board, is properly reflected in the language that the Bill employs.  Therefore, if my amendment was accepted, the substitute subsection would read as follows:<blockquote>(3) The Agency shall consult when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions under <i>section 8(1)(a)</i>, <i>(b)</i> or <i>(c)</i> where relevant, and ensure that due consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation processes undertaken. </blockquote>The key point is the addition of the word &quot;consult&quot; after &quot;The Agency shall&quot;, because that is what it needs to do.  Consultation is not an absolute requirement under the existing wording.  Part of the existing provision, as things stand, is the phrase &quot;as part of any consultation processes undertaken.&quot;  However, &quot;shall consult&quot; is a direction for what the agency should do.  </p><p>  At present subsection (3) states: &quot;The Agency shall ... ensure that consideration is given.&quot;  That is what is being asked of it.  My amendment seeks that the first thing that the agency will do is to &quot;consult when planning and reviewing the provision of services&quot;, and in addition, not only consideration but &quot;due consideration&quot; must be given.  The addition of the word &quot;due&quot; emphasises the extent and depth of what we expect.  I commend my amendment to the Minister and to the members of the committee.</p></speech>

The matter was brought to my attention by a Children's Rights Alliance submission, which stated the following:<blockquote><br />A 2011 report on children's rights commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children, analysing ten cases which came before the Office, found that &quot;the individual children appeared to be largely invisible in the decision-making process&quot;.   In her 2012 Annual Report, the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, highlighted the lack of awareness amongst decision-makers of the detrimental impact that administrative decisions can have on children and their families.  She criticised how these decisions were made with little or no regard for children's rights noting: &quot;[i]n particular, the parameters of the child's best interests and the child's right to be heard were not used to guide administrative decision making to any great extent, if at all&quot;.  Logan cites cases involving a lack of access to education, separating children from their parents and cases where children could not access necessary therapeutic equipment recommended by health professionals, due to bureaucratic processes.  It is important to ensure the administrative decisions taken by all Agency employees impacting on individual children's lives will be covered by Section 9.  This should apply in all cases of very young children as well as non-verbal children.</blockquote></p></speech>

Reviewing the provision of services could have the unintended effect of paralysing management decision-making, diffusing responsibility for decisions taken and delaying necessary change when responsiveness is critical.  Obviously consultation is very important but I see this as bedded in performance management at both organisational and individual senior management level.  I do not believe the amendments sought will have the desired effect.  I wish to point out that my amendment No. 20 does have the effect of broadening the consultation that is done with children.  Also, section 9(4) is very strong on the expression of the child's own views and such views being given due weight.  My amendment No. 23 also covers the same issue.</p></speech>

That is a very reasonable expectation and requirement.  Using the word "consideration", not "due consideration", makes it too simple to dismiss and too easy for the agency to say it has met the criteria.  The provision needs to stand up.  We must deliver a clear message by using the words "due consideration", which is the best way I can strengthen what is intended and what is presented to us in section 9(3) as it stands.  I regret that the Minister is unwilling to accept my amendment and therefore shall press my amendment.</p></speech>

Let us remember how we debated and discussed, in recent times, a review of our legislative processes and brought about a change in how we do our business here.  For new legislation, the idea is that we consult with a much wider range of people whom it will affect.  It is good enough for us to do so from a legislative point of view.  Therefore, it is important that the agency should consult when bringing about the provision of services that directly affect people.</p></speech>
