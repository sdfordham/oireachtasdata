Another area of involvement is what we call the "blueway".  The success of the Great Western Greenway has in turn prompted the development of a parallel water-based or "blueway" experience, which would draw upon the marine potential of our natural heritage in a manner similar to the rail line.  The concept behind the development of the blueway is to develop a scheme that encourages visitors, coming from the land, to engage with the sea in a pilot area along the west coast of counties Galway and Mayo that includes the coastline from Clifden, Inishbofin, Killary Harbour and on to Achill.  The blueway will serve as a network of "free water trails" where the visitor can have a go at activities such as kayaking and snorkelling in a safe controlled environment.  The consumer can decide to engage with this opportunity at a single site along the blueway or can have the experience of a continual guided water-based adventure along the west coast from south Galway to north-west Mayo.  Other water sports, such as surfing and angling, are also supported through various festivals and events, media familiarisation trips and business supports at other destinations elsewhere on the coastline.</p></speech>

I live by the coast and it is fair to say it is one of the best resources anywhere in Europe if it could be properly developed and exploited.  Mr. Pender outlined in his presentation the work in which F&aacute;ilte Ireland is engaged in order to increase tourism numbers.</p><p>  Mr. Pender referred to the Atlantic way.  I happened to be in west Cork for two days over the weekend meeting with fishermen and fishing communities.  I noticed the large volume of tourists in the fishing areas along the coast there.  We find it very difficult in Donegal to attract visitors to Donegal.  I spoke to people involved in businesses along the coast in Cork and in Donegal and they said the tourism season is getting shorter.  There might be an explanation for that in certain coastal areas.  I am teasing out the issue in order to find an explanation for the reason we are not able to get the same number of tourists into the north west as other parts of the country seem to enjoy.  Is there a reason for that.  Mr. Pender outlined the funding that has been made available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100006#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Pender for the presentation.  The Government's published integrated marine plan for enhancing our ocean wealth fits into the greater plan and all coastal and rural TDs will support it.</p><p> The agency working with the private sector was mentioned.  Is there any buy-in from the private sector?  Has it been forthcoming?  The need for it is enormous.</p><p>  I come from Ardfert, just alongside Banna Strand in north Kerry, and I am always struck by the stark difference between the promotion of the Ring of Kerry, in the south of the county, compared to lack of promotion of any ring in north Kerry.  There are fantastic areas from Banna Strand to Beale beach, north Kerry hill right up to the mouth of the Shannon.  While there might be support for this, there does not seem to be any link-up between communities, the private sector and agencies to develop something that would complement the growth of Kerry rather than just south Kerry.</p><p>  The Wild Atlantic Way is a great project, covering the entire west coast from Donegal to west Cork.  I am open to correction but it is my view that way should be linked with the angling and island visiting.  It might be happening in some areas but I am not aware of it.  If we could have a joined-up approach, people will go on a walking tour along the west coast and will enjoy the facilities to take them offshore to the islands or for sea angling.  That would be hugely beneficial.</p><p>  The reopening of disused railway lines for tourism purposes has been contentious in many areas.  The lines are owned by the public and there is usually a wrong approach to adjoining farm owners.  There must be a way around because these offer great potential for cycling and walking.</p><p>  It was interesting that there is a hope to double the value of the coastal marine asset.  It is encouraging because it is very beautiful and if it is marketed properly internationally, there could be benefits for everyone in the sector.  It was mentioned that coastal communities have been decimated by the collapse of the inshore fishing fleet.  It is of huge importance this is developed to give an income that is badly needed to those in coastal communities, addressing the huge emigration from those areas.</p><p>  Never in my life has it been more important to create some way to get people to spend money, particularly in the west and south of Ireland.  Is there any link with the coast of the Six Counties and then on to the east coast?  There are some beautiful areas, such as County Down, County Antrim, the Giant's Causeway, right around to the west coast.  What is the connection with the corresponding organisation in the Six Counties?</p></speech>

It is one of the more exciting things I get to do because it is one of the few areas where we can possibly contribute to the regeneration of rural areas.  So much of what we do in both Houses of the Oireachtas is predicated on decisions made in Brussels and Strasbourg and this is one of the few areas where there is scope for Ireland to move forward autonomously.</p><p>  The Doolin to Liscannor walkway was mentioned and I look forward to seeing the group in Liscannor on Friday morning.  Doolin is on the edge of Galway Bay.  Would a fish farm in the middle of the bay be a big tourist attraction?  Would many people come to see one of the biggest fish farms in Europe in the middle of Galway Bay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100007#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Pender and his colleagues and thank them for the presentation.  I will first refer to a few issues in a strategic manner, rather than discussing specific projects.  We need to explore the potential of tourism and how best to arrive at an integrated approach to developing it.  It would be worthwhile commissioning an independent study on developing rural recreation and marine leisure, two areas where there is not a heap of difference.  If, for example, one is descending a cliff, is one engaged in marine leisure or rural recreation?  If one falls into the sea, one is definitely engaged in a marine leisure activity.  From the perspective of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is angling on Lough Corrib much different in tourism terms from sea angling?  Similarly, does it make a difference to F&aacute;ilte Ireland if one is engaged in an activity on an island as opposed to in the sea off the island?  In my view, rural recreation and marine leisure are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>  It would be interesting to list all the possible activities and then try to calculate how many additional jobs we could create sustainably if we were to take a strategic decision to realise 80% of this potential.  For example, I believe the number of rural walkers increased by approximately 800,000 in the period from 2000 to 2009 and I presume the figure has increased further in the meantime.  I believe the target at the time was to have 1 million visitors who considered walking an important part of their holiday.  It could be clearly demonstrated that tourism, which is spread throughout the country, has the potential to create as many new jobs as foreign direct investment.  </p><p>  We also need a framework plan on how to realise the potential of tourism.  This should include an investment plan identifying the private and public sources of potential investment in the sector.  We must be careful to allow initiative and enable people to work within a framework because so much of tourism is based on personality, rather than being in the best place.  While some areas may not be optimal in terms of geographical location, provided the right person does the job properly, he or she may make a success of it.  On the other hand, persons operating in perfect conditions may not succeed.  For this reason we need a co-ordinated framework that will provide integrated products and encourage people to develop.</p><p>  I remember making a list of outdoor activities to which Ireland lends itself.  If we were to compile such a list, we would fill up more sheets of paper than the presentation before us.  To focus first on the sea, we have especially clear waters where one can engage in snorkelling, diving, swimming and surfing.  With wet suits, some of these activities are no longer as unattractive as they used to be; surfing, for example, is a major growth industry.  In my role in a previous Government, I used to attend the boat show every year to meet my counterpart from Northern Ireland as part of our responsibility for Waterways Ireland.  While I am not interested in yachts, my jaw used to drop at the show which featured everything from small dinghies, kayaks and canoes to the largest ocean-going yacht.  I and my Northern colleague used to have our photograph taken in front of the latter in order that we could tell our respective Ministers that we wanted to buy it.  We were codding and joking.  </p><p>  In Galway, we have Lough Atalia, from which one must sail under a bridge at Claregalway to access the open sea, Galway Bay and the open Atlantic.  We have waters that suit every type of vessel, from ocean-going yachts to smaller vessels that one would not take far from shore.  We also have cliff climbing, wake boarding, sea angling and so forth.  One could list the various sea activities all afternoon, before starting on activities which take place both at sea and on land.  One then has land-based activities such as archaeology.  I do not believe we have a comprehensive plan to develop such activities.   For a long time, I tried to have marine leisure and rural recreation dealt with by one body.  </p></speech>

The only reason work on the Mayo line was commenced first was because Mayo County Council grabbed the bait and ran with it.  If a community does not want something one should move on to the next community that does want it.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Pender's response on the structure issue.  I do not always favour changes to structure but in this case there is logic in having rural recreation and marine leisure dealt with by one body.  I do not care which Department takes responsibility for it.  We should also have a comhairle na tuaithe and a comhairle na mara, both of which would develop the sector and bring all players around the table.  When we previously did this in respect of rural recreation we achieved significant results in terms of access to walkways, mountains and so on.  If the policy we had been pursuing had been continued some 80% of our mountains would now be mapped and opened up to people.</p><p>  I am interested in hearing the delegates view on whether we should take a structural approach to this; if this should be recognised as a major growth industry and if we should have in place a comprehensive plan similar to that proposed in regard to marine development along the coast?  I understand that in terms of marine leisure a necklace of areas is required as people want to keep moving on.  In this regard, there is a need for a planned approach countrywide.  I understand that had a planned approach been taken to this it could have been funded by the market, leaving State funding to areas further up the west coast and so on.  </p><p>  We all have a duty to our constituents.  A particular aspect of tourism, in respect of which we already have open and closed facilities and which I understand can be quite lucrative, is flying club tourism.  I understand there are a number of flying clubs on our neighbouring island which require somewhere to fly into.  I recall being told by my local parish priest, who had bought a plane which he piloted between the islands, that the market for flying clubs on the west coast of Ireland, in terms of overnight stays, etc. was huge.  If one supplied those involved with enough booze they could be kept there forever.  This is not an activity that comes easily to mind.  We have two completed and marked airstrips in Cleggan and Inishbofin which are far superior to those on the Aran Islands, which are owned by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and are not opened even for private flights despite that no air terminals, fire engines and so on are required.  This to me appears to be a waste of resources.  This is just another of the hidden gems we have from archaeology to trails, railways lines, mills, lighthouses and so on that are a huge fascination to tourists and make up for the lack of sunshine here.  I am interested in hearing if the delegates believe this to be another potential source of tourism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100008#G00400"><p>Four areas, in terms of increasing the potential of rural coastal communities and islands to develop sustainable economies, have been identified.  Mr. Pender referred extensively in his submission to sea angling.  Deputy McNamara asked about the impact of aquaculture on tourism.  We are trying to develop a template that would assist development of coastal and island communities and to identify the proper mix in this regard, including if there are initiatives outside of tourism that could be taken but would compromise tourism.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to structural alterations.  Could a better structural system be put in place to deal specifically with these communities?  There are a huge range of initiatives out there.  The 159 destinations on the Wild Atlantic Way should in theory touch on many of the communities which we are trying to develop.  That is by way of background from someone from the uplands of the east.  The walkways referenced are along the coast.  As everybody else has been parochial, the cliff walk from Bray to Greystones is very good, although it probably already has sufficient users and the communities concerned are not in the same situation.  That is my observations on the contributions today from Mr. Pender and members.  </p><p>  I invite Mr. Pender and his colleagues to respond at this point to the questions raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Pender" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100008#G00500"><p>I will first respond to some of the general points made, which will allow me to provide some context on our thinking process.  If members wish to come in again later and to contribute to or influence that thinking process, we would welcome their thoughts.</p><p>  A number of specific points and questions have been made.  My colleagues may be better positioned to respond to some of the specific questions.  I will respond first to the general issues of principle and will then invite my colleagues to respond to the questions relevant to them.  If we have overlooked any point made, the Chairman can let us know and we will come back to it.</p><p>  In terms of local communities, including coastal communities, one of the things we have been particularly concerned to do in the past number of years is give consideration to who captures the economic gains of tourism.  Our tourism industry currently generates approximately &euro;5.6 billion.  Concern is often expressed about tourism being more concentrated in one place than another.  The spatial distribution issue in terms of how the economic gains of the tourism industry are spatially distributed is also often raised.  Tourism is an industry of every parish.  It is unique in that it is not like a financial services centre which exists in only one place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mathews" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100009#H00200"><p>I have only a couple of points to make.  In regard to the Wild Atlantic Way, we have secured an agreement with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to establish a formal link with the causeway coastal route.  Reciprocal signage will be put in place so that, for example, drivers coming to the end of the wild Atlantic way will be encouraged to continue to the causeway coastal route, and vice versa.  Tourism Ireland is very happy with this initiative because it offers something to promote on a greater scale in overseas markets.</p><p>  The key objective of the way is to provide something of scale and singularity in order to raise visibility in overseas markets and highlight areas of the west coast that traditionally have not attracted large numbers of tourists, such as north Kerry, north Mayo and Donegal, by packaging them in a single overarching brand.  However, it is important that the marketing done by us domestically and Tourism Ireland internationally also accentuates the distinctive characteristics of areas along the way and to avoid the impression that it is homogeneous.  There are key differentiating factors and character areas along the route.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethna Murphy" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013061100010#J00200"><p>I will pick up on a number of the points raised by members before making a number of points myself in respect of walking and angling.  I may also comment on the potential which lighthouses offer and on the lighthouse stock to which Deputy McNamara referred.  I will highlight some examples of extensive buy-in on the part of the private sector.  I can inform Deputy Martin Ferris that when good-quality infrastructure is built by the State and its agencies, on many occasions those in the private sector - particularly, small businesses - are very forthcoming in using and sweating that asset very well.</p><p>  It was stated that walking has become more popular and that there has been a great increase in the number of visitors who come to this country on walking holidays.  There were 740,000 such holidaymakers last year.  It is interesting to note that the figure for those who come here on walking holidays has grown year on year.  This growth has been supported by the investment plan initiated in 2007 or 2008.  If ever there was an example of how investment has delivered a return, then this is it.  The trick now is to examine the position with regard to this investment, to consider the situation with regard to the existing infrastructure and to identify, in a very strategic manner, the areas where we would like to deploy assets or energy during the coming years.  We must also examine the possibility of developing more plans and increase our efforts in respect of interpreting existing walks.  We must recount the history of the culture and the communities which are responsible for those walks.</p><p>  A good example of something that is emerging is in Donegal where we are working with the community to develop, perhaps, a leg of the International Appalachian Trail.  We are doing this because the geology fits and because we were approached by the International Appalachian Association in the US in the context of developing a leg of the trail from Donegal to Northern Ireland.  This is a matter on which we are working with a number of partners.  In the context of tourism, having that type of brand recognition in a big market such as the US would hopefully result in more visitors from that market coming to the north west.  It is important to state that none of this would have come about if there had not been a strong partnership approach.  Comhairle na Tuaithe was instrumental in facilitating access to the relevant land.  A number of schemes that were part and parcel of this approach were also extremely important.  We are currently working with the national trails office and we will be conducting a review of the trails throughout the country.  From our point of view, we would like to prioritise the areas on which we should spend more money and in respect of which we should expend more energy in developing interpretation and animation of trails.  Good work has been done in respect of infrastructure but there is a need to bring it to the next level.</p><p>  Mr. Pender alluded to the increase in the number of visitors coming to Ireland for angling, particularly sea angling.  We would probably need to carry out further research on the overall picture but in the context of sea angling, there is huge interest within our European markets.  Our largest market for angling is the UK.  We are finding evidence of increasing numbers of UK anglers coming to Ireland to participate in shore angling, particularly in respect of bass.  The latter is the only species which is managed for recreational angling purposes.  The fact that there has been a ban in place here in respect of the commercial fishing of bass for some time has led to massive recognition of and kudos for our efforts within the UK angling community in particular.  We are building a reputation for offering the best quality bass angling experience in Europe.  This is certainly a matter which we, in conjunction with the various agencies and partners, would be keen to explore further.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara's comment on lighthouses is correct.  This is a resource on which we would be extremely interested in working.  We have had a number of meetings with the Commissioners of Irish Lights and collectively we are putting together a plan which will hopefully result in the development of a lighthouse trail along our coastline.  More importantly, however, we must consider how this asset will fit with existing developments such as the Wild Atlantic Way and add major value to people's holiday experience.  Evidence of such added value can be seen in the south east in the context of Hook Head lighthouse, etc.  We are actively engaged in developing this project at present.</p><p>  In the context of partnerships and input from the private sector, Mr. Pender referred to the greenway.  There are, however, other examples of where we have invested in infrastructure and of where the private sector has come on board.  The economic impact study carried out approximately one year after the greenway was completed highlighted the number of new businesses which had developed additional services on the back of the investment in this regard.  We are hopeful that the "blueway" infrastructure will realise a great deal of marine activities such as kayaking, angling, snorkelling, diving, etc.</p></speech>

If more lighthouses and other loss leaders are to be opened up, more social economy will be required whereby unemployed people will be brought in and paid a little extra.  These places will provide basic focal points for people to visit.  How important is this in developing the product?</p></speech>

It is quite apparent they have a comprehensive grasp of the areas on which we are concentrating.  The meeting has been very helpful for us.  Sea angling overlaps the commercial and tourism sectors and these were covered in great detail for us today.  We want to come up with a template which allows coastal and rural communities develop and which allows us to focus on them.  The committee should recommend to the Government the establishment of such a template.  The committee members have been very engaged with the witnesses and I thank them for attending.

On the previous occasion, a detailed description of the organisation &ndash; its background, remit, structure, financing and programming priorities &ndash; were provided to the committee and while we are more than happy to answer questions from members on these and any other aspects of the organisation, this opening statement will concentrate on the major progress that has been made across the range of programmes in which we are involved.</p><p>  In March 2012, Animal Health Ireland published its strategy for the period 2012 to 2014.  The strategy, which was developed following extensive consultation with stakeholders, set out clear strategic priorities for the organisation for the period up to the end of 2014, and identified four priority programmes in which AHI will concentrate its resources over these three years.  These are bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, mastitis-somatic cell count, the CellCheck programme, Johne&rsquo;s disease and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR.  An outline of the progress made in relation to each of these programmes is provided hereafter, and members are invited to inspect the detailed business plans for these programmes, which are available from the AHI website.  In addition to the four priority programmes, the strategic plan also committed AHI to undertaking work in the areas of biosecurity, calf health, parasite control and animal health economics.  Taking account of the level of resources available to the organisation, the strategy sought to establish clear limits as to the scope of AHI&rsquo;s activities; a clear decision was taken, for example, to limit our work to the bovine species for the period covered by the plan.</p><p>  BVD is a disease of considerable economic importance to Irish farmers.  A cost-benefit analysis commissioned by AHI placed the losses associated with this infection at &euro;102 million per annum.  The objective of the programme is to eradicate BVD from the national cattle herd by the end of 2020.  Following the successful completion of a voluntary phase of the programme in 2012, in which some 10,000 farmers participated, the programme entered a compulsory phase on 1 January 2013.  The legislative basis of the programme is provided by SI No. 532/2012 (Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Order 2012), which was published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> on 28 December, 2012.  Some of the key points of this order include: A requirement to test all calves born from 1 January 2013 onwards; a prohibition on sale of calves without a negative BVD result; and a requirement to carry out follow-up testing where persistently infected, PI, animals are identified.</p><p>  The compulsory phase of the programme is divided into two three-year periods.  In the first of these, running from 2013 to 2015, the emphasis is on tissue tag testing of newborn calves, using the modified national identity tag, with follow-up testing by blood sample and tag testing, as required.  The second period, running from 2016 to 2018, will see the emphasis switching to monitoring by means of targeted blood and milk sampling.  The level of farmer compliance with the programme in 2013 has been generally very good, with BVD test results on the ICBF database for over 97% of all calves registered.  As of 3 June, 1,559,978 results had been recorded on the database since 1 January, and the prevalence of positive and inconclusive animals, at 0.73%, is very close to that which had been modelled by AHI prior to the commencement of the programme.  AHI does have some concern at the rate at which PI animals are being retained on farms following identification, our data indicating that approximately 50% of these remain alive on the farms in which they were disclosed.  The AHI technical working group on BVD is currently examining the potential impact on the programme objectives and timelines of the retention on farms of these highly infectious animals.</p><p>  High somatic cell counts, SCC, an indicator of mastitis, have a major impact on the profitability of dairy farmers and dairy processors.  A recent Teagasc study of the economic impact of mastitis on the profit of Irish dairy farms at five somatic cell count, SCC, thresholds showed a very significant inverse correlation between SCC and net farm profit.  On the basis of this research, it can be stated that the average dairy farmer can improve net profitability by at least 1 cent per litre by improving mastitis control to reduce SCC to achievable and sustainable levels.  Teagasc has just completed a second phase of the research, which will shortly be published and which will show that mastitis imposes significant additional costs at the processor level.</p><p>  The CellCheck programme is the national mastitis control programme, which is co-ordinated and facilitated by Animal Health Ireland, and which is being developed and delivered in partnership with industry bodies representing farmers, processors, service providers and the Government.  The objective of the programme is to facilitate the achievement and maintenance of a national average bulk milk somatic cell count of 200,000 cells per ml or less by 2020.  The various sub-objectives are to: Set goals for improved SCC performance in the national dairy herd; build awareness of the problem among farmers and service providers; establish best practice for the control of mastitis; build the capacity of farmers and service providers to address this problem; and evaluate changes in the performance of the national dairy herd with respect to SCC.</p><p>  Mastitis is a multi-factorial problem and the CellCheck programme attempts to address this by adopting a multidisciplinary approach, which involves the farmer, veterinary practitioner, milking machine technician, co-op milk quality advisers and Teagasc or other farm adviser.  To date, some 240 service providers have been trained to deliver farmer workshops, approximately 40 of which have taken place to date this year.  Programme resources which have been developed to date include the CellCheck farm guidelines, the CostCheck economic cost calculator and a detailed milk quality report, which is available to all farmers involved in milk recording.</p><p>  The objectives of the Johne&rsquo;s disease programme are threefold.  First, to identify a core population of herds that test negative for Johne&rsquo;s disease and to provide these farmers with the knowledge and professional supports to allow them to increase their confidence of being free of infection over time and to protect their herds from the ongoing risk of introduction of this disease.  Second, to provide herds identified by the programme, or otherwise, as being infected, with the knowledge and professional supports to allow them to control and reduce the disease over time and ultimately move to a situation where a high confidence of disease freedom can be achieved.  Third, to further underpin the quality of Irish dairy and beef produce in the international marketplace.</p><p>  Considerable work has been in progress since 2010, by the AHI technical working group for Johne&rsquo;s disease, under the chairmanship of Professor Simon More of UCD.  The programme design developed by the TWG draws on international best practice for the control of the disease and on detailed disease modelling, carried out in conjunction with international consultants.  AHI has also convened an implementation group, comprising all relevant stakeholder organisations, to carry forward the work of implementing and refining a control programme.  The implementation group is currently examining the feasibility of rolling out a major pilot programme for the control of Johne&rsquo;s disease, the components of which would be as follows: an information and awareness campaign, aimed at improving the understanding of Johne&rsquo;s disease among farmers, veterinary practitioners and the industry; a process of initial herd screening for participating herds, based on blood or individual milk samples; a mechanism for capturing the results of testing which has already been undertaken by processor groups and individual farmers and which is aligned with the structured programme; the roll-out of a programme of farm advisory and risk assessment training involving participating farmers and accredited, trained veterinary practitioners; the development of a national database for the management of the disease, which will be hosted by ICBF; the development of the capacity to operate a system of risk-based trading for participating herds; and the establishment of a process of designation for laboratories carrying out testing as part of the programme.</p><p>  In addition to the economic costs arising from direct farm-level losses, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR, is also important because of the impact which it has on the ability of bulls to enter approved semen collection centres and because of the potential interference with live trade to countries which have approved control programmes in place and which have been granted additional guarantees by the European Commission, entitling them to apply restrictions to the importation of cattle from states which do not have approved control programmes in place.  AHI intends to undertake a cost-benefit analysis to establish the rationale or otherwise for the initiation of a national programme for the eradication of IBR.</p></speech>

Going back to BVD, it was mentioned that only 50% of PI animals have been disposed of.  Should there be some incentive for people to get rid of these animals or is the economic argument sufficient to move them?  Are we not compensating them because of current economic circumstances rather than breaking the precedent we had with other animals with a disease that we felt should be taken out of the herd, where we paid farmers for doing so?</p><p>  If farmers were to be compensated for taking out these animals, how many would be involved and at what cost?  It would appear to me numbers would be relatively small, about 0.37%.</p><p>  It was stated that IBR was an influence on the live trade.  Can that be quantified?  How does it restrict the live trade?  What countries does it restrict us to?  What is the economic cost, taking into account that the more markets we have, the more likely it is that the existing markets will give a better price, because there will be more competition?  We must avoid a situation where a small number of players control the whole market.  I am interested to hear about the economic implications of not dealing with that disease.</p></speech>

The major issue with BVD is lack of compensation, with 50% remaining on farms.  From personal experience, I know very small farmers with perhaps half a dozen or ten calves.  They cannot take any losses, which is a huge factor, so a compensation package is very important if we are to achieve eradication.</p><p>  The EHA places a loss associated with infection at &euro;102 million per annum.  Is that based on the 50% reported figure without taking the other animals into consideration?  I welcome the fact that the presentation stated that the all-Ireland approach was of benefit in any sort of disease eradication programme and animal welfare in general.  It appears the group is satisfied with how it is working and the co-operation in the Six Counties, a welcome fact.</p></speech>

I am alarmed only 50% of PIs have been removed from the herd.  It was mentioned there will be screening for Johne's disease.  How many herds does the group hope to screen to get an accurate indication of the problem in Ireland?  The presentation on the four diseases outlined a budget of &euro;338,000 on overall expenditure.</p><p>  Are there any data in other countries for an IBR screening programme on the percentage drop in the disease once the programme started?  On the BVD figures, where only 0.73% animals are showing up as persistently infected, are there any comparative figures from other countries that have screening programmes for IBR?  Would it be cost effective to have a screening programme for this? </p></speech>

It is worrying to see only 50% of affected animals have been taken out.  How dangerous are those animals if they are left there?  I know of a couple of cases where the animals have been isolated but how dangerous would they be to animals in neighbouring fields or from time to time with animals in the herd?  Where the cow is not a PI, it is difficult to see how the calf can be a PI.</p><p>  It is important to adapt an all-Ireland approach to all animal health issues.</p></speech>

I have same concerns about BVD but I would highlight the mastitis and cell count issue.  The figures in the survey that was completed by Teagasc recently speak for themselves.  If there are under 100,000 cells per millilitre, the usual net farm profit amounts to &euro;31,000 compared to a net profit of &euro;11,748 if the count is over 400,000.  That is alarming.  The target is to bring that to an average of 200,000 by 2020 but that is quite conservative.  It is eight years away and quality milk production is crucial, particularly as we try to increase production.  What part will Teagasc play?  Cell count is a difficult issue to sort out, with culling at an aggressive rate one of the few solutions.</p></speech>

The target cell count for mastitis was set out but what is the cell count at present if we want it to be 200,000 per millilitre by 2020?  What are the ramifications of the count being higher than 200,000?</p></speech>

With the projected increase in the bovine population, both suckler and dairy, under Food Harvest 2020, is there a need for extra focus on diseases like Johne's and IBR against that background?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flaherty" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061100005#G00100"><p>I will first address a number of questions related to the points members made on bovine viral diarrhea, BVD, and the retention of persistently infected animals on farms.  It is correct that the figures available to us on the database, which is operated by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, show that the average level of retention on farms is 50%.  I will ask Mr. Graham to comment on this shortly.  It is also correct that this profile varies over time.  For example, in the earlier weeks of the year, the level of deaths or the number of removals of animals from farms is higher, which means the percentage of retentions is lower.  The figure tails off as one approaches the current period.  Nonetheless, it is correct that the average retention rate for persistently infected animals identified since the start of the year is 50%.  These animals are undoubtedly a biosecurity risk to the farms in question and potentially neighbouring farms.  The primary risk, however, is in the trading of these animals.  Once an animal has been identified as a persistently infected, it cannot move to another farm, either through marts or by means of a private sale.  While that risk at least has been eliminated, some significant risks remain.  For example, there is a risk that the animal will transmit the infection to cattle on a neighbouring farm, perhaps across a ditch.  There is also a risk to the farmer because the disease is infectious and the organism can be transmitted on the clothing or person of the operator.</p><p>  We only became aware of the overall figure in recent weeks through interrogation of the database.  We have referred the issue to our technical working group which will produce an opinion on the potential impact of this on our programme timelines and objectives.  We await the group's opinion with considerable interest. </p><p>  On the question raised by members on the potential for compensation to address this matter, as chairman of the implementation group, it is safe to say I reflect the overall view of the group when I state we would welcome some degree of targeted compensation as a means of stimulating farmers who are inclined to retain infected animals to get rid of them promptly.  I should balance that comment by noting that this disease primarily causes harm to the farmer who has the disease.  As such, the benefits of controlling or eradicating the disease largely accrue to the farmer.  There is, therefore, a balance to be struck between, on the one hand, the farmer taking control of an issue which damages his or her business and, on the other, the potential for the State to provide some sort of limited financial support which may encourage farmers to do the right thing.  The farm organisations have put a proposal to the Minister in respect of providing a targeted support and I understand the Department is considering the proposal.  I do not know the outcome of its deliberations at this point.  </p><p>  With the permission of the Chairman, I will ask him Mr. Graham, our expert on BVD and IBR, to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Graham" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061100005#G00200"><p>I will discuss several of the issues that have been raised.  A technical question was asked concerning the basis on which a calf whose mother is not persistently infected becomes persistently infected.  The infection takes place prior to birth.  If the unborn calf in the first 90 to 120 days of pregnancy becomes infected with the virus and is carried to term, it will be born persistently infected.  If it is not persistently infected at birth, it will not become persistently infected subsequently.  Evidence shows that the majority of PI calves are created where the mother has no previous immunity, comes in contact with another persistently infected animal and undergoes what is described as a transient infection.  She then becomes infected and develops an immunity of her own and while she will fight off the infection, the virus passes to the unborn calf.  Having said that, under the programme, where a virus positive calf is identified, the mother will be flagged as being at particular risk and will need to be examined.  If one takes the prevalence figure for calves, which is between 0.6% and 0.7% , one finds that, depending on how one does the measurement, between 6% and 10% of the mothers are virus positive and persistently infected.  The vast majority of infections of PI calves are created through a transient infection of the mother.  For this reason, it is critical to identify and remove PI calves as soon as possible after birth because they are the source of the widespread transient infections.  This is the point at which we can break the cycle.</p><p>  On the impact of retaining persistently infected animals, part of the communications strategy in the programme has been to emphasise three key points.  First, persistently infected calves typically do not thrive or survive and only a minority of them will reach breeding or slaughter age, depending on breed and sex.  There is, therefore, a significant element of throwing good money after bad in cases where farmers invest in, feed and attempt to rear such animals.  Second, these animals are a source of infection for other animals, particularly calves.  They weaken the immune system of their comrades which become infected with a transient infection, resulting in more scars, cases of pneumonia, poor response to treatment and deaths in that group.  Third, they are also a source of further persistent infections if they transmit the virus further to other pregnant, susceptible cattle.  The biggest risk is certainly within the herd because, as Mr. O'Flaherty noted, taking measures to address the trade in such animals has a significant impact on eliminating the risk of spreading the disease outside the herd.  </p><p>  On the question of the economics, the &euro;102 million figure is based on an aggregate of the dairy, suckler and finishing sectors when one models the costs that would arise in the absence of any intervention.  The work done on this matter suggests that year-on-year losses arising from a decision to do nothing would amount to &euro;102 million.  </p></speech>

The issue that arises in this regard is that a number of countries have either completed or are running IBR control programmes which are officially recognised by the European Commission.  Under the terms of this recognition, the countries in question are able to restrict entry of cattle from countries or regions which lack a parallel control programme.  I am not in a position to provide in-depth figures on animal numbers and costs but the economics and technical working group will address this issue in more detail.  I agree, however, that, as other countries progress IBR control, it will create the potential to increasingly restrict markets for export of live animals.</p><p>  On the question as to the potential to screen and what we have done in this regard, it is important to note that BVD and IBR are very different diseases in terms of control.  In the case of BVD, approximately 0.6% to 0.7% of calves are persistently infected and these are the carriers we need to identify and deal with.  The means by which IBR persists in a population is much different.  The means of control is, therefore, also different.  The use of vaccine to prevent the transmission of a virus within herds from carrier animals is at the heart of IBR control programmes.  If we were to take a snapshot of the population, I estimate that between 70% and 80% of herds have a number of carrier animals.  However, testing to identify and remove these animals is not a feasible option given the numbers that are typically involved.</p></speech>

The impact is in two areas.  From a processor's point of view, as the cell count of the milk - the raw product - increases, the quality, quantity and value of the finished product decrease.  As the cell count of the raw milk gets higher there is less that the processors can do with it.  There is also the issue of certain high-value products or high-value markets that can only use milk of a specified cell count.  Similarly some countries will only purchase product - not necessarily high-value product but any product at all - from milk of a specified level.  From a processor point of view there are many potential impacts as the cell count increases.</p><p>  The same is true from a farmer's perspective.  As mentioned, the Teagasc research has identified the impact on net farm profit of having a herd average cell count of increasing levels.  Essentially the lower the cell count, the better the return and the higher the profit.  Most of that loss occurs where animals with a high cell count have infected quarters.  If those quarters are infected, they cannot produce to their full potential and farmers are not maximising the full volume of potential production from the herd.  That is an unseen cost that has been somewhat difficult to quantify in the past, but it probably accounts for the largest volume of it.  One of the tools developed within CellCheck is a cost check calculator which allows farmers to use their own farm figures to identify what reaching a certain herd cell count target would equate to in terms of their profit.</p><p>  What is our cell count nationally?  It is a good question and difficult to answer because at this point the only figures we have to indicate that are the milk recording figures as a proxy.  Traditionally, the bulk tank cell counts as measured by the co-operatives are not collated centrally.  We are working on the matter and we hope we are close to having all of that information collated and analysed.  However, at the moment all we can use are the milk recording figures, which account for approximately one third of the herds in the country.</p><p>  Based on those figures an annual average is probably about 250,000 cells per millilitre.  The current average, based on the most recent figures for the milk recording herds in the past ten days, is 198,000 cells per millilitre.  If we break that down in terms of distribution, 52% of those herds have a cell count of under 200,000 cells per millilitre, 27% are between 200,000 and 300,000 cells per millilitre, 12% are between 300,000 and 400,000 cells per millilitre, and a tail of 9% have more than 400,000 cells per millilitre.  That is not necessarily the milk being supplied to the co-operative, but milk may be being withheld to achieve the standard required by the co-operative.  However, the reality is that it is still a loss that is happening on-farm related to the cell count.</p></speech>

I appreciate the dilemma Ms McCoy has with the figures.  She can only work with what she has.  However, based on her figures, almost half are above what she would ideally like them to be.  After all the years and with all the knowledge we have about mastitis, why are we still at this level?  It is not a new disease that farmers are struggling to understand.  Mastitis has been around for some time.</p></speech>

For a long time the previous EU regulatory limit of 400,000 cells per millilitre was used as the bar.  That was the measure in the past.  As we learn more and understand markets and the impact, there is much greater awareness of the financial cost of cell counts between 200,000 and 400,000 cells per millilitre.  However, that awareness and understanding are relatively new.  People have been managing at the level of between 200,000 and 400,000 cells per millilitre, but losing out perhaps without being aware of it.  One of the principles of the CellCheck programme is to build awareness and demonstrate to farmers and processors that it is worth their while achieving 150,000 cells per millilitre rather than 350,000 cells per millilitre, and we can quantify the value of that.</p></speech>

However, most co-operatives would penalise the farmer if the cell count exceeded a certain amount, for example, 200,000 or 250,000 cells per millilitre.  It is not a new phenomenon that all of a sudden this magic figure has appeared out of the sky indicating that cell count is a problem.  They would have been aware of it for some time.  Obviously, it is up to each individual farmer to get his or her house in order in that regard.  Obviously, a number of issues lead to the problem, including the machinery, the individuals looking after the cows and the cow itself.  Some older cows will constantly be a problem.  Should we consider culling at a higher rate to try to improve quality in future?</p></speech>

However, I asked about herd screening for Johne's disease.  How many herds do we need as a sample?</p><p>  Figures from the Teagasc report on BVD indicate that the eradication cost from the suckler herd would be &euro;6 million but the benefit would be only &euro;5 million.  I ask for an explanation of those figures.  If we do not lose animals, there should be an overall financial benefit.</p></speech>

In the past, penalties generally came into play at a level of 400,000 cells per millilitre, but co-operatives are now starting to pay bonuses for quality, which is building awareness.  However, that is relatively recent.  It is not standard or consistent across the industry.  It depends on the co-operative the farmers are supplying as to whether they will get a bonus payment.  That is evolving over time.  If we had had this discussion a year or two earlier, even fewer co-operatives would have been paying bonuses for quality milk.  A culture change is happening, and to some degree farmers are playing catch-up in understanding what it means for them on farm.</p><p>  There are times when culling is the only viable solution to address the problem of infected animals in the herd.  However, one of the key messages of CellCheck, particularly within the farmer workshops that are being rolled out, is that it is about prevention and looking at the simple practices.  Scientific research shows us the standards on farm at the moment, and there are large areas for improvement in some of the basics.  It may be that as herds get larger, time becomes more precious and possibly less labour is available.  Corners are being cut and they are not always the safest corners in terms of mastitis control.  Prevention is essential and the Deputy is correct that there is no single solution or step that needs to be implemented.</p><p>  It is also multidisciplinary and we need to involve all the service providers in educating and working with farmers.  That is what we are doing through the training CellCheck provides which involves all disciplines.  Those working for Teagasc, vets, private advisers, co-operative staff and milking machine technicians are all being trained together.  They are building networks and teams locally to provide a more efficient and effective service for farmers.</p></speech>

We can look for evidence of antibody, which is typically done on blood but can also be done on a milk sample.  That is looking for the immune marker the animal produces.  Alternatively, we can use a direct test for the bug itself.  The latter has its limitation in that, typically, we believe the majority of infections occur in the first weeks to months of life.  Even though an animal is infected at that stage, it will not test positive, either in direct testing of dung for the organism itself or in a blood or milk test, until the animal is two, three or four years of age.  There is that silent period where the animal is potentially infected and is increasingly contaminating the environment and possibly transmitting infection to its offspring, but only later on, through use of either of those tests, is it being flagged as infected.  As one moves through those various phases for both of the tests, the performance characteristics and accuracy of the test will improve in terms of its ability to detect a genuinely infected animal.</p></speech>

A key point to make, drawing on the characteristics of Johne's disease, is that test and removal is only one element of a control programme, and as important, if not more important, is the on-farm risk assessment and management plan.  Within the framework of the programme, there is a standardised <i>pro forma</i> template for an on-farm veterinary risk assessment, which goes through each of the production stages from calving up to weaning and, on a farm-by-farm basis, analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the various points within those production stages.  After this, the practitioner and the farmer will agree what the top two or three points on which to focus.  On one farm that may be addressing common calving pens and on another farm it might be the use of feeding of pool colostrum.</p><p>  It would be a tailored management approach on each farm because, as has been highlighted, three or four years down the line we are picking up the damage that is done today in this year's calf crop.  If they are infected now, it will be three or four years down the line before we pick them up.  The challenge is through management, and effective management is turning the tap off so that we do not get those animals coming through three or four years down the line.  Certainly, the more testing that is done, the better handle we will have on that.</p></speech>

As Ms McCoy has mentioned, we have cell count information from approximately one third of the herds in the country, which are the milk recorded herds.  That may well be a biased sample.  They may be the better herds.  We do not quite know.  We felt that the more prudent approach was to develop what Deputy Deering referred to, namely, a national database of all of the processors' supply and collate that in a single database, which we are doing.  We hope to have completed in the next couple of months the figures for 2011 and 2012.  That will give us a solid base from which we can measure progress and we can set out clearly in our future business plans how quickly we intend to move forward from that.  This is a programme which is very much driven by market signals and if the market is demanding that the processor produces milk of a particular standard, that market signal will come back quickly to the farmer in the form of a price bonus, the exclusion of that milk or the application of a penalty if the milk exceeds a particular limit.</p><p>  Progress can be made rapidly.  We could have taken a guesstimate of a figure for the level of progress but we decided that what we would do was collate a robust national figure, and we intend to have that within the next couple of months.  In that regard, we are getting good co-operation from all of the major dairy processors.  I will leave the rest of the question with Ms McCoy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Magan" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013061100008#K00700"><p>I hope my colleagues have answered the questions asked adequately.  I would like to deal with the Chairman's questions.  On the question of other diseases, we have finite resources so our capacity to deal with other diseases is limited.  However, we give general and targeted advice on areas such as parasite control and calf rearing and care.  We have found there has been a positive uptake of such projects.  With regard to Food Harvest 2020, the Chairman is correct to say that we need to tackle these issues before we have substantial growth in the national herd.  This is a very good time to tackle some of the issues and when it comes to expanding the national herd, this will have a positive impact, particularly if we have tackled issues like Johne's disease, BVD, mastitis and, hopefully, IBR.</p><p>  As mentioned, behavioural change is slow.  We are working on the science of behavioural change, an interesting dimension.  This is not something one normally hears farmers discuss, but it is a fascinating area.  With regard to the Chairman's comment on antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance, this is very pertinent, because as we lower the level of disease in the national herd, we will lower the use of antibiotics and put the industry in a better place.  Hopefully, we can tackle the issue of antimicrobial resistance issue as it is an important issue for the human population.  This will be a positive outcome of what we are doing.</p><p>  On the question of resources, we were set up on the basis that we would be 50% funded by the State after we raised the other 50% from the industry.  The industry has been good up to now and I hope it will continue to be so.  However, we operate under a delicate funding model.  Hopefully, we will have an in-depth discussion at some stage in the future about how we can continue to fund what is an important, national group that has huge implications for the national herd.  Whether we can continue with the current funding model deserves some debate.  Perhaps that  is not an issue for today, but it is one that should be raised at some stage.</p></speech>

That is a very relevant comment, because much of the expert advice that is given through technical working groups is provided free by interested parties whose background is employment or involvement with someone who supports Animal Health Ireland.  Other agencies doing fine work are funded fully and everything they do is a cost on the State.  It is important that we keep this issue on the agenda, particularly since the industry is so important and faces such challenges.  One of the reasons we invited Animal Health Ireland to this committee was to give it the opportunity to explain the work it does in this forum.  In the context of the current situation, animal health and the status of the national herd are ever more important.  Bio-security issues and new challenges arise continually and we need business plans to cope with new diseases we knew nothing about ten years ago.  We have seen the plans for the four mentioned here, but unfortunately there may be more.  That is the problem.  We must look to the potential damage their growth could do to the ambition outlined in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions, which have been useful to the committee.  Hopefully, we will soon have a conclusion to our CAP negotiations and will have Food Harvest 2020 implementation groups in place for the dairy and beef sectors with agreed targets and deadlines.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is unable to join us today as he is in Brussels.  I also welcome all of the departmental officials and thank them for their briefings over the past couple of days and last weekend.  A great deal of work has gone into ensuring we ask the awkward questions and hold the Minister and Ministers of State accountable.</p><p>  Members will be aware that the Revised Estimates for 2013 were presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme based format.  This means that the Estimate as presented contains the following information for each programme: how it is proposed to spend the money allocated to each programme and the previous year's outturn in each case; the number of staff assigned to work on the programme and how this compares with the previous year; performance related information; departmental outputs, including corresponding information on the previous year, including what are termed performance and impact indicators for the previous year; and administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole summarised in more detail than previously.  The Revised Estimate gives us an opportunity to review whether targets set and the distribution of moneys across the Vote are appropriate in all circumstances and demonstrate the best use of resources.  It also gives us an opportunity to explore issues facing the Minister in terms of the 2014 allocation for his Department.</p><p>  An agreed timetable was circulated prior to the meeting.  It allows for a brief opening statement by the Minister followed by a discussion on the 2013 Revised Estimate, with questions on each programme listed in the Estimate.  Is the timetable agreed?  Agreed.  I now invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

This is the journey we are seeking to travel.  We have introduced the concept of an action plan for jobs which essentially is a whole of Government instrument to try to engage every Department in so far as they impact on the work of this journey.  There is good traction within the system in that we have quarterly reporting on specific actions.  Each year we look afresh at what can be done the following year.  For example, last year we looked at what could be done in 2013.  We are receiving significant levels of submissions, including from this committee, which inform the work we take on. </p><p>  In terms of how we are succeeding on our journey, while it is early days yet the IDA has had its best year in a decade in terms of it having secured 6,500 net jobs.  Enterprise Ireland, which secured 3,500 net jobs, has also had a good year.  This compares with a decline in this area during the past four years.  Overall, according to the CSO, approximately 25,000 jobs have been created in the private sector.  We have had a good export-led recovery and are now beginning to see some of that spill into other parts of the economy, although by no means all areas.  There are continuing declines in construction and other areas.  </p><p>  Reflecting that exports have done well, a problematic issue, of which members of the committee are well aware and one which we must continue to address, is access to finance.  Members will be aware that in this regard we have put in place a number of State designed instruments, including microfinance, seed finance, scaling finance and development capital, the cost of which when combined amounts to &euro;2.5 billion.  While these instruments are in their infancy, take-up in respect of some has been good.  There is more work to be done in promoting them.</p><p>  We have also looked at the range of enterprise support available and have sought to deepen it and make it more export oriented through the establishment of the first time exporters division.  We have also introduced new instruments such as Connect Ireland which is tapping into a range of areas not tapped into by the IDA.  We have sought to reform many areas from wage setting mechanisms to access to finance, including the innovation strategy on which the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will comment.  This year there will be what are termed disruptive reforms, which include actions in areas such as big data, encouraging people to recruit from the live register, buying into energy efficiency and so on.  A number of these actions are outlined in the action plan.  These are important in the context of continuing the momentum for change and drilling down to sectoral level.  For example, the recently published manufacturing strategy.</p><p>  In terms of reform, we have a pretty active work programme of consolidating and improving the manner in which the Department and its agencies work.  This includes the work place commission on which the committee held hearings, which relates to a reduction from five to two in the number of agencies in the employment rights and industrial relations area.  This work is continuing and is resulting in a better service.  Also, legislation in this area is currently being drafted.  The amalgamation of F&Aacute;S into the Department is ongoing, the rationale for this being that we need stronger policy making capability within the Department so that we can create a better framework.  There are many other regulatory reforms taking place.  Many of our agencies have committed to reduced regulatory burdens.  The Department met its 25% target by 2012.  This work is ongoing.</p><p>  A big item on our agenda this year has been the EU Presidency.  There were a number of important actions in play in this context, including Horizon 2020 about which the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will speak later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2013061100004#C00200"><p>The big ticket item at present is negotiating Horizon 2020, which is the next framework for research expenditure in the European Union.  The Irish Presidency is chairing those negotiations, which will be subject to co-decision procedure with the Commission and the European Parliament.  Horizon 2020 will offer a package of measures worth &euro;70 billion or more, with a specific target of 20% for SME engagement compared to 15% in the current framework programme.  We believe this will have a major stimulus effect in terms of SME engagement and job creation throughout the European Union and in Ireland in particular.  Our overarching philosophy is to accelerate the economic and societal return from the public investment in research in order to deliver high quality jobs.</p><p>  In addition to Horizon 2020, we are also implementing our own research prioritisation exercise which brings together the State funders of research.  We have prioritised 14 key areas to maximise the economic and societal impact of our investment in research.  A process is under way of developing the 14 action plans, involving all the State funders of research and the HEA to ensure maximum impact.</p><p>  We are also pursuing smart investment in research centres at scale and with critical mass.  In 2013, we announced seven new large scale SFI research centres supporting more than 800 scientists.  These centres will enhance IDA's capacity to attract foreign direct investment.  The recent &euro;300 million announcement included &euro;200 million from the State's funders of research and &euro;100 million from industry.  Many of the industrial players are in the FDI sector.  Activities funded through the research centres include big data, advanced food research and marine energy research.  Later this afternoon we will be discussing the extension of SFI's mandate to include applied research and to allow it to fund research proposals closer to the applied research arena in order to accelerate the exploitation of research for economic benefit.  We are setting targets in a number of other areas, including high-potential start-up units, technology centres through the institutes of technology and the SFI funded strategic research clusters.   I would be happy to speak further on these activities if members so wish.</p></speech>

We will now commence our discussion on the general position on the saving measures introduced in 2012.  Rather than go around the table for questions, I ask the Ministers to briefly summarise the savings measures achieved, followed by which we will take programme heads in turn.</p></speech>

We have also sought to make use of ICT and other means of improving our capacity to reform in the context of declining numbers.  The decline in numbers has been significant across the various agencies.  Since 2007, the overall number has decreased by 16%.  We have tried to spread the reductions to reflect priorities, such as by protecting the IDA from reductions in view of the work it is doing, but the consequence is a greater impact on other areas.  Capital spending is predominantly demand led and our multi-annual programme reflects that.  We meet our resource provision to the agencies based on demand and their commitments, which come to fruition over a series of years.  It is not like a budget that can be spent in one year because this year's expenditure could reflect approvals made over a five year programme.  We have been fortunate to protect our capital budgets at a time when other capital spending programmes have taken cuts of two thirds.  We have retained our capital budgets in light of the Government's obvious priority of employment creation initiatives.</p><p>  If members have specific questions I can answer them but, by and large, that has been our approach.  The agencies have evolved and changed programmes in light of their reduced resources and manpower.  An agency like Enterprise Ireland continuously considers the cost effectiveness of different elements of its work in order to remain within its budget while meeting its targets, whether in regulatory terms or in supporting enterprises.  That is a bird's eye view of our operations and I can provide more details if members so wish.</p></speech>

The Minister does not get thousands of people protesting outside his meetings but that is not to say his Department is not taking the burden of the Presidency in many areas.</p><p>  Under subhead A.5, IDA Ireland, considerable damage was done recently to our presence in the US market by the allegations made at the US Senate hearings.  I acknowledge that our ambassador responded but given these were political allegations, should the Minister not have dealt with the allegations on a more hands-on basis?  Politicians tend to respect politicians.  Is he concerned that the 132 investment projects targeted for 2013 and 2014 will be affected?</p><p>  Deputy Lyons and I recently visited China with the Ceann Comhairle.  The IDA's presence in Asia is not what it could be.  I recognise that the employment control framework has implications in this regard but we must investigate from where the next wave of industry will come.  Does the Minister have any thoughts in this regard?</p></speech>

Will the Minister indicate why less money is being invested?  The position is similar with regard to Enterprise Ireland, the capital expenditure for which is down considerably on the figure for 2012.  Will the Minister indicate why the proposed target of &euro;70 million will not be hit?  I presume this money will be paid out in capital grants.  Why are we not delivering in this regard?</p><p>  Subhead A8 deals with county enterprise development.  Will the Minister provide an update on progress with regard to the amalgamation of local enterprise offices, LEOs?  Will the funding available under this subhead be transferred to Enterprise Ireland next year?</p><p>  On subhead A15, provision of &euro;193,000 for legal costs and other services was made in 2012.  Only &euro;11,000 of this was spent but the amount provided for this year is &euro;312,000.  There is no logic to that.  Is the Department expecting to be obliged to deal with a large number of legal cases?  What is the reason for this increase in expenditure?</p></speech>

I was referring to the information on page 11 of the document provided.  I am interested in the implementation of the new capital development scheme.  How much money has been invested in this regard to date and what is the spending profile for the coming year?  What are the leverage levels from the private sector?</p><p>  The seed capital venture fund is dealt with on the same page.  When will this fund become operational and what is the spending profile relating to it?  Will the Minister indicate the target amount in respect of private leverage?</p><p>  In the context of LEOs, the credit guarantee scheme is dealt with on page 12.  Some &euro;40 million has been allocated over five years in this regard.  What is the drawdown for the current year in this regard and what is the budget profile for next year?  Will the Minister also indicate what is the target for next year?</p><p>  Attracting foreign direct investment is a topical issue.  How many IDA Ireland-supported firms are operating Irish-registered non-resident companies?  This matter is referred to throughout the document with which we have been presented.  We are dealing here with the Government's subsidising of enterprise and foreign direct investment.  This is extremely important and we all support what is being done.  However, a major aspect of the stimulation of job creation relates to the tax breaks administered by the Department of Finance.  While this does not specifically come under the select committee's remit, it could actually dwarf the levels of business subsidised by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Will the Minister provide a ratio in respect of the tax breaks versus investment by the Department?  Which of these are deemed to be more beneficial and useful - from the Department's perspective - in the context of job creation?</p><p>  Page 14 contains a table about which I wish to raise a couple of points.  Exports and surpluses have increased for the past five years and have returned to 2001 levels but unemployment has not fallen.  We have, therefore, attained 2001 export levels but there has not been a corresponding increase in the level of employment.  Given that we have attained the former, one would have assumed that the labour force capacity necessary to develop this level of exports would have been consumed.</p><p>  Ireland is No.1 in Europe in the context of inward stock.  The latter is defined as the value of the capital and reserves in the economy attributable to a parent enterprise residence in a different country.  The first point that arises in this regard relates to exports and surpluses and the second to foreign direct investment, FDI, inward stock.  Will the Minister outline his views on these matters?</p></speech>

In some instances we may be obliged to provide additional information at a later date.</p><p>  In the context of the microfinance loan fund, 72 applications - with a value of &euro;1.15 million and supporting 181 jobs - have been approved.  That is the up-to-date position.  The fund is obviously in a roll-out phase.  I understand representatives from Microfinance Ireland may have come before the joint committee to discuss its plans.  The organisation has good plans in the context of rolling out the fund and improving the level of take-up in respect of it.  The fund is being administered through the county enterprise boards and we are taking an initiative with the banks in order to improve people's awareness of it.</p><p>  On the temporary loan guarantee scheme, some 41 facilities - worth &euro;4.8 million and giving rise to 245 new jobs and maintaining 115 existing jobs - have been extended.</p></speech>

Obviously it is too early to say but not given the pattern of focus on the sectors where we are already strong.  Increasingly, the wins are for people with higher skills and those in research and development areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will advert to the fact that almost 40% or 50% of the projects we are winning now have a research and development dimension.  We should bear in mind two things.  First, Enterprise Ireland has a much better regional spread.  Second, there is a knock-on with all of this.   For every job with a foreign company there is a job elsewhere in the economy and the same applies to Enterprise Ireland wins in export markets.</p></speech>

Each sector is different.  If a company is in the exporting sector then traditionally it ought to have similar knock-on effects.  By and large the multiplier is higher for an Enterprise Ireland company than for an IDA company because they tend to have higher purchases of materials and services in the domestic economy than an IDA company.  However, one of the initiatives we are taking this year is to identify global supply chains as a source of opportunity for Irish business.  We have targeted 500 million additional purchases for Irish companies from the supply chain of multinationals.  From memory, I believe there is a multiplier of 0.78 for an IDA job and probably 1.5 or thereabouts for an Enterprise Ireland job, averaging approximately 1.  That is the approximate figure.  I am unsure of the figures specifically for county enterprise board jobs or whether such analysis is done, but I expect it would be closer to the Enterprise Ireland figure if the associated companies are exporting.  If a company is in retailing it is a different matter because it could be buying only imported goods.  Such companies would only be supported for mentoring by a county enterprise board and would not be supported for grant giving.</p></speech>

One thing we need to do is get a more accurate reflection of the jobs impact and that is something we hope to develop.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary raised the issue of the case being made that Ireland is a tax haven.  We absolutely reject that and there is strong evidence in this regard.  Ireland has a statute-based tax code.  It is based on a low rate but there are not many allowances against it.  There is no issue of special deals being negotiated by any individual.  Tax is primarily a responsibility for the Department of Finance but the Government, including the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and myself, and the IDA have taken a strong position in the media and in communicating directly with the authorities in the USA, where necessary, setting out our case.  It is important to recognise that there is an issue around aggressive tax planning.  No one denies that it is an issue.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the question of whether we know the number of Irish-registered non-resident companies.  We do not have figures.  By their nature they do not return tax in Ireland and therefore I do not know, but perhaps the Revenue Commissioners have better estimates.</p><p>  Our rules for deciding whether a company is tax-based in Ireland are common.  The British operate in the same way.  If a company is managed and controlled in Ireland, then that is the basis for deciding whether it pays tax.  It is the same in the United Kingdom.  The difficulty arises when people who are aggressively tax-planning play one set of tax rules against another and look for arbitrage across the tax rules.  I strongly maintain that it is not our tax system that is the problem, it is the arbitrage across difference tax systems.  There will have to be international action to deal with that in order to be effective and that is the approach the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Government has taken.</p><p>  Deputy Lawlor raised the issue of the IDA.  The IDA allocation last year included a special &euro;10 million allocation relating to the write-off of a specific grant.  There was an additional allocation and the authority made some specific property acquisitions that year.  Generally, the capital allocation this year will be made up and is largely dictated by grant approvals over the past five years rather than grant approvals for this year.  What is allocated will reflect decisions made over several years.  Obviously, there has been a dip but we are now back to top-level IDA performance.  We have had better IDA performance recently than for several years.</p><p>  We should recognise that over time grant levels through the IDA will probably decline.  Fewer companies will be attracting significant grant levels because of restrictions on state aid and because generally in the case of many of these companies the State will not be giving large grants for expansions.  There is a change in the nature of it.  We will be doing more in the way of promoting, going to countries and winning new investment, but it will be on a broader range of criteria rather than simply grant paying.  That is a long-term change.  There is also a carry over of &euro;7 million in the &euro;86 million in 2013.  Given the multi-year budgets, we are allowed to carry over unspent money and that reflects the nature of it.  This is a long-term pipeline, not a one-off payment.</p></speech>

We will be seeking to maintain our presence in these markets even though, in the short term, one might say it is not turning around the same return, either in IDA investment or in Enterprise Ireland exports.  They are in markets that will dominate growth in the future and we have to be there.  In terms of Enterprise Ireland, we have to get companies that are Asia-ready.  There is no point in bringing in a company that is not willing to commit feet on the ground and build a long-term relationship.  From our point of view, it is a long-term project and we should commit to keeping the resource there even though one would be able to show that projects per head of placement are probably lower in Asia than in the United States or in-----</p></speech>

A balance is being run in all these areas.  Our best market for Enterprise Ireland companies is probably Germany and France but we would be short-sighted to focus on those because we have to build new markets.  It is a question of striking a balance.</p><p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point about tax breaks, Ireland has an offering which is less and less about tax.  Tax is a part of a much wider story.  Mr. Barry O'Leary talks about the four "Ts" - track record, talent, tax and technology - and, increasingly, it is the human resource, the technology and the know-how that is attracting companies here.  Many companies come here without any grant aid whatsoever.  There would be a very significant number where grants are not being paid.  They come here because of what they have already experienced.</p><p>  The Deputy raised the point that export numbers have recovered more quickly than employment.  There is no doubt there have been big productivity gains in many sectors during the recession.  Our unit labour costs are down by 20% because there has been reorganisation.  People have become more efficient but we have rebuilt our export market, and Enterprise Ireland added approximately 3,500 jobs last year.  We are seeing expansion from that market, therefore, and there is the knock-on impact.</p><p>  Regarding the figures on the FDI stock, I confess I do not know what exactly that inward stock measures but in terms of the suggestion that there has been a decline in the inward investment stock, it certainly is not reflected in the number of people employed in foreign-owned companies.  It may refer to portfolios investment but I will have to-----</p></speech>

A company with operations in Ireland pays tax on its operations in Ireland.  This is how the effective tax rate is calculated.  Other people seek to bring in flows which have come from other countries.  Even though our tax code does not apply to them, they seek to somehow apply the tax paid in Ireland not to the operating profits in Ireland but to this bigger number they have added in.</p></speech>

The timelines and the products do not fit much of the market.  When will changes be made?  Must we wait another three months for changes which most people agree ought to be made?  This would mean people losing out on the opportunities provided by the schemes.</p></speech>

Recently, I met the banks to seek better arrangements whereby at the point of refusal, people would be alerted not only to their right to appeal but also access to the loan guarantee or other loan alternatives.  I would be keen to see this because approximately 24,000 small and medium enterprises are refused credit each year and only a tiny percentage either appeal this decision or consider these new options.  We need to increase this.  We are determined to improve it.  Microfinance Ireland is rolling out initiatives through the enterprise boards and other networks to try to improve understanding.</p><p>  We will review the loan guarantee scheme and we will probably start this review before the annual turnout to see whether elements of the mix can be improved.  These are new schemes which were never done before.  There will be a need to evolve them with time and I accept this.  They are adding to the environment and it may be that only 540 jobs have been created or protected by the presence of these schemes, but they are 540 valuable jobs and we will continue to push them on.</p></speech>

Is it completely tied up with getting agreement on the budget at Parliament level?  With regard to the capital programme, namely, the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, the outturn for 2012 was &euro;5 million higher than the Estimate and the Estimate for 2013 is &euro;10 million lower than the 2012 outturn.

Why did Enterprise Ireland technology centres not match those in priority research?  With regard to support through Science Foundation Ireland, the target was to consolidate 28 research centres and five new large-scale awards.  Where were the large-scale awards made?  With regard to Science Foundation Ireland leveraging the &euro;100 million from funded researchers, how was it invested and who owns the outcome of their work?  With regard to intellectual property, does the Minister agree rates or levels of patents submitted and the value of these patents are a suitable metric for reaching objectives?  The figures on page 19 show gross expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GNP.  I understood that in Horizon 2020 the metric was to show gross expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP which would change the measure significantly.  The ears of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, pricked up when I mentioned tax incentives for research and development.  If he does not have the figures to hand, perhaps he will furnish the committee with an overall estimate of the level of tax breaks given to foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland businesses.

Some academics and people in the media have claimed this research has become very skewed and too utilitarian, that research should have a much broader vision and that Ireland's reputation may be damaged if this narrowing of the research mandate and focus continues.  I do not know whether this is a concern.  I am sure the Minister has read about it.  What is his opinion on it?  Does he agree with this criticism?

In this light, it is pertinent that the State and its funders of research would outline a set of priorities to maximise the impact of that research in terms of creating new economic opportunities, namely, creating jobs and high-potential start-ups as well as resourcing the small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that will sustain the economy.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned the sectors these were in and also mentioned the perinatal work in Cork.  In regard to other geographical areas, was there, say, a figure of 50% identified for centres outside Dublin and Cork, or are they all to be found in those two city areas?  My second question relates to the number of patents being granted annually, which is a metric related to success in research and development.

This will give the Deputy the context of metrics and how patents map onto it - or not, as the case may be.  The question one must ask oneself is whether patents are an accurate measure of economic activity.  What long-term effect do they have in terms of creating jobs, etc.?  Of themselves, as intellectual property, patents are important in terms of protecting the good ideas and the new innovations people develop.  What we have sought to do from the research perspective, and are doing, is to bring a paper to Cabinet.  The Minister has a strong input in this regard.  Its purpose is to ensure that wherever the State invests, through all the funders of research, for example, the HEA, Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board and all the other State funders, it will map out or measure the impact of that research funding.  That is measured in terms of publications and in the numbers of jobs created.  One tries to measure the societal impact by looking at indicators such as the European Union innovation index, and so on.  There are metrics around publications of papers, etc.  The key point is that we are ensuring that where we are investing we have a set of criteria laid down such that the metrics have to be measured in terms of the impact and the number of jobs created.  As that is done it informs our approach.</p><p>  I refer to the SFI centres.</p></speech>

A criterion of excellence exists in terms of how one funds research; it is the fundamental pillar for any funding call or new opportunity.  One cannot discriminate between various geographical areas.  If, for example, one wanted to fund into south Kerry it has to be based on the pillar of excellence; it cannot be because the funding call is from south Kerry.  If one examines the calls and looks at where the money has been disbursed, what has been forced is a major collaboration between institutions that might not, historically, have collaborated with each other.  I refer to the CLARITY and INSIGHT centres, for example, where DCU, UCD and NUIG are coming together, which is a significant investment in the area of data analytics.  One also maps the industry engagement, which involves industry from all across the country, geographically speaking.   The geographical indicator takes second place to the pillar of excellence.  One has to fund excellent research regardless of where it comes from, geographically.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

To reassure people, the existing legislation contains a strong public interest test.  The review of mergers some years ago suggested a cleaning up of the criteria, which is being done under the new Bill.  It will also address the transfer issue.  There is a good code of public interest protection.  We are pushing ahead in this regard.</p><p>  The merger into the workplace relations commission, WRC, is progressing well.  It is a major change, with five agencies being reduced to two, a body of first instance and an appellate body.  We have streamlined all of the allocations and are moving to an online system.  We have shortened dramatically the time for cases to be heard before a rights commissioner.  From the moment a complaint is made, information is notified to an employer more quickly.  We are avoiding having the same complaint sent to multiple agencies.  We have introduced a pilot early resolution scheme to remove unnecessary delays by having cases resolved ahead of hearings.  I am pleased with the progress in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary has relevant experience, but any integration is time consuming and requires a great deal of work by officials to get all the ducks in a row.  Rationalisations make good sense and we are enthusiastic about them, but making them work takes a great deal of work.  In this regard, I acknowledge the work being done in my Department.  The integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department is on track, as is the integration of Shannon Development into the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  I have met the chairman of the Health and Safety Authority.  Every agency could find important work to do were additional resources available.  Reverting to the Chairman's first question, that we have needed to reduce our staffing numbers has had a knock-on effect.  The authority has been effective in using modern tools such as ICT.  It has pioneered <i>BeSMART.ie</i> as a way of facilitating companies in complying with their health and safety obligations without incurring elaborate costs.  The authority has been at the forefront of trying to emphasise compliance as a part of a good culture and proper business.  Many of our agencies are under pressure.</p><p>  Insurance costs are always a concern.  We are alert to them.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which predates my term in office by a long time, has removed 70% of personal injury claims from the litigation system.  It has reduced legal costs substantially.  These costs amounted to 46% in 2002, but fell to 8.7% in 2012.  The PIAB has had an impact.  It monitors issues carefully and alerts the Government to matters of public policy.</p><p>  The non-pay allocation provides for our preparations for the Companies Bill 2012, as did the 2012 allocation.  The previous allocation anticipated work on the Bill.  It is major legislation.  Unfortunately, the committee will need to carry some of the load in getting through the legislation.</p><p>  The ICTU grant for education, training and advisory services is performance-based funding with agreed reporting requirements, a memorandum of understanding and the submission of audited accounts.  There is a good system for tracking the spending of the money.</p></speech>

While I understand there will be a reduction in funds to allow for inspections by the Health and Safety Authority, that there were 48 deaths in 2012 underlines how critical it is we enforce standards in industry.  The number fell from the preceding year, but the decrease in construction work could have led to that reduction.  The authority also did good work in helping to decrease the numbers.</p></speech>

Its budget has been set in anticipation of its work under the Companies Bill and we are satisfied that provision has been made for this work.</p><p>  The Deputy is right in that the Health and Safety Authority has been progressive in how it has done its work.  If we rely on inspections, we will never get around to everyone.  We must get people to embrace a culture of high standards and safety in the workplace.  We seek to focus inspections on problem areas.  For example, there has been considerable focus on agriculture.  The authority is keen not just to use its own inspection force.  We have held a round table meeting - I also participated - with agricultural interests, for example, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, to discuss how they can put the message out and support people, including older farmers who do not give the same attention to safety requirements.  There is an effort to network the message more effectively among the groups involved.  I have tried to get that message out.  To be fair, the farming organisations have been supportive of it.  We are trying to box smarter in the way we use our resources to get the message out, but the Deputy is right in that the death levels are reducing but are still too high.  I have an agricultural background, and it is disappointing to see that the high number of deaths remains prevalent.</p></speech>

In Ireland, typically, the rate is 7.7%, meaning the multiple above that the upper grade earns.  In Nordic countries, for example, it is approximately 3.1%. </p></speech>

The figures would be pretty much in line with whatever a Secretary General gets, which is the top of the tree, and what a service officer gets, at the bottom of the tree.  It would be very easy to provide that information.  I ask the Deputy to recognise that all the pay cuts realised in the Croke Park agreement and its predecessors have been graded in such a way that the higher the earner the greater the percentage cut made.  The rates have been graded in a progressive way in all the pay cut rounds, including the one currently under consideration.  There has been an effort to recognise that and no doubt that change will have brought down the ratio the Deputy remarked upon.  It probably should be taken into account that the pension levy, which was also progressive, is probably included in gross pay rates.  The Deputy is using gross pay but is not taking into account the progressive pension levy that is paid only by the public service, which may distort the figures.  We will definitely provide him with the numbers and whatever notes might help him.</p></speech>

He and I may disagree on the outcomes but we all want to get to the same destination.  Although the growth in employment is encouraging, I would maintain it is a growth in temporary employment.  We still have an issue of long-term unemployment, in particular youth unemployment.  The youth guarantee is very important but I am concerned at the manner in which this Department does not appear to be driving it as much as it is being driven in the Department of Social Protection.  The drive in enterprise and job creation needs to be part of the youth guarantee.  That is very important.</p><p>  I reiterate my concern, one I have often expressed and which I believe the Minister shares, about the fact we still seem to have a silo operation.  I am still unconvinced that the jobs action plan has broken down the silos between different Departments in terms of job creation and the way every Department has a role to play in job creation, not only this one.  I refer to expenditure on public projects.   The committee has heard various groups that have attended, small contractors, even people selling school books and supplies.  They are being priced out of the market by the policies of one Department while this Department is trying to encourage small business.  The same goes for big Government contracts for building, where people are being priced out.  </p><p>  I am sceptical about the jobs action plan but one of the concentrations found in it concerned what needs to be done internally, within Government, to support business, in particular small businesses and job creation.  I still believe there is a silo mentality which goes: "That's not our job; that's not our role, that's the other Department's role".  We need to break down those silos in order to create employment and we need to make job creation the work of every Department, not just that of this Minister and his Department.  Every Department needs to realise that every cent it spends should play some role in creating or maintaining employment.  I believe that attitude is still not there in many Departments.</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make in regard to the administration of the Department in its entirety was that there is a difference between being busy and outputs.  Where I would have issues in regard to the Minister's work is in regard to outputs.  He mentioned that the issue of job creation has not reached every door and I made the point that it actually has not reached many doors.  The critical issues, the metrics by which he is judged, are the overall unemployment levels, long-term unemployment levels, underemployment, emigration - all those facts.  In 2010, eight months before Fianna F&aacute;il left Government, the unemployment rate had stabilised at approximately 14%.  It is not really far off that level now, two and a half years into the Minister's administration.  The problems that were there when he came to Government are still there.  Demand is flat and there is a lack of both public and private stimulus in that credit is not available.</p></speech>

We may not agree on everything, but there is no question of the level of commitment on all sides.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked whether we were delivering outputs relative to our inputs.  Our Department has seen a 16% cut in its inputs in the form of 500 fewer people employed.  We do not claim that it is all down to us that 20,000 extra people are at work, but there has been a turnaround.  We have pursued research prioritisation, introduced our intellectual property, IP, protocol and are putting in place a better system of supporting innovation.  We did the same in respect of Enterprise Ireland, in that we initiated new schemes and set up a first-time exporters division.  We have introduced new funding, for example, micro-financing, the temporary loan guarantee and seed capital.  Our new measures are having an impact.</p><p>  No one can pretend that our Department could deal with a collapse in house building from 90,000 per year to 5,000 per year.  That collapse wiped out a swathe of employees, but I cannot talk the 5,000 back up to 90,000.  I must make do with the new areas of the economy that we can grow.  For this reason, the work on innovation and reform and the new activities in export markets constitute the only sustainable course for supporting our ambitions as a small open economy.</p><p>  It is not true to say that there is a prejudice in favour of FDI.  Only &euro;100 million of our &euro;760 million is directed towards FDI.  Innovation alone comprises &euro;150 million of our budget.  Enterprise Ireland has a larger budget.  We are doing a great deal in other areas.  None of the &euro;2.5 billion in new SME funding is targeted at FDI.  However, FDI remains an important element of our strategy.  One cannot build a strong cluster in ICT, medical devices or pharma without major multinational investors.  The challenge we are trying to meet is to build the ecosystem beneath that level.</p><p>  I take Deputy Calleary's point that there is an enterprise role to a youth guarantee.  Regarding Deputy Lawlor's intervention, we are determining whether we should have a competitive start fund solely for young people and whether we can do more in terms of youth entrepreneurship.  A part of the recently announced review of entrepreneurship will consider this matter specifically.</p><p>  Regarding the criticism of the high level of part-time employment - not temporary employment - among the 20,000 extra people, the growth during the past two quarters was in full-time employment.  The pattern seems to be that people start with part-time employment and grow into full-time employment.  We are in a transition and I am not pretending that we are anywhere near arriving.  Indeed, we are a long way from anything over which we can stand.</p><p>  The point on silos was well made, but the Action Plan for Jobs is a genuine vehicle for breaking them down.  We can point to a number of successes, for example, the ICTU skills area and the health innovation hub, where people have stepped up to the plate and done something different on the employment end.</p><p>  Competition by SMEs for public procurement contracts continues to be a problem.  We are examining this in two ways.  We need to make public procurement savings.  If procurement is expensive, we cannot fund other measures.  However, we also need to support innovative small companies that can solve public service problems.  Under Action Plan for Jobs, we have been trying to have good, clear rules, to remove obstacles for small businesses and to cultivate innovation in procurement policies.</p><p>  There is some validity in all of the members' points and we will try to take them on board, but some counterpoints are worth making.</p></speech>

We can provide a further briefing note on Enterprise Ireland's research and development programmes.  The committee has received a good note detailing the practical overview of the innovation vouchers, the research and development fund, technology centres and high-potential start-ups, HPSUs.</p><p>  Were the committee to facilitate me, I would welcome an opportunity to return and delve deeper into the issue of research and innovation.  Since the Estimates process is condensed, leading to a concertina effect, one would appreciate an opportunity to return, interrogate the landscape further and encourage members to visit some of the research centres in a co-ordinated fashion.  Before I became a Minister of State, these matters could be nebulous and theoretical.  If one gets one's fingers dirty by seeing what the researchers are doing in the centres and how they engage with industry, one has a chance to understand the situation fully.  I am not saying that members do not understand it, but my experience of visiting the centres and seeing their work for myself helped me to capture what they were doing.</p><p>  I wish to address the issue of silos.  The Minister hit on it in terms of the health innovation hub.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, my role is to try to break down those silos.  The recent announcement represents the largest investment ever, with &euro;300 million from the industry as well as State funding for research organisations, institutes of technology and universities.  This will break down the traditional silos, elements of the industry will collaborate with one another along thematic lines, and the silos within academic circles will also be broken down.  We are in a new disposition, in that people must collaborate if they are to flourish and survive.  This is the underlying principle.  I thank the Chairman and will leave matters there.</p></speech>

We will organise that meeting in the coming weeks, whenever it suits the Minister of State's schedule and, if possible, before the D&aacute;il rises.</p><p>  That concludes the select committee's consideration of the 2013 Revised Estimates for Vote 32 for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the year ending 31 December 2013.

I thank Deputies Calleary and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for submitting the various amendments and the first proposed amendment is essentially already captured when one considers section 7(1) in conjunction with section 7(6), specifically lines 13 to 18, inclusive.  The wording of the Bill as presented has been undertaken in consultation with the advisory council on science, technology and innovation, and I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill as it stands is appropriate.  It will enable us to leverage more from the ever-increasing SFI investments and it also grants SFI some flexibility with regard to future funding calls for the development of Ireland's enterprise development and without diminution in standards of research excellence.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Future Ministers may seek to broaden the role of SFI into areas that funding will not cover, with associated weaknesses, but amendment No. 5 in particular would prevent that from happening.  As Oireachtas consultation is a buzz phrase with some members of the Government now, this might be a good way to start the process.</p></speech>

This will largely be centred on priority areas as set out in the recommendations arising from the national research prioritisation exercise and through the prioritisation action group, whose work continues.  I am currently chairing that process.  I am satisfied that we could consider this for further discussion on Report Stage, taking into account the submission made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Peer review is a gold standard and stands up within the scientific community, doing what it states on the tin.  A vague &quot;any other review process equivalent to relevant international best practice&quot; seems to open all sorts of avenues for consideration which may not have international standing or strength, particularly in the scientific community, of a peer review process.  What are the Minister of State's thoughts on what will be involved in this alternative review process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2013061100016#P00700"><p>I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I appreciate the concerns and subtleties of the point made by Deputy Calleary.  I was concerned that by including "by another review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" we might somehow lessen the rigour of SFI's renowned review process of excellence.  There is a danger inherent in that if it is dissipated in any way, the core of SFI would be diminish.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy that nobody is seeking to diminish that in any way and the inclusion of the words "review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" is absolutely necessary.  Such a requirement is primarily due to the smaller grant-funded programmes that SFI is now supporting in the promotion of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, where SFI's rigorous international scientific peer review process is not an appropriate mechanism to use.  Deputies should be aware that in March 2012, as part of our reform programme, we transferred responsibility for the Discover Science &amp;amp; Engineering, DSE, programme from Forf&aacute;s to SFI, given the synergies that exist between the DSE-supported actions and certain SFI science awareness supports.  In addition, some of the smaller grants that SFI administers, such as the conferences and workshops programme that works to attract top-class conferences and leading scientists to Ireland, are not internationally peer reviewed and nor should they be.  As is increasingly the case, where opportunities arise for SFI to co-fund with another agency, Department or research entity - in Ireland or in collaboration across international borders - it may not always be appropriate or possible to utilise an international scientific peer review process.</p><p>  It is critical that we ensure in such instances that whatever review mechanism is used by SFI or it is party to, such a process should be of an appropriately high standard and of international best practice.  For these reasons, the inclusion of the words "or by any other review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" is absolutely necessary in the section.</p></speech>

I accept that conferences, etc., do not need peer review but the vast majority of SFI's work would require peer review status.  Will the Minister of State consider some kind of amendment for Report Stage requiring specific elements of SFI's work and funding to have a peer review element as opposed to being able to get by with a lower grade as indicated by "any other review process equivalent to relevant international best practice"?</p></speech>

The peer review process has been the bedrock of Science Foundation Ireland since its establishment in order to ensure continued scientific excellence and relevance to the enterprise base.  We do not want to dilute that in any way, shape or form and we want to continue that strong pillar while allowing flexibility in other areas of opportunity, as I referred to earlier.</p></speech>

This section therefore already provide for the inclusion of any relevant institution in Northern Ireland, including those established under the Good Friday Agreement, and the important operational matter will be whether any such institution, be it based in the North or the South, meets with SFI criteria to be deemed an eligible body to compete for SFI funding calls.

Appointments to the board of SFI are made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in consultation with the Minister for Education and Skills and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In reality, this proposed amendment captures what is already established practice when, annually, the two longest serving SFI board members must retire from the board each July.  As part of the board appointments process, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation actively considers the existing competencies of the SFI board membership and examines the gaps arising from board retirements or other vacancies that might arise separately to the annual retirement process.  The Minister also examines the emerging scientific or industrial expertise needs and trends from which the board would benefit, the gender representation on the board at all times, the ongoing evolution of Ireland's research system and in particular the maturing and increasing relevance of SFI investments, foreign direct investment, FDI linkages and our indigenous base.</p><p>  The Government has also established a practice whereby appointments to State boards are advertised publicly via the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and applications invited.  Such an advertisement regarding the forthcoming July 2013 SFI board vacancies is live on the PAS website, <i>publicjobs.ie</i>.  As part of this process there is a detailed list of competencies which potential SFI board members would need to meet and if we were to accept the Deputy's proposed amendment in this regard, we would also need to significantly broaden the proposed wording of the Bill further.  In this case on page 6 between lines 6 and 7 we would include text along the following lines: &quot;In appointing members of the board the Minister shall seek to ensure it contains a balance of expertise in such areas as academic research, commercial research and development, corporate governance, entrepreneurship, research funding, development and venture funding, public engagement-outreach education, research and development, industrial policy development implementation and assessment both internationally and nationally, awareness and detailed knowledge of Ireland's research landscape, public sector experience and higher education systems,&quot; among many other things.  However, given the established practice undertaken by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding board appointments and the openness of the PAS process which the Government has established regarding appointments to State boards, and the lengthy list of competencies I have just mentioned, I am of the view that the Deputy's proposed amendment is unnecessary, therefore I am not in a position to accept it.</p></speech>

The view regarding the specific amendment is that while one would absolutely and utterly accept the sentiment expressed and the spirit of the amendment, putting forward a specific quota target for this piece of legislation would not be appropriate.  Culturally, within SFI three of the past five appointments have been female.  I take the point about driving a cultural and behavioural change across the State board and agency infrastructure but in SFI there has been a significant redistribution in gender balance.</p></speech>

I will not press the amendment now but will do so on Report Stage.  We need to start implementing this by way of legislation.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is a chicken and egg situation as to which comes first, the culture or the legislation.  I believe legislation can change culture.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State to ensure cultural change comes about and this is the tool to do it.</p></speech>

If one was to look at the scientific or the research landscape, there is clear evidence that female researchers can reach a certain stage but very few break through that glass ceiling.

Section 14 of the Act of 2003 is amended by adding a new subsection after subsection (3):&quot;(4) Where the Director General has responsibilities outside of the work of the Foundation assigned to him or her by the Government in relation to science policy the Director General shall publish an annual statement of such activities as he or she shall undertake in accordance with these additional responsibilities.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote>I am aware the director general is also the chief scientific adviser.  As director general he is superb and brings an enthusiasm to the role that energises everybody who meets him about science and its potential.  As he is being made chief scientific adviser, he has an overarching role.  He has to look at how Science Foundation Ireland is operating.  He almost has to assess himself and assess his organisation to be the chief scientific adviser.  We will want to see how he fulfils that role.   While not personalising the issue, maybe this is going to be the policy in the future where the head of Science Foundation Ireland is also the chief scientific adviser.  The least he should be required to provide is a separate statement on his role as chief scientific adviser, pointing out the issues encountered, something he would have done in any event if the roles were still independent.  It is not for Professor Ferguson but any future incumbent who may have other governmental responsibilities as well as being director general of Science Foundation Ireland.</p></speech>

The question is whether the chief scientific adviser has a role in interrogating or advising on Government policy because Government policy is determined by those who are given the mandate by the people to direct how policy is implemented, subject to advice, but not necessarily through the chief scientific adviser role.  We are lucky that we have a chief scientific adviser and we have continued to keep that position in Ireland.  As there are only about seven countries worldwide that have a chief scientific adviser, we are in a unique position given that we have been able to keep that role in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I understand the amendment and perhaps we need to examine it further.  The appointment of the chief scientific adviser is co-terminous with his appointment as director general.  The current arrangement will not always necessarily be the case.  We can have a further discussion on the issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Section 23 of the Act of 2003 is amended by adding a new paragraph after subsection (2)(c):&quot;(d) detail the balance of expenditure between basic and applied research, including where no such distinction is possible, and between the different strategic areas of opportunity for the State defined by the Minister in accordance with section 7(6).&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote>This amendment deals with some of the fundamental issues of the Bill.  The Minister of State signalled that the Bill is important in shaping the future direction of Science Foundation Ireland and where it goes in its teenage years and that the intention is not to move funding away from basic research.  That is the wish of the Minister of State but when another Minister takes over who has different priorities, there is nothing in the legislation to prevent him or her from upending the current Minister of State's wishes.  As he guards the legislation coming through, some other Minister may come in and change it completely.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 would oblige Science Foundation Ireland to outline specifically what it is doing.  Amendment No. 10 would require that an account be given on the proposed balance of expenditure between different types of research in various areas of research, and amendment No. 11 seeks that it be outlined in an annual report.  That means the foundation will be conscious of the wishes of the legislation about basic research and that it will be core to its remit.</p></speech>

We are extending the remit but, as I said at the earlier committee meeting, one is the logical extension of the other.  It is an almost impossible task and would require significant additional resources to be deployed within Science Foundation Ireland and also across the higher education sector and would be burdensome for the scientific community.  In reality, such a proposal would add little value over and above the systems that Science Foundation Ireland has in place.</p><p>  Perhaps I can explain it briefly.  One needs to appreciate fully the nature and increasing complexity of the research continuum which is not just at the national level but is global.  One needs to realise how it spans from the blue skies fundamental research through oriented basic research and on towards the applied research arena.  Internationally, there is the ever-increasing convergence across different scientific disciplines as well as significantly different timelines in certain sectors.  For example, ICT related research evolves far more rapidly than the life sciences and biosciences research areas, and the lines between pure fundamental research and truly applied research can be very difficult to distinguish.  Research can often span different areas and across different types.  For instance, ICT related research will cross over into the life sciences, energy and many other research areas and will typically encompass basic clinical translational and applied research.</p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland administers more than 450 live research grants with an awards commitment value of &euro;400 million spanning out to 2019.  On top of these SFI commitment levels there are also industry contributions in excess of &euro;100 million from a significant cohort of the 700 plus industry partners directly connected to SFI funded researchers.  The SFI grants awards will have differing durations and review processes which means that the SFI funding model and grants commitments and expenditure process is constantly evolving.  Invariably, there will also be a range of other funding streams in research teams that involve certain SFI supported scientists whereby the SFI element may be only one aspect, along with private industry funding, EU funding, contributions from other private sources or other national funders.  Committee members will appreciate that in recent years, Science Foundation Ireland-funded teams leveraged in excess of &euro;150 million per annum from sources other than its SFI grants, and usually close to 60% comes from non-Exchequer sources.  In 2012, the amount leveraged from other sources was approximately &euro;171 million.</p></speech>

In other words, the Department does not want to do it and will resist.  The same reply is given for parliamentary questions and so on.</p><p>  The remit has been extended but the budget is being reduced, so some areas will lose core funding.  Has the Department conducted an analysis to determine which research areas will be affected?  Who will lose if research is extended into other areas?</p><p>  At the outset the Minister of State mentioned the research prioritisation report that recommends funding to be provided for more than the identified core areas.  SFI has stated that when the Bill is passed, 100% of its programme funding will go to its priority areas.  That means that there is a contradiction between the Bill and the research prioritisation report.  My amendment would allow us to see where funding goes.  The Bill only relates to SFI.  The other institutions are covered by other legislation and we shall go after them under their headings.  I want to see where SFI spends its money.  Is it spent on core research?  Is other research undertaken?  Its funding partners are private enterprises that have a responsibility to their shareholders.  Other agencies are the responsibility of other committees and we shall get after them under those committees.  Today we are dealing with the SFI and we want to know how and where it spends its money. </p></speech>

We seek to move or evolve the research landscape in a way that will ensure that all of the State funders of research are, pretty much, on the same trajectory.  One then seeks to identify new areas of opportunity where co-funding arises.  For instance, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Teagasc and the SFI recently.  It identified new areas of opportunity in a food related space.  Even though food for health is within the priority area, there are other areas of basic research opportunities that can be mined from that type of memorandum of understanding.  Similarly, the Irish Research Council funds an industry-based PhD.</p><p>  One of the areas in which I am trying to drive a greater coherence in education is the area of stem science technology, engineering and maths.  We have a National Centre of Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning.  Perhaps we could drive new areas of funding opportunities into stem science through entities like the national centre of excellence, DCU, UCC and other areas.  I do not just mean on the pedagogue side but also funding to ensure that teachers at primary and post-primary have the ability and the benefit of excellent research that would inform continual and professional development.  That initiative would build up new knowledge areas that would provide for a throughput of students into tertiary education and help them to become the best engineers, technologists, mathematicians and scientists that the country has to offer.  </p><p>  The point that I am making is that the SFI has other areas of opportunity outside of the prioritisation exercise.  We have just announced funding of &euro;6.9 million for basic research with the potential for entrepreneurial activity to support basic scientific researchers in areas such as health.  In that sector it will enable us to research whether there are economical or societal impacts.  SFI core funding will be invested into that type of an endeavour.  </p><p>  SFI is not just concerned with prioritisation in the 14 areas.  It is involved in a raft of other activities and one shall not be at the expense of the other.  In other words, prioritisation is not applied at the expense of basic research and both aspects will continue together.</p></speech>

The legislation has elicited significant comment from the scientific community, including the likes of Professor Peter Higgs.</p><p>  My amendment seeks to provide a review mechanism.  I want the Minister to allow for peer review of the legislation, its impact and how it works.  We have heard a lot about the Government's objective to strengthen and increase the scrutiny and review roles of the Oireachtas.  In 2011 and 2012 the committee deliberated on impending legislation and identified the important issues.  They have become more important and have probably led, in some cases, to certain initiatives not being as successful as the Government wanted.  My amendment opens the door towards that.  </p></speech>

I have always contended that science research and innovation is an apolitical space.</p><p>  With regard to the amendment, I ask that we debate the matter on Report Stage.  I am openly disposed to accepting it as it would give the Houses of the Oireachtas a better opportunity to interrogate relevant issues, and I do not mean that in a loaded fashion.  It would derogate how the role of SFI translates in terms of its operational structures and programmes and its impact from a societal and economic point of view.  Even SFI, as an entity, would welcome that opportunity.</p></speech>

It also would make people more aware of the value of SFI and of research in general.  While such research does not result in jobs straight away, perhaps projects that were established many years ago are now creating jobs and SFI should be given the opportunity to show the value of research, that is, that it is providing or securing jobs at present that otherwise would not be there.  Were it not for research programmes within those facilities, many foreign direct investment jobs that exist today would not exist.  There is a need to have a forum for better public understanding of the value of research and this amendment would allow it.</p></speech>

At the time of SFI's establishment, it was generally recognised that the research it began to fund in 2000 would not generate the desired outcomes or impact for a horizon spanning perhaps ten to 15 years and we have not yet even reached that stage.  It is important to have perspective and I acknowledge the Deputy's point regarding the opportunity it presents to highlight the value of research and so on.  However, if one is to account for every single cent or euro that is spent and if one seeks to put in place an appraisal mechanism around that, is one then in danger of creating huge bureaucracies or administrative functions that are unserviceable precisely for the reasons I outlined previously?  For instance, under the new opportunities that will arise under Horizon 2020, the foreign direct investment landscape mentioned by the Deputy will, while working with the research landscape in Ireland, retain jobs.</p><p>  However, we can now use the investment made of &euro;300 million as leverage to create further opportunities during the lifetime of the next framework programme, because we believe we can ramp up that activity and surpass the &euro;600 million target under the current framework.  If one were obliged to create an administrative function to drill down into that to the last cent, I do not know whether one would be able to achieve that goal.  I do not know of any research landscape in the world, even the most highly evolved, that would be able to achieve it.  For instance, if one takes the Fraunhofer model, that is, the funding cost model that exists at present under FP7, there is a certain resistance by some larger research institutions against the simplification model the member states are trying to establish.  This is because it suits them as they can fund administrative models that allow them to get greater leverage from European Union funding calls.  Consequently, while I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, I believe it is far too prescriptive.  Its timelines are too short and were members able to develop a mechanism here whereby this matter was being debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas or was at least discussed in a formalised and structured way, they could drill down into such debates and arguments.  In that sense, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before we commence, I am glad to welcome the representative of the Irish music industry to the committee.  I pay particular tribute to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for the wonderful display of culture it has provided to our European guests for the last six months for the various events that took place as part of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I attended one of these events myself and it was wonderful to see such a display of Irish culture presented in so professional and enjoyable a manner.  I pay a special welcome to my colleague and friend from Roscrea, an tUas. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Flannag&aacute;in.</p><p>  It is of vital economic importance that Ireland, so famous for its music both traditional and modern, remains proud of that heritage, a vital part of our identity.  Whether it is the music of &Oacute; Cearbhall&aacute;in in the 18th century, The Chieftains, any of the new emerging talents in the 21st century, or even Deputy McGrath singing and dancing, we have contributed enormously to the art of music writing and delivery.  That economic importance is why the committee has invited the witnesses here today to address it on this topic.  We are interested in hearing their views and lending our support to any proposals they have to develop and benefit this sector.</p><p>  I invite Mr. Danny McCarthy to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

In view of the serious circumstances in sales and marketing, these men face a nightmare and that is why they could not be with me today.</p><p>  Serious concern must now be given to the Irish music industry, of which folk and traditional music are a major part, if they are to be considered for the future.  The major stumbling block continues to be the lack of percentage air play for Irish music, and the total lack of support from radio and TV stations nationwide.</p><p>  How do we know that the problem exists and has existed for decades?  The simple answer can be seen in the royalties collected from broadcasters nationwide by IMRO annually, which in 2010 amounted to about &euro;10 million, with an average of 93% going abroad to foreign songwriters, composers and publishers.  This average would be consistent with other years, and cannot be contradicted.  It shows that roughly 7% air play is granted to Irish music.</p><p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his predecessors have continually stated that due to a complaint made to the European Commission, 30% air play could not be granted to Irish music on the basis it would discriminate against European singers and musicians.  I have received articles on the references made by the Minister and a synopsis of Articles 18, 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for the percentage quota of Irish music the Minister referred to, and sent to Gay Mitchell, MEP, show little evidence on percentage air play.  Article No. 18 is a reference to the rights of every citizen of the European Union to be allowed to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states subject to conditions and measures adopted in the treaty.  The freedom of establishment in Article No. 49 means the free movement of self-employed persons.  For them, as for salaried workers, the basic principle is equality of treatment of all EU citizens, meaning the abolition of discrimination based on nationality.</p></speech>

It was founded in Mullingar in 1951, its aims being the promotion and fostering of Irish traditional music, song, dance, the Irish language and all aspects of Irish culture. In the past 62 years the movement has endeavoured to work on achieving these aims with considerable success.  Today Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann has in excess of 400 branches with units in every county in Ireland, units in Britain, in the United States and Canada, in Australia, in South America and in a number of European and Asian countries.  Branches outside of Ireland provide a significant link for the Irish diaspora and promote our culture to wide spectrum internationally. Tour concert groups from Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann travel to Britain and North America every year and we also respond to invites from other countries.  Groups have accompanied Presidents and trade delegations from Ireland on numerous occasions and this year we have entertained dignitaries during Ireland's presidency of the EU.</p><p>  A central element in CCE activity is our education programmes and Attracta will give an overview of all the aspects of the education programmes.  Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is a community-based movement with a democratic structure based on a constitution, ar a dtugaimid an bunreacht.  Branches and county and regional boards elect officers annually.  There are six provincial councils with the governing body, the ard comhairle, being elected by the membership.</p><p>  Volunteerism is at the heart of all Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann related activities and this is a key strength in our movement.  More than 1,000 classes are organised to assist in the transmission of music, song and dance to succeeding generations.  Fleadhanna ceoil are held in each county and region to enable young performers to pace themselves on the road to excellence.  In excess of 25,000 young people take part in the fleadh competitions annually. </p></speech>

More than 1,000 music, dancing and singing classes are organised throughout Ireland every week.  Some 700 teachers have qualified to date with the TTCT, the teastas i dteagasc ceolta t&iacute;re, a teaching diploma recognised and accepted by the Teaching Council.  This diploma has been run by the comhaltas for over 30 years.</p><p>  Classes are divided into instrument classes, which concentrate on the skills of playing the music on every traditional musical instrument and group classes, which direct the young musicians in teamwork and dynamics of group playing.  The children are coached in performance of a number of styles during these classes.  These increase the experience and confidence of young performers, thus preparing them for a variety of performance stages such as solo playing, group unison and harmony, seisi&uacute;in, concerts, tours, music exams and competitions.  Regional ensembles are trained to perform at many events, such as gig rigs at all fleadhanna ceoil, up to and including Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The scr&uacute;d&uacute; ceol t&iacute;re, SCT, exam is a 12-level graded performance examination system, based on best international practice, which provides a structured learning framework for students.  The senior grades also require written submissions from candidates, as part of the exam, on various aspects of our culture, thus ensuring that candidates have an excellent understanding of the history and background of instruments, famous musicians, events, etc.</p><p>  All branches organise recitals, concerts and seisi&uacute;in for their students to aid and increase the experiential learning opportunity.  Many of these events are run for the benefit of other community groups, thereby adding a valuable extra dimension of providing entertainment while helping others in the community.  Social capital is therefore built within these groups from a very early stage.  Youth exchange programmes with groups both within Ireland and abroad are organised annually and are important activities for sharing and reinforcing the traditions.  They serve as a valuable life experience for many young people.</p><p>  Competitions in fleadhanna ceoil provide young musicians with invaluable opportunities to gain public performance experience.  As S&eacute;amus said, some 25,000 competitors take part in these fleadhanna ceoil every year.  In Ireland alone, some 37 fleadhanna ceoil provide thousands of young musicians, singers and dancers with a platform to perfect their playing and performance.</p><p>  Summer camps also introduce traditional music, song and dance to many children throughout the summer months.  They provide an opportunity for young members to learn about event management throughout the organisation and running of these camps.  The apprenticeship style of learning is most often adopted here, with senior comhaltas members encouraging and actively aiding the younger members to take ownership of these youth events.  Scoil &Eacute;igse, the annual week-long summer school of master classes and recitals is attended by up to 1,000 students.  Many students attend these classes having achieved scholarship standard at provincial fleadhanna ceoil.  A FETAC accredited course for the production and performance of traditional Irish arts runs annually in Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;, Cashel in County Tipperary.  It has been in operation for approximately 15 years at FETAC level five.</p><p>  In summary, CCE provides formal and informal music education services to children and people of all ages.  We are very proud of our members who have gone on to become commercial artists, not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is well placed to make a positive contribution to the Irish economy as well as to the self-confidence of the Irish people.  The comhaltas organisation is now active in 15 countries and four continents, with units in such places as Sydney, Moscow, Argentina, Chile, Japan, Sardinia and Bogota, to mention a few.  These are valuable contact points that provide a focus for Ireland as a place, rich in culture and tradition.  Presenting a country in this positive light facilitates its consideration as a place to visit.  Ultimately, it culminates in financial gains for the tourism sector in Ireland.  At home in Ireland, there are significant spin-offs from comhaltas activity.  A recent independent assessment of the three years of Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann in Cavan concluded that the number of visitors to the area was 800,000, generating &euro;105 million for the region.  It is not uncommon for people to find that accommodation is not available within 20 miles of the hosting town during the weekend of the fleadh.</p><p>  Members have already heard that up to 25,000 people compete at fleadhanna ceoil each year and many of the instruments being played are produced in Ireland.  Some competitors compete in a number of competitions.  The more young people learn and play music, the more income is generated for the craftsmen who make the instruments, ultimately benefiting the Irish economy.  There is a comparable situation in regard to dancing.  With regard to music recording, a number of comhaltas units and many individual musicians produce recordings of music or song, an activity which in turn supports the recording sector.  This activity in turn facilitates businesses engaged in the retail and broadcasting sectors.</p><p>  Mar fhocal scoir, the activity generated as a direct consequence of the normal business of comhaltas indirectly supports many other sectors.  Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, "ls ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine."</p></speech>

This is the first time the fleadh has ever been hosted north of the Border.  This decision has brought a raft of benefits not only to the North of Ireland, but to the entire island.</p><p>  During our bid process we had cross-party and cross-Border support for Derry.  The fleadh ceoil is seen as an extremely significant cultural event in its own right, but it is also part of a wider city of culture project that is happening in our city this year.  We see the fleadh as an opportunity to develop genuine cross-community and cross-Border reconciliation and to build civic unity.  The fleadh ceoil has enable reconciliation on a level that has not been able to be achieved through political, social or economic means.  Music and culture have enable us to build bridges with people who might not necessarily want to engage otherwise.</p><p>  Progress so far has been extremely positive.  We established a community relations subgroup, including a cultural forum which brought together both traditions and others for the first time, to discuss how we can use the fleadh to bring communities together.  We also established a stakeholders forum, where we bring together wider society to talk through some of the issues.  The fleadh ceoil has made a bold statement in the context of its venues, through the significant use of Ebrington Square, which is a former British military army base in Derry which until recently was not available for the use of the community.  We have also taken the decision to use the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall and St. Columbs Cathedral in order to embrace all communities in our city.  </p><p>  We have had very significant participation of the Londonderry bands forum in discussions around events connected to the fleadh ceoil.  This is the first time this forum has ever engaged with any cultural group outside of its own forum.  We believe significant progress can be made, both during the fleadh and afterwards in terms of reconciliation.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

I was a bit taken aback by Mr. McCarthy saying there is a total lack of support from radio and TV stations nationwide.

Mr. &Oacute; Flannag&aacute;in referred to the important factor of the economy and mentioned that some 800,000 visitors attended the fleadh ceoil when it was held in Cavan and this was worth &euro;105 million to the region.  That significant amount came from an independent assessment.  Can Mr. &Oacute; Flannag&aacute;in tell us more about that?  How independent was the assessment?  We hear figures thrown about and hear much speculation as to worth, value and attendances.

The facts are clear if one looks at the percentage of royalties going abroad.  If we got 30% of air play, we could retain over &euro;3 million per annum in royalties for Irish song writers and composers.</p><p>  To answer the Vice Chairman's question, before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland came into being, I asked the BCI how it categorised folk and traditional music and I discovered it categorised it as "country and Irish".  We are not about country and Irish music.  We are concerned with music that is identifiable from generation to generation.  I do not accept Irish music being identified as "country and Irish".  If the Vice Chairman wants to accept it be recognised on that basis, he is welcome to that, but certainly it does not reflect the music I represent here today.</p></speech>

The research was carried out by Tourism Ireland, a body that is entirely independent from the comhaltas.  That independence is hugely significant.

To be fair, what we want to do is to hear the views of people who face challenges at this time.  Based on what Mr. McCarthy has said, there are significant challenges facing us.  I would like to make a quick point regarding my experience of local and community radio.  I have good experience in this area and these stations seem to have an ear to the ground and to echo and reflect what is happening on the ground.  It has never been easy for local radio stations, because they had to start from the bottom up.  Perhaps, through dialogue, some of the issues Mr. McCarthy has raised can be addressed.</p></speech>

Irish artists in general are raising the same question about play time on RTE because they are not getting fair play.  Gay Mitchell MEP raised it in the European Parliament.  He is from a constituency close to me.</p><p>  It is up to us to make our own regulations.  We like to keep our independence, particularly because of our culture and language.  The same argument arose years ago around the Arts Council funding and grants.  Approximately ten years ago, we separated the funding for Irish culture and the traditional arts.  It is time that RTE did the same.  Local radio stations give them more air time because it is easy for them.  Mr. McCarthy made the point that country music takes over from Irish.  I like both.  I am not condemning one.  I like traditional and folk music.  A recommendation should go from this committee that the statistics should be separated out.  We will ask RTE for the statistics.  We also have them from Tourism Ireland but we need to get them from the horse's mouth and we should not let RTE get away with the title "Country and Irish".</p></speech>

Many of the traditions are dying out but Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, CCE, has kept alive the traditions of music and making the instruments.  There are many houses waiting for another CCE to happen.  I know one in particular.  There was more funding in the good old days than now.  Has CCE stopped the programme in which the community worked with it on the ground?  There are buildings that perhaps it could move into at very little cost.  They might need a little refurbishment but it could work with local authorities on that.</p><p>  I am a member of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  I think it is the best thing that ever happened.  It is great that for the first time, CCE and the Fleadh are going north of the Border.  I congratulate it.  I will make everyone on the BIPA aware that everyone there should attend in whatever capacity they want.  I have attended and enjoyed the Fleadh in the past and hope to do so again in the future.</p></speech>

I totally empathise with him because he is right about the national broadcaster.  It is not only a question of Irish music but the whole spectrum of culture and heritage across the board.</p></speech>

The local and independent radio stations have their battles with us to get a better share of the funding, as I know because I am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I have been very critical of RTE, not only in respect of Irish language and culture but also on issues such as the pro-life debate when it is biased.  I do not know why but it gets away with spin and does not do what it should do.  CCE's problem with opportunities for jobs in industry is huge, and other committees should consider it too.  Businesses and the self-employed, as Mr. McCarthy said, should be valued.</p><p>  The Vice Chairman does not need to ask Tourism Ireland about the Fleadh.  I was at the Fleadh in Cavan and one would know from the difficulty of trying to get accommodation or to move around the streets and attend the competitions &ndash; indeed the uachtar&aacute;n was at the opening-----</p></speech>

He was out enjoying the music too.  It was fabulous.  Some of my family and members of our group won an all-Ireland rince set there.  They were in Ballina this year and are hoping to go to Doire.  I am delighted that it is going to Doire and I wish CCE well with it.  I think it will be bigger and better.  It is a matter of bringing us together.  There are disparate groups and they do not get any cohesive support from Government or public bodies.  I compliment the Tipperary development group which is running a course on the making of uilleann pipes.  It has sponsored several students of different ages to come to Dublin to learn to make that wonderful instrument.  We must value what we have and now in a recession is the time to really examine it because in the boom time we forgot about these things.  It is our culture, heritage and identity and we must nurture and support it.</p><p>  I would like to talk to our guests again at other committees.  I welcome them and thank them for their work.  Comhghairdeas &oacute; chro&iacute; le Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; agus a bhean ch&eacute;ile, &Uacute;na, for all the entertainment they give in Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;, a fabulous centre in Caiseal na Mumhan.  Businesses from all over the world visit it.  I go there a couple of times a year and there are people from different continents.  CCE does good work abroad too.  The work it did to showcase our heritage at recent events in Dublin Castle and elsewhere during our EU Presidency was tremendous.  We are lucky to have it to do that.  We should respect it.  We do not promote it enough.</p><p>  I have no question except a freagra for the Vice Chairman about Cavan.  I would have no questions about that.  In fairness to RTE, Mary Kennedy did a fabulous show the week before the Fleadh last year.  I was very impressed with the arts linkages in Cavan.  I am sure that will happen in Derry.  I could not get over how it had been broadened out and it can be broadened out much more.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s saying is very appropriate, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  I say onwards and upwards.</p></speech>

Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leo as an s&aacute;r obair at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acu chun cult&uacute;r agus ceol na h&Eacute;ireann a chur chun cinn.  I do not really have any questions for CCE but I would like to ask Mr. McCarthy one or two questions.  I was very impressed by CCE's presentation.  I have some knowledge of it because I am from Listowel, and even though I was never an active branch member, I was a very active Fleadh organiser.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; knows that I was involved in the latter Fleadhanna in Listowel which were very successful.  Listowel was very good to Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann because there had been a dip in its popularity in the early 1960s and the first one in Listowel was a great success.  Every one afterwards was an even bigger success.  Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann and CCE were, in turn, extremely good to my native town.  It put our image on the map, projected us and was good financially.  As someone who was in business at the time, I can assure CCE that the additional revenue it brought in to the town and the hinterland within 25 miles of Listowel was greatly appreciated.  I have attended the Fleadhanna in Cavan and Tullamore, all of which are wonderful.</p></speech>

She has been a tremendous representative both local and nationally for Comhaltas and we are all very proud of her in Offaly.  The work Comhaltas has done over the years and the experience of the Fleadh in Tullamore reflected what the delegation said about other experiences nationally.  It is marvellous that it will be held in Derry this year and it will be a great experience for all the participants.  The young participants from Derry will be so proud to be able to play in their town and county.  That is the value of moving the festival around.  It is great that young people can compete in their own county, giving them extra pride.</p><p>  Comhaltas flew the flag for Irish music when it was not popular to do so.  It is almost cool now to be able to play an Irish instrument whereas years ago there was much competition from other musical influences from other parts of the world.  I am looking forward to the Leinster Fleadh in Edenderry.  My nephew will be playing at it, so I will be rooting for him.</p><p>  I find the <i>Treoir</i> magazine a marvellous way of keeping track of what is happening in Comhaltas.  I did not realise how global Comhaltas has become.  Our music and entertainers are gateways into business.  It is not just about preserving the culture and enriching peoples&rsquo; lives but opening doors to other activities abroad.</p><p>  I thank the delegation, Comhaltas and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for all the work they do in this area.  We need to iron out the categories as to what comprises Irish music.  Are musicians folk, traditional or contemporary?  How do the various radio stations categorise them?  Do they slot all Irish music into the &quot;Country and Irish&quot; category?</p><p>  My local radio station, Midlands 103, is terrific for promoting traditional Irish music and young emerging Irish musicians.  It is providing not just a community service but is also a successful business and will receive a midlands gateway business award.  What is the relationship between IMRO and the regional radio stations?  Does IMRO use the same criteria in calculating levies for these stations as it uses for RTE and larger stations?</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of the presentations but I was unintentionally held up in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  There is a big issue as to what comprises the Irish music industry.  Local radio and Comhaltas would promote Irish traditional music.  Local radio is interested in request programmes which national stations tend not to be.  Years ago, RTE had a programme called &ldquo;Hospitals Requests&rdquo; but now I suppose there are more televisions in hospital wards.  Midwest Radio has very well-known presenters like John Duggan or Michael Commins.  They play many requests and they would be very much in the Irish vein.  Kevin Rohan on Galway Bay FM has a Monday night Irish traditional programme too.</p><p>  We recently had a successful county fleadh cheoil in my village of Castleblakeney.  A fleadh cheoil will be well received in a small town or village.</p></speech>

I note that Mr. Danny McCarthy is raring to go, so he can speak first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Danny McCarthy" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013061100010#M00300"><p>The view of the people I represent is that local radio is as bad as RTE in terms of getting airplay for their music during the day - that is, from 7 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the evening.  Those are the hours during which there is prime time listenership, and that is an important factor.</p><p>  When I decided to examine the legislation covering broadcasting, I found that the one great word that was written in capital letters was "diversity".  I decided to study the level of diversity in the Irish music industry.  We have to embrace all aspects of Irish music.  I am a folk singer-songwriter by profession.  I have a song that received airplay in France, which sold a quarter of a million albums, but I cannot even get airplay for it in Ireland.  However, I am not going down the road of talking about myself.  I spoke to a great songwriter friend of mine recently, who told me that six months ago when he was being interviewed by one the local stations that was mentioned he asked for a track from his CD - which he had sent to the station -  to be played, but the DJ told him that they did not keep Irish CDs on the CD files in their library.  We have the most stupid, ridiculous legislation that does not empower anybody to do anything and, to compound that, we have no regulation.  Midwest Radio was mentioned.  It is a great station and those operating it have a business whereby they can rule themselves, run their own business and cater for their own needs.  I will not speak about individual radio stations, but RTE radio is a typical example.  We would only get three or four tracks of Irish recordings played, if we are lucky, on one music programme, "The Ronan Collins Show" at lunchtime, of all the music programmes broadcast  from 7 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the evening.  I worked at the Ordnance Survey for 25 years and mathematics is something I love.  In this respect, 92% talk radio as against 8% music does not add up, in my estimation.  On Lyric FM there are two to three pure traditional radio programmes per week.  That does not even give rise to a percentage ratio.  The situation for us is disastrous.</p><p>  I speak to songwriters and composers every day of the week who are unemployed and struggling to survive but they have the greatest qualities.  They are brilliant, but we have no regulator to ensure their music gets airplay.  We need to sit down and discuss this issue with the broadcasting authority.  We met the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy two weeks ago and Phil Coulter was with us.  The Deputy will recall that he said that if he were to write and record "The Town I loved So Well" today, it would not be played on Irish radio.  That is the factual position and the reason I am here today.  I am talking about something that is rotten, not in the state of Denmark but in the State of Ireland.  I met Gay Mitchell, MEP, three months ago and he presented a case to the European Commission on my behalf.  The European Commission has no knowledge of the ridiculous legislation to do with the 30% provision.  We need to address this.  I spoke the chief executive of a top music business recently and he said that 15% of those in the Irish music industry control 85% of the wealth.  That is wrong.  We need to change that.  We need to have a middle class in this respect.  When I started as a professional in 1985 I took a five-year career break from the Ordnance Survey and I kept a four-piece band employed and on the road, but I could not do that today.  That is what is radically wrong.  We cannot generate employment because we need access to airplay.</p><p>  Regarding television, we have about 40 hours a week of imported soaps, Australian and British, and what have we got that is Irish?  We have nothing.  I rest my case.  We have IMRO and the PPS, which collects money for the musicians who play on the recordings.</p></speech>

The royalties are being collected.  That is an example of what is happening.  Around 7% of that remains here.  People have told me that some of the very successful groups, such as U2 and The Corrs, have publishers in Holland, as members may have read in an article published the other day, and their royalties are going there.  Some &euro;9.25 million in royalties went outside Ireland in 2010.  About &euro;750,000 remains for Irish songwriters and composers.  Is that not ridiculous?  I started my business in hotels and pubs, but 49% of pubs are now closing.  I travelled around the country 12 months ago to all the radio stations and I nearest I got to them was the reception desk.  As I travelled to those stations I was shocked to see that the grass was growing up around the front doors of the venues in which I had performed for many years.  All those venues in Tipperary, Kerry, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and other countries are now closed.</p></speech>

I was at the Galway fleadh in Castleblakeney and it a very enjoyable event.  Deputy Michael Kitt raised the issue of funding.  Any injection of funding that a Comhaltas unit gets towards running a fleadh - whether it be a Comhaltas branch or a county that is running it - from a local authority or from the State, Comhaltas is able to magnify 20 times.  In other words, if somebody provides funding of &euro;1,000 for Fleadh Cheoil na Gaillimhe to be held in Castleblakeney, such funding will back up the volunteer effort.  If the volunteer effort is combined with the funding, we augment the funding at least 20 times over, maybe more.  Our big strength is our volunteerism and without it our organisation and movement could not function as it does.   The work of our volunteers is inspirational, including the professional back-up that is required, whether in the form of training or support.  If we have to spend a significant amount of time fundraising to run events, it takes from the creative things we do, which we are very good at doing if we have the time to do them.  Fundraising can be soul-destroying.  We appreciate that the State has supported us significantly in recent years.</p> <p>However, that was not always the case.  There was a time, in fact, when we did not receive a shilling of State funding.  Of course we would be delighted to receive more funding than we currently do but, in the present circumstances, we very much appreciate what we have.  There are mechanisms for funding within many local authorities, including through the arts offices, where a certain level of funding is available.  It is very limited but it is something.  As times improve, we hope the level of funding will increase.</p><p> I assure the committee that whatever investment comes into organisations like Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann is put to good use.  We achieve a multiple of the initial investment in terms of outcomes.  An investment of &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000, for example, to a voluntary organisation such as ours can represent a potential benefit of hundreds of thousands of euro.

Senator C&aacute;it Keane asked about the establishment of new branches and the use of buildings.  New branches are being formed all the time.  It only takes a few enthusiastic people who can organise themselves, put their application together and set up a structure.  They will receive every assistance they need from their local county board or from head office.  Anybody in the organisation would be happy to help them.  There is even the added advantage that the subscription to head branch that is normally payable for insurance purposes is paid for them in the first year to get them up and running.  There is no obstacle to the establishment of new branches, and we welcome any and all in this regard.  It would be nice to see every area represented if possible.</p><p>  In regard to the availability of premises, my advice to new branches would generally be to concentrate more on activities.  Schools and halls are usually available locally.  One might get bogged down with other issues instead of focusing on what is important, which is the music and the Gaeilge.  Branches can and usually are run in classrooms, halls and similar.  Chun cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don choiste as ucht &eacute;isteacht linn inniu.</p></speech>

Airplay is the cornerstone of our industry and the means by which we can generate marketing, sales and employment.  Record companies are struggling to survive nationally.  Without meaning to engage in self-praise, it has taken guts to say what I have said today.  We need Government support and a commitment to the Irish music industry.  Looking at Canada and France, one can see how by changing the whole structure they have created a proper industry.  That is what is required in this country.</p><p>  I thank the Vice Chairman and members for having me here today.</p></speech>

This is set against the debate we have had as a committee, culminating with the publication of a joint committee report in July 2012.  This year we met on 5 March to discuss the concerns of the committee regarding the non-consultant hospital doctor issue.  We have also met representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation and the non-consultant hospital doctor committee to hear concerns.  We have met Mr. O'Brien on a quarterly basis, as well as other representatives of the HSE and the Department of Health, and we have discussed recruitment, pay and conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Many members of the committee have expressed serious concerns about the issue and we hope today's meeting will bring clarity in that regard.</p><p>  I welcome the guests and thank them for coming before us today.  Before commencing I remind witnesses and members of privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Clodagh Murray to the Gallery, as she is on a work experience programme in the Houses.  Mr. O'Brien can now make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry O'Brien" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100003#B00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I am joined by a number of my colleagues, Dr Ciaran Browne, national lead, acute services, Professor Eilis McGovern, director of medical education and training, and Mr. Andrew Condon, general manager, human resources.</p><p>  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, play a very important and fundamental role in the provision of services in our hospitals.  The current NCHD workforce comprises approximately 4,910 NCHDs, including 570 interns, 1,812 senior house officers, SHOs, 1,620 registrars and 908 specialist-senior registrars.  Of the 4,910, 80% hold structured training posts, while 20% of NCHDs hold service posts.  In recent years, the HSE has increased the proportion of NCHDs in formal training schemes from less than 40% to approximately 80%, increased the number of specialist registrar posts by 60% and, this year, will increase intern posts from 570 to 639.</p><p>  The HSE recruits a small proportion of NCHDs.  There are two types of NCHD posts: training posts and service posts.  Some 81% of NCHDs are recruited by postgraduate training bodies for placement in training posts in hospitals or health agencies.  The HSE recruits approximately 15% of NCHDs, all of whom are recruited to service posts.  HSE-funded agencies recruit the remaining 4% of NCHDs to service posts.</p><p>  Particular hospitals and specialties have experienced difficulties filling NCHD posts over recent years.  Addressing this issue has been a priority for the health service and has included a number of recruitment programmes internationally.  This has meant that over the past three years, the majority of NCHD posts &ndash; 98% - are filled normally.  Where staffing issues exist, there remain sufficient agency staff to meet service needs.  This means that the hospital system has operated with a small ongoing vacancy level in recent years.  In this context, a challenge facing the health service is that higher payments to agency staff have incentivised NCHDs to leave normal employment and work for agencies with the expectation that they will be hired back by hospitals.  This is particularly relevant in emergency medicine and psychiatry.</p><p>  NCHDs are recruited twice a year &ndash; in January and July &ndash; to accommodate training rotations.  A number of recruitment processes are under way in preparation for July 2013.  Postgraduate training bodies are filling posts on training schemes.  The HSE centralised applications process directs applications to hospitals.  Local recruitment is being done by HSE hospitals and agencies, where candidates are selected and interviewed and a decision is made to fill posts.  There is external recruitment in South Africa, focusing on emergency medicine.  There is an agreed process with the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan to rotate their trainees into Irish hospitals as part of their training scheme in Pakistan before they return to training posts in Pakistan.</p><p>  Particular concerns identified regarding recruitment for July 2013 include changes in the quality of applicants to some sites in terms of training or experience, the ongoing requirement for registrar level doctors in emergency medicine and anaesthesia, who are in short supply internationally, and the consequences of ongoing adjustment of training schemes to ensure participants have a reasonable chance of competing successfully for consultant posts.  This means that some schemes are reducing the number of training posts, albeit the proportion of training posts continues to increase.</p><p>  Specific actions are being taken to ensure posts are filled.  The HSE medical education and training, MET, unit and the integrated services directorate, ISD, have worked together with the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan to place trainees in a structured training programme in Ireland for two years.  The interview process, which was conducted in conjunction with the relevant postgraduate medical training bodies, indicated that applicants were of a high standard.  This initiative is likely to yield up to 30 doctors in 2013 but has potential for greater numbers and additional specialties in 2014 and beyond.  This will be of significant benefit to emergency medicine, a specialty that has been consistently at risk of vacancies over recent years.</p><p>  Earlier this year, the HSE engaged two recruitment companies to begin the process of sourcing additional doctors from South Africa.  This was initially focused on access through the supervised division, but revised access rules for general registration based on South African intern equivalency from 2006 required a change in approach.  Initial reports from the recruitment companies indicate potential availability of ten to 20 candidates, primarily in emergency medicine, with limited numbers across other specialties.  Depending on specialty match, the HSE will assign these doctors to work in hospitals with traditional recruitment challenges, such as in Drogheda and Letterkenny.  Since February, the HSE has provided four administrative staff to the Medical Council to support the efficient and timely registration of doctors prior to the July rotation.</p><p>  In ongoing local and national recruitment, the normal NCHD recruitment process is taking place in parallel with the measures just mentioned following advertising by the national recruitment service nationally and internationally.  Delays in confirming fill rates for training scheme posts and timeframes for interviews create difficulty in accurately reporting on vacancies.  Current data indicate that approximately 200 posts remain to be filled for the July rotation.  These constitute 4% of all NCHD posts.  Vacancies are concentrated in three specialties at registrar level - anaesthesia, general medicine and emergency medicine.</p><p>  Alongside the measures just described, hospitals experiencing particular challenges have been authorised to advertise nationally and internationally in addition to broader HSE advertising.  Hospitals are also evaluating revised NCHD rotas and, in exceptional circumstances, the use of agency staff.  This latter option is clearly a last resort given the financial implications.  Vacancies are generally located in small to medium size hospitals which have limited consultant numbers and do not have the volume or complexity of activity to support training posts.  Taking account of trends in filling posts over recent weeks and noting that the system operates with an ongoing vacancy level, it is anticipated that the vacancies will reduce day by day in the period up to 8 July.</p><p>  The HSE is a partner in an NCHD graduate retention initiative established in 2012.  As part of this initiative, appropriate support services for trainee doctors are being identified and trainee doctor representatives, who will represent the concerns of trainee doctors at a senior level with the hospital management structure, are being appointed.  Key concerns in terms of retention are long working hours and pay for hours worked.  In this context, the HSE has established a national implementation group to progress compliance with the requirements of the European working time directive, EWTD, and to facilitate introduction of electronic time recording and rostering systems.  The Minister for Health has indicated to the European Commission that he is committed to full implementation of the EWTD for NCHDs by the end of 2014.</p><p>  Each hospital and agency has prepared an action plan which identifies the steps to be taken to implement the national standards, other actions that will reduce NCHD hours and related timescales and accountability with a particular focus on two key targets.  These are a maximum working week of 68 hours and a maximum period on-site on-call of 24 hours.  The national group has just completed a process of site visits to each acute hospital and will report in coming weeks on the extent to which NCHDs are compliant with the 68 hour target.</p><p>  Under the public service sustainability agreement, which the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, is recommending its members accept, the IMO and the HSE have agreed, under the heading &quot;retention of graduates of Irish medical schools&quot; to:<blockquote>review the current public health and community medicine, NCHD and consultant career structure with the aim of further developing the career and training pathways from intern to consultant-specialist level.  This will take account of service needs, training and service posts, the health reform programme, the urgent requirement to reduce NCHD working hours and developments in relation to EU legislation.  The overall objective is the retention of graduates of Irish medical schools within the public health system and the attraction back to Ireland of such graduates - where they have left previously.  The management side and the IMO will begin the process by June 2013.</blockquote>  Also under the public service sustainability agreement, the IMO, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, have confirmed their co-operation with the commencement of task reallocation from doctors to nurses, in specified areas, namely phlebotomy, cannulation, first dose medication and delegated discharge.  They have committed to further negotiations on other changes to health care delivery to achieve EWTD compliance.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien for his presentation and for highlighting the current situation.  It is reassuring that a commitment has been given to provide a career path and retain graduates.  At the same time vacancies exist in key areas as Mr. O'Brien's outlined in his report Anaesthesia, General Medicine and Emergency Medicine at Registrar Level.  I call on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to commence because, in the absence of Fianna F&aacute;il, he can take the lead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100004#C00500"><p>My party would do so at any time.</p><p>  I presumed that the opening statement by Mr. O'Brien was going to be followed by others of his colleagues.</p><p>  I join with the Chairman in welcoming the delegation.  We are readdressing the issue even though it is a short period since the quarterly meeting.  It underscores the high level of concern by the level of the Oireachtas joint committee regarding the reality of NCHD cover at a number of hospital sites around the country as of July. </p><p>  On the last occasion Mr. O'Brien attended he indicated the recruitment target from Pakistan as being 20 NCHDs for each of the specialties of anaesthesia, emergency medicine and surgical specialties was identified but that the target would not be &quot;achievable in anaesthesia, in particular.&quot;  Those were his words.  Is that still the case?  What is the up-to-date information on anaesthesia, in particular, and the targeting of Pakistan?  </p><p>  With regard to South Africa, we were told of a potential availability of ten to 20 candidates out of a set target of 60.  Again, there has been a major shortfall.  What is the current position?</p><p>  We have the incredible situation, that was also mentioned in the five page report, whereby higher payments paid to agency staff are incentivising NCHDs to leave their normal employment in order to take up agency posts.  This is done on the basis that they will then be re-employed in the vacancy created through agency appointment or deployment.  Clearly, those posts are not open to being filled in the normal way under the current employment embargo.  Can Mr. O'Brien comment on the matter?  Is it true that when an NCHD person leaves a post to join an agency, the post can only be filled by agency staff?  Does that not highlight the need for more NCHD posts, initially?  I emphasised the word &quot;initially&quot; because I believe that the committee is of one mind in wanting to implement its recommendation to create new grades and a new career path, in the first instance, for young Irish trained doctors working in the health system.  What is the position as of July?  What is the shortfall?  How will it impact on patient care?</p><p>  The Chairman does not have a bell but he has a big mallet that he may hit me with when I mention the following.  At the end of last week I received a parliamentary reply to a question that I tabled on Letterkenny General Hospital.  It is one of the specific hospital sites that I have instanced as a particular area of concern.  I shall conclude by pointing out that a reply received from Mr. John Hayes, Donegal area manager, HSE West confirmed the serious situation that pertains at the hospital.  I have highlighted the matter here before.  The situation at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is particularly acute.  Mr. Hayes indicated that every effort was being made but stated:  <blockquote>However, key challenges still remain in some specialties and particularly in respect of Registrar grade doctors.  This is especially true in the Department of Medicine where the requirement for locum registrars is expected to be close to 50% of the total in that department.</blockquote>  Access to trainee posts is one of the areas that I have highlighted that needs to be addressed.  A greater number of trainee posts are directed to other major hospital sites.  Mr. Hayes also advised: <blockquote>Dialogue with the Royal Colleges &amp;amp; the HSE Medical Education &amp;amp; Training Unit has enabled Letterkenny to designate a greater proportion of existing NCHD posts as formal training posts.  The hospital has also engaged medical agencies to source doctors for key posts.  </blockquote>That is stating the obvious, the hospital is in desperate need to overcome the current challenges.  A fear that has been expressed to me about Letterkenny General Hospital is that some services may not be sustained as of the July date because of the great difficulties that the HSE is having in finding a sufficient number of post holders to undertake the workload and job responsibility at the hospital.  </p></speech>

I appreciate their work and acknowledge that they work in a difficult area.  It is not easy to manage 4,700 junior doctors and its a different issue again to manage them in individual hospitals.  I hope that anything I say is not taken as a personal criticism.</p><p>  I shall follow the comments made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on emergency medicine.  There is a major crisis in emergency medicine due to the expected shortfall of around 28%.  The current figures state that Tallaght will be short two out of five, Limerick three out of six, Cork four out of seven, Drogheda five out of nine, Loughlinstown two out of three, Galway two out of eight and Castlebar two out three.  There is also a major problem in the northwest region with a shortfall of around 80 in medicine.  There are also particular problems in Letterkenny and Portlaoise due to a shortage of two out of three registrars in the obstetrics and gynaecology unit.  </p><p>  My other concern relates to the 2003 report.  It contained a commitment that we would have 3,600 consultants by 2012 but we have only 2,500 consultants at present.  Recently I got the figures on the employment of a registrar for six months which had a provision that positions could not be filled on 1 July.  There is now a commitment to give two agency posts to registrars.  The cost of the registrar for six months is &euro;125,000.  Should we return to the Hanly report of 2003 when reviewing the junior doctor process?  Is it not cheaper to employ five consultants rather than have three consultants and four registrars?  Should we reduce the number of registrars?  We have not revisited the sector.  The use of agency staff will incur great costs for the HSE and lead to an overrun in its budget.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien's report that where the junior doctors are aware of shortage, they are leaving posts in order to fill them again under an agency contract.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100005#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for the presentation.  I ask the witnesses to focus on many of the points raised by Senator Colm Burke.  First, I am the mother of a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD.  He entered that career full of hope, having wanted to be a doctor since he was eight years old.  However, both he and his colleagues are really frustrated and their morale is really low.  While Mr. O'Brien talked about a career path, I do not know what career path because all I know is that he does interviews every six months and every 12 months.  He and many of his friends have been obliged to emigrate and it is very frustrating for them.  I did not speak to him before today's meeting because sometimes it is very difficult to listen to him or even to get him, because he appears to be working all the time.  I note the junior doctors put forward the idea that starting in their first year, they should work for two years as junior doctors, rather than the single year they work at present before being obliged to go abroad or to be placed again.  In many of the hospitals mentioned that are having difficulties, there is no proper career path for these kids.</p><p>  In addition, I note another relative sat the leaving certificate examinations last year, secured 600 points but did not get into medicine.  It galls me when I hear the HSE is trying to bring people into the country because we do not have a sufficient number of doctors and yet kids whose leaving certificate results yielded 600 points did not get into medicine.  This is disgraceful and I refer to kids who are sitting the leaving certificate exams today.  While I believe the position in respect of the HPAT exams will be changed next year because it has failed, there are kids who came through our system but did not get into medicine although they really wanted to so do and who have gone abroad.  Some of my son's friends have trained in Wales and England and are doing very well.  They now are fantastic doctors in the English system.  We are supplying New Zealand and Australia with the best doctors but cannot employ our own doctors.  Consequently, we really must consider their career path.  I ask the witnesses to comment specifically on the proposal for two-year rotas for junior doctors in Ireland, rather than the current one-year rota.  While I have said all I have to say, I must tell Mr. O'Brien I get really annoyed when I hear him talking about trying to bring doctors into the country.  Why do we not train enough doctors and give them a proper career path in this country?</p></speech>

On the issue of agency recruitment, I reassure the joint committee that the HSE has no interest in employing people on an agency basis.  We do so only when there is a crisis.  There is no current embargo and nor does the moratorium impinge on our capacity to employ NCHDs in an NCHD rotation.  However, given the nature of our hospital system and structure, as well as the manner in which training places are approved and authorised by the training bodies, there will always be a percentage of posts which will be what are termed service posts only.  In other words, to sustain our hospital infrastructure, there will be service posts and there are, for reasons best known to the doctors themselves, people who are not interested in a career path or in any sort of career ladder.  They simply are people who are interested in maximising their earning potential by working on an agency basis and as a freelancer wherever they get the work.</p></speech>

Another issue is we have never had more consultants employed in the public health system and have never had more NCHDs employed in the public health system.  It is important to point out that while the Hanly report recommended a redistribution involving more consultants and fewer NCHDs, the HSE has been ploughing ahead in increasing the numbers of both.  There certainly are challenges and there certainly is a need to revisit this issue.  The HSE is committed, with the professional organisations representing all NCHDs and consultants, to engage in that and we will start that process next week.  However, there certainly are lessons to be learned in this regard and things to improve.  I will ask Professor McGovern to deal specifically with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's issue in respect of Pakistan and others.  Mr. Condon will deal with the issues raised on a hospital basis by Senator Burke.  He also will comment on the issue raised by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.</p></speech>

This is the first year in which we have done this and there is a learning aspect to it.  While we targeted initially 60 doctors in three specialties, as we stated previously, we were not going to compromise on the standards and the safety of these doctors.  We set the standards high and we made this point to our own training bodies from the point of view of selection.  The Medical Council also has a role in respect of patient safety.  The difficulty in recruiting sufficient doctors for anaesthesia was related to their experience, in that the issue pertained to the minimum experience we required for doctors to work in the Irish health system.  On the contrary, we got excellent applicants for the surgery programme and all 20 posts were filled, although one subsequently was withdrawn because the person did not have the Medical Council requirements.  Next year, we will have learned from this experience and if we decide to have a programme such as this for 2014, we will apply what we have learned, at both the Pakistan end and the HSE and Medical Council end, to ensure we get the right doctors.  The important thing was not to compromise on the safety profile of the doctors who were coming to work here.</p></speech>

I personally was involved in the recruitment of doctors in Pakistan a number of years ago.  They were interviewed in English in Pakistan by our consultants and by human resources staff and they passed an English test with the Medical Council in Ireland before being able to take up work.  I think that is an issue that is of concern and we also have a provision we have circulated to all employers that in cases in which an employer has concerns regarding the English language capacities of any health staff member, the employer can ask that staff member to undergo the international English language testing system, IELTs, test.</p></speech>

We would anticipate that by July we will have a much lower number than the 200 that have been reported today.  General medicine has been highlighted as a particular issue.  One of the influencing factors is our efforts to progress compliance with the working time directive to achieve a better working environment for doctors, something which Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor referenced.</p><p>  One of the measures to improve working conditions for doctors is to put larger numbers of doctors on particular rotas where they are appropriate.  What we are seeing at the moment is that to some extent one of the reasons doctors are moving around the country is to take up posts in some of the larger sites, as opposed to the smaller sites.  One of the solutions to that is to increase the number of consultant posts and lower rotas.  In obstetrics, for example, we have a number of hospitals where there are three obstetricians providing cover.  Senator Burke mentioned that one of the solutions to this was to increase the number of consultants.  We have offered hospitals experiencing those kinds of problems the facility to apply for additional consultant posts in place of existing NCHD posts, for example, in Letterkenny.  The offer has been in place for some years.  In terms of growing consultant numbers-----</p></speech>

One of the issues in Letterkenny and similar hospitals is the structuring of the medical workforce.  Another issue mentioned was the number of training posts in Letterkenny.  There is a parallel between having additional consultant numbers making sure junior doctors are in training and that people in whom one invests locally in terms of training and education come back to work in the hospital.  As part of that, one of the issues we are confronting in Letterkenny is increasing the number of training posts there.</p></speech>

Also, six of the trainees coming from Pakistan are going to Letterkenny, two to emergency medicine and four to surgery.  There is also a senior registrar in surgery going to Letterkenny this year.  We are working with the training bodies to try to address the issue mentioned by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, namely, the distribution of trainees within central hospitals and more peripheral hospitals.  We all recognise that there is an excellent training opportunity for young doctors in peripheral hospitals.  We are trying to get that balance better distributed and we are working with the training bodies on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy received a communication that there were eight vacancies in Letterkenny.  He also referred to 80 vacancies across the north west, which I presume is possibly Mayo but more likely to be Sligo and Letterkenny.  Again, our information is that the figure is substantially lower.  I put a warning tag on individual figures taken at a certain date given the dynamic nature of the situation.  We have been in this place repeatedly in the past three to four years, where in May or June we have a certain vacancy rate but by the time we get to the NCHD rotation date in July what we find is that we have to make no reduction in services and the staff employed often provide a higher level of service.  I will ask my colleague, Dr. Browne, to comment on the actual response we would have if there was a service issue.</p></speech>

Each of those hospitals must make their adjustments based on the projections but we must also acknowledge the fact that there are a lot of modernisation, service improvement and initiatives happening at local level.  We have referenced some of them previously such as the reallocation of some of the tasks previously carried out by junior doctors to nurses, but also a lot of the business processes that are used within hospitals are being significantly improved, as well as the clinical programmes that are under way across many hospitals.  There is much good work going on that helps to cushion the impact of any reduction or vacancy levels in hospitals.</p><p>  As Mr. Condon acknowledged, there are hospitals which previously carried a vacancy and therefore the numbers quoted today might not necessarily be an increase in the current vacancy rate and they are covering the gap in the number of vacancies by potential-----</p></speech>

In my experience and from talking to colleagues, the clinical directors are making representations to us either on the basis of our committee membership or individually to express concern at what is happening and the impact that could be felt in July.  I accept the bona fides of Mr. Condon that today&rsquo;s figure will be different from next week&rsquo;s figure but why then are clinical directors coming to committee members to voice criticism of the process?  Why, in the case of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Senator Burke, was it suggested to them that there would be a diminution in service?</p></speech>

As Mr. Condon said, we have been in this situation previously and there has been no diminution in services subsequently.  In some cases there might be a requirement to reduce some services, for example, outpatient services, but many of those decisions are made on the basis of local priorities.  For example, the contingency plan that one might need to put in place for a large tertiary hospital such as Beaumont Hospital will be significantly different to perhaps a smaller hospital in another location.</p></speech>

Initially we recruited 220 doctors from those countries and they were placed on the supervised division within the Medical Council.  The individual registration of a doctor is between the doctor and the Medical Council, while the HSE is interested in facilitating the transfer of many of those doctors from the supervised division to the general division.</p><p>  Last year we began a process with the Medical Council to specifically create additional capacity to facilitate the transfer of those doctors from India and Pakistan to the general division.  We have supported the Medical Council with additional administrative support so the documentation and all the administrative processes associated with registration could be fast-tracked through the system.  The HSE has been working with the Medical Council to ensure the opportunity for those doctors to take up registration is in place and we have worked with each of the individual doctors to see how we could assist them in the transfer.</p><p>  Of the cohort of 220 doctors, we would not expect all 100% of them to stay on, they make individual choices based on career or family considerations, but we have worked to create the capacity within the Medical Council to facilitate that registration process.</p></speech>

We have increased year-on-year the number of interns, as recommended in the Fottrell report.  It is a reflection on the quality of the training in Ireland that many Irish doctors decide to travel the world and practise their profession in other locations, despite the fact we have increased by 500 the number of consultant posts that have been available.  That is the nature of the profession; people travel in other professions when they have a globally recognised credential.</p><p>  The very nature of our rotation twice a year in January and July, based on the requirements of the training, means that other statutory agencies have a contribution to make if there is to be a fundamental change in the dynamic of how we plan and deliver medical education and training and we are working with each of them.  Around this time every year, the level of vacancies changes on a daily basis.  This time last year, May was a crisis month and by the third week of June, every slot was accounted for.  I am not saying the same will happen this year, but that is the nature of the business we are in when it comes to situations like this.</p></speech>

Someone asked if this is a recurring problem every July and if there is any long-term plan.  The long-term plan relates to reducing the number of service posts.  Vacancies occur in the service posts, the training posts are mostly filled by our own graduates.  About 20% of posts are service grade posts and that is why we depend on doctors coming from other countries.  Our plan is to convert most of those posts to training posts in the next two to three years.  We need to create those training posts to build capacity in the system for the Fottrell graduates.  We have gone from 340 graduates per annum to 725 expected next year, when the Fottrell numbers plateau.  If we could envisage in two or three years' time a situation where we had more intern posts, more trainee posts and many fewer service grade posts, perhaps 200 fewer, the recurring nature of the vacancy problem in July would recede greatly.</p><p>  I reiterate the remarks I made the last time we were here.  We have an international responsibility to train doctors from low and middle-income countries.  It would never be our goal to be completely self-sustaining.  Every First World country traditionally trains doctors from less well-off countries so they can go back to those countries and add value to their health services.</p></speech>

In hospital groups, hospitals can recruit through the hospital group and then rotate the doctors, which will help Letterkenny because it will form part of a group, and Drogheda, where recruitment is a larger process.</p></speech>

In the intern year, students tend to work in the one location, so during different periods they follow different specialties in that one location.  At other training levels, such as senior house officer or registrar, training is split into basic specialist training and higher specialist training and those doctors have a training agreement with their training body.  There is, however, a huge degree of flexibility as to where they might fulfil that training agreement and they have a level of individual choice and determination with the training body as to where they can rotate to.</p><p>  One of the issues is the extent to which the training body can give a doctor a training agreement at the start of the training programme that states where the doctor will be for the next two years, and in terms of higher specialist training, for the next four, five or six years and where the hospital's doctors will rotate to, along with the rotation dates.  That will be the ideal scenario with a degree of flexibility built in.</p><p>  There is a degree of flexibility at the moment and one of the conversations under way with the training bodies addresses how we give greater certainty to doctors and hospitals about who is coming to them and when.  The health service is delivered by a variety of different employers.  If I am a doctor in training at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin and I move to Cork University Hospital, I am moving from a HSE-funded agency to an agency owned and operated by the HSE itself.  One of the measures we anticipate will deal with that is the transition to hospital groups that have independent governance.  Another issue that will address that is the move to a shared service where instead of multiple payrolls that can lead to problems when changing employment, there will be a single payroll for the health service.</p><p>  The key issue in doctors' working lives is that they know where they are going and how their career and training are oriented.  We are taking that up with the training bodies.</p></speech>

This, however, is a space and place where I do not want to have to address this issue again.  I hope that at least we are on the one page in that respect.</p><p>  Mr. Condon talks about a snapshot in time.  The numbers he instanced were of 60 out of 90 positions in Letterkenny, and he stated that as of today the number is eight.  Is this an ever-decreasing situation and the snapshot tomorrow will not have eight, 18 or some other figure?</p></speech>

As I have consistently pointed out, we are able to offer two-year contracts to graduates from Pakistan whereas, and I do not care what the training bodies are saying, we are still stuck with six-month contracts for people who are on training programmes.  Given that this problem was evident two years ago, I fail to understand the reason no progress of any description has been made in stabilising the position.  Any junior doctor in Ireland can secure a two or three-year contract with two or three different hospitals in the United Kingdom.  This has been practice in the UK for the past 25 years but is not being done to a sufficient extent for Irish graduates in our system.</p><p>  Mr. Condon referred to smaller obstetric units.  There are 12 units operating with a one-in-three rota.  I know of one unit which sought to recruit a fourth consultant but the HSE withdrew the appointment after interviews had been held.  The person to be appointed, who was an Irish graduate, subsequently moved to Canada to work and no explanation was ever given for the failure to appoint a fourth consultant.  I do not accept that the smaller obstetric units have been offered four consultants.  Many of the hospitals in question are being offered doctors who are at the lower end of the scale in terms of ability.  There are people on one-in-three rotas who are working 12 days in a row without a break, not from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but until 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., the reason being that the quality of junior doctors being offered to them has declined significantly.  This issue has not been addressed by the HSE in the past two years.  </p><p>  On the recruitment of doctors from India and Pakistan, I have been informed that 300 such doctors were recruited but I will not argue with Dr. Browne who indicated the figure is 220.  This year, 30 doctors have been recruited from the region.  Did we put our foot in it, as it were, three years ago when we placed doctors who had been recruited from India and Pakistan in rented accommodation and gave them food vouchers for three or four months?  I have met senior consultants from Pakistan and India who have received feedback from junior doctors from their home countries that they walked away from positions in Ireland because of the treatment they received two years ago.  Is this the reason only 30 doctors from India and Pakistan applied for positions in the Irish health service this year compared to 220 two years ago?  These questions must be answered if we are to avoid the mistakes of the past.  </p><p>  The training bodies should not dictate what is to be done if the system is not working and we are not filling posts.  While the problem is especially acute in hospitals outside the major cities, I understand that two vacancies in accident and emergency units in Cork city have not been filled since 1 January.  </p><p>  The OECD has been critical of the number of junior doctors Ireland is recruiting from developing countries.  What is the deadline for reaching agreement with the training bodies on restructuring our approach to employing doctors?  We have the same debate every year and as yet no deadline has been set for establishing a new structure.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said in his concluding remarks that doctors need certainty but I can assure him that they do not have certainty.  As Senator Colm Burke said, they are doing interviews every six months.  I cannot think of any other professionals who are doing interviews every six months and who are wondering whether they will be based in Donegal, Cork or elsewhere.  I do not know what is wrong with our Irish doctors that they cannot be employed in the system.  We are bringing in non-Irish, foreign doctors and I would ask the public if that is what we want into the future.  I do not see the situation improving.</p><p>  Do we want non-Irish junior doctors and non-Irish consultants in this country?  If we do, that is fine but if we do not, Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues need to sort out the problem for our doctors.  I hear Mr. O'Brien sighing but I know of a number of doctors who agree fully with what I am saying.  What is Mr. O'Brien doing to incentivise junior doctors to stay in this country?  They are intelligent, bright people who are working in life-and-death situations for long hours.  They are ambitious and they work hard.  They go to medical school for six or seven years, work in our health system for ten years as non-consultant hospital doctors but then we do not employ them as consultants or we want to pay them peanuts.  Nobody has said that here today but we know that is why so many of them are going abroad.  We need to talk about this realistically.  If we are happy to have non-Irish doctors in our hospitals and non-Irish consultants, that is fine.  That is certainly the direction in which we seem to be going.</p></speech>

Some things have changed.  In the past, the training bodies and the HSE were quite separate.  Since taking up my new role last year, I am a member of the Forum of Irish Medical Postgraduate Training Bodies and I sit on the executive committee of that forum.  The MET, medical education and training, unit of the HSE is working closely with the forum to try to address all of the issues that Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has just described.  Something which underpins all of that is the Fottrell report, which made a recommendation of employing 725 doctors per year, based on the calculation that this is what is required for a modern health service.  The Fottrell report recommends that we educate and graduate 700 doctors per annum and that we then create the capacity in the hospital system and in general practice to allow them to become specialists.  The third step is that the system creates the permanent posts to take those people into the health service in Ireland.  That is the principle on which both the MET unit and the Forum of Irish Medical Postgraduate Training Bodies are working.</p><p>  In terms of clarity about the training journey, that is something that the trainees constantly raise and it is a very reasonable expectation.  In that context, we are trying to incorporate as many posts into training rotations as possible and to have certainty about the duration of the training rotations.  It is important to note that employment contracts are for six months or one year but training agreements, when a doctor is successful in getting onto a training programme, range from two to six years, depending on the specific programme.  The training body is not in a position to give a contract of employment -----</p></speech>

The training bodies select doctors for training and give them training agreements, which are signed by both parties, for between two and six years, depending on the specific programme.  The training programme consists of placements in SHO or registrar posts in hospitals.  That contract of employment rests with the employer - either the HSE or a HSE-funded voluntary hospital, for example.  They are two separate processes and unfortunately it is not possible to give somebody a contract of employment for more than a year because the NCHD contract, which is agreed with the IMO, is for a maximum of one year.  Mr. Condon might confirm that I am correct.</p></speech>

Therefore, the question is why they have to break employment every six months and that will be addressed by the hospital groups.  At the moment we have approximately 45% of our NCHDs working for the HSE, with the remainder working in HSE-funded agencies.  By definition, the health service is currently delivered by that mosaic of HSE and HSE-funded entities.  When we move to the full iteration of hospital groups there will be changes to the employment arrangements.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, we had 513 interns a few years ago, 580 this year and will have 630 this July.  We will have 740 in 2014.  In the space of a few years, the number of intern places has gone up by more than 200.  The HSE has done that without additional funding and without changes in the numbers it can employ.  It has made other changes to accommodate those people.  That gives the Deputy a concrete example of the changes that are happening.</p></speech>

However, it must be put in context to bring some balance to our discussions.  In the last five years, over 10,000 people have been extracted from the overall employment ceiling for the health services and the budget has been reduced by &euro;3.5 billion.  At the same time, we have increased our employment of consultants by 500 and also increased our employment of NCHDs.   In response to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's comments about paying peanuts, the average cost of medical personnel in the Irish public health system is &euro;131,000.  The next nearest cost in the payroll is &euro;64,000 for a nurse.  Below that, every other employee, on average, costs less than &euro;55,000.  Therefore, to suggest that we are not paying an appropriate rate, comparable internationally, is -----</p></speech>

Again, there is the training of doctors and the contractual employment of doctors.  Hospital groups and subsequently, in three or four years, hospital trusts, will become individual employers.  There will not be six-month employment contracts then.  That matter will be resolved.</p></speech>

I have had the parents of junior doctors come to my office to voice serious concerns about the impact of the working conditions on the physical and mental health of their offspring.  The doctors themselves are afraid they will make mistakes because of tiredness.  In one case, a woman in Cork came to me whose son was working as a junior doctor in a hospital, which I will not name.  Such was her concern that she sent him to Dublin to see if he was okay.  He had worked six 12-hour shifts in a row.  We have had the IMO before this committee, as well as Dr. Mark Murphy, who spoke on behalf of the NCHDs, voicing serious concerns in this regard.  These concerns are legitimate because, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, we put our trust in these people but their competence must be compromised if they are working for 12 hours with no rest.  In that context, is our system safe and fit for purpose?</p></speech>

We are working with the training bodies on more clarity about the training journey, making it shorter and trying to encourage them to have a single specialty training duration, which is not divided into basic and higher but to have seamless training in order that people have certainty for even longer.  For example, anaesthesia and surgery both have seamless training programmes.  In anaesthetics, it is a six-year programme.  If people are successful in getting onto that programme, they will get a six-year training agreement and as long as they reach their milestones, pass their examinations, etc., at the end of six years, they will be recommended to the Medical Council for entry onto the specialist register.  People are voting with their feet.  Anaesthesia is an attractive training programme now.  Other training programmes are recognising that one of the benefits of change is that it brings others along.  These two specialties have shortened their programmes by one year as part of that process.</p><p>  Our junior doctors feel isolated and uninformed.  The MET unit will visit all six medical schools to meet the final year medical students for an information session about the intern year and then we will meet all the interns in those locations to talk to them about training opportunities.  In September, the forum will have a national training day to which all trainees are invited and all the training bodies will provide separate opportunities for junior doctors to talk to specialists in the area in which they are interested.  We have asked that all the training bodies have trainees included on all their important committees in order that the trainees can have a say in how the training is delivered.  We have requested that clinical programmes incorporate trainees into their committees in order that the trainees again have an input into how the health service will be delivered in the future.  We have asked the training bodies to do exit interviews with those who leave training.  Up until now, we have just collected the numbers to establish the attrition rate for each training body but we have asked them to interview the trainees in order that they can give us information about why they are leaving.  We can then try to identify where we can make improvements.</p><p>  The final piece of the jigsaw is longer term medical manpower planning.  That function has been added to the remit of the MET unit and we will work with all the stakeholders to come up with a medical manpower plan for the health service that, we hope, will give further clarity to trainees in terms of where the opportunities will be in future.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge there has been a positive contribution by the Indian and Pakistani doctors but we met with a representative group of those doctors, which comprised doctors from sites all over the country working at various levels in different specialties to see how the HSE could better facilitate their general registration with the Medical Council.  None of the issues raised by the Senator were among those put on the table by them to cause them not to undertake the registration process.  This was a representative group from different parts of the country and they did not highlight the issue he raised.  Their significant issue was more to do with how the registration process was set up for them to undertake it.</p></speech>

From the moment I became Minister I have said that we must focus on quality early years interventions and parental support, as all international research and experience shows that the supports provided to children in their early years results in improved outcomes for children and an economic and social return to the State.  For a long time that fact has not been reflected in Government policy.</p><p>  Previously I addressed the Seanad on why we were moving our emphasis towards early intervention, some months ago.  I outlined the benefits that can accrue both in terms of better outcomes for children and in terms of economic return to the State.  I spoke of our legacy of providing direct cash payments, instead of investing in services.  As I told our colleagues in the Seanad, we have lagged behind many other developed countries - when it comes to our early years sector and we must improve quality standards and workforce capacity in all sectors of child care and early years services.</p><p>  What we witnessed on the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme two weeks ago today was distressing, shocking and absolutely unacceptable.  The footage shown will have disturbed every parent in the country and I am particularly conscious of the huge distress caused to the parents of children attending the <i>cr&egrave;ches </i>identified.  The poor practice, the dereliction of duty and care, resulting in the appalling mistreatment of young children is currently and rightly the subject of a thorough and comprehensive investigation by both the HSE and the Garda.  In addition Gordon Jeyes, CEO-designate of the Child and Family Agency, has commissioned a review and analysis of past inspection reports so we can identify the patterns of non-compliance, with particular reference to the for-profit chains.  I consider it to be of critical importance to get a national picture of what has been found through inspections.  That has not been done previously.  I expect an interim report in July and a final report in September.</p><p>  While the practices of individual staff, highlighted in the broadcast, raise serious concerns, the roles and responsibilities of management must also be questioned.  I wish to advise the committee that, at my request, Pobal is engaging with the three child care providers featured in the broadcast with respect to assessing compliance with their contractual obligations.  In the past two weeks I have held a series of high-level meetings to discuss the broader issues and our ongoing work programme.  The meetings included Pobal, the INMO who represent the public health nurses who carry out inspections in child care services, SIPTU who represent some staff in child care settings, Early Childhood Ireland, which is represented here today, the Association of Childhood Professionals and the Department of Education and Skills, as well as holding detailed discussions with Gordon Jeyes, Annie Callanan and Fiona McDonald from the HSE who are also with us today.</p><p>  Our work programme with respect to preschool quality is, of course, part of a broader Government agenda that focuses on children's services.  In line with the programme for Government the Department is pursuing an ambitious and comprehensive reform in the area of child and family services, including establishing, for the first time, a dedicated Child and Family Agency with a dedicated focus on children, legislation for which will be published imminently.  The programme for Government also contains a commitment to improve quality in the free preschool year.</p><p>  I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever early years strategy.  Last year I established an expert advisory group, which includes national experts in early childhood education, child welfare and health and well-being, along with leading representatives of the early years and child care sector.  I expect its report by September.</p></speech>

We have identified eight key areas of action, which need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  Work has been ongoing on these areas, namely, publishing inspection reports online as soon as possible; strengthening the national inspection system; introducing new protocols on regulatory compliance and enforcement; increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance; increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services; introducing a registration system - we have had a notification system up to now; implementing the new national preschool standards; and supporting implementation of the S&iacute;olta framework and Aistear curriculum.  Many speak about S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which were developed in 2006.</p><p>  Publishing inspection reports online as soon as possible is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability.  From 1 July, all new inspection reports, which are quality-assured once issued to the providers, will be published online.  Much work has been done, led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes and his team, to develop a new national inspection system, including standardising operating procedures.  It has not been a national system and I am sure Mr. Jeyes will address that.  There are currently 44 - 37.8 whole-time equivalent - preschool inspectors operating nationally, with an average caseload of 126 services per inspector, although the caseload of the preschool inspectors varies across regions.  There are also some vacancies.  If all services are to be inspected annually, this would mean that each inspector should have a consistent caseload of 100 services or less.  The HSE is reviewing the regional spread of resources, including to determine whether additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required, and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the additional resource implications.</p><p>  On introducing new protocols on regulatory compliance and enforcement, there is a need for greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports record serious non-compliance and what happens as a result.  For that reason I have directed that a new and different approach will be taken to enforcement, prosecution, closure and suspension or termination of State funding.  New protocols between the Department and the HSE and, as appropriate, with Pobal, will mean a more graduated approach, differentiating between very serious, serious and minor breaches and providing for proportionate responses.  With respect to the ECCE scheme, the free preschool year, payments to providers have been suspended on a number of occasions.  There must be a substantial deterrent for non-compliance.  I am reviewing the penalties in place for a breach of the preschool regulations under the Child Care Act so as to increase the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by inspectors without recourse to court prosecution.</p><p>  Increasing the qualifications is an issue I have addressed on a number of occasions.</p></speech>

I shall reference specific changes that have been accelerated as a consequence of recent justifiable concerns.  I shall also offer some observations regarding the overall structure of State involvement in child care and early learning for children aged zero to five years.  I am joined by Ms Annie Callanan, head of quality assurance and Ms Fiona McDonnell, national specialist in early years services.</p><p>  As the Minister has said, the HSE employs 37.8 full-time inspectors which are unevenly spread across the country as a consequence, in part, of the moratorium on recruitment.  Members can read the range of inspection provided by the inspectors in the attached appendix to the report.  There are many types of inspections.  They range from the large institutions, as part of change that we saw in the film, to small locally based ones and to public provision usually through an external force.</p><p>  Inspections are carried out predominantly by public health nurses acting as early years inspectors and in collaboration with environmental health officers.  Where non-compliance is identified during an inspection or as a result of a complaint, specific action points are agreed and a follow-up is pursued.  If appropriate action is not taken by the providers of services or if the infringement is serious, enforcement action is taken in the courts.  The number of enforcement actions is low with an average of four per year.  In some parts of the country it is difficult to get enforcement action in court.  I wish to research the matter further.  An average of 250 providers cease trading each year but the reasons for their closure needs to be explored.</p><p>  The HSE's children and family services commissions early years places as part of its early intervention strategy.  However, the HSE does not provide them directly.  They are generally provided through a third party such as Barnardos or the Daughters of Charity.  There is considerable early years provision in Family Resource Centres that are scheduled to become part of the child and family agency following legislation to be considered by the D&aacute;il later in this session.</p><p>  In preparation for the establishment of the child and family agency, design work carried out has led to consideration of which services should be managed at a national level or the most local practical level.  The management team has proposed and agreed that the early years inspection should be run on a national basis for two reasons, difficulties with resources and to ensure a consistent service is provided.  It is fair to say that the project got a little lost within integrated arrangements and needs clear and consistent leadership.  As an interim measure, I will shortly appoint an acting national manager of the inspection service but that is subject to further trade union discussion.  I want to ensure that we can stand over our current resources and provide consistency, not least in the regularity of inspections.  That means that we can at least, with current resources, move to a minimum of 20 months between inspections instead of an average.  </p><p>  For some time it has been agreed that all inspection reports would be readily available online to allow parents make an informed choice about provision for their children.  Of course, that follows a tightening up and improved quality in inspection reports.  We should make use of the reports.  Clearly, there have been resource difficulties.  As a consequence of recent events and to reassure parents, the initiative will be brought forward.  As the Minister has said, all new reports will be available online by the end of the month and as they become available.  Work will be done to ensure that each centre's most recent report is online in the next few months.  </p><p>  In addition, I have commissioned an analysis of the reports of the past 18 months that will be followed by an annual standards and quality report.  We can all hypothesise about the exact point of weakness but we need to base it on fact.  There were similarities between the three types of provision.  Should we focus on them?  Is it a particular problem for children on full day placement?  We may, within our resources, target the areas most in need of additional regulation and support.</p><p>  I welcome the early years strategy and the introduction of a clear set of relationships.  The initiative will ensure that people are clear about their roles and responsibilities.  We need to ensure the following: that there is strategic leadership; that there is a body to drive improvement in the services; that the components, consisting of Pobal, the school inspectorate and the HSE's inspectors, are provided in a singular, consistent and robust manner; and we must strengthen our efforts to ensure compliance.</p><p>  We, as a society, must consider our approach to commissioning.  The approach must be informed by and based on the needs of children and their parents in order to get the right balance between the private transaction that parents want for good child care and the investment that Irish society wants to provide for children aged zero to six years.  We must also focus on what we can afford.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Teresa Heeney.  We welcome the opportunity to make a presentation to the joint committee on this issue.  Early Childhood Ireland is a national voluntary organisation and NGO, with more than 3,300 members who share its mission of enabling the provision of quality early childhood care and education in Ireland with positive outcomes for children.  Our members operate full day care, playgroup and after-school services and have more than 40 years experience in the sector.  It must be clarified that the majority of these services are small, private settings with an average of five to six child care professionals supporting on average 33 children.  Some 76% of them have level 5 qualifications, which is a one-year post leaving certificate qualification.  The average pay rate is &euro;10.50 per hour.</p><p>  Why are we here?  What we saw on Tuesday, 28 May was totally unacceptable.  The footage of children being manhandled, flipped, strapped into chairs, force-fed and shouted at has sparked a crisis of confidence in the sector and among parents.  Moreover, we saw poorly trained staff who were disinterested in their work and services that appeared to have inadequate management and operated to a timetable designed to meet the needs of the setting and not the children.  We were also confronted by an inspection regime that was inconsistent, not analytical and requiring an overhaul.  </p><p>  Children are citizens too.  As a society, we have a duty to our youngest citizens and a vested interest in getting them off to the best possible start.  As stated by the Minister and Mr. Jeyes, ideally children in every early childhood care setting should be happy.  Children should laugh, make noise, play and be busy.  Ideally, they should have materials, toys and equipment which enable children to become engaged indoors and outdoors.  Adult care providers should take an interest in the children, know them and engage with the warmly, affectionately and responsively.  They should understand their needs and follow their interests and strengths.  These adults understand that children thrive in predictable consistent routines but need to be flexible so that when a child is busy doing something different from the rest of the children that interest is followed on.  Nap time is an individual thing and predictable routines require flexibility.  This can happen.  I have worked in services where this happens.  There are many good services throughout the country.  </p><p>  We have a five-point plan to address issues.  I would like first to highlight some matters that have been already mentioned but require emphasis.  Early childhood matters.  In particular, quality counts.  Poor quality services at best make no difference and at worst can lead to negative outcomes for children.  We know that training and mentoring are key.  The evidence from Northern Ireland is compelling.  It has invested not only in a universal year, but also in mandatory training and mentoring.  The recent scores on the international literacy and mathematical ratings, such as PIRLS and TIMSS, show it to be far ahead of the Republic of Ireland.  Whether it is centre-based or childminding, private or community, children need to get the best care and quality we can provide.  We must develop the mechanisms, structures and sanctions to ensure best quality.  It must be remembered that quality is systemic and requires and involves relationships with children, families, staff, management, training organisations and inspectors.  We have a collective responsibility to ensure quality services.  While the "Prime Time" programme was shocking, there was an amazing outpouring of goodwill from parents to service providers throughout the country, many welcoming that their children were being cared for by a particular service and in some instances bringing them gifts and so on.</p><p>  My colleague, Ms Heeney, will now outline our five-point plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.493" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Heeney" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100015#P00300"><p>The first point of the plan is development of the workforce.  We welcome what we have heard already today from the Minister in terms of new initiatives in this regard.  We propose the introduction of a registration system for all staff working in the sector and that every staff member working directly with children as a supervisor or manager has a suitable qualification, be that a level 5, 6 or 7 qualification.  As stated by Ms Gunning, the "Prime Time" programme showed services that clearly were being poorly managed.  Training must be funded because people working in this sector are poorly paid.  Under the terms and conditions of the free preschool year no time is provided for planning, evaluating, training or holding meetings with parents.  We would urge that this be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There are many professionals working in the sector on 38-week contracts.  These people become unemployed during the summer months.  This is no way to grow the sector if we want to retain a professional workforce therein.</p><p>  The second point relates to quality.  We welcome the Minister's comments in regard to a mentoring system for S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  We have been part of the pilot to which the Minister referred and part of the EU presentation which was well received by people from the Nordic countries where it appears everything is glowing.  They were very impressed by what they saw in the Clock Tower a few weeks ago.  We intend to do a further presentation for Members of the Oireachtas on 19 June in the AV Room.  We will be in touch with Members before that.</p><p>  On the issue of quality, there is huge concern among our members in relation to the lack of special needs assistants for preschool children.  Many of our members are currently reporting that they have to refuse access to their services to children with additional needs because they do not have the staff to give the children the time and attention they need.  We recently heard an example of twins, one of whom attends a playschool in Kildare while the other spends most of her time at home and only attends for three hours per week because she does not have access to special needs assistance hours.</p></speech>

Start Strong is a coalition of more than 50 organisations seeking to advance children's early care and education in Ireland.  We work from a children's rights perspective and on the basis of research evidence and national and international experience.</p><p>  The footage in the "Prime Time Investigates" programme showed individual cases but the causes and the risks are systemic.  Taking our early care and education system as a whole, quality is variable and the lack of assurance is unacceptable.  If we are to prevent the sort of distressing scenes seen on the documentary, we need both immediate action as well as an ambitious programme of long-term reform.  I very much welcome the initial steps that have been announced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and by the HSE.  Certainly stronger sanctions for non-compliance are critical and minimum qualifications are essential.  These are positive measures but we will then need a major programme of change in the sector in the years ahead backed by public investment and driven by strong leadership.</p><p>  The forthcoming national early years strategy offers the Government the ideal opportunity to set out its plans for long-term reform.  In April of this year, Start Strong published its submission on the national early years strategy, "Shaping the Future", in which we set out a wide range of detailed recommendations.  Some of those that are of most relevance to the issues raised in the "Prime Time Investigates" programme are highlighted in the briefing note that was circulated in advance of this meeting.  The central recommendation of our submission was that the Government's core objective in the National Early Years Strategy 2012 should be to ensure that no child is in a low-quality setting.  I think the "Prime Time Investigates" programme illustrated clearly how important that objective is.</p><p>  Much of the focus of attention in the programme and in the discussions that have followed has been on the inspection system.  We most definitely need a robust and fully-qualified inspection system.  It has been rightly pointed out the inspection system is only part of the problem, ultimately it is the skills and competences of those working in the sector that will ensure quality.  When I talk about those working in the sector I mean all those working in the sector, not just those working directly with children but those in management and supervisory roles, those who are providing training through county child care committees or through further education colleges as well as advisers, mentors and the inspectors themselves.  </p><p>  In 2011 a major European Commission report was published on competence requirements in early childhood care and education and care, known as the CoRe report.  It was based on both new research and a comprehensive literature review.  It argued that the key to achieving quality is not just competent practitioners but a competent system.  The CoRe report specifically set a benchmark that 60% of those working in early care and education services should be graduates and that there should be qualified staff in every room.  In Ireland the proportion of graduates is currently around 10%.  A quarter of staff remain unqualified, in particular those working with the youngest children, those under three years old.  Neither those who provide the training nor those who carry out inspections are required to be qualified in early childhood care and education.  A competent system requires not just qualifications but good management, team work, non-contact time for staff to engage in planning and reflection on their practice, and wages that are high enough and working conditions that are good enough to keep staff turnover to a minimum.</p><p>  We definitely need minimum qualification requirements for all those working in services as the Minister has announced but we need to move progressively beyond minimums towards a graduate workforce to achieve that 60% European benchmark.  To achieve that we will need a training fund that will require significant public investment.  To show what is possible I want to refer briefly to New Zealand.  New Zealand has recently completed its ten-year national strategy for early childhood education.  The official evaluations, were led by Professor Linda Mitchell.  Start Strong invited Professor Mitchell to Ireland last September and she gave a briefing to the expert advisory group and to members of the Oireachtas.  It showed a dramatic improvement in quality during the course of the ten year strategy.  The evaluation involved detailed observations of the quality of practice in a sample of services.  During the course of the strategic plan, the number of services in the sample evaluated as "poor" dropped to zero; while the number rated "very good" increased tenfold.  How did they achieve this?  It was a wide ranging strategy with many elements but the central objective was to achieve a graduate workforce.  The proportion of graduates doubled from 37% to 69%, let me repeat the proportion in Ireland is approximately 10%.  The key to achieving this was a fourfold increase in public investment in early care and education.  New Zealand now invests more than 1% of GDP per annum in preschool services compared to less than 0.2% of GDP in Ireland.  They also used public funds to positively incentivise services to employ graduates and to pay them wages that matched those of primary school teachers.</p><p>  One aspect of the "Prime Time Investigates" programme that rightly raised concern is the way that public funds flow into child care services with minimal regard to quality.  There is a real concern about the lack of financial sanctions for low levels of quality and that the quality bar for public funding is too low.  I know the Minister has spoken about changing that.  We are also not taking full advantage of the opportunity of the lever that public funding gives Government to create positive incentives for higher quality levels.  We need to look at building on the higher capitation grant for services with a graduate leader in the free preschool year, though it will be essential to link such measures to adherence to agreed salary scales to ensure that higher rates of public investment turn into higher wages for appropriately qualified professionals rather than resulting in higher profits.</p><p>  It should not be forgotten that there is no regulation or inspection of school age child care or of most paid child minders.  The absence of regulation in those areas means that the risks of unsupported work and poor practice are in many ways even greater.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that we are all here today to discuss this matter.  We were all horrified, shocked and sickened after watching the cruelty, emotional abuse and physical heavy-handedness of staff caring for children.  We witnessed the exclusion and isolation of children, seeing children being flung on to a sleeping mat and being shouted at.  It could have been a great deal worse.  We were spared because we did not get to see the facial expressions of the children as their identity was withheld.</p><p>  A question that sprung to mind when watching the programme was why it took RTE and an undercover child care worker to expose these practices.  We have all expressed our shock.  What does it take for the HSE to close facilities?  Unfortunately there seems to be a certain culture in these facilities because in one short week, a new staff member was able to expose the ongoing practices.</p></speech>

Some actions will require a short to medium-term approach to restore confidence and trust.  One such action that can be taken straight away - the Minister alluded to it in her contribution - is to amend the Child Care Act 1991.  It is unbelievable that big businesses, making profits in excess of &euro;1 million, if found to have breached regulations, are fined &euro;1,270.  That is not good enough.  There is a need for amending legislation in this area.  We facilitated the Minister previously when she brought forward technical legislation in this area and, I can assure her, we will facilitate her again.  There is a need for punitive penalties to ensure large business do not get away with breach of practices because we are talking about the safety and well-being of our children.</p><p>  I had thought the Minister might have alluded to the children first legislation.  It has been promised repeatedly in recent years.  The absence of this legislation is leaving some children in vulnerable situations.  That legislation should be in place before the summer recess.  We can facilitate this by sitting on Fridays and late at night to ensure this critical legislation is put in place.  It needs to be in place before parents take their children back to the cr&egrave;ches and child care services in September.  That would help restore a renewed confidence and ensure that the protection and welfare of children is finally put on a statutory basis.  I am aware the Minister is committed to doing that and I hope she replies to my request when she gets an opportunity to do so.<br /><i></i>I seek also the registration of all child care services.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has advised in her contribution that this will be done in September.  It is also welcome that she has committed to the hiring of additional inspectors.  It is unbelievable that there are more inspectors in the animal welfare area than in child welfare.<i></i>Will the focus of the new inspectors<i></i>change from compliance based to ensure the well-being and learning development<i></i>of our children?  Will it be similar to the joint evaluation process debated some weeks ago in the D&aacute;il?<i></i>In her contribution the Minister said she had spoken with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but will she confirm if she was successful in getting additional workers?  It is imperative that additional resources and a national training fund are provided to ensure the implementation of the S&iacute;olte framework and Aistear curriculum.<i></i>Perhaps the Minister will give a timeline for same.  Given that she has made many promises and commitments today, will<i></i>she commit to publishing a quarterly report to ensure all the targets she has set will be met?</p><p>  In regard to the issues exposed by the RTE programme, were any of the issues brought to the attention of the Minister or the HSE prior to being exposed by RTE?  May I put a few direct questions to the HSE officials?  </p></speech>

All I am seeking is an extra minute.  The cr&egrave;che has stated that it conducted an investigation of the events outlined following the resignation of the covert worker.  What oversight had the HSE of this investigation?  The HSE was made aware of the incidents filmed in a letter on 21 March.  What actions did it take to conduct an investigation?  Given that the cr&egrave;che and the HSE were made aware of the allegations, and disciplinary action was taken against the staff member, why did it take two months, an RTE investigation and the threat of broadcast, before the families were informed of the incidents that led to a member of staff being disciplined?  What supports has the HSE put in place for families affected?  Have the families been offered counselling support?  Have the children been medically and psychologically assessed and, if not, why?</p></speech>

What we witnessed on the breach of trust programme was hugely distressing for everyone who watched it.  We can only image how distressing it must have been for the children directly affected and for their parents to see this all over again on their screens, assuming they were already apprised of the detail of it.  I noted last week, it is no surprise to me, in the course of the D&aacute;il recess that in meeting with people who are front line child care providers that it was hugely distressing for that greater number of people who are involved in preschool provision and who are adhering to the highest standards and providing proper care for children.  One has to acknowledge that.  However, I would do the issue no service if I failed to also say that breaches of regulations are widespread.  We have to face up to that because it needs to be on the basis that there are breaches of regulations occurring with a regularity that is beyond acceptance.  That needs to be confronted.  The most important point is to recognise the terrible consequences for children not only in terms of the direct experience but in preparing children for later life.  We have all spoken in the committee in the past about the formative years which have such an impact as young people develop, grow up and become young adults.  The echoes continue throughout lifetime.</p><p>  Many points have been made in the Minister's contribution and that of Mr. Jeyes.  I noted that she mentioned the child and family agency legislation which has been long promised.  I am not taking out a bata m&oacute;r, a big stick.  The legislation has been long promised and some of the expectation has been created.  Given her own commentary and that of Mr. Jeyes earlier, there was an earlier expectation of this legislation.  That is not to pretend ignorance of the scale of what is being undertaken but I am reflecting the growing frustration outside by all across the sector.  There is huge interest in seeing the child and family agency established.  We need to see the legislation.  The Minister said it is imminent.  I hope so.  That would be my certain wish.  Both the Minister and Mr. Jeyes made the point that all new reports and all new inspection reports will be put online but when is this likely to show?  The Minister mentioned 1 July but how long will it take before reports are available online for all preschool facilities?  It takes effect as of 1 July.</p></speech>

I wish to make a declaration of interest.  I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland, which is a Government role.</p><p>  I have had an opportunity in the Seanad to express my concerns about the television programme.  Therefore, I shall immediately address some of the issues that we must work through.  Deputy Troy has asked the HSE direct questions such as when was it informed, did the programme research write to it and what action has been taken.  I support his questions and have similar ones.  Why did two months elapse before families were informed?</p><p>  We have all talked about the inspection reports.  What will the new inspection reports look like?  I have read some of the current inspection reports.  If I was a parent trying to choose a child care place I would find them uninformative.  They are not like HIQA nursing home reports because one can get used to reading them and thus understand them.  I have talked to one child care provider who informed me that an inspector can spend two days on a premises examining the service but only one box will be ticked in the report that merely states that regulation 5 has been fully complied with.  That does not share information or provide qualitative data.  I would like to be assured that the new inspection report will include a qualitative section and will give us an understanding of the setting.  I want to know whether it was a minor fault or is it a far more serious matter which would be of concern to a parent.  </p><p>  Why have no inspections taken place in some areas?  When will we be able to say that every child care setting in Ireland has been inspected within the past six months or year?  What guarantee do we have that will happen?  When will we reach the point and can be assured that every place has been visited?  </p><p>  I seek clarification on the "unannounced" versus the "announced" HSE inspections.  My understanding is that the majority of inspections are unannounced but there is a public perception that they are announced.  I want it clarified that they are unannounced.  </p><p>  I have spoken to several providers about the regulations.  For example, regulation 5 deals with quality, regulation 8 is on ratios, regulation 14 deals with vetting.  Providers have told me that it takes eight weeks for a person to be vetted at present.  That is the reality faced by a provider when he or she needs staff.  There are two issues, ratios and vetting.  Providers are faced with the impossible choice of which regulation to break or breach.  If a staff member hands in his or her notice tomorrow is there a panel of vetted, qualified people available?  Substitute teachers are available in education.  Is there the same provision in the child care sector?</p><p>  I wish to raise an issue about vetting.  I tabled amendments on the vetting of childminders when the national vetting bureau Bill was debated in the Seanad.  My amendments were not taken on board but we must return to the issue.  </p><p>  Last summer the committee gave great consideration to the heads of the Children First Bill.  Several members of the committee and the organisations concerned suggested that emotional abuse should be included in the definitions of abuse.  At the time emotional abuse had not been included in the definitions.  The "Prime Time" programme clearly showed why emotional abuse must be included in the list of definitions.</p><p>  That brings me to my next point.  Where do staff go?  Where are the whistleblowers?  As I watched the programme I thought about the staff who work in such settings.  Where can they lodge a complaint?  The Children First legislation would be one place to turn to if it was enacted.  Where can staff go?</p><p>  I agree with the Minister's comments about professional development and qualifications.  Salaries, subvention and ratios are issues when it comes to having higher qualified staff.  The equation does not work.  We need to talk about the matter.</p><p>  We need to examine provision for children under three years of age.  The State gives a subvention for a preschool year and the Minister has mentioned qualifications.  What about children who are under three years of age?  Most of the children shown in the programme were under three years of age. </p></speech>

RTE changed the context in which we are having this discussion by bringing to it the national focus I have advocated from the moment I was appointed Minister.  A number of the Senators and Deputies present have a close interest in this area but the kind of national focus that now obtains is important.  When I hear members speak about inspection regimes for restaurants and farms, I ask why we do not pay the same attention to the care of children under the age of five.  That is precisely the point I have been making as Minister.</p><p>  We all need to focus on services for children under the age of five and the nature of the inspection regimes, compliance levels and qualifications.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted that I used the word "considered" but I also used the phrase "addressed as a matter of urgency".  I assure members that is the case.  Since setting up the early years group, I have been aware of the need to focus on this sector.  This is why I gave the group terms of reference which included examining services for children under the ages of five, three and one.  Parents, not to mention the country, will need these services in the future.  Not everyone enjoys the support of parents, grandparents or neighbours.  We have to offer that reassurance to parents.  I acknowledge the point made by members that the programme must have been upsetting for parents.  I think a shiver ran up the spine of every parent and, indeed, citizen in this country when they saw the disturbing images contained in this programme.</p><p>  I am dealing with the issue of inspection in the same way that I brought the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into the area of child protection.  It is important that the inspection reports are online.  I will ask Mr. Jeyes to deal with the details and timeframe for that initiative.  By publishing the reports online we can provide parents with transparency and thereby allow them to feel more confident about these services.</p><p>  Deputy Troy asked what it takes to close down a facility.  Even with the low level of sanctions, it has been difficult to pursue prosecutions.  The question arises of what is considered acceptable.  We have to move to a more graduated approach whereby the response is appropriate to the level of difficulties exposed in a child care setting.  We cannot deal with every issue in the same way and our sanctions must be appropriate.  I will amend the child care legislation and am examining how that can be done.  We will bring forward those amendments at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about safety and well-being.  We have learned the hard way in respect of child abuse and protection that a range of factors are required to work together.  It requires a change in culture, training, information and education, and it requires people to act when they see abuse.  There is no simple solution.  We must act in a range of areas.  Certainly the robust inspection regime I have outlined will be important.  The changes to the inspection regime will be informed by the new national standards to be introduced in September.  I met the inspectors last week.  The new standards will ensure inspections are based on a set of criteria that focus on quality and care.</p><p>  The mentoring programme is important.  Clearly, that is a budgetary issue which will have to be discussed.  When approximately &euro;300 million was taken back several years ago after the establishment of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the money was not reinvested in dealing with quality issues.  We are now trying to address these issues after the services were established.  Under the ECCE scheme, Pobal has been working to ensure compliance, but the RTE programme revealed issues with compliance in respect of children aged three and under.  These issues will be addressed through a more robust inspection regime, through management taking its responsibilities seriously and through changed recruitment practices.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the new child and family support agency, the legislation for which is close to completion.  The legislation comprises more than 160 pages over 100 heads.  It is the largest public sector reform this Government has pursued, with more than 4,000 staff involved.  We will bring the legislation before the Government in the next few weeks.  I pay tribute to my officials and Mr. Jeyes and his team for the huge amount of work they have done on the legislation.  People have discussed the need to bring a focus to children's services, and this Government is introducing that reform.</p><p>  I ask Mr. Jeyes to respond to the specific questions on inspections.</p></speech>

It should be particularly embarrassing for the providers of these very expensive services to parents in the areas in question.  While I take the general point about salaries, which is an issue for an under-qualified and under-rewarded cohort of staff, in this instance a service was being transacted between parents and companies which have posted significant profits.  Something about the public good and private transactions was not working.  It was extremely important to shed light on that type of provision and we need to drill down to examine the patterns and correlations.</p><p>  It is all very well for us to sit here and announce we are doing this or that.  We are making our announcements because the revelations in the programme have led to a sense of urgency.  It is not that we were not pursuing these measures but we were doing so at the pace of Ireland 2013, which is sometimes quite slow in these recessionary times.</p></speech>

We have spoken about the programme and how it has changed everything.  It certainly has changed our view of children and childhood in Ireland.  This is a very important point.  When we speak about inspection and how it can be reformed, we must speak about the support system which must be in place.  We have spoken about training, but it is essential that a support system such as mentoring is made available to the sector.</p></speech>

It can still be characterised in this way.  Approximately 4,600 services operate in the country and 70% are private.  Of this 70%, 214 services are operated by chains.  This means the vast bulk are small local operations which very much act like community-based services.  I am sure we all recognise this description of the services.  In our infrastructure design, we need to recognise we are speaking about a number of women, many of whom were only recently forced to engage in training to be able to offer the free preschool year.  This is the nature of the service.  The vast bulk of these women are poorly trained, forced to become unemployed in the summer months and earn on average &euro;10.50 per hour.  We must recognise what we have.  They do not all make large seven figure sums.</p></speech>

Publication of the inspection reports will help and will shed some light, but only a little because of limitations on the types of questions asked and in the composition of the inspection teams.  The composition of inspection teams needs to change.  We need broader teams with broader quality focus.  One of our recommendations is for an audit of quality of practice to be carried out, perhaps of the type done in New Zealand at the beginning of its early years strategy which allowed it to monitor progress during the course of its strategy.</p></speech>

Mr. Jeyes spoke about judicial actions in this regard.  Without the need for recourse to judicial action, is consideration being given to a more instantaneous response to serious regulatory breaches or repeated such breaches rather than dependence on a protracted judicial process which will not get to the point sufficiently quickly?</p><p>  I know very well the make-up of those providing such services, and with five children, I have enjoyed and appreciated that very much.  I take my cap off to them all.  We had only the most wonderful experience.  Not to take away from that, while we all might feel apologetic and not want to offend those who are doing such a good job and the network Mr. Jeyes has described, the reality is that it is not about offending anybody but about what is best for our children.  The fact that they are doing it is because the State has failed to do it heretofore.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on a number of points in the presentation of Early Childhood Ireland.  While this meeting is taking place because of what we saw happening in preschools throughout the country, are people aware that the after-school sector that covers children aged four, five and six is completely unregulated and uninspected, and in some cases those involved do not even require Garda clearance?  Is this another scandal that is waiting to unfold?  We need to be proactive regarding after-school provision.  There is no training available for people involved in the after-school sector.  A FETAC model for after-school provision was developed, but for some reason it has not been included in this round of FETAC training for child care workers.  That is a scandal that needs immediate action rather than waiting for another "Prime Time Investigates" programme.</p><p>  As a public body, I imagine that RTE was duty bound to make a child protection or welfare referral as soon as it got the information.  Based on the timeline Mr. Jeyes provided, it first made contact on 29 March but failed to make a child protection or welfare referral.  Did RTE make one?  If it did not, the committee should ask RTE to provide us with its reasons for not doing so.  It is imperative that we get that information as soon as it is known to a person.  As citizens of this country, we are duty bound to make referrals.  This committee had lengthy meetings on the heads of the Children First Bill, involving, I understand, representatives of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, because we asked representatives of all Departments to attend as they all have responsibility in the protection of our children.  I would like to know the position in that regard.</p><p>  What commitment does the Government really have to the S&iacute;olta and Aistear programmes?  They have been around for a long time and have been piloted but never fully implemented.  The recent service level agreement between Pobal and the service providers now places a requirement on child care providers to become compliant with S&iacute;olta.  I am talking about people who provide the free preschool year, certificates or subvention.  Heretofore they did not need to have S&iacute;olta implemented in the setting, which is not good enough.</p><p>  The county and city child care committees provide infrastructure.  However, I understand there is not always a good reporting relationship between preschool officers and the county or city child care committees.  A preschool officer could unearth something but it is very unclear as to whether he or she is allowed to share that information with a county or city child care committee.  That is nonsense and needs to be addressed here and now.  It is an abhorrence that one arm of the Government can determine that a particular facility is not fit but that information is not being shared with another arm of the Government which is then recommending that facility to parents.  It needs to be stamped out straight away.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100021#V00700"><p>As a parent of children in the child care setting, I found the "Prime Time" programme very disturbing, as did every other parent.  It made us all wonder what is happening in our own service.  In fairness, the majority of services throughout the country are excellent and provide a high standard of care, and parents are very conscious of what is going on.  It is not only upsetting for parents themselves but also for many workers in these facilities who are working for very low pay and providing a very good service in a very difficult situation.</p><p>  Some of the questions I wanted to ask have already been asked.  Deputy Conway stole my thunder to a certain extent.  Mr. Jeyes said there are on average four enforcement actions every year and he spoke about the challenges of getting convictions in those cases.  The Minister pointed out that the ECCE payments have been suspended on a number of occasions.  How frequently have they been suspended?  Is it along the lines of the four a year that Mr. Jeyes mentioned?  Are they based on the HSE inspections that are taking place?  Are the public payments being suspended for serious failings within any part of the service or just in regard to the ECCE part of the service?  It is important that incremental sanctions are applied depending on the level of breaches in particular facilities.</p><p>  The economics relating to the preschool services throughout the country vary dramatically between the types of services provided.</p></speech>

It is very important for us to recognise that preschool education and child care is incredibly important given that children are at such a formative stage in their lives.  It should always be in our minds when we discuss an issue like this.  From my experience as a teacher, one can often come across a view that something to do with infants or first class is not that important, which is very false.  What we are discussing is of significant importance for the development of our society.</p><p>  In respect of the abuse shown in the "Prime Time" programme, have any of the delegation a sense of how widespread that abuse is?  This is one of the major concerns people have.  Could I get some clarification about how often inspectors visit different facilities and the penalties for non-compliance?  How easy is it to close down a facility if it is not operating properly?  It may not be appropriate for the delegation to answer this question, so they should feel free not to answer if that is the case.  What will happen to the child care facilities examined in the "Prime Time" programme?  To return to something mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, would it be better if we had a State-owned, not-for-profit system for both preschool education and child care?</p></speech>

The introduction of a regulatory environment for after-school services is a priority for the Department and must be dealt with.  Previous child care legislation did not include after-school services, so legislation must be introduced to deal with it.  We must amend the legislation to deal with that.  The child care regulations were last amended in 2006 and we must deal with after-school services as part of the review of the regulations.  In the meantime, amendments will be made to the contracts for the provision of services to school-age children under the CCS and CETS programmes to provide for appropriate regulation.  This will be done when the contracts are being drafted.  There is work to be done in terms of legislation and regulation of the after-school sector.  Again, like much in this area, the sector has grown up incrementally without regulation being in place.  That is the reality of how services have developed in Ireland.  It is not good enough and requires a change in legislation.  In the new scheme we are introducing, the regulation will be built into the contracts to deal with the current scheme, which is very important.</p><p>  In respect of S&iacute;olta and Aistear, the preschool year has required services to implement S&iacute;olta since its introduction in 2010.  What we need to do now is to build in the support for this.  I mentioned that the only support that has been given so far has been via the Department, the local child care committees or voluntary child care organisations and under the preschool year.  International practice has indicated that the best way to support the development of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear framework, which is about the curriculum and the work done with the children, is to provide regular mentoring support.  I will be seeking resources to put that layer into preschool services because it is badly needed and is the best way to build up the quality that is needed.  I think Mr. Wolfe said that this has happened in Northern Ireland.  It is the way to go forward but it requires resources, which I will be fighting for, because it is essential that we move towards that.</p><p>  I do not know the details concerning RTE and reporting because that is being dealt with directly by the HSE.  Mr. Jeyes will address that.  Deputy Conway also made a point about co-ordination, which is extremely important.  I have already said that there has been no national approach to this issue.  In much the same way as was the case with child protection and reporting from local child protection teams, we needed far better national data that we have had.  We have been addressing that, which is the reason we are setting up the new Child and Family Support Agency.  Equally, we need better co-ordination.  I accept Deputy Conway's point and discussed this with Pobal last week.  We need more co-ordination between Pobal, the inspection regime within the HSE, the education inspection regime and the child care committees.  The approach has been fragmented and needs to be more co-ordinated.  This is precisely what the CEO designate, Mr. Jeyes, has been doing in terms of moving to a national approach.  This is the challenge we are meeting in every area relating to children's services.  We must move from local and regional to national and bring about better co-ordination between the services that are out there.  That is being worked on and I can only agree with Deputy Conway that this issue needs to be dealt with.  </p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised a point about compliance and how we can look at what is happening, and said that sanctions need to be more varied where there are breaches of regulations.  That is very clear from the events of recent weeks but also from what inspectors have been saying.  It needs to be much more nuanced than it is at present.  It needs to be more graduated, which will happen as we build in the new national standards.  We will begin to see that in the inspection regime.  As I said earlier, I have already replied to Deputy Naughten's question on after-school services.</p><p>  Deputy Troy asked about how widespread abuse is.  Clearly, the cameras saw unacceptable behaviour.  The way to avoid that and to ensure that children are not having that experience is through the combination of factors we have been talking about here today.  It is about reporting.  Under Children First, if people see abuse, it should be reported.  There are very clear guidelines on reporting that kind of abuse.  If people see it, it should certainly be reported.  Other changes are required as well with regard to training, and management needs to pay more attention to recruitment and suitability for the work.  Not everybody is suitable to work in this sector and we need more focus on the suitability of staff.  This is a very basic requirement with regard to CVs, taking up references and making sure that people are suitable for the work, because training and qualifications will do much but if one does not like working with children there is not much point in working with a child care provider.  That came across very clearly.</p></speech>

I endorse the spirit of the question in that enforcement action should be available to whomsoever has an inspection and monitoring role.  Even at the moment, I am not the commissioner.  If I was engaged in similar activity as director in Stirling or Cambridge, I would have been able to take action with court stages later on.  I would have had immediate power, so I would argue for that.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Conway, I expect all public bodies and others to know about Children First.  It does not need to be statutory for us to know what to do.  Until the parents saw the footage and contacted us, we did not receive any child protection notifications.  Generalised complaints were made.  In one instance, the investigator left on 20 March and reported a complaint to the inspectors on 15 April.</p></speech>

As a consequence of previous correspondence, I am sure the public body concerned was aware of the Children First guidelines.  A body which believes children may be at risk does not hold back and think about whether it is an issue of child protection.  That was one of the faults of the church during the previous decade.  Such matters should be reported to the HSE and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will then make a judgment on whether it should be considered a child protection issue.  We did not receive any child protection notification but did receive general complaints about the management and operation of each of the cr&egrave;ches, in each instance some days after the researcher had left their employ.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Naughten's point about consistency, I have acknowledged that there was system failure.  There is much we must put right.  Reforming a system in a time of recession is challenging.  However, I am confident in public health nurses as inspectors.  The skills of the workforce are excellent, and this applies across Ireland.  The problem is that often things are organised in such a way that those skills are not properly utilised.  I am not suggesting they should be the only ones in the workforce with responsibility in this area.  As this sector matures, there will be others with early childhood qualifications who should also be recruited.  Existing public health nurses have good qualifications and do a good job.  Often, the system lets them down despite that they have reported accurately.</p><p>  I understand one of the cr&egrave;ches identified in the RTE programme received a clean bill of health shortly before the programme aired.  Let us be clear, RTE obtained those reports through freedom of information and chose to investigate cr&egrave;che facilities about which we had reservations.  It was not an arbitrary choice.  They chose cr&egrave;ches about which they knew there would be a story.</p><p>  The final question related to how often inspections are carried out.  I will ask Ms McDonnell to comment on that.  A lot of issues have been raised today.  It is now up to the committee to focus on where investment should best be targeted.  The shopping list from members here today is quite lengthy.</p></speech>

Some inspection services have capacity and carry out inspections annually and conduct follow-up and review visits in the same year.  In other areas, predominantly Dublin areas, there is only limited capacity.  This is the result of the moratorium and the large number of retirements over the past two years.  Inspection services in these areas range from 18 to 24 months.</p><p>  On registration and the HSE reform programme in respect of inspection, the rationale for registration is to enhance the regulatory position of the HSE to ensure early years services are subject to inspection prior to opening.  Currently, the HSE inspects retrospectively.  Phase 1 of regulation will include assessment of the regulatory requirements applicable to determine how a service is designed and the suitability of persons working therein.  Phase 2 will provide for the introduction of national standards and examine outcomes for children.  As such, there will be a change in our inspection reports.  The design and lay-out will be different.  Reports will be more explicit and will provide information to parents on the type of service available from providers.  The reports will also detail the care, welfare and development of the child and look at supports for curriculum and programmes of care.  They will clearly demonstrate the HSE's view of a service on inspection.  The existing inspection regime is compliance based and includes many regulations.  In future, we will look specifically at the health, welfare and development of the child and the components around care of children.</p><p>  On Senator van Turnhout's question in regard to protected disclosure for whistleblowers, protected disclosure is a mechanism within the HSE and is underpinned by the Health Acts 2004 and 2007.  It sets out procedures and specific duties for the HSE in regard to acceptance of disclosures.  In the normal course of events, employees who want to report concerns generally do so to their line manager or, if appropriate, to another manager in the workplace.  However, in exceptional circumstances, employees may raise their concerns with anyone in the system, which will then go through the protected disclosure process.  Under legislation enacted in 2009, a dedicated protected disclosure office was set up in the HSE in 2010.  It welcomes and values reporting and ensures impartial investigation of good faith reports made by staff.  I hope that provides some assurance on the matter.</p><p>  On county child care committees and their work with the HSE, there is great co-operation between both organisations.  The HSE has identified areas which require further development in terms of regulation No. 5.  Our colleagues and support workers on the county child care committees would provide this support and training.  There is evidence of this but it is not standardised countrywide.</p></speech>

The contract which we have in place with all of the services sets out quality standards.  The visits concentrate on checks of the attendance register, the number of children participating in the programme, the fee payment policy, ensuring parents are aware of the free preschool year, staff qualifications and so on.  To facilitate parents and children, we allow transfers in and transfers out.  They are the issues being checked.</p></speech>

We are very proud of the curriculum, in the development of which so many of us were involved.  It includes themes of belonging, communication and identity.  The outcomes from the pilot project are very positive and we were only just discussing and assessing this morning ways in which we might extend it.  We have been involved in the S&iacute;olta pilot projects, which have begun to produce a type of Irish model in mentoring that is really good.  When the migration of FETAC courses took place, the awarding bodies insisted that the after-school course which we developed generically for the awarding body was dropped.  It is a strange one.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that many viewers of the "Prime Time" programme were shocked at the high level of parental fees and public subsidy going into services in which staff were paid low wages and quality standards were low.  It came across, rightly, as shocking.  At the same time, it is important to note that much of the provision in Ireland is small-scale and non-profit community provision.  There are models, including those in New Zealand and Norway, where high quality standards have been achieved through a mix of private and community provision.  A national debate on the question is certainly welcome.  The Taoiseach was absolute right to say in the D&aacute;il the other day that we need to see child care not as a business but as a profession.</p></speech>

We all know that parents take very careful decisions on the care of their children.  The vast majority - 70% - of parents make the decision that their child should be looked after by a childminder.  On the other hand, we know that it is very important to be vigilant.  If parents have questions or see something they do not like, they should link in with the child care committee, the inspections system or ECI to ask questions of providers.  Publishing the reports online will certainly help.  The other issues we have spoken about in relation to training are also important.  Parents make careful decisions but their confidence will have been shaken.  I am sure the parents who had their children in the services in the facilities in question felt that they had made the very best decision for their child.  I am sure the confidence of every parent has been shaken by what they have seen and heard.  Perhaps, people had not realised that there were the kinds of issues we have been discussing as to how the sector developed and the catching up that falls to be done at this point.  As Gordon Jeyes said, there is a large shopping list of issues that need addressing.  We are working on them and I hope I have given an indication of the dates of the various changes which are under way.  The early years strategy will give us the overview later in the year.</p></speech>

That must be borne in mind.  Certainly, in preparation for the meeting it was brought home to me by a number of child care providers that they are struggling in the current environment and have lost clients.  A number of them are in serious difficulties.</p><p>  However imperfect, what we are doing is putting in place a two-tier system in relation to child care in Ireland.  One tier involves what will, hopefully, be a well-regulated and well-qualified professional cohort of carers for children.  I take the Minister's commitments on board on the introduction of legislation for after-school services.  I am concerned, however, that a very significant number of parents have children who are being cared for in very informal situations and who are outside the loop completely.  We are carrying a legacy from the past and the choices made by previous Governments as to how child care would be approached.  If our starting position is that anybody working with children should be suitably qualified, we will have to deal with the informal child care sector.  Does the Minister have any proposals as to how that can be achieved?  One of my concerns, looking at what is currently happening with ECCE and the funding being provided in the formal sector, is that services are being funded for 38 weeks of the year with low-paid workers having to sign on the dole during the summer months.  If we are to establish the kind of professional child care situation Mr. Wolfe and Early Childhood Ireland were referring to, there will be very significant cost implications for the majority of small child care providers.</p><p>  Everybody providing child care services should have some level of professional qualification, whatever it may be.  I would like to see an overall package of measures from the Department to deal with the formal and informal child-care sectors.  We are going to have to look again at the concept of tax relief.  Has the Department considered how we can expand regulation of child care to cover every sector in which child care is being provided?</p></speech>

Everybody has mentioned the shocking effect the "Prime Time" programme had.  I could not understand where other people were at the time the filming was going on and why they did not step in.  It does not make sense to me.  If I am in a room where a child is being abused, I do not care whether I am filming or not, I step in.</p><p>  I reared my children preschool in a parish playschool and received a wonderful service.  It was a friendly place where children were brought into an atmosphere which involved parents and where teachers were qualified to be there.  There was something different about it then.  There was a gentle touch with people who were in preschool.  They had a way of dealing with children.  It was not about the paperwork.  One can have all of the certificates one likes, but if one does no have the gentle touch and a good reason to be there, one is not doing one's job.  Child care is a very important profession.  One can have all the degrees in the world, but if one does not have the ability to be able to cope with snotty-nosed kids and puts children standing in a corner, one loses the effect of what child care is all about.  One of the most significant problems is the larger professional organisations that have come into child care and have 130 children in some facilities.  How, in God's name, can one manager in a building be responsible for that many children and what level of care can be provided?</p><p>  There are many good people working in child care.  I know many small, private and community child-care facilities where excellent work is being done.  I was very impressed by what Ms Gunning said about children being part of a place where there were only 30 or 33 in a class.  When one goes outside those numbers, one loses the whole point of putting children into pre-school.  I have every sympathy for parents who have to work, but leaving children in school from 7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. is wrong.  No child should be in any place for 12 hours.  I have a grandchild who will not stay in one room for five minutes.</p><p>  Arising from the Minister's contribution, I have a question.  She said her Department is examining measures to support training in line with the increased qualifications requirement.  Could she expand on that?  It was the most important thing she said this afternoon.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100025#Z00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The "Prime Time" programme is the reason we are here.  Everyone who watched it was absolutely horrified.  It is the worst nightmare of a parent with a child in preschool.  It was also very distressing to child care providers providing a good service.  What struck me about the presentation is that all of the witnesses identified the same problems and the key issues that must be addressed.  These include low salaries, the lack of a full year, training and development, poor management, lack of supervision, and the need for better qualifications, although I agree that qualifications do not necessarily make people suitable.  It is not in everyone's nature to love kids and to do this job, one must love kids.</p><p>  Providers in some of the facilities cater for too many children.  Smaller groups are more homely and more loving.  We also need a register of qualified child care providers, more robust quality inspections and publication of the inspection reports.</p><p>  A  child care provider came into my constituency office who has not been inspected since 2009.  This person phoned to ask if someone could carry out an inspection but was told the inspector only works 18 hours and did not have the time to do so.  It is outrageous.  There are some 37.8 whole-time equivalent inspectors.  If this is to be brought to a head, the number of inspectors will have to be increased.  Does the Department have the funding to do so?</p></speech>

It is useful to have this meeting.  Mr. Jeyes mentioned that RTE specifically targeted three cr&egrave;ches on the basis of inspection reports in which the HSE had previously raised reservations.  Still, RTE did not make any child protection complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Can Mr. Jeyes confirm that he said that?  What were the concerns of the HSE about the three cr&egrave;ches?  When did RTE get copies of the inspection reports highlighting the HSE concerns?  What action has the HSE taken arising from the inspection reports that highlighted concerns?</p><p>  People mentioned the raising of the bar with regard to qualifications of those caring for our children.  Until we genuinely address the fact that we expect professional people with qualifications to mind our children for &euro;10 an hour, we are fooling ourselves.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and officials from the Department.  The Minister launched the new association, the Association of Childhood Professionals, last week and I presume the group will be at our future meetings.  Early Childhood Ireland has also been a professional organisation for many years.</p><p>  I must declare my interest in that I went around Ireland inspecting Montessori schools before there was any inspection regime.  I lectured in Montessori colleges in Ireland.  Accountability must be paramount in respect of those running and managing premises.  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked where the management was in any of those situations.  Qualifications are important but we cannot lose sight of the people and the small facilities that have been working forever with children.  They have excellent services.  The system of accreditation of prior learning, APL, must be introduced to ensure people who have worked with children all their lives and have the empathy and sympathy are recognised and that it is part of training.  People have acquired master's level qualifications in recognition of APL but it has not been considered by the Department of Education and Skills in the context of childhood education.  It is important it is done to ensure people working there are recognised.</p><p>  In Scotland, 10% of the inspection staff come from the education Department and there is integration between it and the health Department.  It should not be on one Department to supply all of the resources in early childhood care and education.  Why do we call it education if the Department of Education and Skills gets off scot free without providing any funding?</p><p>  Some 80% of the child's development takes place between birth and three years of age.  We are losing the plot if we do not put money into the child at that age.  Between three years and six years, the child needs care and education.  A report from Scotland dealing with 2005, 2006 and 2007 shows integration and care and the development of a model.  We must examine it.</p><p>  There are so many issues and I have such short time.  We must expand what we are inspecting.  In 1991, I sat on the expert working group on child care along with Ms Gunning.  Many of the points being made now came up then.  These include physical, emotional, language, learning, family support and needs support.  It is important not to lose sight of what is not regulated.  This includes after-school care and <i>au pairs</i>.  We must have the correct debate.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister on what she has done since her appointment, which has put the issue on the map.  It is excellent that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs exists for the first time.  It recognises that we can put children first, not on paper but in a Department.  I congratulate Mr. Gordon Jeyes on his appointment.  In July 2011, he said that things had changed and were seen to have changed.  Accountability structures in HSE are similar to those in the Catholic Church in regard to child abuse when the HSE should be on the side of the public.  It is hard to find people in the HSE on the side of the public and on the side of children.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes is changing that and I welcome it.</p></speech>

It is an ill wind that blows no good.  We were all children at one stage so it is great to discuss the programme even though it was dire to watch.  The ideas are getting out and hopefully something will come of it.</p><p>  We are talking about two sectors, although they overlap.  Early education is needed by every child and child care is another area.  One of the main reasons we need child care is for when parents are doing something else.  That might seem obvious but the point is that the vast majority of people do this because they need to work or want to work for variety.  We cannot suspend reality when we talk about how we need to pay more to people who work in the child care sector and ignore the fact that the higher the wages, the seesaw of whether parents can go to work works against people.  That must be taken into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100026#AA00200"><p>A number of issues have been raised in this part of the discussion.  Senator Hayden asked questions about child minding.  It is true that most parents in Ireland make their own informal arrangements with childminders.  They do not go to the more formal sector.  There is an international debate about how regulated that should be.  Over the last few decades we have taken the decision, for whatever reasons, that if a childminder is looking after fewer than three children, it is a private arrangement and is not subject to a huge amount of regulation.  Parents have generally seemed happy with that.</p><p>  A changing society and the move to more urban living, where parents perhaps do not know neighbours or do not have access to childminders they know, may well mean that this area will increasingly be the focus of a request for regulation.  However, that has many implications in terms of resources and inspections.  If one asks a childminder who is taking care of one child or two children to notify the authorities, what are they notifying for?  Is it for inspection or a more formal registration?  It raises many questions.  We favoured a more informal approach when the regulations were introduced in 1991.</p><p>  Of course, childminders were always encouraged.  Childminding Ireland, which receives funding of approximately &euro;300,000 from the Department, tried to encourage childminders to link with child care committees and to register.  In fact, the registration has not been successful in terms of numbers.  It has been very low.  However, there are thousands of childminders working with child care committees, going through quality training and getting support for themselves.  That has been happening, but there is scope for more of it.  Of course, the child care committees work with the childminders.  However, whether all childminders in Ireland should be registered is a very big decision and one that would require a degree of discussion.  Other countries have taken that direction and it is certainly a possibility, one that is more likely to become a focus as we discuss the quality issues further and as parents seek more information about the quality of care.  Parents have always wanted that, but they might feel that the State has more of a role with regard to childminding.  Toby Wolfe's organisation Start Strong has made submissions in that regard.</p><p>  However, the agenda we are discussing here today is very wide.  It particularly illustrates the approach that has been taken over the years to this sector.  The focus has really been on direct cash payments as opposed to building an affordable, accessible and high quality child care service, which everybody is demanding now.  One cannot produce it overnight, but one can certainly begin to deal with the issues we have discussed here today - the importance of inspection, regulation and stronger sanctions, as Deputy Byrne mentioned.  That is very important but Deputy Byrne also said there are very good people involved in child care, and it is very important that we make that statement today.</p><p>  Deputy McLellan talked about the multifaceted response that is required.  That has certainly become clear in the discussions over the last few years.  The Department has a register of every child care worker, and their qualifications, in the ECCE scheme.  That could be extended, and a number of members made that point today.  It is something that could be considered, as well as the concept of panels.  In Roscommon there has been an attempt to operate a panel system, where workers would be available when there is an urgent need for them.  That could be extended as well.  There is much work to be done in that area.</p><p>  We need more inspectors and I am in discussions about the funding for that.  It is clear there are some areas where there have been unacceptable levels of non-inspection, so we need more inspectors.  We need to fill those vacancies.  Undoubtedly, some redeployment will be possible but we must also examine the issue of extra funding for the sector.  Clearly, extra funding will be needed for mentoring and developing the programme I discussed earlier.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan spoke about parents' choices.  The point he made is very relevant in respect of giving parents the maximum opportunity to make choices about being at home or being in the workforce.  We all know the economic realities surrounding that.  My approach to this has always been to say that the State should give the most generous maternity leave possible, as well as parental leave and paternity leave, to ensure that parents have as much choice as possible, particularly in the early years.  That has been the approach in other countries and it is one on which we should continually try to build, whereby parents will have choice in those early years as to whether to stay at home with support or to be in the workplace.  Increasingly, however, the reality for many couples is that both will be working and the issue of providing high quality child care will not go away.  We must address it and in addressing it we must ensure that the quality issues we have been discussing and which were so starkly illustrated in the "Prime Time" programme are dealt with.</p><p>  We know the various initiatives that must be taken but they are resource intensive at a time when we are borrowing &euro;1 billion per month.  It is a huge challenge but many initiatives are being taken that will make a difference.</p></speech>

Clearly, our follow-up work with them at that time was insufficient.  It is one of the things that is illustrated in this relationship between the challenge and monitoring of inspection and the responsibility for improvement and support, as well as the complexities of enforcement, as discussed.  I can confirm that we did not receive any other child protection notifications for us to consider until receiving them from parents on the weekend that they were informed, beginning on 17 May.</p></speech>

They did not have full compliance, but it would be unfair to say that a lot of services struggle with these two regulations.  We put a great deal of focus on supports for providers to assist compliance.  With Garda vetting specifically, we have changed our inspection regime and made it more explicit regarding what we look for in management and staffing.  We are looking for Garda vetting and police clearances that previously might not have been requested.</p></speech>

In 2005, Scotland was having the same debate, namely, a debate on what it believed its early-years service was.   Those in the education sector were not exactly putting their hands up to volunteer to participate.  I was at that time Scotland's sole integrated director of services.  What I describe affects the early-years sector because it is not just an education sector, a care sector or a health sector; it is all of these, and one cannot distinguish one from the other.</p><p>  I get irritated when the sector is called the pre-five sector because four-year-olds deserve the right to be four; being four is not a preparation for being five.  It is a matter of standing up for the right to be four.  In some ways, this reflects back on the sector.  We cannot quite work out whether it is about keeping them away so we can work, or whether it is about their socialisation.  The balance between the private transaction that families want and the common good must be borne in mind.  The debate is welcome as it will ensure Irish society as a whole will be clear on what is important to it in regard to early-years education and where it is desirable to pitch investment.  For me, this underpins much of the work I am doing right across the sector.  Irrespective of whether one is dealing with children in special care or children in foster placements, it is about the attitude to children and respect for them.  It is about trying to come to terms with that in an Ireland that has coped with change at an enormous speed.  It is now declining and reflecting back to a particular period when change happened very rapidly, when Dublin expanded and extended families and inner-city links were broken.  These were the great strength of Irish communities.  Family patterns have changed because of the new Irish and various practices, and it is to these that staff and others must adjust.  It is that context that chief executives and others need guidance and advice on resources and top priorities.  It is in this area that this debate is invaluable, but at the end of it we need to have clarity of responsibility and clarity regarding society's priorities.</p></speech>

Whatever we do, we do not want a split between care and education because they go together.  We, as the adults, provide the care and education while the children learn and develop.  Regardless of what we provide, the children develop all the time.  Positively or negatively, they learn all the time.  What we must do is provide the relationships for them to do so.  It is a choice between parental care and centre-based child minding.  From brain research, we know that children only learn.  Small babies learn.  I have heard people question whether we need education for babies.  Babies are the ones who are learning rapidly.  They learn only within an emotional environment that is conducive to that learning.  It has to be a nice, emotional environment in which they are seen as centre stage.  This must be emphasised.</p><p>  Many of us would like to see collective retraining of inspectors in order to augment their expertise in early childhood development.</p></speech>

This may make Mr. Jeyes even more nostalgic.  Our Irish Garda vetting system is such that one could find oneself seeking Garda vetting from five different organisations.  This has led to a very congested system.  In Scotland, there is a passport-type system, and the passport travels with the individual for a defined period.  A key issue with regard to many breaches pertaining to Garda vetting compliance is that there are now very many international staff working in services.  It is virtually impossible to secure Garda vetting for many of them because we do not have agreements with their countries.</p><p>  Let me return to the school-age child care issue.  If we want to have quality school-age child care, we must have appropriate levels of capitation when the Government is funding the CETS programme.  The levels of capitation for the current programme are grossly inadequate.  The Department of Social Protection is funding that measure as a Labour-enhancement measure.  I hope this discussion will lead to the leveraging of more funds from the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-11a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Wolfe" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013061100027#BB00500"><p>There are just two questions on which I would like to pick up.  The first concerns the possibility of tax relief.  Whatever funding is put in place, be it through the free preschool year, CETS scheme or tax credits, it is critical that quality be linked to any funding measure, as was clearly evident in the "Prime Time" programme.  Irrespective of the merits of tax credits, a mechanism has to be in place to ensure that only quality services will give rise to tax credit entitlements.</p><p>  On the question of supports for parents, I agree that many parents are struggling financially and with the difficulty of achieving a work-life balance.  Sometimes parents struggle in their parenting role also.  If we are to develop a comprehensive national strategy for children's early years, it must address the circumstances of children in all settings, including centre-based services, childminding facilities or informal care.  It must set out ways in which we can support parents at home.  Specifically, the extension of paid parental leave beyond the six months of maternity leave to the period that UNICEF recommends, which is at least one year, should be included so children under one will not need to be cared for outside the home.  Second, work-life balance measures should be catered for.  A right to request flexible work is a critical measure that would not incur a cost but which would empower parents to ask for flexible working arrangements.  It is critical to ensure there is a national plan for the delivery of parenting supports.  It would support parents in their parenting role.</p></speech>

Could someone suggest practically how this could be afforded?  Why are there no men working in this sector?</p></speech>

It is not possible at present for an individual to apply for a Garda vetting.  If I were a childminder minding only two children, it should be possible for me to obtain Garda vetting in my own right.  Allowing for this throughout the entire child care service would be useful.</p></speech>

We will discuss that on Thursday morning.  In principle, we agree with the proposal.</p><p>  I thank everybody for attending.  I apologise for keeping everybody here until 8 p.m. but this was a very important discussion.  It is important that committee members reassure parents and guardians that we have a very good child care system, a Minister who is very much concerned about bringing about change and officials who are responsible and accountable.  There is a need for change, and this will happen.  I compliment RTE on its programme.  The expos&eacute; was required.  The committee will revisit this matter on Thursday morning.</p></speech>
