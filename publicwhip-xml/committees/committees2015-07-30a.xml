In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearings of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today, the focus of the inquiry is on Anglo Irish Bank and IBRC.  At this morning's session ... or this afternoon's session we will hear from Mr. Fintan Drury.  Mr. Drury is a former non-executive director of Anglo Irish Bank.  He was a member of the bank's risk and compliance committee, which he chaired for one year.  He was also on the committee established on recruit the new CEO in 2004.  Mr. Drury, welcome before the committee this afternoon.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.

Thank you, members of the committee.  In July 2009 I was on the panel on the Marian Finucane Sunday morning show reviewing the papers and the events of the week.  During a commercial break, Rachel English, who was sitting in for Marian, said that a couple of callers had phoned to ask that she would question me about my role on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  I dealt with this as best I could at the time by saying that, as a former director, I would fulfil my obligations to the letter and co-operate with any legal matters that might arise.  I also said that morning that I believed I had a duty as a citizen of this State to participate fully in any and all inquiries established either by Government or by the Oireachtas.  I was obliged, as a citizen, to give whatever insights I might have into the events around the banking collapse.  Since then, I, like other former directors of Anglo, have attended interviews with the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement and the GBFI investigating certain matters and I accounted in full for what I knew.  I have been interviewed by Dr. Nyberg as part of his report, all of which was conducted in private.  I am grateful, therefore, to have the opportunity to appear before this committee and, in full public view, deal with those issues that I can deal with.  Where I cannot, I will say so.  In my written statement of a month ago to this inquiry, I prefaced the response to the points raised by the committee by making some general observations.</p> <p>  The first is that the part of the definition of "non-executive directorship" is to be non-executive and that in accepting such a role in any business, there is what I have chosen to describe as "an unstated contract of trust" between you, the non-executive, and the executives or senior management in that business.  The non-executive holds a part-time role on the board and he or she is dependent on the integrity and the openness of the senior full-time management who have access to all the information about the organisation's business.  In 2009 Donal O'Connor, the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, addressed the board's failings and made a fulsome apology to all those who had been affected by its underperformance, from shareholders to staff.  And as a result of the ... a result of what had happened - the ultimate fallout - an apology to the taxpayers.  I was party to that apology, as a former director, albeit I had retired in June 2008.  I want to recapture the essence of that apology this morning ... or this afternoon and restate it for my own part because with more ... the more that has emerged in the intervening period, I would want there to be no obfuscation when it comes to apologising for whatever part I may have played in the difficulties that arose.  Quantifying that is for others, including this committee, to do.</p> <p>  This is all by way of context for these proceedings, Chairman.  I will endeavour to deal with all the committee's lines of inquiry.  I will do so as clearly and directly as I can, with my only interest being to add to the weight of knowledge that might assist you in your work to ensure that the lessons are learned and can be applied to future shock scenarios - better to protect the financial system, better to protect the economy and better to protect the people of this country.  I believe there are valuable lessons to be learned from what we have experienced.  That experience cannot be of value though, if those involved are not prepared to come forward and give an honest account of what they know and to do so without concern for protecting any individual's interests, including their own.  Over a six-week period in the summer of 2002, I joined the board of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power plc.  I served for six years on the bank's board and eight on the board of Paddy Power, six of those years as chairman.  At the time I fulfilled those roles, I had an equally high regard for the senior management of both companies.  Interestingly, so too did the markets and, in the case of the bank, international rating agencies.  I did my job with each company, with the same commitment, interest and the same integrity.  In taking on the roles, I did so in the belief that I was working with management teams that would share all the information required with me, as a non-executive director, to allow me to fulfil my responsibility to the shareholders.  Was that in any contract of employment?  No.  Did it need to be? No.  This is business at a level where not everything should need to be documented, where management ... senior management knows that it has an obligation to keep its non-executive directors appraised of anything that is material to the well-being of the business.</p> <p>  There's been a good deal of comment on the lending approach of Anglo Irish Bank.  Much of it is comment that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a focus on one main sector, such as property.</p><p>Broader-based banks also got the emphasis wrong and continue to get the emphasis wrong.  Considerable focus is placed on risk and the management of the risk function within the bank and its oversight by the board and, specifically, by the risk and compliance committee.</p><p> As you said in your opening remarks, Chairman, I was a member of this committee for the duration of my time on the board, and its chairman for my last year as a non-executive.  It's understandable, correct, that attention has been focused on this aspect of the bank's governance and it's reasonable to expect that the committee of inquiry would want to question me about it.  Let me set some initial thoughts before you do.  I believed that the risk and compliance function was well-resourced and that the senior executives responsible within the bank were competent, committed and focused exclusively on protecting the bank's interests against any lending that could damage it.  I also believed that the overall structures, built around the executive function, were robust, comprising a risk statement which was reviewed and updated every year and, as part of that review, a comprehensive listing of all anticipated risks detailed and considered by the committee and the board.  That was, in effect, our bible for the coming year and a programme to mitigate those risks was reported on at each risk meeting.  Risk management as a function within the bank lived this on a 24-7 basis.  It was monitored by internal audit and external audit and quarterly reports were submitted to the regulatory authorities.  The risk and compliance committee reviewed the work of the asset and liability committee, which was a management committee, and we reported directly to the board.  Separately, we brought in external consultants to review the risk committee's work and the risk function on a regular basis.  In 2003, Bernard Somers and Associates was brought in to review the whole risk function within the function, post the Rusnak affair.  In 2006, that exercise was repeated when PwC were brought in to review the performance of risk within the bank and the minutes will show that I had recommended, as I finished with the bank and the committee, that a further external report should be carried out in late 2008 to see how the committee could be strengthened further.</p><p> There are issues that have been raised by other contributors to the inquiry to date around the bank's credit policy, its loan growth and the concentration on development lending, which I am sure you'll want to explore presently.  Before doing so, the Anglo collapse needs to be seen in context.  Yes, the bank overextended itself and, despite efforts from 2006 onwards to curb lending in Ireland, it took on too much in the Irish marketplace - even with the application of the foot to the brake - in new development lending that the board had approved at that time.  Great efforts had been made over the previous decade to develop its franchise in the UK and North America with considerable success, the latter being down, in no small measure, to the work of David Drumm, a serious consideration when it came to his appointment as chief executive.  Nonetheless, the bank's exposure to development lending was at 23% by the end of 2008, with 50% of total lending in Ireland.  On the other hand, the board had supported the recommendation of the director of banking to stop new lending except to its top, most established clients and Anglo's share of major land deals in Ireland was less than half that of AIB and 10%  lower than Bank of Scotland between 2005 and 2007.</p><p> My friendship with Brian Cowen has been much commented upon in the context of Anglo's demise.  Let me deal with what I know.  In doing so, I realise there's a significant number of people whose minds are made up on the issue and nothing anyone can say will undermine their belief in a conspiracy theory.  Interaction No. 1 was a few days after St. Patrick's Day 2008.  I received a phone call from Sean FitzPatrick, the chairman of the bank, asking me if he thought that Brian Cowen would take a call from him.  I asked him why and he said it was about the ongoing liquidity issue, so I said that I knew Brian Cowen was overseas, but I would try and reach him.  I made contact with Mr. Cowen within an hour or an hour and a half, explained the situation to him, and he said he would need to talk in the first instance with the Governor of the Central Bank, but that he would then revert to me.  Within an hour or so later, he had called me back and he told me that the Governor was going to deal with the matter.</p><p> Interaction 2 - Heritage House, Stephen's Green, April 2008.  The first point to make here is that this was not a special, set-piece event built around Brian Cowen or his position as Minister for Finance.  Such events happened, on average, twice a year and had been in place since before I had joined the board in 2002.  Over those years, the board had held lunches primarily, though sometimes dinners, with people in public life - senior public servants, politicians and others - with the emphasis very firmly on it being a social occasion where there would be an exchange of views and experiences.  In my time on the board, I had attended, I would say, eight or ten and ... of those functions and among the attendees over those years had been politicians of different persuasion to what Brian Cowen's is.  Brian Cowen just happened to be next on the list.  I had undertaken to ask him to  do the event and, indeed, the records in the Department should show that he had at least ... on at least two previous occasions been diaried to meet with us, but other priorities had got in his way.</p><p> The event was completely unremarkable.  I recollect a general introduction by Sean FitzPatrick, as chairman, and then a broad discussion about all things other than banking, with the Minister going around the table asking each board member to set out their thoughts on their area of expertise or their view of the Irish economy or, in the case of those who had global experience, like No&euml;l Harwerth, who was a former COO of Citigroup, the global economy; the same with Gary McGann, obviously through his role as CEO of Smurfit Kappa.  </p><p> Interaction 3 - the Druids Glen golf outing.  I understand that some people find it hard to believe that we didn't discuss the bank during the course of that afternoon and evening.  I'm a sometime sceptic myself, so I understand the extent to which some people have difficulty in accepting this point.  Let me, though, ask a few questions.  Had we discussed the bank, what would we have discussed?  The general liquidity issues in the sector at that time or how the Quinn CFD position had unsettled the market and added to the pressure on the stock?  Perhaps we could have discussed those issues, but to what end?  The then Taoiseach is a friend of mine.  I saw him regularly, often in his offices, so why, if I, as a former director of Anglo at that time, wanted to lobby him or to bring undue and inappropriate influence to bear on him, would I choose such a convoluted and public route to do so, when I could have arranged to meet him in his office, closed the door, sat down and had the conversation well away from prying eyes?  For me, the idea that the meeting, the golf and the dinner in Druids Glen was part of some conspiracy to capture the support of Brian Cowen for some kind of imagined need that Anglo had in July 2008 is more lacking in credibility.  We met for about two hours, we went through an agenda that Alan Gray had prepared for the meeting and which did not have banking on it at all.  Sean FitzPatrick, Brian Cowen and I then went and played ... I don't even remember was it nine or six holes of golf and then we went to the bar and had some drinks, where we were joined by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who happened to be in the Druids Glen hotel attending a wedding, and he asked Mr. Cowen to join the bridal party for photographs, which the Taoiseach - the then Taoiseach - was happy to do.  Later, Gary McGann and Alan Gray returned to join us for dinner.  Alan had retained the agenda, but in classic Brian Cowen fashion, he remembered that his driver was outside and he said he would like him to join us for dinner, which, of course, he did.</p><p>We reviewed some of the matters we had discussed that morning and we closed business early.  There are other material reasons why people should not believe the conspiracy narrative.  Brian Cowen may represent something that some people do not like and do not admire.  That is absolutely their prerogative, as all of us evaluate in our own minds, in our own hearts, people who are in public life.  What should be acknowledged, however, as I know politicians who are not part of his party readily do, is that in public office, Brian Cowen would never make a decision that was not centred on what he considered to be best for his country.</p><p> Equally, this is about me and my standards.  I would not act in a manner that is unethical.  And were I to have attempted to pressurise Brian Cowen in the interest of a private business, at the expense of the State who's duty it was his to serve, I would have been behaving inappropriately, and for those who know me well, in a way that would be completely and utterly out of character.  In my time as a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power, and other private businesses of which I was a director, I never discussed the business of those organisations in any material way with Brian Cowen.  Confidentiality is integral to who I am and how I conduct my affairs.</p><p> Much of the comment on Anglo is commentary that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a narrow focus, rather than the larger institutions that offer a wide array of products and services.  Much of the comment is also based on a view of the bank of its lending and of its growth, which has its source in the knowledge we now have of the cataclysmic global economic events of the mid-2000s.  I know, Chairman, that you've all probably had your fill of witnesses coming into these sessions and talking of 20/20 vision or "If I knew then what I know now."  But while in normal circumstances, this may be a pretty poor line of defence, it is the case that the storm that broke in Ireland was a global financial tsunami that had its origins elsewhere and just took its time to crash over our small island and wreak the damage that it did.  There is no doubt that the damage was accentuated by the fact that our own defences were very weak.  We had gorged in the boom years and the banks had continued to feed our insatiable appetites.  I know.  I know because I was involved in both putting the menu on the table as a non-executive director of Anglo Irish Bank, and I know because I was one of the hundreds of thousands who sat there and ate more than I needed.  This is not excuse time, Chairman, it is simply to acknowledge the fact that when the massive shock waves stirred by global financial events washed over us, we were already in a vulnerable position.  We know now that Anglo Irish Bank most certainly was.</p><p> This statement is not an apologia.  It is an honest attempt to summarise what I would consider to be the main insights of the time that could help the committee in meeting its objective to assess what went wrong, where and why in order that it can apportion responsibility where it believes it should rest, and provide guidelines or learning's from its review of the whole episode.  I accept that to have been on the board of Anglo Irish Bank over the period leading up to the financial crisis, disallows absolutely any notion that one could claim to be in any way blameless.  But, as I have said before, it is for the committee to determine where the lines of responsibility lie and to weight them according to people's roles across the banking sector and the other stakeholders involved.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Fintan Drury was a former director of Anglo Irish Bank, not at that time, and Alan Gray was a director of the Central Bank.  So ... and they were ... they were selected for that discussion on the basis that prior to going on holidays, I had had a discussion with Brian Cowen about the value of having a number of smart people around a table to discuss with him some of the more substantive economic issues that ... and not just economic issues, but primarily economic issues that were facing the country at the time and which he, as Taoiseach, might need to get some outside perspectives on.</p></speech>

This was a ... this was a kind of one-off discussion to explore areas that outside people might be able to give him guidance on.  And the reason the people who were at that event were chosen was because it was a combination of people I knew and people that ... who Brian knew.  Brian had great belief in Alan Gray, as many people in politics and in the Civil Service do.  So he wanted him there.  I knew Alan, but not well.  He wanted Gary McGann there because, as I refer to in my opening statement, he had a view that Gary was very smart, very committed to public service.  He was a ... I think at the time, a former chairman, if not still chairman, of the Dublin Airport Authority, and had committed himself to a number of roles in public service, but he was also chief executive of one of Ireland's largest companies, which had a global reach and Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick was my suggestion and the suggestion was made at a time when Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick was deified.  It's an exaggeration but his reputation was, both globally and in Ireland, extremely high and he was seen as somebody who was extremely bright, extremely talented, and would have, therefore, value to add.  And it was done on that basis.</p></speech>

And to ... because I think it's an important question in terms of not just his integrity but I'm here to speak for myself, my own integrity.  To presume, and I'm not saying that your question does make that presumption, but to presume for a moment that Brian Cowen would have been influenced to such an extent by me or by anybody else in respect of one bank and one bank's interests, that he would take a decision, or allow himself to be influenced in making a decision, in a manner that was not in the interests of the people of Ireland and the State is ...

Very, very irregularly.  Partly, and I regret that, but partly because the truth is that we live in a very small country.  We live in an environment where if I met Brian Cowen for a pint or we went to a match together, there is a percentage of people who would think we're up to no good.

I engaged fully with Dr. Nyberg.  I found his approach very insightful, very fair and very comprehensive.  And I'm not ... you know, I think one of the things I ... there's probably only one significant finding in Nyberg that I would really take issue with and ... and I think, as I said ... also said in my opening statement, Deputy, the truth is that whatever belief I had at the time that I was a director at Anglo Irish Bank, some of those beliefs have been if not shattered, they have been rendered inappropriate.</p></speech>

By July 2008, just when you came off the board, the exposure was at just over 600% of its own funds.  Were you ever concerned about this breach of the limit, over 200%, was it something that was raised with you, was it something that was discussed at the board?</p></speech>

I had ... I, I unquestionably had faith in the risk management function and the risk management team.  I think there were errors made ... and rather than appear to be apportioning blame elsewhere, I think as chairman of the risk committee for that last year, and as a member of the risk committee for the previous five years, that ... I have to accept some of that responsibility.  And what I mean by that is, for example, I think that the decision we made to have a ... merge the roles of chief risk officer with that of the finance director was a mistake.  And that's not a reflection, important to state, of the, on the individual in question, you know, quite the opposite.  But it's in the principle, when you look back, and I'm going to try avoid saying that ... too much, but the principle, at the time the principle should have been wrong.  We should have, as a board, we should have recognised that that principle was, was not good, because the bank was at a scale where those two functions needed to be completely delineated.</p></speech>

Weaknesses in these areas were identified by auditors and regulators in 2003, 2006 and 2008.</blockquote>It goes on to say, &quot;Management showed a lack of awareness of risk and focused their attention on business growth.&quot;  Mr. Drury, how do you reconcile these comments with the positive statements on governance structure of the bank contained in the corporate governance statement each year, in the bank's annuals, annual report?</p></speech>

If you ... but, but, that's the view of the PAC reviewing what it saw as being the performance and the stewardship within Anglo at a moment in time or over a period of time, rather.  And you are juxtapositioning that against the corporate governance statements in, in the annual reports, and I'm saying to you ... what I'm saying to you is that, if you simply take one, one commentary and put it against the other and present them as you have done, they are irreconcilable .</p></speech>

So, let me be, or attempt to be, cautious and yet at the same time address the question and deal with it as substantively as I can.  I think I made a reference to, in my opening statement, I made reference to ... I, I talked about the, the kind of contract of trust.  And I think it is something which, you know, at the risk of labouring it, people just need to understand and accept that if you are taking on a position as a non-executive director, you have no choice but to vest a degree of trust, and I'm not talking about legal issues, I'm talking about ethics, I'm talking about moral responsibility.  There is a two-way moral responsibility.  I cannot function as a non-executive director of any organisation unless I can presume on the executives providing me with the information I need in order to be able to evaluate what is happening in that organisation.  Okay?  I think, I hope that people would accept that.  Because  otherwise, you're second-guessing everything, and you become an executive, and you're in the, you're in the institution or organisation every day of the week.  So my, my answer to you is that without being specific or without being ... addressing very particular areas which might by implication identify individuals unfairly, there was a deficit and it's manifest in some of the documentation I've received from the committee.</p></speech>

The graphs speak for themselves in terms of the rapid rise of Anglo in those three areas.  Do you think that these levels of growth were prudent or sustainable, in the context of the level of competition in the Irish banking market during this period?  And in your opinion, did these levels of growth imply that the pursuit of growth was affecting credit quality and lending standards?</p></speech>

The view of Anglo Irish Bank, at that time, would have been still uniformly positive.  The share price was coming under pressure for reasons we've discussed or have been discussed here already.  I think that the, the growth story that Anglo was at that time, or had become, was one that was largely admired, was largely admired by all external audiences or most ... the vast majority of external audiences.</p><p>And so, at that particular time, I don't think that there was anybody that I can recall who was identifying and establishing in any definitive way or ... a problem with the growth story of Anglo Irish Bank.  Now, that does not mean that the board of the bank at the time, including non-executive directors, wouldn't have had a responsibility to take a wider view and to look at the figures in the stark manner in which you have presented them Deputy, and you're right, in which they look now when we look at them.  We didn't, and that is again clear from the documentation you will have read, and all of you will have read and seen in preparing for these meetings - that, you know, the view that was taken of the growth of the bank was that it could continue to grow.  The problems that manifest themselves, both the global one, which I have stressed in my opening statement, but which I do not want to over-stress because I think it in ... if I was to do so, it would, kind of, try and negate what happened here - and I mean in Ireland and I mean not just in Ireland, within Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

And I mentioned, for example, the earnings per share increasing by 363% over that five-year period.  Now, 90% of employees of Anglo Irish Bank were shareholders with the bank.  Were individuals blinded by the rapid growth and the rapid growth in share prices and took additional risks as a result of that?  Was it affecting credit quality?  Was it affecting lending standards?</p></speech>

So, for example, whether it was Paddy Power, Anglo Irish Bank or any other business that I was involved in, the growth - even a private business with shares that weren't traded on the Stock Exchange - the growth in the share value, for me, was not what the business and the people involved in the business should be focused on, or would be focused on.  So, as a board in Anglo Irish Bank, I don't remember - and I'm sure there would have been discussions about share price from time to time - but I don't ever remember that being a focal point for the board in terms of determining whether or not the business was being ... was successful, and that the only means of judging the success of the business was where stood the share price.</p></speech>

I'd like to refer to core booklet, Vol. 1, again, and it's page 97.  These are the minutes of the risk and compliance meeting that was held on 24 May 2007.  The issue being discussed is the suggested revision of Anglo's minimum capital ratio requirements.  It says in the document:<blockquote><br /><br />The committee reviewed and considered the proposal and in particular the key reasons for the Group's suggested reduction in Minimum Regulatory Capital, namely<br /><br />- The Group has constantly held a surplus over the minimum regulatory capital requirements, thereby creating a significant buffer in the event of an unanticipated and sudden losses in the Group.<br /><br />- The high propensity of the Group to generate significant and new internal capital equity each year due to the- maintenance of strong average gross lending margins<br /><br />- low cost-income ratios<br /><br />- loan loss provision track recordFollowing consideration, the proposal in the paper was approved on the basis of very compelling arguments outlined therein.</blockquote>Now this is to reduce the amount of capital that would be held by Anglo bank just over a year before Anglo bank lost its capital.  Why did you take a decision to place the capital at risk?</p></speech>

I'm sure I knew at the time but I don't know why that decision was taken at that time.  What I would say is that the decisions, and I think that the documentation in terms of the risk committee demonstrates the point that I made in my opening statement - and I'm not avoiding your question; I will come back to it - demonstrates the extent to which the risk and compliance committee was interrogating and pushing for the risk function within the bank, or the risk management team within the bank, to establish cause, establish reason why any changes in policy would be taken.  So, if group management was making up ... advocating a change of policy, then that would have been interrogated very, very carefully at the time and the decision would have been taken on the basis of such an approach.</p></speech>

You know, it would be wrong for me to turn around and say, "I regret that decision."  Because it might be the right thing to say from a public relations point of view but, you know, I have to genuinely regret it.  I can't say to you with any honesty, Deputy, that a decision that was made, I'm sure and certain, on the basis of full facts at that time, and would have ... and the presentation or view that was brought to the committee would have been interrogated ... and that that decision was taken, do I regret it, no.</p></speech>

And the reason why the Irish tax----- The reasons why the Irish taxpayer has endured such losses are multi-faceted, as I think we would all accept.  They are not all down to Anglo Irish Bank; they cannot all be laid at the door of decisions that were taken at a moment in time by directors be they non-executive or executive directors or senior management in Anglo Irish Bank.  Was that material to the losses that the taxpayer has endured?  Of course.  I'd be a fool to sit here and try and suggest otherwise.</p></speech>

So in all my time, both as a consultant, Deputy, in the '90s and then later as a non-executive director of the bank, and with the greatest respect to everybody in this room, I never came across, or I rarely came across an institution that I worked with, or had an engagement with in Ireland, that was less interested in politics and less interested in lobbying, or less interested in engaging with the body politic.</p></speech>

I'm saying to you definitively there was not, and therefore I don't know, because I never ...

And I would like to raise one other point here, even though I've made it before, because I think this is important.  I work in part of my life in professional football.  And it is often referred to as how corrupt the sport is and the extent to which agents, who represent footballers, are corrupt.  And yet the very notion that a corrupt deal can be done by one party, one person sitting on one side of the table ... so let's imagine for a moment, Deputy, that I was prepared to go in and sit down with Brian Cowen and beat him up metaphorically to get him to act in a particular way in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, Paddy Power, Mainstream Renewable Power, I don't believe there are many people sitting in this room who believe that Brian Cowen ... that that conversation would have been a lengthy conversation.</p></speech>

Were you aware, because you asked the questions, that there was no problems within the bank at that time in terms of challenging the conspiracy theory that some may have?  So, were you aware that at the end of April, Seanie FitzPatrick had approached John Hurley looking for a guarantee for his bank - as has been suggested in evidence or given in evidence by Kevin Cardiff?  Were you aware that a week later a DD, which Kevin Cardiff described as a person of substantial presence in the financial sector, also made such an approach?

I did not arrange for Sean FitzPatrick ... for Sean FitzPatrick to have a meeting and a game of golf and a dinner afterwards with Brian Cowen, as you have profiled it in your question, and I was very clear as to what I had done.  I had, at Brian Cowen's request and in discussion with Brian Cowen about his need to get a macro-perspective on what was happening in the economy, I had gathered a very small select group of people, rightly or wrongly, who at that time were Alan Gray, who is a respected economist, Gary McGann, who was chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, and Sean FitzPatrick, who was a highly respected chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

So as I said, an inspection of commercial property lending activities in Anglo by the Financial Regulator in May 2007 identified 30 separate issues which it required to be addressed, at which it listed in the report dated 27 June 2007, and that's on the screen there in front of you.  So what you see is a letter from Ms Mary-Elizabeth Donoghue, banking supervision department, at the office of the Financial Regulator.  I'll just take two paragraphs of it there.  The first letter, it's May 2007 and it's a letter to Mr. Drumm and it says, "I refer to the inspection of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc ("Anglo") carried out by the Financial Regulator between 9 and 17 May 2007."  Then moving on to the third paragraph, it says, "The Financial Regulator's inspection process is a high level review and does not constitute a detailed examination or audit."  So, at this stage, it's high level, it's not drilling down into very, very specifics.  And as a result, it then goes on to say, "Consequently, the inspection process may not be relied upon to identify all issues arising in the areas reviewed."  So, it outlines there that there might be other matters as things advance on.</p> <p>  So, if I could just move on to the regulator's letter then which is the next one up and you see there, there's a number of headings.  There's the "Group Credit Policy" is one with nine items under it.  The next one is the "Exceptions to Group Credit Policy" that has three items under it.  "Credit Committee Terms of Reference" has another item under it.  "Group Risk Management Operations Board" has two items under it.  "Risk Management Reports" have two items.  "Personal Guarantees" have an item.  "Group Watch List" have an item.  "Loan Review Process" have an item.  "Breaches of Internal Limits and Targets" have two items but is broken down into more detail with some Roman numerals.  It then goes on to "Stress Testing" has an item.  "Hedging of Risk" has an item.  "Condition Precedent" has an item.  "Review of Loan Files" has three items.  "Interest Only Breakdown of the Loan Book" has an item and "Job Descriptions" has an item.  It's quite extensive.  Were you, as a board member, made aware of this report and was it discussed by the board? </p></speech>

The documents I am referencing, Chairman, are Vol. 1 page 21-25, a report from Barry Herriott, management consultants and also page 17, the Nyberg report and they relate around that the report from Barry Herriott undertaking an external consultancy in 2003 noted that the directors felt that the board pack "failed to ignite debate in important issues" and many directors expressed frustration on need for more debate on strategic issues.  And the Nyberg report, ''there is little evidence that board directors at the time were active in challenging ... bank's approach [and] its pace of lending growth''.  Now, do you agree with these observations?  What's your opinion on them?  Did you challenge management enough as non-executive directors?  How do you describe the corporate culture of the board during your period on the board in terms of the interaction of the chair with the management ... generally, how the board was run?</p></speech>

But the collegiate sense also works in the ... in this regard I believe, that there was a singular focus and the singular focus was on success and the problem with talking in those terms now, is that people assume that that meant success was increased profits, share price going through the roof and that that was the only means by which success would be determined.

So the question I'm asking is: is it credible ... Anglo was in survival mode at that time; share price was falling; two weeks before the unwinding of the contracts for difference had taken place; major liquidity problems.  They were a monoline group.  It wasn't a diverse group.  It was a group of four people, all direct links with Anglo.  So is it credible - you were saying you discussed the economy - first of all, is it credible that ye did not discuss banking and Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

But, as I said in my opening statement, there are a great many people who don't and who never will, no matter what they hear and who they hear it from.  I regard myself as a pretty ordinary person.  I regard myself as somebody who behaves in a particular manner and who has a code of ethics and standards, which you alluded to in your opening before you asked the question.  And so the defence I'm offering of what I ... the account I gave you of what happened in Druids Glen is simply this: you either accept what I told you under affirmation as being a truthful account of what transpired on that occasion, or you don't.  And I can stay here until Tibb's Eve, Deputy, and make the same point over and over and again, and I accept - I may not have said it in my opening statement - I have friends who find it lacking in credibility.

And there is an element of frustration, having waited seven years to make any public comment about what happened, to be constrained by what I can say.  But I respect that and understand that to be the position.  And, at the same time, I don't want to appear to evade or elude my own responsibilities.  So I look at things ... for example, I'll give you simple examples, if I can.  I look at things as serious as that one which I already alluded to, I think, in response to Deputy Murphy, which is the question of the decision to morph, as it were, the role of chief risk officer with finance director.  I think that was a mistake.</p><p>And I think I was smarter than to allow that to have happened or not to have seen that as being a mistake, and that's nothing to do with what happened subsequently.  It's just the principle of that for a bank that had got quite large by that time.  But, from there to smaller things like, you know, I would have argued with Sean FitzPatrick at some stages about the need for an economist within the bank.  And ... but I didn't push hard enough.  I had issues around, around Sean Quinn's CFD holdings, which I did articulate, but I look back and say, "Maybe I should have been stronger".  So, that's being as ... that's ... those are three example, very different examples, where I'm trying to be as candid as I can.</p></speech>

Thank you very much, Mr. Drury, and thank you, Deputy O'Donnell.  I just want to deal with two matters, just on a point of clarification, and I'm just proposing a five minute comfort break at that ... after which.  In questioning there with Deputy O'Donnell, Mr. Drury, the question, kind of, indicated with regard to the corporate culture of the bank during your period of time on the board, and you did elaborate in regard to Mr. Murray.  But maybe you could just move into some of the space during Mr. FitzPatrick's time as well.</p></speech>

I think there tends to be a change when you get two very different personalities.  So, there was no change in terms of, you know, the quality of information, the standard management of board meetings, but there was a different type of dynamic, and I referenced the ... I think I used the term "collegiate" when I referenced Peter Murray and his stewardship of the board.  Sean's was equally so in many ways, but just with a different hue, or a different flavour.</p></speech>

But, in 2002, from annual reports, Anglo had &euro;13.3 billion in loans.  In 2003, that went up by &euro;4 billion.  It went up by &euro;7 billion in 2004; by &euro;10 billion in 2005; by &euro;16 billion in 2006; and by &euro;17 billion in 2007.  So, &euro;54 billion in extra loans between ... in five years.  And Patrick Honohan, now Governor of the Central Bank, in <i>The Economic and Social Review</i>, summer 2009, said:<blockquote><br /><br />A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual real growth rate of 20% is often taken as the trigger.  Each of the locally-controlled banks had at least one year in which this threshold was triggered.  One of them, Anglo Irish [Bank], crossed it eight of nine years and indeed its average annual rate of growth, 1998-2007, was 36%.</blockquote>And we had another witness to the inquiry here, Mr. Bill Black, a former US regulator ... are you familiar with him?  Yes.  Mr. Black said, &quot;The rule of thumb on banking for many decades if you grow more than 25% a year, you will likely fail.&quot;  Were you aware of the risks of this kind of exponential growth in the loans of Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

So, this was ... in 2002, would have been a largely Irish bank and over the period in question that you're talking about, such significant growth in the overall size of the bank and in the overall loan book, the bank had grown significantly in the United Kingdom and it was also going through significant growth in the United States, as I mentioned earlier, under the stewardship of David Drumm and I think that was a factor in the decision to appoint him as chief executive ultimately.  So, I think the ... in some respects, we're not comparing like with like when you look at 2002 and 2007-2008.  I also believe that, in those particular territories, the economies of those markets were going through significant growth and a lot of the growth in the UK was concentrated in a part of the UK which has always had sustained growth.</p> <p>  I think, having said that, Deputy, that if you look at it through the prism of economic analysis that someone like Bill Black would be renowned for, then you see that growth in particularly bleak terms.  I'm not saying that's incorrect, I'm simply saying that, you know, economic views and economic opinion obviously can be ... I'm conscious of who's sitting on your left but can be, kind of, quite polarised.</p></speech>

And the values that NAMA achieved in taking on those loans has to be seen in the context ... well, it's not for me to judge it, but it in time will have to be seen in the context of how those loans have ... those loan portfolios have performed post sale by NAMA to third parties and post the sale of those loan portfolios by third parties.  And that the ... that is the ... that was the basis on which ultimately the value of those loan portfolios will have to be judged in time.</p></speech>

I didn't hear her evidence, but taking what you've said as representing what she ... her point, I think she's right in the sense that historically, and again today, despite what's happened, and I don't mean in Ireland, I mean globally, again today we see evidence all the time that people in financial services institutions get paid phenomenal amounts of money for doing the work they do.  And the basis on which they are entitled to those significant sums, and entitled to very significant bonuses, are out of kilter with how financial ... or with how remuneration is structured in other areas of industry, it seems to me.</p><p>So I think what she has expressed, as a former director of a mutual, is a view that a great number of people feel, and even people who have had exposure as she has and as I've had ... have had exposure to the financial services sector.  But the market sets these ... I'm not saying its right, but the market does set these rates and remuneration is generally tied to performance of the institution,  if not of the individual.</p></speech>

I had a long experience of Hungary going back to the 90s when I established an office for my communications consultancy in Budapest.  I knew the Hungarian people quite well; I had worked very closely with a number of people in a number of businesses in Hungary.  And I believed in the value of what the Hungarian people and the Hungarian state was attempting to do post its accession to the EU.  And I always maintained a strong interest there.<br/><br/>Far from approaching the project, in the way in which you have profiled it, the project was an investment, a proposed investment, of a significant amount of money by a number of people - a small number of people - in a development in an area of ... outside Budapest called  Pilismar&oacute;t, which is not an area where anybody lives, was wasteland, and which the mayor, who was, as it happens, an independent politician of left wing disposition, wanted to see development in order that his community would benefit from the introduction of something that he saw and members of the council saw as being a positive venture.  As with anything like that, and you people in this room will know and understand this better than I, there is always people ... or likely to be people who are not in favour.  The project was not bankrolled by Anglo Irish Bank.  There were no loans from Anglo Irish Bank.  And the emphasis you have placed on a particular media or medium, is one which was challenged at the time, as being incorrect and was, subsequently, not followed through on.  I mean by that the report, just to be clear, was not accurate in a great many respects.  So, the representation or presentation of me, in this case, as being somebody who behaved in a manner which was to disenfranchise people from areas of land which they rightfully, or rightly wanted to manage in a particular way against their wishes, was completely and utterly false - No. 1. <br/><br/>No. 2 - There was never a line of credit established between me and Anglo Irish Bank in that respect, which gives me the opportunity to, if I may, Chairman, just make one point of clarification.  In 2005, my business wanted to make an acquisition and we needed to raise &euro;1 million to make the acquisition.  And it was discussed at the board of my company and we decided to proceed and I said, &quot;I would like Anglo Irish Bank, as I'm a director of the bank, I would like Anglo Irish Bank to have the opportunity to tender for the business, but I cannot go and meet with and deal with and interact with the bank.&quot;  So my chairman, who had no connection with Anglo Irish Bank whatsoever, went to a number of ... two banks, one of which was Anglo, and a deal was done whereby Anglo became the lender to the business and that is ... I'm simply using that to emphasise the point that in my dealings, I attempted at all times to create an appropriate distance between me and other parties in respect of my directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.  The presentation in <i>The Mail</i>was ... let's put it this way, it was inaccurate and misleading.</p></speech>

I have to take responsibility for having been on the board of that bank, that was crafting such a menu.

He had gone back and looked through everything and he had some ... some issues to raise and there was ... there was progress made in respect of that over the ... over the following number of months.  I remember as well that ... that, even though trading was a very small part of Anglo's portfolio of work, we had a problem with a trader on one occasion who had gone past his limits.  And there was a discussion about it and myself and a number of the other non-execs were asked our view and we said "Well, look, you know, he needs to be given a warning," and it wasn't ... now, it wasn't ... he hadn't dramatically overshot his limits but, again, when ... at the next meeting ... or, I beg your pardon, not the next meeting, but within a number of months, it had happened again, and we ... we made a decision at committee that-----</p></speech>

And when I joined in 2002 it so happened that I had been approached by Paddy Power to go on the board of its ... onto its board, excuse me.  And I had, as I referenced in answering Deputy O'Donnell earlier, I had a view that one stays ... does two three-year terms.  I mean, the standard is you're invited and asked and you're assessed as to whether you're up to the business, up to the job or not and you're given a three-year term and if you ... if you're half decent I think you tend to be asked to do a second three-year term.

Can I ask you, then, in relation to questions touched on by previous speakers, loans taken on by NAMA from Anglo?  Estimated that &euro;9 billion worth of interest roll-up loans were taken ... were transferred from five banks, &euro;3 billion relating to Anglo.  Were you aware of the level of interest roll-up included in Anglo's loan book?</p></speech>

However, I do think when we discuss roll-ups, we need to understand that the nature of Anglo's business meant that roll-ups in Anglo's case were going to be higher.  By definition, the nature of its business meant they were going to be higher than they would be for others.</p><p>I also think when we talk about &euro;9 billion, and five institutions, we're actually talking about, realistically we're talking about four, because EBS's percentage of the &euro;9 billion was, I think - I don't know what the percentage was but I think it was 0.1% .  And so the ... therefore, the amount of ... the total amount of the &euro;9 billion, the amount of that that Anglo held, perhaps, wasn't as stark as it might appear for those two reasons.  And I think when you're in development lending, which we ... which the bank was, you know, roll-ups is part and parcel of that business, and you know, business ... banks that are in the business today, that Anglo was in then, are doing roll-ups at that level right now, here and overseas.</p></speech>

And I also think that because ... I mean, Deputy Doherty asked me this earlier on, in terms of the small ... the percentage of the loan book that was in ... was ... related to a relatively small number of clients or customers.  And that was, you know, that can be argued either way, I guess, but that would have been seen as being, and the ... there would have been seen as an element of protection about that; that it was people we knew well; we knew that they would be able to move the land that they had bought from zoned to full planning and to being built and starting to generate very serious income-----</p></speech>

I know that executive directors have a particular responsibility, and non-execs, and you've explained and we are familiar with the limitations on the role of non-executive directors.

And I think that sometimes to get the answer to the question, that now seems obvious, you know, what level of engagement have we had with the Financial Regulator?  Has the Financial Regulator written to you in the last month, two months, three months?  The only was of knowing, of my knowing that such a letter had issued from the Financial Regulator to senior people in Anglo, would have been for me to say at the end of a meeting, "By the way, has the Financial Regulator made contact with you or with any of your colleagues since our last meeting?"  And if I was chairing a risk committee today, would I ask such a question intermittently?  Absolutely.</p></speech>

But I go back to the central point here,  which is that when you are a non-executive director, you engage in a relationship with the executive team in any organisation and, particularly, I believe, in a bank, on the basis of ... that the people who are in there day in, day out, working hard and doing their job, are going to provide you with any information which is relative to and sensitive to the role that you have as, if you like, some form of guardian of the interest of the shareholders and protecting the interest of the company, or the bank.  And we know of other scenarios, and I have to be careful in what I say here, and again I would say I find it, you know, somewhat frustrating that I have to be as careful as I have to be.  But the situation being what it is, we know of other situations where the non-executives were not informed of information which, to elicit that information they would, on occasion, have had to ask questions that, quite frankly, had they asked them, people would have thought they were bonkers.</p></speech>

You've referred to the decision to combine the roles of the finance director and the chief risk officer, I think, once as problematic, and actually the first time you said it, it was a mistake.  What are your reasons for that point of view today?</p></speech>

I think that, unlike my answer to the question to Deputy Phelan, I do think that with the wisdom that there was around the board at the time that that decision was taken, there should have been a greater degree of caution, a greater degree of care expressed about the idea that somebody who was the finance director, therefore, overseeing every aspect of the financial management of this organisation, as it was growing, was responsible for a myriad of different tasks; leading the investor relations, but also leading the accounting, leading the audit, all of that - this was his, this is his task - and, obviously, overseeing the drive towards continued growth of the bank, that he would also be charged with the responsibility for overseeing risk.  And, as I said in ... and I want to restate, because it would be unfair not to, that is not a reflection on the individual involved who was a very capable person.  But those roles should be distinct, in terms of even the optics for an organisation to have somebody who is financial controller, financial director and the chief risk officer, was not the smartest decision, I think, that was made or overseen by the board.</p></speech>

He says:<blockquote><br /><br />At this time, Anglo's property-related exposure in Ireland, the UK and the US had grown very significantly, and the need to monitor and manage the attendant complexity and risk had grown proportionately.  This decision would suggest that risk management was not appropriately prioritised within the bank.</blockquote></p></speech>

So the extent to which we lacked an internal, robust source of risk assessment and external feedback is, I think, questionable because the external feedback was something which we did on a very regular basis.  I believe this committee must have seen extensive copies of minutes of the risk and compliance committee and of its work and I believe that all of that documentation illustrates or demonstrates the extent to which there was a very intensive assessment of what was going on.  It was clearly deficient in some respects, I mean ... there's ... again, I hope I haven't tried to avoid that fact, or come across as I'm avoiding that fact, but it was clearly deficient.  But at the time we would have all have felt and considered it to have been extremely robust.</p></speech>

I mean relative to what we're dealing with here it was a relatively small issue, the details of which I don't remember.  But the regulator in Switzerland immediately made contact with a non-executive director of the board and elevated it to that point.  I think that the letters that we didn't see, or the correspondence - and I presume there's more than one letter but certainly the letter that you shared with me, I hadn't seen before.  That letter I would have thought two things.  One, when it landed wherever it landed in Anglo it should have been cc'd ... it should have been copied to the risk committee and I would have thought the other observation I'd make is that it should have been in the letter, it should have stated that we expect the board to be made aware of this.</p></speech>

One of the refreshing things about Brian Cowen, having worked with, as a consultant ... and it's probably important to put it on the record, having worked as a consultant with politicians from Fine Gael and the Labour Party over many years, in just as intense a manner in which I did with Brian Cowen or ... when he was Minister.  The relationship with Brian Cowen was such that we ... we talked about everything.  We talked about, you know ... except things that were, as far as I was concerned, and he was concerned, off limits.  And I've already made that point very clear, I think, to the committee.  So the discussions we'd have had would have been about family, would have been about sport.  One of the refreshing things about Brian Cowen, he was one of the few people in politics - and I'm conscious of where I am - who was as interested in my life and interested in my work as I was in his.  And so it was a very natural, normal relationship.</p></speech>

I was not a member of the nominations committee and I was asked by Peter Murray, as I recall, who was then chairman, to join the nominations committee for that particular appointment.  And I was happy to do so in the sense that I felt that I could add value.  I had had a good relationship with most of the senior executives in the bank.  I had no particular favourites, if you like, and I also had a view, which I had expressed at board, that the bank should consider outside appointees, which wasn't a view that was, you know, unanimously shared.  Some people had that view; others didn't, which is fine.  So the approach that we took was ... would stand up to scrutiny anywhere.  It was extremely thorough.  We had specialist consultants who worked with us on developing and refining the job spec, if you like, who also helped with us in drawing up a provisional list of possible candidates, if we were going to look outside the bank.  And over a period of months and a considerable amount of work, we went through a process whereby we assessed all of the possible candidates and made a decision to narrow it down to three, maybe two, and David Drumm won the race.

Will he take my call?"  Okay?  And I said, "I don't know.  What do you want to talk to him about?"  And he told me what he wanted to talk him about.  I put a call through to Brian Cowen.  Brian Cowen did what he did and I believe 100% appropriately so, went through the appropriate channels and said ... and handled it in the manner in which he did.

I don't know precisely.  I know I was away, so I think it was probably mid, sort of second week of September, I think.  And what I did was, because I didn't have a relationship with Brian Lenihan at all, but I contacted Cathy Herbert and I basically handed the request to her as the person appropriate I felt, to deal with the request.  And that was the extent of it.  And important to fill out the answer, I did have a phone call in the week of what turned out to be the guarantee, I had a phone call from the chief executive of the bank, of Anglo Irish Bank, and he asked my advice on something and I suggested to him that I couldn't really advise him but I suggested a course of action and I think the Chairman would understand why I am being somewhat obtuse- which I have tried to avoid.  But I suggested a course of action that he should take.  I was not aware at all of, you know, anything that was going on in respect of the machinations within Government.</p></speech>

Thank you very much, Senator, I am going to move to wrap things up.  Mr. Drury, in doing so, can I just put one question to you myself and then I'll invite the leads in subsequently.  Mr. Drury, your testimony of this afternoon would indicate that you were unfamiliar or not aware of the following: key concerns expressed by the Financial Regulator about commercial property lending activities, the levels of exceptions of lending policies, the experience needed to manage a fast-growing monoline bank such as Anglo, broader implications of the rapid growth in lending and profits of Anglo, implications of lending to such a concentrated number of developers, the extent of breaches in regulatory sectoral lending limits, the extent of interest roll-up within the Anglo loan book, the implications of combining the roles of CRO and financial director.  Mr. Drumm, or sorry, Mr. Drury, my apologies.  Mr. Drury, can I ask you to explain to this committee what role and purpose did you provide for Anglo?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-30a.853" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Drury" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015073000002#YY04900"><p>I was appointed to the board of Anglo Irish Bank in 2002 and one of the reasons why I think I was appointed was because I was a generalist, as opposed to somebody who had kind of linear experience or professional experience.  And in that context, I feel that I contributed very well as a non-executive director.  I was somebody who understood what the bank was trying to achieve, who understood the ambition of the bank, who understood the need to balance growth with control and I think that the issue around my suitability really in some people's minds relates to question of my chairmanship of the risk committee and my role on the risk committee.  And I think in that respect, I would say ... make the following points, Chairman.  Number one, when I assumed the position as chairman of the risk committee, I had served five years on the risk committee at that point.  So I had a ... a strong understanding of the risk management function, how it worked and how the risk committee worked.  I think that the second point is that at that time, I said very clearly to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick that I would like the composition of the risk committee to be changed in order that there would be high-quality financial people on the committee with me and in that sense, Ned Sullivan, who had been chairman of the audit committee for four, maybe six years prior to that, he became a member of the risk committee.  No&euml;l Harwerth, who was chief operations officer of Citigroup, she became a member of the committee and Lar Bradshaw, who was former managing partner of McKinsey, became a member of the committee.  And my job was also, I think, to be seen in the context of I had been chairman of Paddy Power PLC for a considerable period of time- almost six years by then.  Over that time and Paddy Power you know, may seem like a very different business.  But in many respects, the work that a company like Paddy Power does in the gambling industry is very, very significantly layered with risk and the management of risk.  And in that respect, my experience as chairman of Paddy Power of the board of Paddy Power overseeing significant growth in the market capitalisation of Paddy Power, overseeing the appointment of a new chief executive, I think made me suited to the position as chairman of the risk committee.  I accept fully, the points that you have made in summary, harsh and all as they may appear.  What I have been attempting to do in my testimony to your committee, Chairman, is ... is to account for what I could account for.  And as I said in my opening remarks, if I cannot give an answer, I will say so.</p><p>I do think that the remarks that you have made are unfair in the context of somebody who was chairman and a member of a risk committee and a member of a board of directors who was compromised by the fact that there was a significant amount of information which we ... which was not shared with us.  It may not have been significant in terms of the quantum, but it was certainly - and the evidence is there now - it was certainly significant in respect of its import.  And I do think that I was equally compromised by the fact that I have had to give evidence today in circumstances where there are acute sensitivities around what I can say about individuals, or even groups of individuals, not naming people.  I was told in advance of coming in to give testimony today that I couldn't even talk about "the leadership of the institution".  And if that is the case then to-----</p></speech>

And so in April 2004 Pat Whelan, who is the head of group risk, writes a memo, in which he notes that development exposure has increased from the guideline limit of 15% of the total loan book to about 21%, and there's a need to agree a strategy to reduce the exposure.  Was any strategy agreed to reduce the exposure, from your recollection?</p></speech>

I ... you know, 2004 is 11 years ago.  I saw the document four weeks ago.  I'm in ... you know, I'm prohibited from showing the document, sharing the contents of the document, quite correctly, with any third party.  I cannot give you - and this may not serve my purposes well in terms of how I will be perceived by members of this committee or by the public - I cannot give you an honest or authoritative answer to that question.</p></speech>

Can you ... can I talk to you about, going back to the issue in, in relation to Druids Glen, and, prior to your evidence it would have been my impression the narrative was that - and the witnesses before us didn't correct that narrative, but weren't questioned on it - that it was a round of golf, dinner and discussions but now it's clear that there was a private meeting prior to that.  In, in Mr. Cowen's testimony to this ... to this committee, he referenced a point where he says, "it was out in the open in a foyer of [the] Druids Glen golf club in full public view", we can only assume he was dealing with the second part of it and not the private meeting that we now know happened upstairs or in some room off the foyer, or, or somewhere out there.  Can I ask you, in relation to your organisation of that event-----</p></speech>

Brian Cowen was going, and understood he was going, to have a round of golf - how many holes is still questionable - with yourself and Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick.  You decided to have a private meeting with five individuals, then go for a round of golf, which takes, if it's nine holes, about two hours, and then continue the meeting afterwards, at a later stage over, over dinner or tea.  Does it seem as if that's not the best way to organise a meeting?  Usually, if I were to do it, I would organise the golf beforehand or afterwards.  But, you decided to put the golf, which would leave a number of your participants sitting, waiting for you to come in from the, the ninth hole or the 18th hole, depending how far you got.</p></speech>

I wasn't particularly concerned about the organisational element of it.  It was a factor of what was possible.  It was ... the principal reason for getting together was to have a discussion around the issues that I've already referenced in answer to, to Senator O'Keeffe's question, the kind of issues that, that Alan Gray had tabled in, in the agenda of items that we wanted to cover.  That was the principal purpose ... was, however people may view the individuals who had been gathered, and whatever perception people may have those ... have of those individuals, the, the intention was that the Taoiseach would be able to draw down on their views, their expertise, across a number of key issues facing him, in terms of the economy at that point.  And, the game of golf was very much a, kind of ... I wouldn't say an afterthought, because it was all stitched together, but the game of golf was purely to get him out for a bit of fresh air, and then we would reconvene over dinner.  It didn't ... it didn't discommode those who weren't golfers, because they went away for a few hours and did something.  And they knew in advance that was ... what was happening.  So, I'm not really sure that I can enlighten you any further, other than what I've said already, in respect of this, now infamous, event.</p></speech>

He gave evidence saying that he was concerned in relation to what was happening in Anglo, that they discussed it, and both of them were concerned.

Yes, he did.  "Did he discuss with you what was discussed?"  Yes, he did.  I did not know, until you've just said what you said, Deputy, what Bertie Ahern's account was of what Brian Cowen and he had discussed on that ... at that meeting.  I was not at that meeting.  When I spoke to Brian Cowen, Brian Cowen spoke with me and told me that he had met with Bertie Ahern at his house, and what had been discussed.  That was never referenced.  The first I heard of it, truthfully ... and if I had heard Bertie Ahern's testimony, and I was saying everything I have said so far to this committee today, I couldn't have said, as, as I did, to Deputy ... I beg your pardon, to Senator O'Keeffe, that, you know, Brian Cowen told me what they had discussed.  In other words, what I am saying to you, as, as clearly as I can, is that, in my conversation with Brian Cowen about what he had discussed with Bertie Ahern on that particular evening or day, there was absolutely no reference to the things that you have said Bertie Ahern gave in testimony to this committee.  None whatsoever.  Now, I ... or, I'm not saying that, that what Bertie Ahern said to this committee isn't a truthful account of what, what occurred or what they discussed, I don't ... the only ... two people who can answer that question are Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, but I can tell you, when Brian Cowen spoke to me he never referenced anything to do with what you've just said Bertie Ahern said, if you follow me.</p></speech>

The Irish Government, the Administration and the regulatory systems did not have the tools that were required to deal with the combination of circumstances and problems that faced them.  Prior to September 2008, there had been discussions about the nature of a possible bank guarantee and a framework of draft legislation for bank nationalisation had been prepared.  There was no legislative provision for a bank resolution system until the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of 2010.  Apart from the credit institutions winding-up directive of 2001, no bank resolution system was in place in the eurozone.  The eurozone implemented the single supervisory mechanism in 2013 and the single resolution mechanism, which is intended to deal with future bank resolution requirements, will come into effect at the beginning of next year.  Prior to the Irish bank guarantee in September of 2008, the UK had dealt with the Northern Rock and the Bradford and Bingley cases.  The Irish Government, prior to that, had gone through a dispute with the German Government on the question of which of them had responsibility for the Depfa affair.  That was resolved by the German Government having to take responsibility for it.<br/><br/>Ireland was the first eurozone member to find itself obliged to take action.  And I think it's fair to say that any action in an area like this by a first mover was bound to be controversial and, indeed, by definition, unprecedented.  Other countries followed.  Germany had to take action about Landesbanks, an issue that is still the subject of ongoing work in Germany.  France, Belgium and the Netherlands had to take joint action to deal with the problem in Fortis bank.  Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Cyprus all had to take action and Latvia found itself obliged to take action in this area, in fact before it joined the eurozone.  Of the early movers, I think its fair to say that the action taken by Ireland was the most comprehensive of any.  Indeed, I think it was probably to our disadvantage that the Irish Government at the time made it very clear that it was dealing with the whole banking system.  Other countries took action that was virtually as wide in its effect but they didn't have to say they were dealing with their whole banking system.<br/><br/>Retrospectively, it has been suggested that once the burning of bondholders was ruled out, the options available to the Government in September of 2008 were, first, a blanket guarantee, accompanied by nationalisation of the entire banking system; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank; or, the liquidation of Anglo, accompanied by what's been described as a &quot;political guarantee&quot; for the rest of the system.  In the event, the course of action that was adopted was a blanket guarantee, followed shortly afterwards - within a few months - by the nationalisation of Anglo and AIB and a partial nationalisation of the Bank of Ireland.<br/><br/>The evidence available is to the effect that the European Central Bank, some eurozone partners and some US authorities, made it clear that repudiation of bondholders would have serious, if unspecified, negative consequences.  Relatively little attention has been paid to the fact that the repudiation of senior bondholders would, as a result of the <i>pari passu</i>treatment convention, have had very serious repercussions for depositors with deposits of over &euro;100,000.  These repercussions would have affected individual depositors, corporate depositors and other banks - both Irish and non-Irish banks.  In his evidence to this committee on the 15th of this month, Mr. Paul Gallagher, who was Attorney General at the time, said of the relative positions of depositors and senior bondholders, and I quote, &quot;The law at that stage was that they ranked equally&quot;.</p><p>Liquidation of Anglo in September 2008 would have had, I think, the following consequences,<i>inter alia</i>: first, a draw on Government funds to cover the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee - Anglo was largely illiquid at the time - or measures to move the Anglo deposit book to another institution, which would have been a fairly complex exercise.  It was done later and it wasn't a simple exercise to carry out.  Other consequences would have been litigation issues arising from the absence of banking resolution legislation at the time.  And the need for some type of vehicle to realise the banks assets in order to avoid the contagion effects on other banks of calling in outstanding loans on the Anglo books, including many cases where borrowers from Anglo were also borrowers from other banks in the system.  NAMA didn't exist at the time, and I think it's fairly clear that any transfer of the loan book of Anglo to any other institution would immediately have spread the contagion to those other institutions.  On the face of it, that would have been a much more complicated procedure than the one actually adopted.  Again, in evidence given on the 15th of this month by Paul Gallagher, we find the statement that at the time, &quot;It was quite clear to everybody that you couldn't take the risk of winding down a bank, in whatever fashion.&quot;<br/><br/>Liquidation of Anglo would, in my view, have cast very serious doubt on any political guarantee that might have been ... that might have accompanied it, particularly given the fact that the liquidation of Anglo would have required ... would have inevitably had a contagion effects on the other banks ... And I think if there's need for any further illustration of the difficulties that would have accompanied a liquidation of Anglo at the time, I think we just have to look at what's happened since February of 2013.  In that liquidation, which involved a very much smaller outstanding volume of loans - I think about &euro;15 billion net - two and a half years later, the process has still not concluded . And that's not in any sense a criticism of the liquidators; I'm sure they're doing as much as they can.  But I think that gives some indication ... a small indication of what the difficulties would have been of a liquidation in 2008.  I have to say that, having listened, debated, worked over the period since September 2008 up to date, that had I been in the position of the Government of the day at the time, with the knowledge, or the lack of knowledge that they have, I don't think I would have done anything very different.  <br/><br/>By the time that I was appointed to the board of Anglo Irish Bank in November 2008, that bank, and the other Irish banks, had greatly exceeded every prudential limit in terms of the concentration of lending by sector and by client.  It was very clear that they had already, at that stage, found themselves in a very, very high risk position.  This had happened under the noses of the regulators, who had access to all the information required to arrive at that conclusion.  I don't know whether the failure to appreciate this can be ascribed to role confusion in the then bicephalous regulatory structure, or through any lack of capacity.  Immediately after nationalisation, the Anglo board ... the new Anglo board set in train a detailed review of the banks provisioning policy.  We commissioned an independent external review of the methodology, and, on 15 April 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement at that point was in excess of &euro;4 billion, rather than the &euro;1.5 billion that the Department had in mind at that point, with a very substantial downside risk from any further deterioration in property prices.  And I don't think I need to remind the committee that property prices had been falling from some point in 2007.  That fall actually accelerated very substantially in January 2009 and from then out.  So, in mid-April of 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement for Anglo, as it was at the time, was in the region of &euro;4 billion, with, as I say, a very substantial downside risk from further deterioration in property prices.</p><p>That was clearly unwelcome news which also had substantial implications for the other guaranteed institutions.  When we conveyed that the Department of Finance itself commissioned a separate study, to the best of my recollection by PwC, and that came to a conclusion broadly similar to the one that we had arrived at in Anglo.  I have to confess, a Chathaoirligh, that I was a little taken aback to hear the second secretary of the Department of Finance say recently in the course of her evidence to this committee, "Anglo surprised on the downside every time you looked at it."  The Department should not have been surprised since a very clear warning had been given in April of 2009.  I don't know whether the warning was understood or not.</p><p> Were the banks, including Anglo, insolvent in September of 2008?  That has been a question that has exercised minds.  I frankly don't know what the answer to it is, but my guess is that if the exercise had been carried out at the point when the guarantee was given, that Anglo would probably have proven to be solvent at the time on the basis of what was known, and the other banks I think would certainly have been.  That situation changed, it deteriorated as I've said, very rapidly over 2009 and continued to deteriorate for some time after that.</p><p> The then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan TD, came to the view early in 2009 that the staff resources in the Department of Finance were inadequate to deal with the issues facing it and personnel were drafted in from the National Treasury Management Agency.  I have to say, a Chathaoirligh, that that body's very considerable expertise lies in treasury management, not in securing repayment from borrowers, which is a different function.  Difficulties inevitably followed when staff of the department of the NTMA came to deal with issues of bank restructuring and dealing with externally recruited persons who had specific skills and a lot of experience in the area of restructuring.</p><p> The then head of banking in the Department of Finance proposed to me in 2011 that Anglo should be run, "as a subsidiary of the Department of Finance".  That proposal was a non-starter in terms of governance and prudence but unfortunately the bank's rejection of that negatively influenced the relationship with the Department.  And that problem was further compounded by the bank's later rejection of a suggestion made in a report commissioned by the Department of Finance from McKinsey's, a suggestion that the functions of chief financial officer and chief risk officer be combined.  The combination of those two functions in the bank in 2007 was identified by the Nyberg report as one of the deficiencies in the bank's structure and risk management system - and the committee had some discussions with a previous witness this afternoon on that issue.</p><p> Notwithstanding all of that rejection of that proposal - which we regarded as very, extremely unwise - the rejection of that proposal by the bank was seen by the Department of Finance as yet another example of obduracy on the part of the bank.  I have to say that a difficulty that continued throughout that period arose from what seemed to me to be an entirely inadequate appreciation by the Department of Finance of the role and obligations of the bank as a separate company set up by statute with all the duties that that implies under company law, and the duties and obligations of a regulated entity.  It was required, and this was indeed acknowledged, in the first relationship framework to operate at arm's length from the Minister for Finance for very solid prudential reasons.  And as I point out in the statement I submitted to the committee, I take issue with the current second secretary of the Department of Finance who observed to the Public Accounts Committee that that arm's-length requirement changed in some way when the bank was put into wind-down mode in 2011.  To my mind, and to our minds jointly in the board of management of the bank, the wind-down mode did not in any way affect the necessity for the arm's-length relationship for the prudential protection of the Minister and of the State.</p><p> On a more general note, I have to say that since the onset of this crisis both the Eurogroup and the European Union authorities have been, I must say politely, dilatory in their approach to all of this and have only gradually recognised and attempted to get to grips with the flaws of the architecture of EMU.  I think that's well illustrated by the fact that the crisis really began in 2007, the single supervisory mechanism came into effect at the beginning of 2014.  I think that's an extremely slow pace of reaction to one of the most difficult crises we've had to deal with.</p><p> Having said that, I believe that against this very difficult and confused background, the Irish authorities have dealt extremely well with the macro-level consequences of the 2008 bank guarantee and the challenges of resolving highly distressed bank assets.  And in that regard, I think NAMA has performed extremely well, and indeed the performance of all of the banks in dealing with the greater part of the distressed assets has, I think, been rather good.  I'm not sure that I would have the same level of comfort about their mortgage books but that's perhaps something we could get into at a later stage.  Apart from the Central Bank, it's my belief that the authorities here did not have the skills to micro-manage banks and should not have attempted to do so in any case.  And I have to say that the Department of Finance frequently seemed to adopt a defensive and hostile approach to outsiders who were recruited for their specific skills that they brought in.  Following the liquidation of IBRC in February of 2013, the directors produced a statement of affairs as required by the legislation.  This showed that, on the basis of the balance sheet, and the support measures in place up to the moment of liquidation, the bank was solvent.  The joint special liquidators are reported to believe, or to expect that on completion of their functions, there will be a surplus of something in excess of &euro;1 billion for distribution to unsecured creditors.  The Governor of the Central Bank forecast that that institution will make an appreciable profit of several billion euro, from its participation in the funding and the payment flows associated with the bank bailout process, much of which of course was associated with operations concerning Anglo and IBRC, and NAMA expects to return a surplus at the end of its operations.</p><p> The combined effect of those factors will produce a useful mitigation of what will still be a very large final cost to the State, of the banking crisis.  Together with my colleagues of the board of management of IBRC, I'm happy to have been able to contribute constructively to the mitigation of that cost.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

As you know, I came to Ireland in September '09.  I definitely had the view when I arrived, based on what I'd been told and what was available publicly, that there was a big job to be done here.  I had no idea that it would quickly become known as the most toxic bank in Europe.  By the time of my arrival, of course, the decision to establish NAMA had been made and you will recall that there was a number of 20%, in about mid-2009, being referred to as the likely NAMA haircut estimate across the industry.  I've been involved in difficult situations previously, I knew that this was likely to be a light number.  I knew that the full extent of the falling markets was not at that stage apparent, and we would see further deterioration, but I didn't expect the free-fall to continue as it did.  By the end of 2009, the haircut was estimated at around 30%, and of course right through 2010, it increased dramatically to the point where by the time all of the calculations were done, the industry average was around 58%.</p><p>For Anglo Irish Bank, this was devastating, as it was for the rest of the industry.  It produced a loss on transfer of assets to NAMA of &euro;21 billion.  And that &euro;21 billion loss on NAMA assets, that was a 62% haircut on &euro;33.9 billion of assets eventually transferred.  Of course, that 72% of the overall &euro;29.3 billion of State funding required to support Anglo and that's ... it's interesting to contrast that &euro;29.3 with the original &euro;1.5 estimate, just prior to the point of nationalisation.  Now, of course, the loans that remained in the banks, they were a mix of good loans but also of distressed and non-performing loans that didn't qualify for transfers.  So, the difference ... the other &euro;8.3 billion of money that went in, went to offset provisions on those loans and also to recapitalise the bank ... put it in a position to maintain its regulatory capital thresholds.  </p><p> Internally, what I expected to find at the bank was the requirement to fundamentally restructure the organisation.  I knew that that would be necessary, given past experience I'd had.  I knew that there had been a substantial dislocation in the markets and that that pointed to a long period of uncertainty and that there would be a need for very, very careful management of the distressed loan portfolio.  While the extent of the downturn was still very uncertain at that point, it seemed crystal clear that it wasn't just a cyclical aberration in markets; it was a structural change, and that was driven, primarily, by the global financial crisis and the collapse of the global funding markets. </p><p> So the business at Anglo needed to be restructured.  People there were focused on growing and lending and the mindset of the lending banker needed to be changed.  It needed to be changed quickly and it needed to be changed to, what you could refer to, as the mindset of a restructuring banker rather than a lending banker.  We assembled a management team, which, I think, collectively, was capable of addressing any issue that was put before it in the bank.  The Minister for Finance, at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, specifically requested that the senior people hired should be unblemished and not have been associated with the Irish banking scene or involved in any way in the global financial crisis.  The new team included specialists in corporate finance, debt restructuring and insolvency, as well as debt capital markets, balance sheet and capital management, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, finance, legal compliance and control in an environment wherein the management capacity and the mix assembled was equally applicable to a bank in full wind-down as it was to a bank going through a major restructure.  </p><p> The work to transform Anglo-INBS - on merger, IBRC - into a fit-for-purpose vehicle was extensive and required essentially a rebuild of, not only the client relationship management functions, but also the governance risk management and control activities from the ground up.  This had to be a progressive process, as markets were deteriorating rapidly and due attention to the immediate loan portfolio problems was critical.  It was a difficult process, as the loan book at Anglo was characterised by a lack of thorough management information, poorly perfected security - in some cases, absent - and a need to retain and supplement the management teams themselves.  Timeframes set by commitments to the European Commission needed to be respected and progress was desirable in the identification of management of a significant number of legacy issues.  In both my main and supplementary statements to the inquiry, I've referred to a number of times to difficult aspects of the interaction between the bank and the Department over the period from nationalisation to liquidation.  I remain of the view that most of the conflicts could have been avoided if there was a better understanding in the Department of the constraints the bank was under in complying with the various requirements it was subject to and the legal and prudential need for the bank to act independently.  The bank was governed by the Anglo Act and as well as an associated relationship framework that required ongoing separation from the Minister and his nominees.  In conducting interactions, there were often complex considerations required across multiple dimensions.  These included, not only the regulatory obligations, but many others in managing the ordinary course of business, which referenced many possible overlapping areas such as the public interest dimension, the management of legacy issues, the management of stressed loans, the management of very large exposures, as well as the number of other relevant legal considerations.</p></speech>
