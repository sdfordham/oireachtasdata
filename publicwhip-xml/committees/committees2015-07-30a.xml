Thank you, members of the committee.  In July 2009 I was on the panel on the Marian Finucane Sunday morning show reviewing the papers and the events of the week.  During a commercial break, Rachel English, who was sitting in for Marian, said that a couple of callers had phoned to ask that she would question me about my role on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  I dealt with this as best I could at the time by saying that, as a former director, I would fulfil my obligations to the letter and co-operate with any legal matters that might arise.  I also said that morning that I believed I had a duty as a citizen of this State to participate fully in any and all inquiries established either by Government or by the Oireachtas.  I was obliged, as a citizen, to give whatever insights I might have into the events around the banking collapse.  Since then, I, like other former directors of Anglo, have attended interviews with the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement and the GBFI investigating certain matters and I accounted in full for what I knew.  I have been interviewed by Dr. Nyberg as part of his report, all of which was conducted in private.  I am grateful, therefore, to have the opportunity to appear before this committee and, in full public view, deal with those issues that I can deal with.  Where I cannot, I will say so.  In my written statement of a month ago to this inquiry, I prefaced the response to the points raised by the committee by making some general observations.</p> <p>  The first is that the part of the definition of "non-executive directorship" is to be non-executive and that in accepting such a role in any business, there is what I have chosen to describe as "an unstated contract of trust" between you, the non-executive, and the executives or senior management in that business.  The non-executive holds a part-time role on the board and he or she is dependent on the integrity and the openness of the senior full-time management who have access to all the information about the organisation's business.  In 2009 Donal O'Connor, the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, addressed the board's failings and made a fulsome apology to all those who had been affected by its underperformance, from shareholders to staff.  And as a result of the ... a result of what had happened - the ultimate fallout - an apology to the taxpayers.  I was party to that apology, as a former director, albeit I had retired in June 2008.  I want to recapture the essence of that apology this morning ... or this afternoon and restate it for my own part because with more ... the more that has emerged in the intervening period, I would want there to be no obfuscation when it comes to apologising for whatever part I may have played in the difficulties that arose.  Quantifying that is for others, including this committee, to do.</p> <p>  This is all by way of context for these proceedings, Chairman.  I will endeavour to deal with all the committee's lines of inquiry.  I will do so as clearly and directly as I can, with my only interest being to add to the weight of knowledge that might assist you in your work to ensure that the lessons are learned and can be applied to future shock scenarios - better to protect the financial system, better to protect the economy and better to protect the people of this country.  I believe there are valuable lessons to be learned from what we have experienced.  That experience cannot be of value though, if those involved are not prepared to come forward and give an honest account of what they know and to do so without concern for protecting any individual's interests, including their own.  Over a six-week period in the summer of 2002, I joined the board of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power plc.  I served for six years on the bank's board and eight on the board of Paddy Power, six of those years as chairman.  At the time I fulfilled those roles, I had an equally high regard for the senior management of both companies.  Interestingly, so too did the markets and, in the case of the bank, international rating agencies.  I did my job with each company, with the same commitment, interest and the same integrity.  In taking on the roles, I did so in the belief that I was working with management teams that would share all the information required with me, as a non-executive director, to allow me to fulfil my responsibility to the shareholders.  Was that in any contract of employment?  No.  Did it need to be? No.  This is business at a level where not everything should need to be documented, where management ... senior management knows that it has an obligation to keep its non-executive directors appraised of anything that is material to the well-being of the business.</p> <p>  There's been a good deal of comment on the lending approach of Anglo Irish Bank.  Much of it is comment that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a focus on one main sector, such as property.</p><p>Broader-based banks also got the emphasis wrong and continue to get the emphasis wrong.  Considerable focus is placed on risk and the management of the risk function within the bank and its oversight by the board and, specifically, by the risk and compliance committee.</p><p> As you said in your opening remarks, Chairman, I was a member of this committee for the duration of my time on the board, and its chairman for my last year as a non-executive.  It's understandable, correct, that attention has been focused on this aspect of the bank's governance and it's reasonable to expect that the committee of inquiry would want to question me about it.  Let me set some initial thoughts before you do.  I believed that the risk and compliance function was well-resourced and that the senior executives responsible within the bank were competent, committed and focused exclusively on protecting the bank's interests against any lending that could damage it.  I also believed that the overall structures, built around the executive function, were robust, comprising a risk statement which was reviewed and updated every year and, as part of that review, a comprehensive listing of all anticipated risks detailed and considered by the committee and the board.  That was, in effect, our bible for the coming year and a programme to mitigate those risks was reported on at each risk meeting.  Risk management as a function within the bank lived this on a 24-7 basis.  It was monitored by internal audit and external audit and quarterly reports were submitted to the regulatory authorities.  The risk and compliance committee reviewed the work of the asset and liability committee, which was a management committee, and we reported directly to the board.  Separately, we brought in external consultants to review the risk committee's work and the risk function on a regular basis.  In 2003, Bernard Somers and Associates was brought in to review the whole risk function within the function, post the Rusnak affair.  In 2006, that exercise was repeated when PwC were brought in to review the performance of risk within the bank and the minutes will show that I had recommended, as I finished with the bank and the committee, that a further external report should be carried out in late 2008 to see how the committee could be strengthened further.</p><p> There are issues that have been raised by other contributors to the inquiry to date around the bank's credit policy, its loan growth and the concentration on development lending, which I am sure you'll want to explore presently.  Before doing so, the Anglo collapse needs to be seen in context.  Yes, the bank over-extended itself and, despite efforts from 2006 onwards to curb lending in Ireland, it took on too much in the Irish marketplace - even with the application of the foot to the brake - in new development lending that the board had approved at that time.  Great efforts had been made over the previous decade to develop its franchise in the UK and North America with considerable success, the latter being down, in no small measure, to the work of David Drumm, a serious consideration when it came to his appointment as chief executive.  Nonetheless, the bank's exposure to development lending was at 23% by the end of 2008, with 50% of total lending in Ireland.  On the other hand, the board had supported the recommendation of the director of banking to stop new lending except to its top, most established clients and Anglo's share of major land deals in Ireland was less than half that of AIB and 10%  lower than Bank of Scotland between 2005 and 2007.</p><p> My friendship with Brian Cowen has been much commented upon in the context of Anglo's demise.  Let me deal with what I know.  In doing so, I realise there's a significant number of people whose minds are made up on the issue and nothing anyone can say will undermine their belief in a conspiracy theory.  Interaction No. 1 was a few days after St. Patrick's Day 2008.  I received a phone call from Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, the chairman of the bank, asking me if he thought that Brian Cowen would take a call from him.  I asked him why and he said it was about the ongoing liquidity issue, so I said that I knew Brian Cowen was overseas, but I would try and reach him.  I made contact with Mr. Cowen within an hour or an hour and a half, explained the situation to him, and he said he would need to talk in the first instance with the Governor of the Central Bank, but that he would then revert to me.  Within an hour or so later, he had called me back and he told me that the Governor was going to deal with the matter.</p><p> Interaction 2 - Heritage House, Stephen's Green, April 2008.  The first point to make here is that this was not a special, set-piece event built around Brian Cowen or his position as Minister for Finance.  Such events happened, on average, twice a year and had been in place since before I had joined the board in 2002.  Over those years, the board had held lunches primarily, though sometimes dinners, with people in public life - senior public servants, politicians and others - with the emphasis very firmly on it being a social occasion where there would be an exchange of views and experiences.  In my time on the board, I had attended, I would say, eight or ten and ... of those functions and among the attendees over those years had been politicians of different persuasion to what Brian Cowen's is.  Brian Cowen just happened to be next on the list.  I had undertaken to ask him to  do the event and, indeed, the records in the Department should show that he had at least ... on at least two previous occasions been diaried to meet with us, but other priorities had got in his way.</p><p> The event was completely unremarkable.  I recollect a general introduction by Sean FitzPatrick, as chairman, and then a broad discussion about all things other than banking, with the Minister going around the table asking each board member to set out their thoughts on their area of expertise or their view of the Irish economy or, in the case of those who had global experience, like No&euml;l Harwerth, who was a former COO of Citigroup, the global economy; the same with Gary McGann, obviously through his role as CEO of Smurfit Kappa.  </p><p> Interaction 3 - the Druids Glen golf outing.  I understand that some people find it hard to believe that we didn't discuss the bank during the course of that afternoon and evening.  I'm a sometime sceptic myself, so I understand the extent to which some people have difficulty in accepting this point.  Let me, though, ask a few questions.  Had we discussed the bank, what would we have discussed?  The general liquidity issues in the sector at that time or how the Quinn CFD position had unsettled the market and added to the pressure on the stock?  Perhaps we could have discussed those issues, but to what end?  The then Taoiseach is a friend of mine.  I saw him regularly, often in his offices, so why, if I, as a former director of Anglo at that time, wanted to lobby him or to bring undue and inappropriate influence to bear on him, would I choose such a convoluted and public route to do so, when I could have arranged to meet him in his office, closed the door, sat down and had the conversation well away from prying eyes?  For me, the idea that the meeting, the golf and the dinner in Druids Glen was part of some conspiracy to capture the support of Brian Cowen for some kind of imagined need that Anglo had in July 2008 is more lacking in credibility.  We met for about two hours, we went through an agenda that Alan Gray had prepared for the meeting and which did not have banking on it at all.  Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, Brian Cowen and I then went and played ... I don't even remember was it nine or six holes of golf and then we went to the bar and had some drinks, where we were joined by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who happened to be in the Druids Glen hotel attending a wedding, and he asked Mr. Cowen to join the bridal party for photographs, which the Taoiseach - the then Taoiseach - was happy to do.  Later, Gary McGann and Alan Gray returned to join us for dinner.  Alan had retained the agenda, but in classic Brian Cowen fashion, he remembered that his driver was outside and he said he would like him to join us for dinner, which, of course, he did.</p><p>We reviewed some of the matters we had discussed that morning and we closed business early.  There are other material reasons why people should not believe the conspiracy narrative.  Brian Cowen may represent something that some people do not like and do not admire.  That is absolutely their prerogative, as all of us evaluate in our own minds, in our own hearts, people who are in public life.  What should be acknowledged, however, as I know politicians who are not part of his party readily do, is that in public office, Brian Cowen would never make a decision that was not centred on what he considered to be best for his country.</p><p> Equally, this is about me and my standards.  I would not act in a manner that is unethical.  And were I to have attempted to pressurise Brian Cowen in the interest of a private business, at the expense of the State who's duty it was his to serve, I would have been behaving inappropriately, and for those who know me well, in a way that would be completely and utterly out of character.  In my time as a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Paddy Power, and other private businesses of which I was a director, I never discussed the business of those organisations in any material way with Brian Cowen.  Confidentiality is integral to who I am and how I conduct my affairs.</p><p> Much of the comment on Anglo is commentary that could be applied to the many banks across the world that had or have a narrow focus, rather than the larger institutions that offer a wide array of products and services.  Much of the comment is also based on a view of the bank of its lending and of its growth, which has its source in the knowledge we now have of the cataclysmic global economic events of the mid-2000s.  I know, Chairman, that you've all probably had your fill of witnesses coming into these sessions and talking of 20/20 vision or, "If I knew then what I know now."  But while in normal circumstances, this may be a pretty poor line of defence, it is the case that the storm that broke in Ireland was a global financial tsunami that had its origins elsewhere and just took its time to crash over our small island and wreak the damage that it did.  There is no doubt that the damage was accentuated by the fact that our own defences were very weak.  We had gorged in the boom years and the banks had continued to feed our insatiable appetites.  I know.  I know because I was involved in both putting the menu on the table as a non-executive director of Anglo Irish Bank, and I know because I was one of the hundreds of thousands who sat there and ate more than I needed.  This is not excuse time, Chairman; it is simply to acknowledge the fact that when the massive shock waves stirred by global financial events washed over us, we were already in a vulnerable position.  We know now that Anglo Irish Bank most certainly was.</p><p> This statement is not an apologia.  It is an honest attempt to summarise what I would consider to be the main insights of the time that could help the committee in meeting its objective to assess what went wrong, where and why in order that it can apportion responsibility where it believes it should rest, and provide guidelines or learning's from its review of the whole episode.  I accept that to have been on the board of Anglo Irish Bank over the period leading up to the financial crisis, disallows absolutely any notion that one could claim to be in any way blameless.  But, as I have said before, it is for the committee to determine where the lines of responsibility lie and to weight them according to people's roles across the banking sector and the other stakeholders involved.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Fintan Drury was a former director of Anglo Irish Bank, not at that time, and Alan Gray was a director of the Central Bank.  So ... and they were ... they were selected for that discussion on the basis that prior to going on holidays, I had had a discussion with Brian Cowen about the value of having a number of smart people around a table to discuss with him some of the more substantive economic issues that ... and not just economic issues, but primarily economic issues that were facing the country at the time and which he, as Taoiseach, might need to get some outside perspectives on.</p></speech>

This was a ... this was a kind of one-off discussion to explore areas that outside people might be able to give him guidance on.  And the reason the people who were at that event were chosen was because it was a combination of people I knew and people that ... who Brian knew.  Brian had great belief in Alan Gray, as many people in politics and in the Civil Service do.  So he wanted him there.  I knew Alan, but not well.  He wanted Gary McGann there because, as I refer to in my opening statement, he had a view that Gary was very smart, very committed to public service.  He was a ... I think at the time, a former chairman, if not still chairman, of the Dublin Airport Authority, and had committed himself to a number of roles in public service, but he was also chief executive of one of Ireland's largest companies, which had a global reach and Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick was my suggestion and the suggestion was made at a time when Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick was deified.  It's an exaggeration but his reputation was, both globally and in Ireland, extremely high and he was seen as somebody who was extremely bright, extremely talented, and would have, therefore, value to add.  And it was done on that basis.</p></speech>

I think for anyone who knows Brian Cowen and anyone of any political hue who knows him well would say "That's not Brian Cowen".  Now, it is all-----</p></speech>

I engaged fully with Dr. Nyberg.  I found his approach very insightful, very fair and very comprehensive.  And I'm not ... you know, I think one of the things I ... there's probably only one significant finding in Nyberg that I would really take issue with and ... and I think, as I said ... also said in my opening statement, Deputy, the truth is that whatever belief I had at the time that I was a director at Anglo Irish Bank, some of those beliefs have been if not shattered, they have been rendered inappropriate.</p></speech>

By July 2008, just when you came off the board, the exposure was at just over 600% of its own funds.  Were you ever concerned about this breach of the limit, over 200%, was it something that was raised with you, was it something that was discussed at the board?</p></speech>

I had ... I unquestionably had faith in the risk management function and the risk management team.  I think there were errors made ... and rather than appear to be apportioning blame elsewhere, I think as chairman of the risk committee for that last year, and as a member of the risk committee for the previous five years, that I have to accept some of that responsibility.  And what I mean by that is, for example, I think that the decision we made to have a ... merge the roles of chief risk officer with that of the finance director was a mistake.  And that's not a reflection, important to state, of the, on the individual in question, you know, quite the opposite.  But it's in the principle, when you look back, and I'm going to try avoid saying that ... too much, but the principle, at the time the principle should have been wrong.  We should have, as a board, we should have recognised that that principle was not good, because the bank was at a scale where those two functions needed to be completely delineated.</p></speech>

It's the PAC report in July 2012 on the crisis into the domestic banking sector, and it noted, this is the quote, it says:<blockquote><br /><br />Anglo had poor governance structures and procedures and risk controls during its period of high growth.  Weaknesses in these areas were identified by auditors and regulators in 2003, 2006 and 2008.</blockquote>It goes on to say, &quot;Management showed a lack of awareness of risk and focused their attention on business growth.&quot;  Mr. Drury, how do you reconcile these comments with the positive statements on governance structure of the bank contained in the corporate governance statement each year, in the bank's annuals, annual report?</p></speech>

If you ... but that's the view of the PAC reviewing what it saw as being the performance and the stewardship within Anglo at a moment in time or over a period of time, rather.  And you are juxtapositioning that against the corporate governance statements in the annual reports, and I'm saying to you ... what I'm saying to you is that, if you simply take one commentary and put it against the other and present them as you have done, they are irreconcilable .</p></speech>

So, let me be, or attempt to be, cautious and yet at the same time address the question and deal with it as substantively as I can.  I think I made a reference to, in my opening statement, I made reference to ... I talked about the, kind of, contract of trust.  And I think it is something which, you know, at the risk of labouring it, people just need to understand and accept that if you are taking on a position as a non-executive director, you have no choice but to vest a degree of trust, and I'm not talking about legal issues, I'm talking about ethics, I'm talking about moral responsibility.  There is a two-way moral responsibility.  I cannot function as a non-executive director of any organisation unless I can presume on the executives providing me with the information I need in order to be able to evaluate what is happening in that organisation.  Okay?  I think, I hope that people would accept that.  Because  otherwise, you're second-guessing everything, and you become an executive, and you're in the, you're in the institution or organisation every day of the week.  So my, my answer to you is that without being specific or without being ... addressing very particular areas which might by implication identify individuals unfairly, there was a deficit and it's manifest in some of the documentation I've received from the committee.</p></speech>

The graphs speak for themselves in terms of the rapid rise of Anglo in those three areas.  Do you think that these levels of growth were prudent or sustainable, in the context of the level of competition in the Irish banking market during this period?  And in your opinion, did these levels of growth imply that the pursuit of growth was affecting credit quality and lending standards?</p></speech>

The view of Anglo Irish Bank, at that time, would have been still uniformly positive.  The share price was coming under pressure for reasons we've discussed or have been discussed here already.  I think that the growth story that Anglo was at that time, or had become, was one that was largely admired, was largely admired by all external audiences or most ... the vast majority of external audiences.</p><p>And so, at that particular time, I don't think that there was anybody that I can recall who was identifying and establishing in any definitive way or ... a problem with the growth story of Anglo Irish Bank.  Now, that does not mean that the board of the bank at the time, including non-executive directors, wouldn't have had a responsibility to take a wider view and to look at the figures in the stark manner in which you have presented them, Deputy, and you're right, in which they look now when we look at them.  We didn't, and that is again clear from the documentation you will have read, and all of you will have read and seen in preparing for these meetings that, you know, the view that was taken of the growth of the bank was that it could continue to grow.  The problems that manifest themselves, both the global one, which I have stressed in my opening statement, but which I do not want to over-stress because I think it in ... if I was to do so, it would, kind of, try and negate what happened here - and I mean in Ireland and I mean not just in Ireland, within Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

And I mentioned, for example, the earnings per share increasing by 363% over that five-year period.  Now, 90% of employees of Anglo Irish Bank were shareholders with the bank.  Were individuals blinded by the rapid growth and the rapid growth in share prices and took additional risks as a result of that?  Was it affecting credit quality?  Was it affecting lending standards?</p></speech>

So, for example, whether it was Paddy Power, Anglo Irish Bank or any other business that I was involved in, the growth - even a private business with shares that weren't traded on the Stock Exchange - the growth in the share value, for me, was not what the business and the people involved in the business should be focused on, or would be focused on.  So, as a board in Anglo Irish Bank, I don't remember - and I'm sure there would have been discussions about share price from time to time - but I don't ever remember that being a focal point for the board in terms of determining whether or not the business was being ... was successful, and that the only means of judging the success of the business was where stood the share price.</p></speech>

I'd like to refer to core booklet, Vol. 1, again, and it's page 97.  These are the minutes of the risk and compliance meeting that was held on 24 May 2007.  The issue being discussed is the suggested revision of Anglo's minimum capital ratio requirements.  It says in the document:<blockquote><br /><br />The committee reviewed and considered the proposal and in particular the key reasons for the Group's suggested reduction in Minimum Regulatory Capital, namely<br /><br />- The Group has constantly held a surplus over the minimum regulatory capital requirements, thereby creating a significant buffer in the event of an unanticipated and sudden losses in the Group.<br /><br />- The high propensity of the Group to generate significant and new internal capital equity each year due to the- maintenance of strong average gross lending margins<br /><br />- low cost-income ratios<br /><br />- loan loss provision track recordFollowing consideration, the proposal in the paper was approved on the basis of very compelling arguments outlined therein.</blockquote>Now this is to reduce the amount of capital that would be held by Anglo bank just over a year before Anglo bank lost its capital.  Why did you take a decision to place the capital at risk?</p></speech>

I'm sure I knew at the time but I don't know why that decision was taken at that time.  What I would say is that the decisions, and I think that the documentation in terms of the risk committee demonstrates the point that I made in my opening statement - and I'm not avoiding your question; I will come back to it - demonstrates the extent to which the risk and compliance committee was interrogating and pushing for the risk function within the bank, or the risk management team within the bank, to establish cause, establish reason why any changes in policy would be taken.  So, if group management was making up ... advocating a change of policy, then that would have been interrogated very, very carefully at the time and the decision would have been taken on the basis of such an approach.</p></speech>

You know, it would be wrong for me to turn around and say, "I regret that decision."  Because it might be the right thing to say from a public relations point of view but, you know, I have to genuinely regret it.  I can't say to you with any honesty, Deputy, that a decision that was made, I'm sure and certain, on the basis of full facts at that time, and would have ... and the presentation or view that was brought to the committee would have been interrogated ... and that that decision was taken, do I regret it, no.</p></speech>

And the reason why the Irish tax ... the reasons why the Irish taxpayer has endured such losses are multi-faceted, as I think we would all accept.  They are not all down to Anglo Irish Bank; they cannot all be laid at the door of decisions that were taken at a moment in time by directors be they non-executive or executive directors or senior management in Anglo Irish Bank.  Was that material to the losses that the taxpayer has endured?  Of course.  I'd be a fool to sit here and try and suggest otherwise.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Murphy, was talking to you in relation to your relationship with Brian Cowen.

So in all my time, both as a consultant, Deputy, in the '90s and then later as a non-executive director of the bank, and with the greatest respect to everybody in this room, I never came across, or I rarely came across an institution that I worked with, or had an engagement with in Ireland, that was less interested in politics and less interested in lobbying, or less interested in engaging with the body politic.</p></speech>

I'm saying to you definitively there was not, and, therefore, I don't know, because I never ... I don't ever recall anyone in Anglo Irish Bank, when I was a consultant to the bank and when I was a director, lifting the phone to me, or asking me to meet them for a cup of coffee, and saying, "We're trying to get to see the Minister for the environment about planning issues to do with some of our client stuff."

And I would like to raise one other point here, even though I've made it before, because I think this is important.  I work in part of my life in professional football.  And it is often referred to as how corrupt the sport is and the extent to which agents, who represent footballers, are corrupt.  And yet the very notion that a corrupt deal can be done by one party, one person sitting on one side of the table ... so let's imagine for a moment, Deputy, that I was prepared to go in and sit down with Brian Cowen and beat him up metaphorically to get him to act in a particular way in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, Paddy Power, Mainstream Renewable Power, I don't believe there are many people sitting in this room who believe that Brian Cowen ... that that conversation would have been a lengthy conversation.</p></speech>

Were you aware, because you asked the questions, that there was no problems within the bank at that time in terms of challenging the conspiracy theory that some may have?  So, were you aware that at the end of April, Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick had approached John Hurley looking for a guarantee for his bank - as has been suggested in evidence or given in evidence by Kevin Cardiff?  Were you aware that a week later a DD, which Kevin Cardiff described as a person of substantial presence in the financial sector, also made such an approach?

I did not arrange for Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick ... for Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick to have a meeting and a game of golf and a dinner afterwards with Brian Cowen, as you have profiled it in your question, and I was very clear as to what I had done.  I had, at Brian Cowen's request and in discussion with Brian Cowen about his need to get a macro-perspective on what was happening in the economy, I had gathered a very small select group of people, rightly or wrongly, who at that time were Alan Gray, who is a respected economist, Gary McGann, who was chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, and Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, who was a highly respected chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

So, as I said, an inspection of commercial property lending activities in Anglo by the Financial Regulator in May 2007 identified 30 separate issues which it required to be addressed, at which it listed in the report dated 27 June 2007, and that's on the screen there in front of you.  So what you see is a letter from Ms Mary-Elizabeth Donoghue, banking supervision department, at the office of the Financial Regulator.  I'll just take two paragraphs of it there.  The first letter, it's May 2007 and it's a letter to Mr. Drumm and it says, "I refer to the inspection of Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc ("Anglo") carried out by the Financial Regulator between 9 and 17 May 2007."  Then moving on to the third paragraph, it says, "The Financial Regulator's inspection process is a high level review and does not constitute a detailed examination or audit."  So, at this stage, it's high level, it's not drilling down into very, very specifics.  And as a result, it then goes on to say, "Consequently, the inspection process may not be relied upon to identify all issues arising in the areas reviewed."  So, it outlines there that there might be other matters as things advance on.</p> <p>  So, if I could just move on to the regulator's letter then which is the next one up and you see there, there's a number of headings.  There's the "Group Credit Policy" is one with nine items under it.  The next one is the "Exceptions to Group Credit Policy" that has three items under it.  "Credit Committee Terms of Reference" has another item under it.  "Group Risk Management Operations Board" has two items under it.  "Risk Management Reports" have two items.  "Personal Guarantees" have an item.  "Group Watch List" have an item.  "Loan Review Process" have an item.  "Breaches of Internal Limits and Targets" have two items but is broken down into more detail with some Roman numerals.  It then goes on to "Stress Testing" has an item.  "Hedging of Risk" has an item.  "Condition Precedent" has an item.  "Review of Loan Files" has three items.  "Interest Only Breakdown of the Loan Book" has an item and "Job Descriptions" has an item.  It's quite extensive.  Were you, as a board member, made aware of this report and was it discussed by the board? </p></speech>

We had a watch list and we had an impaired list and there were decisions made based on credit policy around some of which Deputy Doherty has already raised, which were around the whole loan book and that changed.

The documents I am referencing, Chairman, are Vol. 1 page 21-25, a report from Barry Herriott, management consultants and also page 17, the Nyberg report, and they relate around that the report from Barry Herriott undertaking an external consultancy in 2003 noted that the directors felt that the board pack "failed to ignite debate in important issues" and many directors expressed frustration on need for more debate on strategic issues.  And the Nyberg report, ''there is little evidence that board directors at the time were active in challenging ... bank's approach [and] its pace of lending growth''.  Now, do you agree with these observations?  What's your opinion on them?  Did you challenge management enough as non-executive directors?  How do you describe the corporate culture of the board during your period on the board in terms of the interaction of the chair with the management ... generally, how the board was run?</p></speech>

But the collegiate sense also works in the ... in this regard I believe, that there was a singular focus and the singular focus was on success and the problem with talking in those terms now, is that people assume that that meant success was increased profits, share price going through the roof and that that was the only means by which success would be determined.

So the question I'm asking is: is it credible ... Anglo was in survival mode at that time; share price was falling; two weeks before the unwinding of the contracts for difference had taken place; major liquidity problems.  They were a monoline group.  It wasn't a diverse group.  It was a group of four people, all direct links with Anglo.  So is it credible - you were saying you discussed the economy - first of all, is it credible that ye did not discuss banking and Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

But, as I said in my opening statement, there are a great many people who don't and who never will, no matter what they hear and who they hear it from.  I regard myself as a pretty ordinary person.  I regard myself as somebody who behaves in a particular manner and who has a code of ethics and standards, which you alluded to in your opening before you asked the question.  And so the defence I'm offering of what I ... the account I gave you of what happened in Druids Glen is simply this: you either accept what I told you under affirmation as being a truthful account of what transpired on that occasion, or you don't.  And I can stay here until Tibb's Eve, Deputy, and make the same point over and over and again, and I accept - I may not have said it in my opening statement - I have friends who find it lacking in credibility.

And there is an element of frustration, having waited seven years to make any public comment about what happened, to be constrained by what I can say.  But I respect that and understand that to be the position.  And, at the same time, I don't want to appear to evade or elude my own responsibilities.  So I look at things ... for example, I'll give you simple examples, if I can.  I look at things as serious as that one which I already alluded to, I think, in response to Deputy Murphy, which is the question of the decision to morph, as it were, the role of chief risk officer with finance director.  I think that was a mistake.</p><p>And I think I was smarter than to allow that to have happened or not to have seen that as being a mistake, and that's nothing to do with what happened subsequently.  It's just the principle of that for a bank that had got quite large by that time.  But, from there to smaller things like, you know, I would have argued with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick at some stages about the need for an economist within the bank.  And ... but I didn't push hard enough.  I had issues around, around Se&aacute;n Quinn's CFD holdings, which I did articulate, but I look back and say, "Maybe I should have been stronger".  So, that's being as ... that's ... those are three example, very different examples, where I'm trying to be as candid as I can.</p></speech>

Thank you very much, Mr. Drury, and thank you, Deputy O'Donnell.  I just want to deal with two matters, just on a point of clarification, and I'm just proposing a five-minute comfort break at that ... after which.  In questioning there with Deputy O'Donnell, Mr. Drury, the question, kind of, indicated with regard to the corporate culture of the bank during your period of time on the board, and you did elaborate in regard to Mr. Murray.  But maybe you could just move into some of the space during Mr. FitzPatrick's time as well.</p></speech>

I think there tends to be a change when you get two very different personalities.  So, there was no change in terms of, you know, the quality of information, the standard management of board meetings, but there was a different type of dynamic, and I referenced the ... I think I used the term "collegiate" when I referenced Peter Murray and his stewardship of the board.

But, in 2002, from annual reports, Anglo had &euro;13.3 billion in loans.  In 2003, that went up by &euro;4 billion.  It went up by &euro;7 billion in 2004; by &euro;10 billion in 2005; by &euro;16 billion in 2006; and by &euro;17 billion in 2007.  So, &euro;54 billion in extra loans between ... in five years.  And Patrick Honohan, now Governor of the Central Bank, in <i>The Economic and Social Review</i>, summer 2009, said:<blockquote><br /><br />A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual real growth rate of 20% is often taken as the trigger.  Each of the locally-controlled banks had at least one year in which this threshold was triggered.  One of them, Anglo Irish [Bank], crossed it eight of nine years and indeed its average annual rate of growth, 1998-2007, was 36%.</blockquote>And we had another witness to the inquiry here, Mr. Bill Black, a former US regulator ... are you familiar with him?  Yes.  Mr. Black said, &quot;The rule of thumb on banking for many decades if you grow more than 25% a year, you will likely fail.&quot;  Were you aware of the risks of this kind of exponential growth in the loans of Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

So, this was ... in 2002, would have been a largely Irish bank and over the period in question that you're talking about, such significant growth in the overall size of the bank and in the overall loan book, the bank had grown significantly in the United Kingdom and it was also going through significant growth in the United States, as I mentioned earlier, under the stewardship of David Drumm and I think that was a factor in the decision to appoint him as chief executive ultimately.  So, I think the ... in some respects, we're not comparing like with like when you look at 2002 and 2007-2008.  I also believe that, in those particular territories, the economies of those markets were going through significant growth and a lot of the growth in the UK was concentrated in a part of the UK which has always had sustained growth.</p> <p>  I think, having said that, Deputy, that if you look at it through the prism of economic analysis that someone like Bill Black would be renowned for, then you see that growth in particularly bleak terms.  I'm not saying that's incorrect; I'm simply saying that, you know, economic views and economic opinion, obviously, can be ... I'm conscious of who's sitting on your left but can be, kind of, quite polarised.</p></speech>

And the values that NAMA achieved in taking on those loans has to be seen in the context ... well, it's not for me to judge it, but it in time will have to be seen in the context of how those loans have ... those loan portfolios have performed post-sale by NAMA to third parties and post the sale of those loan portfolios by third parties.

I didn't hear her evidence, but taking what you've said as representing what she ... her point, I think she's right in the sense that historically, and again today, despite what's happened, and I don't mean in Ireland, I mean globally, again today we see evidence all the time that people in financial services institutions get paid phenomenal amounts of money for doing the work they do.  And the basis on which they are entitled to those significant sums, and entitled to very significant bonuses, are out of kilter with how financial ... or with how remuneration is structured in other areas of industry, it seems to me.</p><p>So I think what she has expressed, as a former director of a mutual, is a view that a great number of people feel, and even people who have had exposure as she has and as I've had ... have had exposure to the financial services sector.  But the market sets these ... I'm not saying its right, but the market does set these rates and remuneration is generally tied to performance of the institution,  if not of the individual.</p></speech>

I had a long experience of Hungary going back to the 90s when I established an office for my communications consultancy in Budapest.  I knew the Hungarian people quite well; I had worked very closely with a number of people in a number of businesses in Hungary.  And I believed in the value of what the Hungarian people and the Hungarian state was attempting to do post its accession to the EU.  And I always maintained a strong interest there.<br/><br/>Far from approaching the project, in the way in which you have profiled it, the project was an investment, a proposed investment, of a significant amount of money by a number of people - a small number of people - in a development in an area of ... outside Budapest called  Pilismar&oacute;t, which is not an area where anybody lives, was wasteland, and which the mayor, who was, as it happens, an independent politician of left wing disposition, wanted to see development in order that his community would benefit from the introduction of something that he saw and members of the council saw as being a positive venture.  As with anything like that, and you people in this room will know and understand this better than I, there is always people ... or likely to be people who are not in favour.  The project was not bankrolled by Anglo Irish Bank.  There were no loans from Anglo Irish Bank.  And the emphasis you have placed on a particular media or medium, is one which was challenged at the time, as being incorrect and was, subsequently, not followed through on.  I mean by that the report, just to be clear, was not accurate in a great many respects.  So, the representation or presentation of me, in this case, as being somebody who behaved in a manner which was to disenfranchise people from areas of land which they rightfully, or rightly wanted to manage in a particular way against their wishes, was completely and utterly false - No. 1. <br/><br/>No. 2 - There was never a line of credit established between me and Anglo Irish Bank in that respect, which gives me the opportunity to, if I may, Chairman, just make one point of clarification.  In 2005, my business wanted to make an acquisition and we needed to raise &euro;1 million to make the acquisition.  And it was discussed at the board of my company and we decided to proceed and I said, &quot;I would like Anglo Irish Bank, as I'm a director of the bank, I would like Anglo Irish Bank to have the opportunity to tender for the business, but I cannot go and meet with and deal with and interact with the bank.&quot;  So my chairman, who had no connection with Anglo Irish Bank whatsoever, went to a number of ... two banks, one of which was Anglo, and a deal was done whereby Anglo became the lender to the business and that is ... I'm simply using that to emphasise the point that in my dealings, I attempted at all times to create an appropriate distance between me and other parties in respect of my directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.  The presentation in <i>The Mail</i>was ... let's put it this way, it was inaccurate and misleading.</p></speech>

I beg your pardon, 2005-2006, maybe ... it could have been as early as 2004, I had concerns about the amount of lending going into the hotel and leisure sector.  And we had, you know, quite a significant amount of lending in that sector and there was already a slowdown starting to percolate through to ... because, obviously, a hospitality sector tends to be the first to feel the sense of a cold wind.  And I remember raising that at committee and I remember discussing it with Pat Whelan who was the ... at that time, the head of risk and, as would have happened with Pat Whelan as head of risk, about a week later he rang me and asked me to come in and he had done a really thorough analysis of the area.  He had gone back and looked through everything and he had some issues to raise and there was progress made in respect of that over the following number of months.  I remember as well that, even though trading was a very small part of Anglo's portfolio of work, we had a problem with a trader on one occasion who had gone past his limits.  And there was a discussion about it and myself and a number of the other non-execs were asked our view and we said, "Well, look, you know, he needs to be given a warning", and it wasn't ... now, it wasn't ... he hadn't dramatically overshot his limits but, again, when ... at the next meeting ... or, I beg your pardon, not the next meeting, but within a number of months, it had happened again, and we made a decision at committee that-----</p></speech>

So if I was to name people who I recall that's, I think, not particularly ... you know, not fair or not reasonable.  I think the point I was making in describing it as I did this morning, Deputy, was this was something that had been in place for quite some time and the timing being ... the timing being what it was, you know, it was Brian Cowen who I had spoken to some time previously and as it happened, the way circumstances dictated, it fell that the opportunity was on the date it was.  And I was trying to create or establish, because it's the truth, that there was no ... you know, it ... we weren't asking for Brian Cowen to meet us at that particular time because we wanted to discuss things with him because actually ... and so we had had a statement like that about it-----</p></speech>

And when I joined in 2002 it so happened that I had been approached by Paddy Power to go on the board of its ... onto its board, excuse me.  And I had, as I referenced in answering Deputy O'Donnell earlier, I had a view that one stays ... does two three-year terms.  I mean, the standard is you're invited and asked and you're assessed as to whether you're up to the business, up to the job or not and you're given a three-year term and if you ... if you're half decent I think you tend to be asked to do a second three-year term.

Can I ask you, then, in relation to questions touched on by previous speakers, loans taken on by NAMA from Anglo?  Estimated that &euro;9 billion worth of interest roll-up loans were taken ... were transferred from five banks, &euro;3 billion relating to Anglo.  Were you aware of the level of interest roll-up included in Anglo's loan book?</p></speech>

However, I do think when we discuss roll-ups, we need to understand that the nature of Anglo's business meant that roll-ups in Anglo's case were going to be higher.  By definition, the nature of its business meant they were going to be higher than they would be for others.</p><p>I also think when we talk about &euro;9 billion, and five institutions, we're actually talking about, realistically we're talking about four, because EBS's percentage of the &euro;9 billion was, I think - I don't know what the percentage was but I think it was 0.1% .  And so the ... therefore, the amount of ... the total amount of the &euro;9 billion, the amount of that that Anglo held, perhaps, wasn't as stark as it might appear for those two reasons.  And I think when you're in development lending, which we ... which the bank was, you know, roll-ups is part and parcel of that business, and you know, business ... banks that are in the business today, that Anglo was in then, are doing roll-ups at that level right now, here and overseas.</p></speech>

And I also think that because ... I mean, Deputy Doherty asked me this earlier on, in terms of the small ... the percentage of the loan book that was in ... was ... related to a relatively small number of clients or customers.  And that was, you know, that can be argued either way, I guess, but that would have been seen as being, and the ... there would have been seen as an element of protection about that; that it was people we knew well; we knew that they would be able to move the land that they had bought from zoned to full planning and to being built and starting to generate very serious income-----</p></speech>

I know that executive directors have a particular responsibility, and non-execs, and you've explained and we are familiar with the limitations on the role of non-executive directors.  But in light of the fact that you were involved with the risk committee for years, you know, is ignorance of the existence of the letter a defence in that case?</p></speech>

And I think that sometimes to get the answer to the question, that now seems obvious, you know, what level of engagement have we had with the Financial Regulator?  Has the Financial Regulator written to you in the last month, two months, three months?  The only was of knowing, of my knowing that such a letter had issued from the Financial Regulator to senior people in Anglo, would have been for me to say at the end of a meeting, "By the way, has the Financial Regulator made contact with you or with any of your colleagues since our last meeting?"  And if I was chairing a risk committee today, would I ask such a question intermittently?  Absolutely.</p></speech>

But I go back to the central point here,  which is that when you are a non-executive director, you engage in a relationship with the executive team in any organisation and, particularly, I believe, in a bank, on the basis of ... that the people who are in there day in, day out, working hard and doing their job, are going to provide you with any information which is relative to and sensitive to the role that you have as, if you like, some form of guardian of the interest of the shareholders and protecting the interest of the company, or the bank.  And we know of other scenarios, and I have to be careful in what I say here, and again I would say I find it, you know, somewhat frustrating that I have to be as careful as I have to be.  But the situation being what it is, we know of other situations where the non-executives were not informed of information which, to elicit that information they would, on occasion, have had to ask questions that, quite frankly, had they asked them, people would have thought they were bonkers.</p></speech>

You've referred to the decision to combine the roles of the finance director and the chief risk officer, I think, once as problematic, and actually the first time you said it, it was a mistake.  What are your reasons for that point of view today?</p></speech>

I think that, unlike my answer to the question to Deputy Phelan, I do think that with the wisdom that there was around the board at the time that that decision was taken, there should have been a greater degree of caution, a greater degree of care expressed about the idea that somebody who was the finance director, therefore, overseeing every aspect of the financial management of this organisation, as it was growing, was responsible for a myriad of different tasks; leading the investor relations, but also leading the accounting, leading the audit, all of that - this was his, this is his task - and, obviously, overseeing the drive towards continued growth of the bank, that he would also be charged with the responsibility for overseeing risk.  And, as I said in ... and I want to restate, because it would be unfair not to, that is not a reflection on the individual involved who was a very capable person.  But those roles should be distinct, in terms of even the optics for an organisation to have somebody who is financial controller, financial director and the chief risk officer, was not the smartest decision, I think, that was made or overseen by the board.</p></speech>

He says:<blockquote><br /><br />At this time, Anglo's property-related exposure in Ireland, the UK and the US had grown very significantly, and the need to monitor and manage the attendant complexity and risk had grown proportionately.  This decision would suggest that risk management was not appropriately prioritised within the bank.</blockquote></p></speech>

So the extent to which we lacked an internal, robust source of risk assessment and external feedback is, I think, questionable because the external feedback was something which we did on a very regular basis.  I believe this committee must have seen extensive copies of minutes of the risk and compliance committee and of its work and I believe that all of that documentation illustrates or demonstrates the extent to which there was a very intensive assessment of what was going on.  It was clearly deficient in some respects, I mean ... there's ... again, I hope I haven't tried to avoid that fact, or come across as I'm avoiding that fact, but it was clearly deficient.

I mean relative to what we're dealing with here it was a relatively small issue, the details of which I don't remember.  But the regulator in Switzerland immediately made contact with a non-executive director of the board and elevated it to that point.  I think that the letters that we didn't see, or the correspondence - and I presume there's more than one letter but certainly the letter that you shared with me, I hadn't seen before.  That letter I would have thought two things.  One, when it landed wherever it landed in Anglo it should have been cc'd ... it should have been copied to the risk committee and I would have thought the other observation I'd make is that it should have been in the letter, it should have stated that we expect the board to be made aware of this.</p></speech>

One of the refreshing things about Brian Cowen, having worked with, as a consultant ... and it's probably important to put it on the record, having worked as a consultant with politicians from Fine Gael and the Labour Party over many years, in just as intense a manner in which I did with Brian Cowen or ... when he was Minister.  The relationship with Brian Cowen was such that we ... we talked about everything.  We talked about, you know ... except things that were, as far as I was concerned, and he was concerned, off limits.  And I've already made that point very clear, I think, to the committee.  So the discussions we'd have had would have been about family, would have been about sport.  One of the refreshing things about Brian Cowen, he was one of the few people in politics - and I'm conscious of where I am - who was as interested in my life and interested in my work as I was in his.  And so it was a very natural, normal relationship.</p></speech>

I was not a member of the nominations committee and I was asked by Peter Murray, as I recall, who was then chairman, to join the nominations committee for that particular appointment.  And I was happy to do so in the sense that I felt that I could add value.  I had had a good relationship with most of the senior executives in the bank.  I had no particular favourites, if you like, and I also had a view, which I had expressed at board, that the bank should consider outside appointees, which wasn't a view that was, you know, unanimously shared.  Some people had that view; others didn't, which is fine.  So the approach that we took was ... would stand up to scrutiny anywhere.  It was extremely thorough.  We had specialist consultants who worked with us on developing and refining the job spec, if you like, who also helped with us in drawing up a provisional list of possible candidates, if we were going to look outside the bank.  And over a period of months and a considerable amount of work, we went through a process whereby we assessed all of the possible candidates and made a decision to narrow it down to three, maybe two, and David Drumm won the race.

Okay, so you're essentially ... your question is saying, you're putting those two things together and you're saying there was, to use your word or term, an "apparatus", for the first one and there wasn't an "apparatus" for the second one, and should there have been?</p></speech>

Will he take my call?"  Okay?  And I said, "I don't know.  What do you want to talk to him about?"  And he told me what he wanted to talk him about.  I put a call through to Brian Cowen.  Brian Cowen did what he did and I believe 100% appropriately so, went through the appropriate channels and said ... and handled it in the manner in which he did.

I don't know precisely.  I know I was away, so I think it was probably mid, sort of second week of September, I think.  And what I did was, because I didn't have a relationship with Brian Lenihan at all, but I contacted Cathy Herbert and I basically handed the request to her as the person appropriate, I felt, to deal with the request.  And that was the extent of it.  And important to fill out the answer, I did have a phone call in the week of what turned out to be the guarantee, I had a phone call from the chief executive of the bank, of Anglo Irish Bank, and he asked my advice on something and I suggested to him that I couldn't really advise him but I suggested a course of action.  And I think the Chairman would understand why I am being somewhat obtuse, which I have tried to avoid.  But I suggested a course of action that he should take.  I was not aware at all of, you know, anything that was going on in respect of the machinations within Government.</p></speech>

Thank you very much, Senator, I am going to move to wrap things up.  Mr. Drury, in doing so, can I just put one question to you myself and then I'll invite the leads in subsequently.  Mr. Drury, your testimony of this afternoon would indicate that you were unfamiliar or not aware of the following: key concerns expressed by the Financial Regulator about commercial property lending activities, the levels of exceptions of lending policies, the experience needed to manage a fast-growing monoline bank such as Anglo, broader implications of the rapid growth in lending and profits of Anglo, implications of lending to such a concentrated number of developers, the extent of breaches in regulatory sectoral lending limits, the extent of interest roll-up within the Anglo loan book, the implications of combining the roles of CRO and financial director.  Mr. Drumm, or sorry, Mr. Drury, my apologies.  Mr. Drury, can I ask you to explain to this committee what role and purpose did you provide for Anglo?</p></speech>

And in that context, I feel that I contributed very well as a non-executive director.  I was somebody who understood what the bank was trying to achieve, who understood the ambition of the bank, who understood the need to balance growth with control and I think that the issue around my suitability really in some people's minds relates to question of my chairmanship of the risk committee and my role on the risk committee.  And I think in that respect, I would say ... make the following points, Chairman.  No. 1, when I assumed the position as chairman of the risk committee, I had served five years on the risk committee at that point.  So I had a ... a strong understanding of the risk management function, how it worked and how the risk committee worked.  I think that the second point is that at that time, I said very clearly to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick that I would like the composition of the risk committee to be changed in order that there would be high-quality financial people on the committee with me and in that sense, Ned Sullivan, who had been chairman of the audit committee for four, maybe six years prior to that, he became a member of the risk committee.  No&euml;l Harwerth, who was chief operations officer of Citigroup, she became a member of the committee and Lar Bradshaw, who was former managing partner of McKinsey, became a member of the committee.  And my job was also, I think, to be seen in the context of I had been chairman of Paddy Power plc for a considerable period of time- almost six years by then.  Over that time and Paddy Power you know, may seem like a very different business.  But in many respects, the work that a company like Paddy Power does in the gambling industry is very, very significantly layered with risk and the management of risk.  And in that respect, my experience as chairman of Paddy Power of the board of Paddy Power overseeing significant growth in the market capitalisation of Paddy Power, overseeing the appointment of a new chief executive, I think made me suited to the position as chairman of the risk committee.  I accept fully, the points that you have made in summary, harsh and all as they may appear.  What I have been attempting to do in my testimony to your committee, Chairman, is ... is to account for what I could account for.  And as I said in my opening remarks, if I cannot give an answer, I will say so.</p><p>I do think that the remarks that you have made are unfair in the context of somebody who was chairman and a member of a risk committee and a member of a board of directors who was compromised by the fact that there was a significant amount of information which we ... which was not shared with us.  It may not have been significant in terms of the quantum, but it was certainly - and the evidence is there now - it was certainly significant in respect of its import.  And I do think that I was equally compromised by the fact that I have had to give evidence today in circumstances where there are acute sensitivities around what I can say about individuals, or even groups of individuals, not naming people.  I was told in advance of coming in to give testimony today that I couldn't even talk about "the leadership of the institution".  And if that is the case then to-----</p></speech>

And so in April 2004 Pat Whelan, who is the head of group risk, writes a memo, in which he notes that development exposure has increased from the guideline limit of 15% of the total loan book to about 21%, and there's a need to agree a strategy to reduce the exposure.  Was any strategy agreed to reduce the exposure, from your recollection?</p></speech>

I ... you know, 2004 is 11 years ago.  I saw the document four weeks ago.  I'm in ... you know, I'm prohibited from showing the document, sharing the contents of the document, quite correctly, with any third party.

And, I think that we would have gained some succour from where the bulk of the money was being invested rather than the ... rather than the reverse.  But I, I take the point, looking at it now, that the spread, even, albeit that the ... the bulk of it was in, in parts of the country which were more-----</p></speech>

Okay.  Can you ... can I talk to you about, going back to the issue in, in relation to Druids Glen, and, prior to your evidence it would have been my impression the narrative was that - and the witnesses before us didn't correct that narrative, but weren't questioned on it - that it was a round of golf, dinner and discussions but now it's clear that there was a private meeting prior to that.  In, in Mr. Cowen's testimony to this ... to this committee, he referenced a point where he says, "it was out in the open in a foyer of [the] Druids Glen golf club in full public view", we can only assume he was dealing with the second part of it and not the private meeting that we now know happened upstairs or in some room off the foyer, or, or somewhere out there.  Can I ask you, in relation to your organisation of that event-----</p></speech>

Brian Cowen was going, and understood he was going, to have a round of golf - how many holes is still questionable - with yourself and Se&aacute;nie FitzPatrick.  You decided to have a private meeting with five individuals, then go for a round of golf, which takes, if it's nine holes, about two hours, and then continue the meeting afterwards, at a later stage over, over dinner or tea.  Does it seem as if that's not the best way to organise a meeting?  Usually, if I were to do it, I would organise the golf beforehand or afterwards.  But, you decided to put the golf, which would leave a number of your participants sitting, waiting for you to come in from the, the ninth hole or the 18th hole, depending how far you got.</p></speech>

I wasn't particularly concerned about the organisational element of it.  It was a factor of what was possible.  It was ... the principal reason for getting together was to have a discussion around the issues that I've already referenced in answer to, to Senator O'Keeffe's question, the kind of issues that, that Alan Gray had tabled in, in the agenda of items that we wanted to cover.  That was the principal purpose ... was, however people may view the individuals who had been gathered, and whatever perception people may have those ... have of those individuals, the, the intention was that the Taoiseach would be able to draw down on their views, their expertise, across a number of key issues facing him, in terms of the economy at that point.  And, the game of golf was very much a, kind of ... I wouldn't say an afterthought, because it was all stitched together, but the game of golf was purely to get him out for a bit of fresh air, and then we would reconvene over dinner.  It didn't ... it didn't discommode those who weren't golfers, because they went away for a few hours and did something.  And they knew in advance that was ... what was happening.  So, I'm not really sure that I can enlighten you any further, other than what I've said already, in respect of this, now infamous, event.</p></speech>

Yes, he did.  "Did he discuss with you what was discussed?"  Yes, he did.  I did not know, until you've just said what you said, Deputy, what Bertie Ahern's account was of what Brian Cowen and he had discussed on that ... at that meeting.  I was not at that meeting.  When I spoke to Brian Cowen, Brian Cowen spoke with me and told me that he had met with Bertie Ahern at his house, and what had been discussed.  That was never referenced.  The first I heard of it, truthfully ... and if I had heard Bertie Ahern's testimony, and I was saying everything I have said so far to this committee today, I couldn't have said, as, as I did, to Deputy ... I beg your pardon, to Senator O'Keeffe, that, you know, Brian Cowen told me what they had discussed.  In other words, what I am saying to you, as, as clearly as I can, is that, in my conversation with Brian Cowen about what he had discussed with Bertie Ahern on that particular evening or day, there was absolutely no reference to the things that you have said Bertie Ahern gave in testimony to this committee.

The Irish Government, the Administration and the regulatory systems did not have the tools that were required to deal with the combination of circumstances and problems that faced them.  Prior to September 2008, there had been discussions about the nature of a possible bank guarantee and a framework of draft legislation for bank nationalisation had been prepared.  There was no legislative provision for a bank resolution system until the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act of 2010.  Apart from the credit institutions winding-up directive of 2001, no bank resolution system was in place in the eurozone.  The eurozone implemented the single supervisory mechanism in 2013 and the single resolution mechanism, which is intended to deal with future bank resolution requirements, will come into effect at the beginning of next year.  Prior to the Irish bank guarantee in September of 2008, the UK had dealt with the Northern Rock and the Bradford and Bingley cases.  The Irish Government, prior to that, had gone through a dispute with the German Government on the question of which of them had responsibility for the Depfa affair.  That was resolved by the German Government having to take responsibility for it.<br/><br/>Ireland was the first eurozone member to find itself obliged to take action.  And I think it's fair to say that any action in an area like this by a first mover was bound to be controversial and, indeed, by definition, unprecedented.  Other countries followed.  Germany had to take action about Landesbanks, an issue that is still the subject of ongoing work in Germany.  France, Belgium and the Netherlands had to take joint action to deal with the problem in Fortis bank.  Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Cyprus all had to take action and Latvia found itself obliged to take action in this area, in fact before it joined the eurozone.  Of the early movers, I think its fair to say that the action taken by Ireland was the most comprehensive of any.  Indeed, I think it was probably to our disadvantage that the Irish Government at the time made it very clear that it was dealing with the whole banking system.  Other countries took action that was virtually as wide in its effect but they didn't have to say they were dealing with their whole banking system.<br/><br/>Retrospectively, it has been suggested that once the burning of bondholders was ruled out, the options available to the Government in September of 2008 were, first, a blanket guarantee, accompanied by nationalisation of the entire banking system; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank; or a blanket guarantee, accompanied by the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank; or, the liquidation of Anglo, accompanied by what's been described as a &quot;political guarantee&quot; for the rest of the system.  In the event, the course of action that was adopted was a blanket guarantee, followed shortly afterwards - within a few months - by the nationalisation of Anglo and AIB and a partial nationalisation of the Bank of Ireland.<br/><br/>The evidence available is to the effect that the European Central Bank, some eurozone partners and some US authorities, made it clear that repudiation of bondholders would have serious, if unspecified, negative consequences.  Relatively little attention has been paid to the fact that the repudiation of senior bondholders would, as a result of the <i>pari passu</i>treatment convention, have had very serious repercussions for depositors with deposits of over &euro;100,000.  These repercussions would have affected individual depositors, corporate depositors and other banks - both Irish and non-Irish banks.  In his evidence to this committee on the 15th of this month, Mr. Paul Gallagher, who was Attorney General at the time, said of the relative positions of depositors and senior bondholders, and I quote, &quot;The law at that stage was that they ranked equally&quot;.</p><p>Liquidation of Anglo in September 2008 would have had, I think, the following consequences,<i>inter alia</i>: first, a draw on Government funds to cover the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee - Anglo was largely illiquid at the time - or measures to move the Anglo deposit book to another institution, which would have been a fairly complex exercise.  It was done later and it wasn't a simple exercise to carry out.  Other consequences would have been litigation issues arising from the absence of banking resolution legislation at the time.  And the need for some type of vehicle to realise the banks assets in order to avoid the contagion effects on other banks of calling in outstanding loans on the Anglo books, including many cases where borrowers from Anglo were also borrowers from other banks in the system.  NAMA didn't exist at the time, and I think it's fairly clear that any transfer of the loan book of Anglo to any other institution would immediately have spread the contagion to those other institutions.  On the face of it, that would have been a much more complicated procedure than the one actually adopted.  Again, in evidence given on the 15th of this month by Paul Gallagher, we find the statement that at the time, &quot;It was quite clear to everybody that you couldn't take the risk of winding down a bank, in whatever fashion.&quot;<br/><br/>Liquidation of Anglo would, in my view, have cast very serious doubt on any political guarantee that might have been ... that might have accompanied it, particularly given the fact that the liquidation of Anglo would have required ... would have inevitably had a contagion effects on the other banks.  And I think if there's need for any further illustration of the difficulties that would have accompanied a liquidation of Anglo at the time, I think we just have to look at what's happened since February of 2013.  In that liquidation, which involved a very much smaller outstanding volume of loans - I think about &euro;15 billion net - two and a half years later, the process has still not concluded.  And that's not in any sense a criticism of the liquidators; I'm sure they're doing as much as they can.  But I think that gives some indication ... a small indication of what the difficulties would have been of a liquidation in 2008.  I have to say that, having listened, debated, worked over the period since September 2008 up to date, that had I been in the position of the Government of the day at the time, with the knowledge, or the lack of knowledge that they have, I don't think I would have done anything very different.  <br/><br/>By the time that I was appointed to the board of Anglo Irish Bank in November 2008, that bank, and the other Irish banks, had greatly exceeded every prudential limit in terms of the concentration of lending by sector and by client.  It was very clear that they had already, at that stage, found themselves in a very, very high risk position.  This had happened under the noses of the regulators, who had access to all the information required to arrive at that conclusion.  I don't know whether the failure to appreciate this can be ascribed to role confusion in the then bicephalous regulatory structure, or through any lack of capacity.  Immediately after nationalisation, the Anglo board ... the new Anglo board set in train a detailed review of the banks provisioning policy.  We commissioned an independent external review of the methodology, and, on 15 April 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement at that point was in excess of &euro;4 billion, rather than the &euro;1.5 billion that the Department had in mind at that point, with a very substantial downside risk from any further deterioration in property prices.  And I don't think I need to remind the committee that property prices had been falling from some point in 2007.  That fall actually accelerated very substantially in January 2009 and from then out.  So, in mid-April of 2009, we informed the Department of Finance that the recapitalisation requirement for Anglo, as it was at the time, was in the region of &euro;4 billion, with, as I say, a very substantial downside risk from further deterioration in property prices.</p><p>That was clearly unwelcome news which also had substantial implications for the other guaranteed institutions.  When we conveyed that the Department of Finance itself commissioned a separate study, to the best of my recollection by PwC, and that came to a conclusion broadly similar to the one that we had arrived at in Anglo.  I have to confess, a Chathaoirligh, that I was a little taken aback to hear the second secretary of the Department of Finance say recently in the course of her evidence to this committee, "Anglo surprised on the downside every time you looked at it."  The Department should not have been surprised since a very clear warning had been given in April of 2009.  I don't know whether the warning was understood or not.</p><p> Were the banks, including Anglo, insolvent in September of 2008?  That has been a question that has exercised minds.  I frankly don't know what the answer to it is, but my guess is that if the exercise had been carried out at the point when the guarantee was given, that Anglo would probably have proven to be solvent at the time on the basis of what was known, and the other banks I think would certainly have been.  That situation changed, it deteriorated as I've said, very rapidly over 2009 and continued to deteriorate for some time after that.</p><p> The then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan TD, came to the view early in 2009 that the staff resources in the Department of Finance were inadequate to deal with the issues facing it and personnel were drafted in from the National Treasury Management Agency.  I have to say, a Chathaoirligh, that that body's very considerable expertise lies in treasury management, not in securing repayment from borrowers, which is a different function.  Difficulties inevitably followed when staff of the Department, of the NTMA came to deal with issues of bank restructuring and dealing with externally recruited persons who had specific skills and a lot of experience in the area of restructuring.</p><p> The then head of banking in the Department of Finance proposed to me in 2011 that Anglo should be run, "as a subsidiary of the Department of Finance".  That proposal was a non-starter in terms of governance and prudence but unfortunately the bank's rejection of that negatively influenced the relationship with the Department.  And that problem was further compounded by the bank's later rejection of a suggestion made in a report commissioned by the Department of Finance from McKinsey's, a suggestion that the functions of chief financial officer and chief risk officer be combined.  The combination of those two functions in the bank in 2007 was identified by the Nyberg report as one of the deficiencies in the bank's structure and risk management system - and the committee had some discussions with a previous witness this afternoon on that issue.</p><p> Notwithstanding all of that rejection of that proposal - which we regarded as very, extremely unwise - the rejection of that proposal by the bank was seen by the Department of Finance as yet another example of obduracy on the part of the bank.  I have to say that a difficulty that continued throughout that period arose from what seemed to me to be an entirely inadequate appreciation by the Department of Finance of the role and obligations of the bank as a separate company set up by statute with all the duties that that implies under company law, and the duties and obligations of a regulated entity.  It was required, and this was indeed acknowledged, in the first relationship framework to operate at arm's length from the Minister for Finance for very solid prudential reasons.  And as I point out in the statement I submitted to the committee, I take issue with the current second secretary of the Department of Finance who observed to the Public Accounts Committee that that arm's-length requirement changed in some way when the bank was put into wind-down mode in 2011.  To my mind, and to our minds jointly in the board of management of the bank, the wind-down mode did not in any way affect the necessity for the arm's-length relationship for the prudential protection of the Minister and of the State.</p><p> On a more general note, I have to say that since the onset of this crisis both the Eurogroup and the European Union authorities have been, I must say politely, dilatory in their approach to all of this and have only gradually recognised and attempted to get to grips with the flaws of the architecture of EMU.  I think that's well illustrated by the fact that the crisis really began in 2007, the single supervisory mechanism came into effect at the beginning of 2014.  I think that's an extremely slow pace of reaction to one of the most difficult crises we've had to deal with.</p><p> Having said that, I believe that against this very difficult and confused background, the Irish authorities have dealt extremely well with the macro-level consequences of the 2008 bank guarantee and the challenges of resolving highly distressed bank assets.  And in that regard, I think NAMA has performed extremely well, and indeed the performance of all of the banks in dealing with the greater part of the distressed assets has, I think, been rather good.  I'm not sure that I would have the same level of comfort about their mortgage books but that's perhaps something we could get into at a later stage.  Apart from the Central Bank, it's my belief that the authorities here did not have the skills to micro-manage banks and should not have attempted to do so in any case.  And I have to say that the Department of Finance frequently seemed to adopt a defensive and hostile approach to outsiders who were recruited for their specific skills that they brought in.  Following the liquidation of IBRC in February of 2013, the directors produced a statement of affairs as required by the legislation.  This showed that, on the basis of the balance sheet, and the support measures in place up to the moment of liquidation, the bank was solvent.  The joint special liquidators are reported to believe, or to expect that on completion of their functions, there will be a surplus of something in excess of &euro;1 billion for distribution to unsecured creditors.  The Governor of the Central Bank forecast that that institution will make an appreciable profit of several billion euro from its participation in the funding and the payment flows associated with the bank bailout process, much of which, of course, was associated with operations concerning Anglo and IBRC, and NAMA expects to return a surplus at the end of its operations.</p><p> The combined effect of those factors will produce a useful mitigation of what will still be a very large final cost to the State, of the banking crisis.  Together with my colleagues of the board of management of IBRC, I'm happy to have been able to contribute constructively to the mitigation of that cost.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

As you know, I came to Ireland in September '09.  I definitely had the view when I arrived, based on what I'd been told and what was available publicly, that there was a big job to be done here.  I had no idea that it would quickly become known as the most toxic bank in Europe.  By the time of my arrival of course, the decision to establish NAMA had been made and you will recall that there was a number of 20%, in about mid-2009, being referred to as the likely NAMA haircut estimate across the industry.  I've been involved in difficult situations previously, I knew that this was likely to be a light number.  I knew that the full extent of the falling markets was not at that stage apparent, and we would see further deterioration, but I didn't expect the free-fall to continue as it did.  By the end of 2009, the haircut was estimated at around 30% and, of course, right through 2010 it increased dramatically to the point where by the time all of the calculations were done, the industry average was around 58%.</p><p>For Anglo Irish Bank, this was devastating, as it was for the rest of the industry.  It produced a loss on transfer of assets to NAMA of &euro;21 billion.  And that &euro;21 billion loss on NAMA assets, that was a 62% haircut on &euro;33.9 billion of assets eventually transferred.  Of course, that 72% of the overall &euro;29.3 billion of State funding required to support Anglo and that's ... it's interesting to contrast that &euro;29.3 with the original &euro;1.5 estimate, just prior to the point of nationalisation.  Now, of course, the loans that remained in the banks, they were a mix of good loans but also of distressed and non-performing loans that didn't qualify for transfers.  So, the difference ... the other &euro;8.3 billion of money that went in, went to offset provisions on those loans and also to recapitalise the bank ... put it in a position to maintain its regulatory capital thresholds.  </p><p> Internally, what I expected to find at the bank was the requirement to fundamentally restructure the organisation.  I knew that that would be necessary, given past experience I'd had.  I knew that there had been a substantial dislocation in the markets and that that pointed to a long period of uncertainty and that there would be a need for very, very careful management of the distressed loan portfolio.  While the extent of the downturn was still very uncertain at that point, it seemed crystal clear that it wasn't just a cyclical aberration in markets; it was a structural change, and that was driven, primarily, by the global financial crisis and the collapse of the global funding markets. </p><p> So the business at Anglo needed to be restructured.  People there were focused on growing and lending and the mindset of the lending banker needed to be changed.  It needed to be changed quickly and it needed to be changed to, what you could refer to, as the mindset of a restructuring banker rather than a lending banker.  We assembled a management team, which, I think, collectively was capable of addressing any issue that was put before it in the bank.  The Minister for Finance, at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, specifically requested that the senior people hired should be unblemished and not have been associated with the Irish banking scene or involved in any way in the global financial crisis.  The new team included specialists in corporate finance, debt restructuring and insolvency, as well as debt capital markets, balance sheet and capital management, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, finance, legal compliance and control in an environment wherein the management capacity and the mix assembled was equally applicable to a bank in full wind-down as it was to a bank going through a major restructure.  </p><p> The work to transform Anglo-INBS - on merger, IBRC - into a fit-for-purpose vehicle was extensive and required essentially a rebuild of, not only the client relationship management functions, but also the governance risk management and control activities from the ground up.  This had to be a progressive process, as markets were deteriorating rapidly and due attention to the immediate loan portfolio problems was critical.  It was a difficult process, as the loan book at Anglo was characterised by a lack of thorough management information, poorly perfected security - in some cases, absent - and a need to retain and supplement the management teams themselves.  Timeframes set by commitments to the European Commission needed to be respected and progress was desirable in the identification of management of a significant number of legacy issues.  In both my main and supplementary statements to the inquiry, I've referred to a number of times to difficult aspects of the interaction between the bank and the Department over the period from nationalisation to liquidation.  I remain of the view that most of the conflicts could have been avoided if there was a better understanding in the Department of the constraints the bank was under in complying with the various requirements it was subject to and the legal and prudential need for the bank to act independently.  The bank was governed by the Anglo Act and as well as an associated relationship framework that required ongoing separation from the Minister and his nominees.  In conducting interactions, there were often complex considerations required across multiple dimensions.  These included, not only the regulatory obligations, but many others in managing the ordinary course of business, which referenced many possible overlapping areas such as the public interest dimension, the management of legacy issues, the management of stressed loans, the management of very large exposures, as well as the number of other relevant legal considerations.</p><p>Importantly, the bank needed to be on top of all associated technical and commercial aspects and be aware of any potential dangers involved to both the bank and the Minister should the separation not be respected.  Unfortunately, this ran against the grain of what became the preferred position of the Department from March 2011-----</p></speech>

This included management through a period of unprecedented market turmoil whilst dealing with multiple high-profile legacy issues.  It included building a new leadership team and driving significant changes in the broader organisation, including overhauling of risk functions and establishing new governance and control processes.  It included conducting a thorough due diligence of NAMA bound and post-NAMA loan portfolios to identify the true quality and value of the underlying assets, establishing asset and loan recovery strategies and setting up specialist work-out units to proactively resolve distressed loans, maximise recovery and, where appropriate, restructuring loans so as strengthen and improve asset quality.</p> <p>  The bank was also involved in supporting the Irish authorities' and the international authorities' broader restructuring of the bank and the Irish banking landscape.  This work was central to the task of working through multiple alternative paths which ultimately led to the ... Anglo and INBS being placed into wind down.  And, of course, we have successfully ... we have successfully executed the acquisition of INBS and downsized the total asset portfolios from pre ... pre-crisis highs of over &euro;100 billion plus to some ... in total assets to a point where the net loan levels were around the &euro;15 billion mark at the point of special liquidation.  This included the sale of the substantial US-based loan portfolio in what was the largest single open market sale in the USA since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>  In summary, I feel fortunate to have worked in Ireland during the challenging period and to have been associated with a world-class team consisting of a very talented ... board and management team.  If I have any immediate concern about what went on during the period, it is simply that I'm not certain that all valuable lessons have being learned with regard to the need to separate banking policy and operations functions within the State.  My experience with the Department of Finance makes me worry that it is likely that the Department will not only continue to direct banking policy but also look to take an active role in directing operations and the regulatory function.  In part, this approach was a significant contributor to the breakdown of the banking sector in Ireland.</p> <p>  As Ireland continues to move forward in its recovery, I wish it well and hope the outcomes of this banking inquiry and the very important work you're doing can productively be used to safeguard the sustainability of the financial sector for the future.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Sorry for holding you up.  We only have 15 minutes so I ... I'd encourage you to be as brief maybe in your responses as you can.  I'll try and be as brief as I can in asking the questions.  A gentle one first, Mr. Aynsley, for you.  In your opinion, what were the main weaknesses in the Anglo business model ... in the years prior ... prior to nationalisation ... particular reference to corporate governance, maybe, and to the ... the overall business structure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-30a.992" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Aynsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015073000002#MMM00600"><p>Yes, there were many.  The ... at the ... at the board governance level ... I ... I think the board governance level was weak.  One of the aspects that was brought to my attention early on was the fact that there were sometimes two board meetings with ... small number of board members meeting and deciding on things and then having a larger group meeting and ... and pushing things through.  The committee structures I don't think worked as effectively as they could have.  There were a small number of people in the organisation responsible for very large decisions.</p><p>The reporting frameworks I don't think were particularly detailed or complex and certainly not framed, in my view, in a way that properly informed the board of the risks and the activities that were being undertaken in the bank.  Risk management, I think, seemed to be a process that the organisation went through just simply to say that they'd gone through a process to approve lending transactions and ... I sort of recall one of my first meetings with the chief risk officer at the time of my arrival.  He was an incumbent chief risk officer who had been at the bank for many years and he'd been at the front end of the lending business.  And he described it as a role that he was put in because he started to question some of the transactions that were being done and they sort of banished him to the risk area where in, in his words, he was classed as a second-class citizen.  So, you know, I think the ... the governance and the risk management and controls would be the key ones ... but it also gets down to just the embedded culture at the front end of the business and the thoughts that ... thought processes and mindset of the people going out and doing transactions.  </p><p> Another good example, and of course a ... a foreigner coming to town, particularly an Australian coming to down ... to town, the local Australian embassy here ... I am here and they invite me out there one night.  So the first ... first night I went out there for a dinner, there's a whole group of people.  I ... I don't know anyone there, and this fellow came up to me, who will remain unnamed, and he says, "I love Anglo."  He said, "I'm glad you're here." An Aussie.  "I just love Anglo."  So I ... okay ... talk to me, and he said, "You know, I've been buying properties, investing in properties, for a long time".  And he said, "I don't know how they found out about it but I was at an auction one morning and a fellow came up and he handed me an envelope, and it was an Anglo Irish Bank envelope, and I opened it up, and there was a cheque inside, which represented slightly more than what the deposit would be and it says ... a note attached saying, 'Just in case you need the deposit'.".  So, you know, this is the mindset at the time.  It was to go out there at all costs, find ways to go out there and grow the loan book and lend.</p></speech>

You know, the country was in a lot of trouble and, you know, I sort of took the view that I was just going to work through it but, you know, I have to say, you know, at times I ... I would get fed up with it.  I would have said to the chairman, you know, "Chairman, tell me, do you want me to stay around?"  You know?  But, you know, I think ...

I want to turn, because time is moving on, to Mr. Dukes and a couple of questions that I wish to ask him also.  Could I ask you, Mr. Dukes, could you briefly describe the prevailing culture again that you encountered when you were first appointed as a public interest director on the board of Anglo in December or, I think you said, November 2008?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-30a.999" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Dukes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015073000002#NNN00700"><p>Yes, well, I have to say that the prevailing culture didn't prevail for very long because very shortly after I was appointed, the chairman or the chief executive resigned and shortly after that, the bank was nationalised.</p><p>All of the previous board resigned with the exception of one who became the executive chairman.  He'd been on the board for only a short time before that.  </p><p> Looking back over the picture as it was then, a few things struck me very, very forcibly in addition to what Mike Aynsley has said.  Anglo developed a reputation.  I knew Anglo when it was a very young bank.  I had some dealings with them and it was a business bank and it struck me as being a very progressive and active outfit doing business lending.  It went into property then, as you know, in a large way.  It was successful and grew rapidly in the property sector in Ireland and looking at it from the outside, it seemed to me they had decided to diversify so they went and got into the property sector in the UK and grew very rapidly.  Then they decided again to diversify and they went and did the same thing in the United States.  So here we had a bank that was rapidly becoming a monoline with the same kind of risk in three jurisdictions.  Now I know they had some other operations in Austria and in Germany but they weren't hugely material in terms of the total.</p><p> So there was a very great concentration of risk there.  It developed, and they were very proud of it, I think, this kind of system of what they called relationship banking, which was that, and this was part of their picture, they knew their clients very well, they could rely on a relationship with their clients and they knew their clients well enough to know when they could be confident that this was a good loan or this other one wasn't, which resulted in a situation where, as was explained this afternoon at one point, 6% of the loan book constituted loans for land in Ireland on which there was no zoning.  Now that to me indicated much more than a prudent appetite for risk and it indicated a failure to appreciate the dangers of the kind of concentration that they had.  That was a concentration by sector and then when after ... immediately after nationalisation, we began to look through the loan book and tried to figure out what relationship banking was all about, it became apparent very quickly, and I have dealt with this in my statement, that it took quite a lot of time to find out just where the exposures were or what the level of exposure was to given borrowers.  You would find a case where a given borrower ... there was a large exposure to the person in a particular project and then you'd find if you followed the threads through, there were other exposures to the same borrower and in fact-----</p></speech>

They nationalised it, which I think was a rational thing to do.  And we had a relationship framework that was drawn up and it set out the concern of separation of the bank, which was a risky operation, from the State, which wanted to avoid risk to the extent that it could.  And having done that, the Government decided they didn't trust the people that they had entrusted with this job of doing it.  And that then was compounded by the fact that two key proposals were made to the bank at different times, one about the head of banking in the Department of Finance being on the board who would, in my view, have been seriously conflicted, and it did not seem to me that that was in any way a runner ... that was badly ... the rejection of that was badly received.</p><p>And then the other point ... at a later stage, where it was suggested, on the basis of a report which was not shared with the bank ... we never saw that McKinsey report but one recommendation from it was to recombine the functions of chief financial officer and chief risk officer in a very risky bank where we were very concerned about protecting the State from the consequences of a default on the part of the bank or a cessation of business where it was absolutely the wrong thing to do - to mix the risk function with the finance function.</p></speech>

Now, we resisted those two proposals and we were regarded as being stubborn, obdurate, unresponsive in doing that, where we felt we were doing the job we were properly charged to do and that was, maximise return for the State and keep the risk down as far as possible.  So, I mean, that, kind of ... current.  Now, I have to say that if you look at the relationship framework ... the two versions - the first one we had in 2009 and the second one that was there in 2012 - if you parse and analyse through those, the relationship framework say this should be operated at arm's length from the Minister, except where the Minister decides to do it otherwise.  And there was always a conflict there, so there was always going to be unease in that relationship.  And, finally, I know you want to be brief, I have to say - and I say this in all sincerity - I watched the evidence given to this committee by the current second secretary of the Department of Finance and if she and other officials in the Department of Finance had been as forthcoming with us about their state of mind through those years as they were with this committee, we wouldn't have had half the difficulties we actually had.</p></speech>

I'd known him for quite some time and we had a good relationship and he asked me if I would agree to be considered as one of those 12 people.

I'd like to welcome Mr. Dukes and Mr. Aynsley and if I can start with you, Mr. Dukes, and take you to the decision in February 2013 to liquidate the bank.  Can I ask your view now of that decision and whether you believe that greater value would have been achieved for the State if the orderly wind-down of the bank as decided previously, if that had been implemented instead of a liquidation?</p></speech>

There's another commission of investigation coming down the tracks.<br/><br/>The decision to liquidate in February 2013 was motivated, and this is on the record of the D&aacute;il, by a concern with dealing with the cost of the promissory note that had supported the bank for some time before that.  I described the decision at the time as an astute piece of financial engineering, which I think it was.  I feel vindicated in that view by the fact that the current second secretary of the Department of Finance has used the same phrase, I think, in evidence to this committee.  I think it was an astute piece of financial engineering and it's part of what I meant in my opening statement when I said that the State seemed to have dealt very well with the macroeconomic fall-out from the decision in the first place.<br/><br/>I think, and there will be other people who can give a different view on this, I think that had the bank not been liquidated, given the market conditions as they changed, you know, through 2013 up to today, I think it's possible to speculate that we might have made an even better return from the remaining assets of the bank if it hadn't been, in the course of being disposed of, in a liquidation but that has to be speculation.  Having said that, as far as I can see, the special liquidators are doing an extremely good job.  I don't know when they'll have concluded their work but it must be pretty soon.</p></speech>

The discount in the end was 61%, almost &euro;21 billion of a loss crystallised immediately onto the books of Anglo-IBRC.  Can you just clarify in terms of the valuations placed on those loans by NAMA, was the bank in a position to challenge any of those valuations or was it a very structured rigid process which resulted in such a large discount being applied?</p></speech>

NAMA decided what the valuation was and that was that, and that's the way the legislation was written.  Where it was open to discussion, and I'm open to correction on this, where it was open to discussion was whether or not a given loan or relationship actually qualified under the terms of what should be transferred to NAMA and there were some discussions about that.  There was a point when the chief executive of NAMA expressed the view that Anglo was not being very frank with NAMA in terms of the valuations, the presentation of the loans.  That, I think, was due to a misunderstanding.  What is the case is that there was still, at the time in 2010 particularly, and we saw it later, there were difficulties, which Mike Aynsley referred to in his opening remarks, with some of the documentation underlying some of these loans, I mean title and so on-----</p></speech>

And we took a view very early on that everything that we did in terms of the loan recovery process and the ... in particular, loan sales, needed to be within a proper process, and that process needed to be open; it needed to be transparent; it needed to involve multiple parties, multiple bidders.  And there were different ways of constructing sale processes and bidding processes but they were always constructed in ways which ensured that the correct oversight and diligence was conducted around every aspect, whether that was internally or externally or around the individual parties.  So for us to enter into bilateral processes and to say "Okay, well, we'll just ... this guy's interested.  He's knocked on our door" and move to the point where we negotiate a price for something that we just weren't interested in.  And we feel that if we had gone down that pass ... path, it certainly wouldn't have maximised our main metric, which was the value of the loans recovered.</p></speech>

Whether that was a rogue view of an individual in the Department, one can't be sure.  I have to say, I frequently had the impression that information that we transmitted to the Department didn't percolate all the way through.  You know, it maybe didn't percolate all the way through to where it should.  And a second comment about a sales processes: we were very concerned at all points to ensure we got maximum value, which is how we designed the processes but there was, from time to time, a suggestion that we should do it differently.  For example, I was urged at one point by an official to speed up sales of various performing assets, whereas, as I say in my statement, we tended to take the view that if there was a loan that was performing, meeting all of its requirements and covenants and it was going to mature within the wind-down period of the bank, there wasn't a good reason to go and try to terminate that early, although this was what was being urged.</p><p>And when I asked the person in question why on earth we'd want to do that ... because if we had a performing loan and the borrower was meeting all the covenants the only way we could persuade the borrower to pay off the loan early would be to put some incentive on the table, which meant we would be getting less out of it than we otherwise would.  But, you know, there was a view, sometimes expressed by some people in the Department, that if there was a good loan there, we should take the money and run, you know, force a refinancing or a sale on the basis that, you know, there was a time value of money and that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, whereas we took a different view that we had to look at recoveries over the whole period and, in addition, if you had a performing loan that was paying, it was making a contribution on a continuing basis to the running costs of the bank.  </p></speech>

This is maybe trespassing on some other question.  It was decided in 2011 that we should wind down the bank over ten years - maximum recovery for the State and maximum avoidance of risk, if you like.  The actual outline proposal for the pace of the wind-down was one which the bank proposed.  I proposed it at a meeting with the relevant authorities and it was accepted.  I made the point, at that stage, that we could probably do a more rapid wind-down with not a very much bigger risk of execution and I was told, at that point, "No, do not propose that."  And I assumed, and I think I was probably right in assuming this, that the authorities did not want to be corralled into a wind-down process that might be faster than we could actually deliver so we agreed on an outline wind-down proposal, what we called, in our own internal jargon, "the blue bars", which were the declining outstanding loan values in each year.  But, from time to time, we would be urged to accelerate the process.  Now we did actually wind down a bit faster than "the blue bars" proposal because we found we could do it without sacrificing the level of return and, in fact, the US book was a very good example of that.  We certainly thought that had we done a series of individual sales of those assets, we would have made a better return out of it, but it would have taken much longer than the process that we actually engaged in and we were concerned, for other reasons, for other considerations, to wind down the American operation, you know, as quickly as we could and to get rid of all the outlying parts of the bank so that we could concentrate on the core.</p> <p>  But, you know, from time to time there would be pressure to say, "Well, can you not do it a bit faster?" and we said, "Yes, of course, we could do it faster but if you want us to do it faster than we have undertaken to do in the exercise, then please give us a formal instruction to do that", and that was never forthcoming.</p></speech>

I think this is a very important concept because it gets right to the heart of, you know, the difference between the highest sale price and what is the best economic value in a transaction.  And, in this particular case with the US book, there were economic value considerations outside the control of the bank and they were really at the State level.  So whilst, you know, we're governed by the EC restructuring plan, we're governed by the commitments letter which says that we need to get certain returns on assets when we sell on on a net present value basis, and we have to deal with timeframes for running down a portfolio so ... in other words you just don't want to go and sell a portfolio and fire sale it and say "I've done a good job because I've wound this bank down quickly."  The idea is to wind it down no quicker than the timeframe, but to achieve the best result.</p> <p>  In this case there was a major result that the State was looking for apart from the financial return in Anglo Irish Bank, and that was to alleviate this very significant problem with the ECB funding levels.  So the deleveraging of the system was something which was a statewide objective that we couldn't make a decision around.  The Minister needed to make that decision, ultimately decided that this was an important component, formed part of the decision-making process and resulted in a ministerial instruction for us to sell the portfolio or include some assets in the portfolio that we probably or that we definitely would have kept for a longer period if these other issues were not at the forefront.</p></speech>

Those are issues outside the control of the bank and they're satisfying broader objectives and if the Minister wants to do that it's a Minister's prerogative to issue us an instruction and ask us to do that.  There were certain assets that we did say it makes far more sense with this particular asset not to include it for whatever reason.  It might have been, for example, that there was a timeframe that didn't allow for the perfecting of security and, therefore, if you included it, you would get a 40% return on it rather than 80% if you held it for longer. So there were some rational exchanges in making decisions around those assets.</p></speech>

And, you know, the old Anglo Irish Bank conducted its activities in, you know, a way that I hadn't seen previously.  I'll give you a couple of examples.  Boom markets - a client being banked by Anglo for a long period of time has value in the assets that are being financed that's increasing because the markets are going up.  The bank at some point goes along and says, "You've now got all of this extra value in your assets.  How about we lend you some more money so you can go off and buy something else?"  So, they lend another &euro;100 million with the agreement that what they'll do when he spends money is go back and pick up the security on those particular properties.  And then, for whatever reason, it is not done.  So, enter the new management team.  We start get in loan by loan into these assets and we find that they haven't perfected security and it's really not just one or two transactions, it's endemic, and we need to go through it in a detailed fashion across every aspect of the loan portfolio - every category.</p> <p>  And, you know, I know the numbers that, you know, you saw coming out of Anglo were massive.  The losses were massive and they seemed to never stop.  And part of this was just the sheer work involved in getting through the portfolio at a detailed level.  That wasn't something you could just do overnight and say, "Okay, we're done with it now."  It took months and months and extended resources of internal and external specialists to come in and do this work.  </p></speech>

Given that we've heard from two of those, and it is only two, and they say that they will back everything, was the write-downs from NAMA justified?  Could Anglo Irish Bank have dealt with those loans themselves under new management, under a new board?  Can you talk to me about that there in terms of the write-down that was applied, the justification for it and what that did to the institution going forward?</p></speech>

I guess a couple of comments.  Whether they were borrowers, distressed borrowers or staff walking into my office in the first couple of months - the first three or four months - it was like, "Well, of course, we're going to pay everything."</p><p>And it became ... actually with clients really after the first couple of months, I decided I'd take a break, quite frankly, from talking to customers.  And it was because I'd get one story and I wasn't at that stage across enough detail of the actual loans and the exposures.  And I was finding that I'd get really good story spun by people who ... very engaging and then we'd go and look behind the scenes and find that the numbers looked totally different and, you know, in some cases, it was just irrecoverable.  It's amazing what people will put forward as, "Well, if you'd only done it" ... you know, we had a situation where a client said, you know, an enormous amount of money, "We're gonna pay you back everything", but what it actually required was a loan in excess of half a billion to help support them and then they were going to pay zero on it for seven years.  Well, you know, that's not a cost to the bank in that environment for us, that's a cost to the taxpayer and we just weren't in any position to do those sorts of transactions.  </p></speech>

You know, I guess the only thing I'd say is, like, markets are markets and there are lots of variables.  You know, some of those variables ... you can put a lot of assets into a market at a point in time and the timing is right and you do very well off them, and, you know, the market's not the same three months later.  We've all seen that.  Now, having said that, I think we'd recognise that since the liquidation, the markets continued to rise and I think ... you know, if you look to spread out the loan sales over a longer period of time in a rising market, you're going to get a better result.

As I say, you know, the risk people viewed themselves and were considered like second class citizens.  They had processes and they went through processes but it was more finding ways that they could do the transactions, rather than examine the risks in the transactions and then overlay that against where they believed the market was going.  So, I think it would've been a very difficult thing for a good risk person to be involved with.</p></speech>

And that, sort of, runs counter to the approved plan that had recently been put in place with the European Commission, which looked at a measured wind-down over a 20-year period of time so ... look, you know, it seemed pretty obvious that there was, if you like, changes afoot, just what they were, you know, I have to say I didn't really know because, to be blunt, I can't really be sure what election promises are going to be fulfilled when the new Government actually gets in.</p><p>So I didn't really know whether that would be the case.  The other thing you don't know as well is, the new Government coming in, how quickly they are going to come to terms with what they've got their hands around.  You know, they're not across all the detail as are the old Government.  So, you know, there was uncertainty but, certainly, with the new Secretary General coming in, or the new head of banking policy, it became clear very quickly that the approach was to deleverage the system and deleverage, largely through Anglo Irish Bank, very quickly.</p></speech>

I only had a photograph of it on my phone so I couldn't print it out to bring in so I had to draw this but I think it's useful just thinking about the timing of the losses in the banks.  And, of course, you know, Anglo took the early hit of &euro;4 billion in the first half of 2009.  By the end of 2010, they had taken &euro;18 billion and then another &euro;17.3 billion so &euro;29.3 billion, so Anglo really did the work on the asset portfolio, understanding where the destruction in value was and took those hits up front.  This report I'm referring to is labelled ... it's from the guarantee to bailout, looking at the cost of the capitalisation of the banks and the reference is Honohan, 2012.  And from that, you know, the other banks really...  Bank of Ireland did not take a &euro;5.2 billion hit until March 2011 when they did PCAR and AIB didn't take a hit until March 2011 of &euro;13.3 billion so whilst you could look in those early days and, you know, I had these discussions early on with the Department of Finance about the size of the hits we were taking and saying "Well, it sort of doesn't make sense to me what's happening in AIB because, given their activity, their involvement in the same markets over the same period of time, there should have been a direct read-across from what we knew about their portfolios."  And that wasn't coming through in these numbers; that didn't come through until a lot later in those banks</p></speech>

There was a massive level of international funding supporting all of the Irish banks.  Of course it was a very, very high proportion of funds supporting Anglo Irish Bank from the international capital markets and I think we all know, with the fall in the markets and the reputational damage done to Ireland, that virtually all foreign jurisdictions began to withdraw funding from Ireland and this was a major problem.  If ... in the early days, Anglo Irish Bank had large pools of retail deposit funds from the UK and they also had large pools of wholesale funds from the debt capital markets globally and from corporates globally.  As time progressed and the bank wound down its asset portfolio and repaid a lot of these - and, indeed, a lot of them were replaced with short-term funding from European Central Bank - the systemic importance of Anglo waned.</p></speech>

But there didn't seem to be anything more than some kind of polite suggestions from the regulator to the banks that they should maybe think again about doing these things.  Now, I have to say that in the absence of a specific bank resolution regime, regulators anywhere have a big problem because if they really get annoyed or upset or worried about a bank, at the end of the day the only sanction they have is to remove the banking licence and that is the nuclear button.  I don't think any regulator ... I haven't heard of any case in the last decade where regulators have used that.</p></speech>

This is maybe a wider philosophical discussion; it's kind of common cause among people who comment on this that the problem we had was light-touch regulation.  I don't think there was all that much wrong with the form of the regulation; it was the fact that it wasn't applied.  And, you know, as you've recalled, Senator, there were tools there that weren't used that could, I think, have been used to head off some of the worst features of the problem.  And I certainly think it was within the power of the financial regulators, (a), to say to the banks much earlier than had been said that they were over-concentrated from a risk point of view in certain sectors and to certain borrowers and, (b), to say to the financial institutions generally that 100% mortgages are banned.  We now have rules that are much more constraining about mortgages and I think, probably, we would have been better off if we had rules of that kind from, say, 2004 on.</p></speech>

I got myself in bad odour with my previous party in 2009 for disagreeing with them both about NAMA and about the method of restructuring banks.  It seemed to me that if you were going to wind down or cure the running sore that was distressed loans in banks, it needed some kind of a vehicle to take over the distressed loans, and that would have been the case whether you liquidated them or set out to wind them down, or whatever.  There was a need.  At one point, in fact, probably early in 2010 when we were just beginning the process of transferring loans to NAMA - which was going to be a difficult process - I remember raising the question, just for discussion, whether we shouldn't transfer all of the Anglo loan book into NAMA and close down Anglo.  The tenor of the replies that I got - I never made it as a formal proposal, but I kind of floated it - the tenor of the replies which I got which I think was reasonable, was that that would have been far too big a chunk to put together.  Having said that, as I said in my opening statement, I think NAMA has worked rather well.</p></speech>

You spoke about the ten-year, sort of, wind-down approach to IBRC and the kind of cost-benefit analysis of that and so forth.  Maybe if I could ask you to elaborate a bit further and maybe give some background behind the liquidation of IBRC as a device to deal with the promissory note.</p></speech>

We had actually concluded by the winter of 2012 that we could do the wind-down by 2018.  In fact, Mike Aynsley said to me early in December, I think, of 2012 that he thought we could do the wind-down by 2016, and we actually didn't get time to discuss that properly before the liquidation happened.</p> <p>  My understanding of the motivation for the liquidation at that point was that the State wished to avoid the necessity to pay a further &euro;3 point odd billion every year at the beginning of March to fund its obligations under the promissory note, and that by winding down ... by liquidating Anglo the State believed it had the opportunity to replace the promissory note by cheaper money, basically through other means, and that that would allow ... a requirement of doing that was the liquidation of Anglo-----</p></speech>

Thank you to both the witnesses.  Mr. Dukes, if I may, I want to go through your opening statement just to get clarifications on a couple of items in it.  On page 3 of your opening statement, you talk about the actions that you had to take ... by the board immediately following the nationalisation in January '09 and the first thing is an immediate review of the bank's provisioning policy, which led to at the end of March, the conclusion that the recapitalisation required at that point was &euro;4.5 billion rather than the &euro;1.5 billion estimated by the Department of Finance in January.  So why was there a difference in that short period of time?</p></speech>

On the provisions for impairment, just basically what we are talking about here, in the report for the year ended 30 September 2008, the total provision for impairment of those accounts was &euro;879 million, which had been presented rightly at the time as the largest impairment provision that any Irish bank had ever made.  For the accounts for the 15 months ending 31 December 2009, the provision for impairment was &euro;15.1 billion and, you'll recall, during the course of 2009, we changed the accounting year for the bank.  It had been, you know, October to September and we adjusted it to be a full year so we did a 15-months accounting at the end of December but the provision for impairment on loans over those 15 months was &euro;15 billion compared to &euro;879 million for the year... the accounting year immediately preceding that and that was directly as a result of working back into the bank's balance sheet, the information that we had about the decline in property prices.</p></speech>

Finance has a figure of &euro;1.5 billion it's estimating in January and in March you have it at &euro;4.5 billion.</p></speech>

They were shocked.  It was a huge surprise to them, a most unwelcome surprise, and, as I said, we had commissioned two experts to do a study of our methodology and we had done an internal review of the provisioning policy.  The Department of Finance, after we had given them that particular piece of bad news, commissioned, I think it was, PwC to look at the same material we had looked at and they came to broadly the same conclusion on the basis of market information as it was then.</p></speech>

I just want to move on then to another thing that you had to do following nationalisation, which is the restructuring plan in September '09.  You did two plans and you worked with them in conjunction with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA and both plans were rejected by the EC and you say "It subsequently emerged that the Department of Finance had not supported the plan in [their] discussions with the EC" and I think this was unique amongst member states in support programmes, as you point out.  Can you explain to me what's happening there and why you're not getting the support from the Department of Finance who've agreed this restructuring plan with you?</p></speech>

The Department were very embarrassed by that and they, they decided to take that piece out of the document but it had already been said.  But it was a difficult time.  When we had to do the second restructuring plan, and I don't know why the Commission turned down the first one, we were never told the full detail of that, during the second one, it took quite a long time for us to get engagement from the Central Bank and the Department in doing the plan, and the NTMA.</p><p>At a very late stage in putting that plan together, the Central Bank came along with another twist which was difficult to include in the plan but from recollection, I think it's ... I've referred to it in the statement ... there was only one occasion when anybody from the bank was involved in any engagement with the European Commission about the restructuring plan.  I found out subsequently, in conversation with a senior Commission official, that other countries that were presenting restructuring plans for their banks brought the banks along to the discussion with the Commission.  Personally, I think it would have helped us ... second ... certainly, the second time around and, clearly, the third time around if we had been involved in the discussion with the Commission so that we knew what kind of expectation they had in terms of restructuring.</p></speech>

I want to move on, if I may then, to a document you supplied in your opening statement - the first document you supplied - which is bullet points for, I think it's John Moran's meeting with the board in May 2011 and I don't know if we can get that up on the screen, Chair.  Thanks.  A number of bullets points there but the second, kind of, section of the document is, &quot;D. Fin/NTMA, influence has slowed down adjustment process&quot;, and a series of bullets.  The first one:<blockquote><br /><br />- Indecision on restructuring policy approach (now on version 4, still undecided).<br /><br />- Sep. 2010 &ldquo;funding bank + recovery bank&rdquo; proposal never made any sense.<br /><br />[down to the bottom bullet point]<br /><br />- Official demand for external validation of Bank analyses and proposals has simply increased expenditure on external consultancies...</blockquote>At the bottom of the page, &quot;The moral of the story: get them off our backs and things will happen faster, better.&quot;  Can you just explain for me what that means?  And the second question is: was the way in which the Department was engaging with you costing you more money and costing the State more money, ultimately?</p></speech>

If you look at the second section of the document there, the third bullet point, the bank's original liquidity management exercise in 2009, which was burning the subordinated bondholders ... our original proposal was considered too aggressive by the Department so-----</p></speech>

The NTMA reckoned that that was too aggressive and we ended up paying somewhere in the thirties per cent - I have the exact figures somewhere but I can't quite recall them at the moment - which meant that instead of saving somewhere over &euro;2.2 billion, we saved &euro;1.8 billion on that exercise.  In 2010, we proposed another exercise to cram down subordinated bondholders and it took almost six months to get agreement of the authorities to do it.  That was a more aggressive one.</p></speech>

They were all reviewed for the public accounts committee and gone through with the Secretary General at the time and we've had the other various reports talking about failings in the Department of Finance and the move now to rectify them post-crisis.</p><p>But if we look at Mr. Aynsley's statement ... on page 2, he talks about a skills gap in the Department of Finance; on page 3, "ongoing lack of banking knowledge and experience in the Department of Finance"; on page 4, "It appeared increasingly to be driven by political considerations"; and then, on page 7, we have a resignation letter from the CFO, "The authorities are stuck in their old ways.  They do not recognise nor understand conflicts of interest."  So, in terms of the Department of Finance, as you understand it, and as you have dealt with it until very recently, have you seen any significant change over the Department of Finance that was there prior to the crisis, which was criticised so heavily in things like the Wright report and the Nyberg report?</p></speech>

We found, as I ... that note that you referred to in the beginning, that was a note I prepared for my own guidance in chairing the meeting with Mr. Moran in May of 2011.  It set out areas where I felt that the interaction between the bank and the Department was not producing the kind of result that it might have.  For example, I think we were more aggressive ... we were more constructive about restructuring Arnotts, for example, than the Department would have been and we consulted them about that because that was an area that we thought might be an area of public interest ... you know, an iconic department store in a sensitive part of Dublin ... you know, there might be considerations to be taken into account but NTMA was nervous about the kind of deal we were doing.  And the same, there was another deal ... a Champion deal, which NTMA was nervous about but which we went ahead with because it was our commercial judgment that that was in the best interests of the bank.  And if you see on the section directly above that ... "Anglo board has real concerns about liability issues".  That goes to the heart of the way the relationship worked.  I felt at that time that we had to make it clear that the ultimate responsibility for what happened in the bank rested with the board and not with the NTMA or the Department of Finance and that it was the board's necks that were on the line for decisions that were made and we couldn't legally or prudently leave too many of those decisions to be made by other people, whose concerns were not, maybe, as informed by the realities of commercial life as ours were.  We found, from time to time, in discussions with the Department, that they raised questions, which was a legitimate thing to do, but some of the questions were extremely naive.  And as I said earlier on, we were never entirely sure just how far up in the Department the responses percolated and we found, from time to time, that it seemed to be difficult to come to a conclusion on an issue with the Department.  The Department would raise a series of questions, legitimately, about a particular set of activities or whatever.  We would sit down with them, explain it all, go through it all and they would ... we'd end the meeting and it would appear that that was concluded.  And, a couple of months later, they would come back to us with the same set of questions, so it seemed to be difficult to be sure that we had concluded on an issue with the Department.  I could go further about particular issues that I'm not allowed speak about here-----</p></speech>

Do you think that there were opportunities for much more severe haircuts to bondholders rather than taxing the taxpayer with their debts?</p></speech>

I know there's a great deal of talk about it, and various pop economists talked about the mirth and the joy there was among senior bondholders and champagne corks popping and all that and how they would come back the following day and lend you more money.  I think a lot of that is very fanciful.  If you look at the experiences of countries where senior bondholders have been burned, I don't think you can conclude that it's an exercise that doesn't have very serious costs involved in it.</p></speech>

Loans ... total assets were &euro;100 billion.  The loans to customers were about &euro;67 billion, loans and advances to banks were about &euro;7 billion and there was about &euro;12 billion of investments in financial markets.</p></speech>

There were still a number of very large borrowers left, some with fully performing loans, others with loans that were less than fully performing but, you know, where something was happening.  And I think it's fair to say that not all of the distressed loans were transferred to NAMA.  There was also, to the best of my recollection - and I'm open to correction on this - I think there was a lower limit on the exposures that would be transferred to NAMA.  There was a figure below which the loans would not be transferred to NAMA.</p></speech>

In fact, both the first and the second restructuring plans were done on the basis that the bank would be a going concern.  The May 2010 restructuring plan separated ... proposed to separate it into a good bank and a bad bank and, if memory serves me correctly, I think we were looking at an outstanding loans base of somewhere in the region of &euro;15 billion at that point, but the European Commission decided at that stage that the bank ... it could no longer be treated as being prospectively a functioning bank into the future.</p></speech>

And I think what Mr. Dukes says is 100% valid.  One way of looking at this is if you think of the discussion we had earlier around the systemic importance of Anglo.  One of the reasons was the level of deposits that it had, both domestic but largely international.  So, if you go back to September 2008, their customer accounts liabilities were running about &euro;52 billion; March 2009, they'd dropped to &euro;34 billion; December 2009, &euro;28 billion; by the time we got to December 2010, they were down to &euro;11 billion.  So, what you had ... two things happening.  You had a flight of deposits out of the country, and this was just not impacting on Anglo, it was impacting on every Irish bank, and that was the reason why you saw this very substantial growth in ECB funding.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-30a.1339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015073000002#LLLL00300"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

There was very little asset portfolio left that you could use, at the end of the day, to centre-post a new good bank.  And even if you argued that, well, perhaps it was big enough to create a small business bank, the funding issue was a large one.  Deposits were still leaving the country and this is why one of the reasons was taken to structure up quickly this funding bank structure to take the deposits that were left out of Anglo and put them with an institution, AIB, that could use those to support its business as one of the pillar banks going forward.</p></speech>

The legacy issues ... I think broadly I'd characterised those as the issues that were identified and taken up by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, who started their investigation in February of 2009.  There was a whole series of outstanding issues there, some of which are still subject to litigation, but they were, if you like ... and I think I can use the phrase, colloquially, "the sins of the past" that needed to be examined and have people held to account for them-----</p></speech>

Gentlemen, the ... you were under pressure from the euro system to sell off the assets so the banks had money to pay back to the ECB as I understand it.  Did you feel you were under political pressure from the State or from the Government for any political reasons to advance sales more quickly?</p></speech>

As I said, a wind-down programme was agreed in the early part of 2011, which we over-fulfilled.  From time to time after that, there were people in the Department of Finance seeking to encourage us to wind the bank down faster, which we did not think was always that wise, and we felt that as long as we stayed within the objectives of the wind-down targets that we had proposed and we took opportunistically other opportunities to dispose of assets at what we regarded as a reasonable price, that we would do so.</p></speech>

The appropriateness of the relationships between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector and in your written statement you say, "This issue has been a rich source of modern mythology."  Considering the history of tribunals which have shown relationships between political parties, politicians, developers and then a perceived closeness between some parties or politicians and big developers, do you think that that might merit a more considered response?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-30a.1353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Dukes" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015073000002#LLLL01700"><p>I considered that response very carefully.  You use the word "perceived" which, I think, is an appropriate word in this case.  I mean, I think there is a fact that is hugely overlooked in some of this discussion, and that is that for many, many years the construction sector in Ireland has persuaded all political parties, not just Fianna F&aacute;il but Fine Gael and the Labour Party and, I think, others that ... on the basic proposition that they make that construction is good for the economy.</p><p>I've always thought that that is the wrong causation.  A strong economy is good for construction and I think that an over-reliance on construction as a motor of growth has turned out, in our case and indeed in other economies, to be a very bad idea.</p><p> There is frequent comment to the effect that there are, kind of, cosy cartels between bankers and politicians and all the rest.  My observation, both in politics and out of it, in dealing with bankers is that, by and large, they prefer to stay as far away from politicians as they can.  I think until 2008, most of them thought they knew more about what was healthy for the country than the politicians did and I think they found out that they don't necessarily.  </p><p> Again, in relation to developers it's frequently alleged that developers are more friendly to one particular party than another.  Frankly, my experience has been that they're very, very flexible as to who they support.  I think the whole political system probably pays too much attention to them than they actually deserve.  So, I mean, that's where I think the mythology comes in.</p></speech>

The initial discussions I had prior to joining the bank and then after I joined the bank with the Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, were very much along the lines that the preference the State had at that point was to repair the banking system, repair Anglo.  It was in the early days and they believed that Anglo would remain as a systemic part of the financial sector.  So, the view was to convert the stub of the bank or not the stub of the bank or the cleaned up entity into a bank that focused more broadly on business banking and SME banking.  But, you know, as I said, as the markets developed and deteriorated, it ended up not being possible.  So, I think then it became a matter of how do you move it to ultimate resolution and in what timeframe and that was really the subject of the ultimate pieces of work that resulted in the final plan and subsequent liquidation.</p></speech>

They complete a transaction, they store the data and that data changes as interest rates change or maturity dates happen and get reset, etc.  But, it also records security data and any other number of aspects of a transaction.  What we found was that they were in such a hurry to transact business and write new business that they had put a minimum amount of information into the computer systems.  So, it then becomes a matter of going back, file by file, back to the original documents, original files, and rebuilding that over time.  That is, again, one of the enormous pieces of work that needed to be done, just so we knew where we were because in the absence of a ....  I mean a lot of its guarantees were worthless but there were some that were worthwhile.  But if they weren't on the system and you didn't know they were there, you really didn't have a solid basis to value the loans.  So, it kept on coming back to a process of revisiting the original loan documents and rebuilding that data from the ground up.</p><p>To answer your question, back in '08, if somebody walked in and said "we need to do a quick look at this portfolio and see its real health", it would have been very difficult to do that.  </p></speech>

The processes they had in place are different than certainly what I have been used to throughout my career because, you know, there is no substitute for a fact base of information.  It seemed that a lot of the information relied on reports that were provided by the relationship managers who were dealing with the clients day-to-day, and they would make assumptions and put forward reports and then they were rolled up to the next level.  The information just wasn't built off a solid fact base.</p></speech>

As I said earlier on, the information was there about the concentration of risk by sector, and by borrower, and it was there available to the regulatory authorities.</p> <p>  The second point I would make is that I think this was common cause for most of the banks.  If they were asked about their loan exposures in the property sector they would have said, and probably would have believed, that they operated a 70% loan-to-value ratio.  On deeper examination I found, and this is making it very broad - this is broad brush kind of stuff - if you really examined their loan books, and tracked through individual borrowers, you would find that in a number of cases, and a not insignificant number of cases, the 30% equity that was supposed to go with this 70% loan-to-value ratio was borrowed funding either from the one bank or from another bank and brought in as equity to support a loan.  So that, in fact, the concentration by sector and by borrower was actually exacerbated by the loan-to-value ratios that actually existed in real terms.  The first two parts of that were information - if you like, gross level information - that was available to regulators and that should have set off alarm bells.  Regulators should have said "Stop, you are over concentrated."  The last bit of it was much more difficult to find out and that was partly related to the design of the bank systems and the kinds of things that Mr. Aynsley has been talking about. </p></speech>

Given the ... no, in fairness, Chair, I did ask the question.  You said ... in relation to the observations you made about the Department of Finance, do you believe that the relationship framework was, at any time, breached by the Department of Finance in relation to you?</p></speech>

It's close.  I think ... I think it could have been if we'd let it.  I think, you know, there was ... and that was part of the conflict ... there was this ongoing push-back because of the recognition that there were very many conflicting elements that needed to be considered and, you know, if we'd conducted certain activities in conjunction with the Department of Finance, it may have had a direct impact and caused a default and accelerated and created a cessation of business risk for us ... or an event.  So, you know, we had to push back on many, many things.  So, I think the answer is "No, there wasn't", but there could have been.</p></speech>

If you have time and patience, read through them.  They're not pellucidly clear and discussion along the second one went through 29 different drafts - becoming increasingly bureaucratic as they went through - and it was resolved finally when our chief executive officer lost patience with the whole process and he said "Why don't we refer this to the two sets of legal advisers?".  They looked at it and came back with a much more workable draft in the space of a few days.</p></speech>

Mr. Aynsley, first, if I may, you say on page 16 "When I arrived in Ireland in September 2009 there was still little appreciation of the scale of damage done by the pre nationalisation Bank Management".  And could you describe the prevailing culture you encountered on your arrival in Anglo in September '09?</p></speech>

I started to say earlier, I mean, one of the things I recall when I came in ... within the first week; I don't think there was one member of the management team ... the old management team that were still there didn't walk in and ask for an audience and start talking through what they'd done and within the first 15 minutes put their hands up to say "Well, you know, of course, well I didn't do anything wrong throughout this whole process".  In those days, the discussions around the loan portfolio ... it's not really, you know, "We've got a better loan portfolio than anyone else.  The other banks have followed us and they've pushed this harder than us after the fact".  There was a denial, I think, about the quality of the loan portfolios.  There just wasn't an acceptance that this was a particularly serious situation.  This was a fair way in.  This was September ... August-September 2009.  And I'd say that the culture of denial about what had gone on and what was still unfolding was probably the thing that struck me the most.</p></speech>

You had seen the market fall significantly and I spoke at the beginning about the expectation at that ... middle of the year there was a 20% haircut on NAMA assets, by year end it was 30, it ended up being 58 overall.  Just the extent of what was unfolding hadn't really struck a lot of people.  And bear in mind, a lot of people hadn't ... in Ireland ... hadn't been through this type of crisis and no one really in major jurisdictions had seen the extent of what was going to happen.</p></speech>

Could you describe for us the Alan Dukes model of simple, clear, brutal bank regulation and what would be in it, because we will have to address that, obviously, as we come to the end of our work?</p></speech>

To give an example, it has taken a long, long discussion in the United States to get something apparently simple like the Volcker rule implemented.  I'm sure the Senator is familiar with this.  It was decided I think four years ago and it only came into operation this year with great reluctance on the part of the banks.  And I think that rule, if it were rigorously applied to banking systems through the world, would actually reduce the complexity of regulation because it just takes a whole area of activity away from the proper activities of investment banks.</p> <p>  That particular statement represents what I suppose you would call a prejudice about it.  I've been looking at detailed regulation of various kinds since 1967 and I find both in various customs regulation, in tax law and in banking regulation, the more detailed the rules you have, the more the incentive is there and the more the opportunity is there to find a way around the rules.  Now, detailed rules give rise to detailed avoidance procedures.  Simple rules are much more easily implemented and I think, you know, there is a big discussion here around the question of what do we want the banking and financial system to do for the real economy.  And I think the answer to that is something much simpler than they do today.  So, let's have simple statements and simple rules.</p></speech>

I think, you know, this is one of the areas I spoke about in my opening.  You know, I think, you know, there's evidence here that the areas have been confused and the roles haven't been clear.  The regulator hasn't ... pre-rebuilding of the regulator, you know, the regulator wasn't regulating properly and banking policy wasn't clear and banks just seemed to do what they wanted to do.  And I think, you know, certainly in Australia the roles are very separate and I think rightly so.  I think, you know, there is clarity around what the regulator is doing.  There is clarity about the way they supervise the expectations that are levied on the banks and banking policy is not confused by the Government.</p></speech>

In fact, if you look at the documentation you'll find that I think I had sent to the Department some time in advance of the opening of those discussions a draft relationship framework, which they found far too light.  But the problem was that it was very difficult to find out where to draw a line between the independence of the bank and the right or the inclination of the Department/Minister to intervene.</p></speech>

But, I mean, just to give one example of where the difficulty was, the Department was always keen to ensure a flow of information from the bank, which they got - they got it in spades.  But in some of the drafts, for example of the relationship framework, if the Department wanted information it had to be supplied on the spot.  If the Department was required to give a response, they had seven days or ten days or whatever to reply, which was very uneven.  In some cases it was not at all unusual for the bank to say, "here is an issue, here is something we feel we need to do or we want to do, and we need to do it in the next three days".  It was no good to us to have an answer back in ten days time, you know.  That didn't seem to register with the Department as an objective difficulty on our part.</p></speech>

I can't be sure.  The problem, as presented to the Government, as I understand it, in September of 2008 was a problem of liquidity in the banks.  I think I said in my opening statement the question is: were the banks or was Anglo insolvent at the time?  This is a pure guess, I have no scientific basis for saying it, but I think, you know, this is probably not too far from reality.</p><p>At the actual point at which the guarantee was given, I think it was probably the case that technically Anglo was solvent because the real damage to the asset values happened sometime after that, fairly quickly after that, and certainly from January 2009 on.  But I would think that had the kind of examination that Senator O'Keeffe was talking about earlier on ... had that been done in advance of the bank guarantee I think the probability is that Anglo would still have been solvent at that point and I think the other banks would have been solvent by a bigger margin, if you like, at that point.</p></speech>

You know, if you look at September '08, the organisation had a capital base, equity base of &euro;4.1 billion at that point.  And, of course, we know not long after that there was estimates done that said well you know, probably going to need a &euro;1.5 billion of capital.  And I think, you know, this is all about where asset values went over a period of time versus where they were perceived to be at that time.  So, likely to be solvent, I would suspect.</p></speech>

I am going to move to begin the wrap-up.  I'll invite the leads in.  I'll ask them to be as concise and as brief and to avoid any repetition of material that's been covered already.  If further clarification is needed, of course, we will have to do that.  If I could just begin with maybe the same question to the both of you.  And Mr. Dukes dealt with some of my latter questioning already, just before we broke earlier.  But the general question to the both of you would be: what was your own preference for the future of the bank from among the options identified in the various restructuring plans?</p></speech>

At a point in 2010, we believed that it would still have been possible, as Mike Aynsley has said, to centre-post a continuing bank on the basis of the assets as they were then.  Asset deterioration subsequently, I think, made that impossible and, by September of 2010 ... I think it was in September 2010, that we began to look at the reality of the need to wind down the bank.</p></speech>

I think - and maybe it's not really useful to say this, but I think it should be said - there is quite a difference between winding down a bank, getting bank into a wind-down position, and liquidating it.  If you wind it down, you get to the point where you have satisfied all of the demands of creditors, there is still some base of assets left, there's enough left to deal with the tail risks that are there or else the tail risks are of a magnitude that it's safe to hand over to somebody else without creating a problem.  And I think, at the end of the day, that was, if you like, our preference to wind the bank down in that way.  As Mike Aynsley has said, from the State financing point of view, other priorities supervened and it became more interesting or more valuable from the State's point of view to liquidate the bank and get the benefit in terms of the easement of the promissory note burden rather than to continue with disposing of the assets.</p></speech>

I guess the only other thing that like ... I still think, looking back on it - sorry, I still think looking back on it - I think, looking back on it now, even if there had been &euro;12 billion or &euro;15 billion and you could have funded this new entity, I still think it would have been difficult given the perception around the ... the historical perception around Anglo Irish Bank and the name, and the perception around what it had done, right or wrong.  And I think that's something that I had no idea of until I came and lived here for a while and everywhere you went, you know, people would say, "Great, really glad you're here, something really needed to be done about that bank, you know, the sooner it's gone the better."  Just the level of dislike and the level of hate is something that I had no idea until probably mid-2010.</p></speech>

I covered off that one earlier I think.  I ... I think originally the extent of ... of what was happening was unclear and the thought of turning it into a ... the beginning of a third force starting with a business bank that was a little bit more diversified and better focused was the thought process.  That's where it started from and the liquidation aspect of it came in subsequently, driven by events.</p></speech>

It was made very clear to me, certainly from an early stage, that the ... that Brussels wanted Anglo gone.  There was a great deal of political comment from all sides of the political spectrum from 2010 on and certainly for a period in early 2011 when other things were going on, when people were saying "Yes, get this off the landscape, get rid of it as quickly as possible."  But as these things often happen, when people find themselves with the reins in their hands they find the horse is not going to go quite where they thought it was going to go in the first place and that it's maybe better to jump the ditch than to take the gully over the other side of the road.</p></speech>

And then they, kind of, super-posited on that of the duties of a director of a bank.  And when I asked what the specific duties of a public interest director were, the conversation got a bit abstract and ... and vague, and quickly came back to the point of saying that, yes, you had a duty to the company and, yes, you had a duty to the shareholder and, yes, you had a duty of care to the employees of the company and you still had to bear the public interest in mind.  But where all these things met was never clear.</p></speech>

I think other members of the board kind of disagreed with me about this, but, being a simple-minded person, I rationalised it to myself on the basis that I was there to look after the public interest, the shareholder in the bank was the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance has a duty to the public interest and in a sense kind of embodies the public interest, so the objectives of the Minister for Finance satisfied the requirements that I look after the public interest.</p></speech>

I am a big believer that the NAMA structure ... whether you call it NAMA or not is another matter, but the NAMA-type structure is very important in cases like this because, you know, one of the key aspects of it is that it crossed all financial institutions in a ... in a country that provided banking facilities to, you know, single borrower groups from multiple entities.  And I think it's the only way you can really corral all of these relationships and get them in shape to be resolved.  Now, whether they did a good job doing that, I mean, I don't know.</p></speech>

Firstly, let me take issue with the first part which is it wasn't significantly ahead of the cap.  It was on the cap.  The cap was set under the CIROC guidelines and there were aspects within the CIROC report ... the CIROC guidelines.  And my package, which, by the way, I didn't structure, it was offered to me, there were aspects that I negotiated around ... moving here.  It was a structure that was arrived at by the bank in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Minister.  And the Minister personally signed off on it on the basis that it complied with all aspects of the CIROC guidelines.  Now, you know, the level of these things ... I know this is a lot of money but, you know, there's a market and if you want to bring people to the country to resolve issues, there's a price.</p></speech>

I can say that already in August of 2011, and this is from recollection, I was able to say that the practice of sending board packs and minutes to the Department was already well established by then.  Now, that's ... so by early 2011, long before we started talking about a new relationship framework, that practice was in place.</p></speech>

Let me give an example.  We had a number of assets in the north east of England which were in a fairly distressed position and at a given point we had a report from the UK office about what the condition of that particular group of assets was, with a number of suggestions as to how we might go about prospecting the market to see how that would go.  Some time later, another report came back detailing what kind of progress had been made on that and what kind of problems there were with that portfolio.  And then, some time later, there would have been a number of specific proposals to the board as to proposals for disposal of assets.  And, you know, they were subject to quite a lot of discussion.</p> <p>  And I can remember a series of board discussions at successive board meetings about how we were dealing with, for example, one transaction I can remember ... and I can talk about it because it is not going to be ... it was in the UK, a group of hotels in the UK, where there were a number of iterations of the plan to dispose of them, including a provision for restructuring some of the loans in order to get the thing into shape.  So there was quite a lot of discussion at board.</p> <p>  I mean, it was one of the arguments - discussions - we had with the Department of Finance.  In 2009 and 2010, for example, we had an enormous number of both board meetings and committee meetings, and it was represented to me that we were having too many meetings.  And it was even said to me by people in the Central Bank.  But once we explained to them what the subject matter of the meetings was, it was agreed that we were ... it was reasonable, if onerous.  And I, as I have said to so many other people who have raised this with me, I think if the other members of the board had felt that I was convening board meetings too quickly, they would have been on my case pretty damn quick.</p></speech>

In relation to when you took over in terms of new management, you carried out a review in terms of the hospitality expenditure done by Anglo Irish Bank between 2006 and 2009 and, as part of that, golf seemed to come up very ... quite often.  We see in a table that was published in Simon Carswell's book that there was &euro;1.37 million spent, of which a large proportion of it was on the likes of golf balls, where &euro;208,000 was spent, and umbrellas where there was in excess of, I think, &euro;100,000 spent.  There was golf days, &euro;102,000, and so on.</p></speech>

Mr. Carswell walked in and presented me with a golf ball that he had been sent from someone in Spain who had found it on the golf course.</p></speech>

They had all expired by, I think, the middle of 2009, end of 2009.  So we had no value that we could take but what we did do with them is we had one of the PAs, who had a good relationship, talk to them from time to time and we would use those for staff.  You know we couldn't do things for staff and we would ring them up and say "Look, you know, this has expired but do you mind if we send a couple of our operations people down?", for example.</p></speech>

I think, as I said, I think it is a ... I think it is a headline and I think it's debatable.  I think one bank in a country like this - it is a small country relatively speaking.  It is a small financial sector and if you embed cultural behaviours you can generate contagion that can have a negative impact so ...  not out of the question but I think it is drawing a long bow.</p></speech>

Do you agree with that assertion?</p></speech>

I think there was a failure of regulation.  There was, clearly, a failure of risk appetite, risk management on the part of the banks.  There was excessive reliance by the banks on short-term interbank funding, which dried up.  So, yes, all of those problems could have been dealt with domestically and if they had been properly dealt with domestically, we certainly ... we wouldn't have been immune from the effects of the international crisis, but the effects would have been a good deal less than they actually were.</p></speech>

And I'd also like to thank you for your positive engagement with the inquiry here this evening as well.
