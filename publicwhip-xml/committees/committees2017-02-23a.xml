We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Marc MacSharry.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 15 and 16 February 2017 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I do not think any particular matter arises from the minutes.  If there is we can discuss the matter under any other business.  </p> <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  No. 297A is a briefing document from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for today&rsquo;s meeting.   Is it agreed that we note and publish it?  Agreed. </p> <p>  No. 312A is an opening statement from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.   We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  Category B correspondence is from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings.  The first item, since the last meeting, is correspondence dated 6 February 2017 from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This is a follow-up to the appearance of the Department and Tusla before the committee on 19 January 2017.  We will note and publish that.  People are free to make comments once the correspondence is published.  </p> <p>  No. 300B is correspondence dated 16  February 2017 from Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, An Ceann Comhairle, regarding the staff resources and the PAC secretariat.  As we dealt with this matter in private session yesterday we can note the matter. </p> <p>  No. 301B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills regarding the production of financial statements at the National College of Art and Design.  The correspondence states that the college is working with the Comptroller and Auditor General and that while there are ongoing compliance issues the Department is confident that these issues will be rectified in the near future.  I am sure through the natural course of the examination of the accounts and statements laid weekly we can keep an eye out for this.  We will watch and monitor the matter as we go along.</p> <p>  No. 302B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the presentation of the 2012 and 2013 financial statements for The Gathering Project 2013 Limited.  They were laid on the 2 February and were noted by the committee at last week's meeting.   We will note the correspondence.  </p> <p>  No. 303B is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, Director General of the HSE.  The letter recommends that before the Department and the HSE are before the Committee on 9 March 2017, to discuss the fair deal scheme, that the committee visit a public residential community facility.  Would any member like to comment on the invitation that is worthy of consideration?  We have received a letter from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien who has suggested that when considering this matter we should look at some of the State nursing homes and see how a good one operates.  I note that he has recommended we visit a place in Mountmellick, County Laois.  Perhaps it is a coincidence but the place is located in my area.  Maybe it is not a coincidence.  I do not know.   Mr. O'Brien has a point.  We must get a proper feeling of what is provided in HSE institutions versus what is provided in nursing homes.</p><p>We know HSE institutions have a lot of people that the nursing homes do not cater for.  If we are evaluating them strictly on a cost basis and on value for money we have to take into account the quality of the service being provided.  I think that is what is behind that particular letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00200"><p>I certainly welcome that because the level of dependency that I have seen in public nursing homes in Galway and in the county, when we had one in Galway, was extraordinary.  There is a facile debate, not even a debate but a facile public relations campaign, going on into private nursing homes to suggest they are much cheaper.  Certainly I welcome that as the complexity of finance for public nursing homes is not being looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00300"><p>I will put in one more item on this.  While I stress I had no role in or knowledge of the invitation before it arrived, if the committee agrees to visit Mountmellick I would put in a proviso that we visit the Abbeyleix community nursing unit on the same day, though not to add any extra time.  The reason for this is a decision by the HSE to close that unit.  In all published documentation, it is listed as the most expensive unit in the country per patient per week.  I think we should have a short visit there.  The level of patients in it has diminished dramatically but the cost structure is very high.  It think it would give a good balance.  Mountmellick might be excellent in terms of facilities and costs whereas Abbeyleix might provide a contrast.  I leave it open to the committee.  I am not suggesting anything.  I am guided by the committee and I am conscious that it is my own constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00400"><p>I assume the proposal the HSE has made is in the context of the cost comparisons between public and private facilities.  I have no difficulty with it.  I think it is a good idea for us to visit any one of the public ones but if that is the case should we also, on the basis of balance, visit a private facility?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00700"><p>We will try to set a date for the visit to Mountmellick.  Perhaps we might arrange with some of the nursing home associations to have a visit to a private nursing home that can be reached on the same day, rather than heading to somewhere 150 miles away or something like that.  Or do we want to go there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00800"><p>I think it is a good idea.  The comparison has to be fair.  I do not think any of us will dispute that.  It is more than money.</p> <p>  Where there have been such visits previously, is there a better take-up from committee members when it is closer?  If only one or two people go will we get full value for it?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C00900"><p>We will agree that we will not travel unless there is a reasonable quorum.  There is no point in two people travelling.  Unless four, five or six are travelling, and if more all the better, we will not go.  It would not inform the full committee if only two or three people were to go.  Will we ask the secretariat to contact members to try to determine a suitable day?  Perhaps Tuesday morning before we get here would be appropriate.  We could do a 9 a.m. visit.  Mountmellick is only an hour from Dublin.</p></speech>

She could take it into Portlaoise from Galway and Portarlington.  We will work out the transport arrangements.  We agree that it is a good idea.  Maybe we will drop the Abbeyleix visit but should we visit a private nursing home at the same time?  I am very conscious of a group of us walking into a nursing home.  I am sensitive about that.  I would not like to intrude on any patient or resident's dignity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C01400"><p>I do not think we should rush off to look at nursing homes.  I do not think it is our role.  A particular point has come up here in respect of high levels of dependency in public nursing homes.  That is our starting point.  We should make decisions on what we will do after that, rather than rushing into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C01500"><p>Okay.  We will thank them for the invitation and we will hold over the issue for now.  We will just hold on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C01600"><p>I beg the Chairman's pardon.  I am not saying that we should not visit a public nursing home but that the issue that has come before us is the high dependency level and issues like that.  I do not think we should rush off to visit a public nursing home and feel we have to balance it with private nursing homes.  I do not think that is necessary at this point.  I think it is necessary to gather information and elucidate what the HSE is trying to point out to us, that is, that there is an unfair comparison.  Perhaps we could include such a visit after that.  I would have no problem with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#C01700"><p>Perhaps then we will pick a private nursing home more convenient to here.  We will agree in principle to accept the invitation, subject to timing, but I think it will probably be after Easter in any event.  We will not set a date just yet.  I am not quite sure.  We will ask the secretary to liaise with a view to facilitating this.  We want to respect the dignity of the residents when we visit the place too.  I am sure the HSE will ensure that happens in any event.</p></speech>

Perhaps a Tuesday morning.  We will ask the secretariat to liaise.  If we get it far enough in advance it should be possible.  Again I stress that a minimum number going is an important factor as well.  We will move on.</p> <p>  No. 307B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from NAMA regarding clarification of information sought from Project Eagle.  What is that?</p></speech>

It is just clarifying information.  We will note that.  We have already examined that in our report.</p> <p>  No. 308B 1-3 is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Maurice Quinn, Secretary General at the Department of Defence.  This is in follow-up to the appearance of the Department before the committee on 26 January and its subsequent request for information.  We might hold this over until next week.  I have not had an opportunity to study it and I would like to do so.  We will hold it over to next week.  It will be on next week's correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category C correspondence is regarding private individuals.  No. 299C is correspondence dated 10 February 2017 received from an individual in respect of the North Meath Community Development Association.  This matter is being dealt with in the Department and we await a response from the Minister.  When we receive that we will advance it further.  We will note that.</p> <p>  No. 304C is correspondence received from an individual alleging misconduct by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a waste of public money by garda&iacute;, the Judiciary and State-paid solicitors in another Department.  I propose that the Clerk to the Committee advise the person to take the matter up with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the first instance.  If there is alleged corruption in the Garda or use of resources to intimidate then that may be investigated.  Is it agreed that we tell the individual, if he has a complaint against the garda&iacute;, to take it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 305C is correspondence dated 13 February 2017 from an individual following correspondence from the committee.  While the individual may feel that the committee is dismissing his correspondence by contacting the Arts Council for an explanation, it is normal procedure for the secretariat to contact the relevant body.  We considered this individual's correspondence at some length quite recently.  We will write back to the individual and state that we are noting his correspondence and we now consider the case closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 306C is correspondence dated 13 February 2017 from the social care division of the HSE in follow-up to correspondence to the committee received regarding Nua Healthcare.  Does Deputy Cullinane want to comment on this?  Should we forward it to Nua Healthcare or does he want to come back to it next week?</p></speech>

The Deputy is happy to note that.</p> <p>  That is correspondence received.  The next item is on reports and statements of account received since the last meeting.  I will open up this particular topic by acknowledging a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published on this issue during the week, that is, Special Report No. 95, financial reporting in the public sector.  It was published on 21 February 2017.  It was completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the timeliness of financial reporting in the public sector.  Most public sector bodies are required to have their accounts prepared within three months.  Two thirds of all bodies missed that deadline.  That is 200 out of approximately 300.  We are not talking about the direct line Departments, which meet the deadlines for annual audit and the appropriations account.</p><p>It is to do with the bodies and I have therefore asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce a list of those on a Department-by-Department basis to see which Departments are the principal offenders.  We will then call in those Accounting Officers.  The Department of Health one, due to the establishment of the ETBs, was a set-up situation so there are understandably quite a lot of delays in that area.  Notwithstanding that, the education sector has been a particular problem.  I do not believe the Accounting Officers have paid sufficient attention to this area.  They come in looking for money for public bodies every year and they have no idea why they are not in the audited accounts that have already been submitted in respect of prior years.  Our committee will be putting down a marker on that.  It is directly related to the report, Financial Reporting in the Public Sector, which was published only two days ago.  </p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General might say a few brief words on this topic to which we will return as we have a special report on it.  We will not discuss it today but I just want to highlight it.</p></speech>

Since this committee has been in office, I have been trying to push the idea that prompt submission of financial statements is important.  There are structural difficulties in the system and I have tried to set those out in a fair way in the report.  I hope it is comprehensive and I will try to repeat it.  This relates to the 2014 year of account.  I will try to update it for 2015 so the committee will have up-to-date information.  I will also try to replicate that reporting annually in order that a focus can be kept on this.  The committee, ourselves and the audited bodies have succeeded in bringing forward the financial report and progress has been made.  I would like to put that on the record.  Even further progress has been made in 2016 but we are still in a situation where many bodies are quite late in completing the financial reporting process.  That means that information is coming to the committee too late to address problems in a timely way.</p></speech>

At year-end of 2016, a full 12 months after the end of 2015, we had just 16 sets of financial statements where the audit had not been completed.</p></speech>

We will return to that topic because there is a special report.  The item before us today is to note the financial statements and accounts received since our meeting of Thursday, 16 February 2017.  The first item is 4.1 - the Health and Safety Authority, which has a clean audit report.</p> <p>  The next item, 4.2, is the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency's &euro;16.9 million turnover.  It has a clear audited opinion and it relates to the 2015 accounts.  It provides services and supports for social housing to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can explain a reference in his report to the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  At the end of the 2014 audit that agency seems to have been substantially in arrears, according to page 30 of the report.  Is that the same organisation we will be asking the Department about?</p></speech>

Even at the stage we were doing the report, we were indicating that it had not been completed by the end of 2015.  Therefore the 2014 audit dragged into the beginning of 2016.  The Chairman can see there that was probably in January or February of 2016.</p></speech>

Today the committee is dealing with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Next Thursday, 2 March, it will be the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We will be dealing with the central fund of local authorities, as well as progress on land aggregation and the departmental Vote.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 9 March it will be the HSE, dealing with patients' private property accounts, financial statements on the fair deal scheme and the health repayments scheme donations fund.  Those are three specific topics for the HSE, so it will not be a general HSE discussion. </p> <p>  On Thursday, 23 March we will have the Department of Education and Skills.  Can we start by agreeing some suggested dates for the third level colleges?  We do not want it to take too many weeks.  It is now in front of us on the screen.  These are possibilities that are all subject to confirmation.  I want members to have an indication of where we are going but the dates may change.  They are possibilities for people to work on, however.</p> <p>  On 30 March we will examine the University of Limerick, University College Cork and NUI Galway.  We will have to bring in each group separately, but it is a matter for us to decide.  We will have a limited time for each group.  If we did them one or two at a time it would take us from here to the summer recess.  We want to cover them all, so we might restrict the number of questioners.  Some members might ask questions of the first institution, while three or four might ask the next one.  We will work that out, but if all 13 of us ask questions of every institution that comes in we will be here forever.  We might therefore plan our own progress and timetable.  </p> <p>  The plan is to try to do three institutions, but they will be long days if we are having three.  There will be breaks at the end of each session, but if we did them any slower we would be here for far too long.  There are other items to get on to.  That is a possibility for 30 March.  </p> <p>  On the 6 April, we will examine Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology and the Higher Education Authority.  Can they come any earlier or is that the suggested date?</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence concerning the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call the Comptroller and Auditor General who will make a short opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#E03000"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The 2015 appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport received a clear audit opinion, with no material issues arising for reporting.  The account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.73 billion in 2015.  Receipts into the Vote totalled &euro;406 million, &euro;370 million of which was accounted for by a transfer of funding from the local government fund, which the committee will be aware is substantially funded by motor taxation receipts.</p> <p>  The gross Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across five expenditure programmes, as outlined in the diagram on screen.  The bulk of the spend was under the Department&rsquo;s land transport programme, accounting for 81% of its total expenditure.  I understand that the Accounting Officer will provide more detail on the programme expenditure in his opening remarks.</p> <p>  Just under 85% of the Vote expenditure related to funding provided to other public bodies in the form of current and capital funding.  A number of the bodies are significant grant awarding bodies in their own right.  I have prepared a diagram which is on the next page of my statement - it might be put up the screen - which tries to summarise and categorise the bodies under the aegis of the Department.  I will explain the diagram.</p> <p>  A number of the bodies the Department overseas are within my audit remit and so there are reports on the financial statements of those bodies and they come before the committee.  The more substantial ones that fall into that category are Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Sport Ireland.  All of those are substantial grant awarding bodies in their own right.</p> <p>  In addition, there are other bodies under the aegis of the Department which are substantially funded by the Department for their operations or which are regulators.  All of those come within my remit, for instance, the Road Safety Authority, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the Commission for Railway Regulation, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</p><p>Funding is also provided from the Vote to Tourism Ireland Limited.  This is an all-Ireland body that was set up under the 1998 agreement which is audited by me in conjunction with my equivalent in Northern Ireland.  It also receives funding in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Then there is a set of commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department that are not audited by me - members will be familiar with that - and therefore do not directly fall within the remit of the committee either.  These include the CIE Group, the harbour boards, Dublin Airport Authority, the Shannon Group and the Irish Aviation Authority.  I also pointed out that there is funding from the Department to Sport Ireland and through it to national sports governing bodies and local sports clubs and so on.  Again, they are not audited by me but, depending on the scale of the funding, I may have inspection rights.</p><p> Finally I draw attention in the diagram to the existence of the Irish Coast Guard, which is part of the Department.  It is an agency within it.  I prepared the diagram because I thought there were quite a number of bodies and it might be helpful to the committee to understand the relationship between the bodies and the Department. </p><p> On the Vote outturn for 2015, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved a Supplementary Estimate of a net &euro;100 million for Vote 31 in November 2015.  This was mainly to allow additional capital funding for investment in roads, rail and light rail networks and bus fleet.  At the year end, a net &euro;22 million remained unspent.  The sum of &euro;16.1 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2016 with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result, just under &euro;6 million was liable for surrender at the end of the year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300002#F00300"><p>I have provided members with a detailed briefing on the 2015 appropriation account which is the subject of today&rsquo;s hearing.  My Department was not the subject of focus in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2015 so the briefing the committee has describes spending programmes across the entire Vote.<br/><br/>In 2015, the Department&rsquo;s overall gross expenditure was &euro;1.6 billion.  Our final outturn for the year, thanks to a Supplementary Estimate, was over &euro;1.7 billion.  The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided between five main expenditure programmes and the administrative budget.  As Deputies will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis which we oversee in accordance with the code of practice for the corporate governance of State bodies.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for the diagram, which is very helpful this morning.  Much of the funding within this Vote is channelled through these State agencies and, as pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, they are audited separately in terms of that expenditure.<br/><br/>In 2015, 80% of the Vote went towards the land transport programme, at almost &euro;1.3 billion.  This programme provides for spending in the area of roads and public transport.  The roads programme spent almost &euro;730 million, covering national, regional and local roads as well as PPP operational payments.  The bulk of this funding is spent on the maintenance and upkeep of our road network, with some limited funding for new road developments.<br/><br/>Investment in the public transport infrastructure totalled almost &euro;340 million that year, including Luas Cross City works.  That project is still on target for completion of works and commencement of services this year.  Funding was also provided to the National Transport Authority for PSO buses for the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets and for the continued implementation of various programmes around sustainable travel, traffic management, regional cities and accessibility grants.  The public transport subhead also provides capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann primarily for maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network nationwide under the multi-annual infrastructure manager contract, IMMAC.  In 2015, &euro;209 million was committed towards public service obligation for public transport services.  This was the first time since the fiscal crisis that funding was maintained rather than decreased.  Subsequent budgets for 2016 and 2017 have seen the level of public service obligation funding increase substantially.<br/><br/>The tourism services programme, accounted for 8%<b>, </b>or &euro;120 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  This comprises the programme and administrative spend of the two tourism agencies, that is, F&aacute;ilte Ireland at &euro;56 million and Tourism Ireland at &euro;15 million, as well as the tourism marketing fund at &euro;34 million and the tourism product development programme at &euro;13 million.  At the time, 2015 was a record year for visitor numbers to Ireland, with a total of 8.6 million visitors, an increase of almost 14% on 2014.  These trends have continued.  In 2015, a tourism policy - People, Place and Policy - was launched which set ambitious goals for the sector to 2025.  The year 2015 also saw the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, building on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It is clear that Brexit presents a particular challenge to the tourism sector.  Over recent months, we have been working very closely with the tourism agencies and tourism stakeholders to ensure Ireland is positioned well to address these challenges.<br/><br/>The maritime transport and safety programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;91 million, of the Vote in 2015.  The main expenditure programme here relates to supports to the Irish Coast Guard at &euro;76 million.  In 2015, the Coast Guard responded to over 2,600 incidents and the search and rescue helicopters were tasked over 1,000 times.  The year 2015 also saw significant progress in the modernisation of equipment and processes within the Coast Guard, including a new IT-based incident logging system within the three rescue co-ordination centres.  This new system has greatly improved operational effectiveness and efficiency within the centres.<br/><br/>The sports and recreation services programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;90 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  The programme supported the Irish Sports Council and National Sports Campus, at &euro;57 million.  Both have since merged to form Sport Ireland.  We provide funding to the sports capital programme and the swimming pools programme.  During 2015, significant progress was made in the development of facilities at the National Sport Campus, including work on the development of a new high performance centre, a new multi-purpose campus conference centre.  Work also commenced on the National Indoor Arena which has since been completed.<br/><br/>In 2015, the gross expenditure provision for the aviation programme was &euro;26 million, or 2%, of the Vote.  The largest beneficiary of the funding is the regional airports programme, at &euro;12 million.  This programme also covers costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol and subscriptions to other international organisations.  The year 2015 saw the publication of the national aviation policy following significant stakeholder consultations.  A key element of the policy was the subsequent establishment of a National Aviation Development Forum which had its first annual conference last Monday. <br/><br/>Finally, the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget, at &euro;34 million, represents 1.7% of overall spend.  It covers pay costs for the Department&rsquo;s staff of around 450 in 2015 and administrative overheads such as IT, travel, utilities and accommodation services.<br/><br/>Over recent years, the Department has been proactive in developing new policy responses across its remit on a strong evidence basis.  I have mentioned a number of these already.  However, a particularly important piece of evidence-based policy was the strategic framework for investment in land transport, which we call the SFILT, that was published in August 2015.  This strategic framework considered what role transport needs to play in the future development of the economy and to estimate the appropriate level of investment in the land transport system.  The evidence analysis provided important inputs to the existing capital plan and it will also inform our input to the review of that plan which was announced earlier this month.<br/><br/>I hope that this opening statement has provided the committee with a broad overview of the expenditure areas under my remit and that it has been helpful to the committee as it examines the 2015 appropriation account.</p></speech>

However, I wish to establish the Department's role in terms of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I also want to deal with the public service provision payments, which are under Mr. Doyle's Department's remit.  My first question relates to the public service subvention for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Does Mr. Doyle have the figures on the levels of subvention going back, say, over the past seven or eight years to hand?  For example, would he have the figure for 2010 at his fingertips?</p></speech>

It is not necessarily a level playing field.  I have mentioned just one example.  There are other examples.  The CIE express service cannot use the full motorway, whereas the private operators can do so.  Mr. Doyle has explained that competition rules constitute a legal impediment to the provision of additional subventions, but does he not see that the absence of a level playing field for the public and private operators is a problem in that context?</p></speech>

We have just established that there has been a significant decrease in the subvention payments for public service provision since 2010.  We have also heard from Mr. Doyle today that there has been a freeze in the free travel contribution.  All of this tells me that Bus &Eacute;ireann is facing significant challenges as it seeks to provide a service without the levels of subvention it would have received in the past.  The current situation is of relevance in this context.</p></speech>

The changes that are being made bring that about on a general basis, so, I suppose, the benefit to Ireland is that if we were in that same space again we would actually have to make a prior notification in relation to it.

I signalled to the Chairman in advance that I would raise this and I have sent a copy of the transcript to Mr. Doyle.  The Department made additional funding available for regional airports, but we had a Minister in Waterford who said there was absolute resistance from departmental officials to fund Waterford Airport and went on to say that the airport would have been closed were it not for the Minister, Deputy Ross, who was sitting there.  His experience was that it was a terrible job, as he described it, dealing with officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Mr. Doyle has seen that transcript.  I give him the opportunity to respond.  It is a serious charge to make.  It would concern people in Waterford and other areas if the departmental officials were offering that type of resistance to funding regional airports.  I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on that.</p></speech>

The Department has been hugely supportive of the airport over the last number of years.  In the last decade I think approximately &euro;20 million has been allocated to Waterford Airport under the various programmes.  My own experience of dealing with the Department in regard to the airport was always very positive.  While I would not want to put words in other people's mouths, I would be surprised if the airport itself would cite anything other than huge co-operation from the Department in relation to its efforts to try to bring new carriers to the airport, as it has suffered from the loss of a variety of carriers over the last couple of years.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss the PSO aspect of CIE.  If some of the Expressway services were relinquished and returned to PSO, is it true that the National Transport Authority would have to find money out of its current funds to cover the PSO aspect of those services if they went out to tender?</p></speech>

It did that a couple of years ago in relation to the X5 and X7 routes.  It looks at existing services to see if tweaks can be applied to existing services, be they existing PSO services, rural transport services or otherwise, to try to fill the public transport need.  It will apply some of its budget to do that.  On the last occasion, yes, there was a cost.  I do not have it to hand.  I believe it was a relatively small cost in terms of the backfill that the NTA engaged in.  However, the NTA does ensure it has flexibility in its budget.  While we would always like more budget for PSO services, it does ensure there is flexibility to make changes where it needs to make them.</p></speech>

I am sorry to be giving the Deputy a figure of the top of my head, but in relation to the X5 and X7, my recollection is the cost was something of the order of &euro;1.5 million.  It was a relatively small cost to extend services and they were quite substantial routes.</p></speech>

What is the relationship between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Department of Social Protection in covering those?  There is no obligation on the commercial providers to offer free travel to those with a free-travel pass; some do and some do not.  What evaluation happens between the two Departments to ensure that people are provided with transport?</p></speech>

However the demand varies in relation to that.  That has been what it has been receiving for the last number of years.  The Minister is on record publicly as saying that we are engaging with the Department of Social Protection at the moment in relation to the matter of free travel.  We have a concern that the funding in relation to it has been frozen for a period of time and the demand has been increasing.  So we are engaging with that Department at the moment in relation to the overall amount provided for free travel, which is primarily provided to the CIE group of companies, but, as the Deputy says, is also provided to some private operators.</p></speech>

Some of that is made up from the motor taxation fund.  By my reckoning about a third of that comes from what is collected in motor taxation.  Just after the crash we heard that we would sweat assets.  It is possible to sweat them to the point that they become liabilities.  Might we, or somebody else, be here in five or ten years' time talking about the multiplier effect of not spending now, particularly on road maintenance?  What are we likely to have to spend in addition to what would be required if we had a maintenance budget that was adequate?</p><p>Is there a projection for that?  There is a significant shortfall.</p></speech>

We carried out a significant piece of work which I referred to earlier on, the strategic framework for investment in land transport, SFILT.  The SFILT had a few aims.  A primary aim was maintaining roads.  It is one thing to make a case for opening new roads but it is another to maintain them, although less glamorous.  It is critically important because if the maintenance is not carried out over a period of time then the cost of restoration at some point in the future becomes very significant.</p> <p>  We found from that work that if we applied our total Department Vote to maintaining the land transport network, both roads and public transport, it would be about &euro;300 million per annum shy of what would be needed to maintain what we termed the steady state.  That is if we applied our entire budget to that end.  The shortfall for what we believe we should be providing for the road network compared to what we are providing to maintain it is very significant.  It accumulates over time as I think the Deputy was suggesting in her question.  That has been a significant concern.  That thinking and analysis fed into the capital plan.  It was our primary point of argument for the capital plan as well as looking at key roads projects.  Primarily, we would have argued very strongly to get up to maintaining our current road network.</p></speech>

There is a very significant amount foregone from value-added tax.  It is projected to be &euro;626 million in 2016.  That would not necessarily have found its way into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but is a risk analysis being done about Brexit, currency fluctuations and such?  Is an evaluation being done about whether a different approach might need to be taken, requiring a different funding mechanism?</p> <p>  The &euro;626 million foregone is not exclusively from restaurants and hotels.

We have supported it over the last number of years.  The sector is a significant employer and has been a mainstay of the economic recovery.  We have supported the VAT measures for the industry.  It is probably the key support for the tourism industry, notwithstanding all of the very important work done through our agencies and the various budgets that we provide.</p> <p>  There are some areas, around Dublin and in other parts of the country, where we have been dealing with problems of growth due to concerns that we maintain our cost-competitiveness in the tourism industry, particularly in the light of Brexit, and about constraints in capacity in accommodation.  We are keen to continue to support the industry in the context of Brexit.  We are supportive of the VAT rate and we will argue to maintain it.  I am sure we have some analysis on that.

This is a small number of projects in regard to the various swimming pools projects that were allocated funding previously.  It is very much a demand-led programme so we pay out on the basis of stage payments or completion of works in regard to the projects themselves and we can only do that as we receive those funding requests.  There were delays in a number of those projects.  What we have done more recently is we have looked at the funding available and we put out a call for submissions in regard to other swimming pool projects that could be funded.  Three of those were considered and funding was applied to two of them.  That is the approach we took last year in responding to the fact that funding was not being drawn down.</p></speech>

However, there is a trend, if we look at it on a <i>per capita</i>basis, where areas that would possibly not be in a position to come up with matching funds feature poorly.  For instance, Westmeath was top of that and that could have been for local reasons in a given year but there are places at the bottom of it which are getting a very poor amount of funding relative to their population.  Does the Department look at that scheme in terms of varying the scheme depending the wealth of an area and its ability to come up with matching funding, for example?</p></speech>

What happens is that an assessment of the projects, as they fall, is carried out and there is a rebalancing at the end in terms of spreading the funding to make sure that there is a fair crack of the whip across the country.  The requirement for matching funding in that regard, which was the first part of the Deputy's question, is about 5%.  It is a relatively small percentage, which I appreciate can be difficult to raise, and I know that clubs raise it in a variety of ways from particular sponsorship lump sums, from fundraising activities or whatever.  It is a feature now of very many grant programmes that a certain level of matching funding is required but we keep it relatively low in the sports capital programme.</p></speech>

In terms of how we split it, we have three main programmes which go towards roads - restoration maintenance, which is the surface dressing programme; restoration improvement, which is rehabilitation of payments; and a discretionary grant programme.  Normally, they account for maybe over 85% of our budget for regional and local roads and they are all mileage based.  The only exception is that there is a factor of 1.3 applied for Kildare and Meath because of traffic volumes, and the cities have a factor of 2 applied to them.  Apart from that, it is on a per kilometer basis.</p></speech>

There are actually three different types of contract.  In the first, the contractor carries all the risk regarding traffic.  That was the original batch of PPPs.  The one we have now is simply availability payments and the contractor is not carrying any risk in relation to what traffic uses the road.  Then there were two schemes which were part of the first batch but were too large to have the normal arrangement so that one would not get contractors to carry the risk.

It arises from a representation I received but it is also general point as well and it relates to the decal symbol that one is obliged to display on a taxi.  Taxi drivers seem to be obliged to display these 24 hours a day.  According to the representations I have received, it has serious implications for their insurance.  Could the Department clarify that for me?  Why can they not remove it or use a magnetic system where that could come off when they are using the taxi for family purposes?</p></speech>

I was elected first elected a public representative in 1999.  I cannot tell Mr. Doyle how many public transport documents I have seen in my 17 years.  Smarter Travel Galway is, I would say without exaggeration, the 15th document for Galway alone.  We have massive congestion on our roads at peak times.  Galway, in particular, is a medieval city and it has massive traffic on its roads at peak times only and an unsustainable reliance on cars.  I am not blaming the cars.  We have put nothing in place, despite all of these documents.</p> <p>  I have here another lovely framework.  I could not but praise the Government on Towards a National Planning Framework.  I am actually praising the Government on this matter.  The document states the framework will address matters, including "Promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas including measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the necessity of adaptation to climate change".  It sounds wonderful.  The reality is far from wonderful, despite all these lovely documents.  In fact, for Galway city, there is an N6 project - another road.  This is under the Department's watch, where we have one window of opportunity in regard to climate change.  This is the last D&aacute;il that will come up with meaningful action on climate change.  Otherwise, it is too late.  That is what all of the non-governmental organisations are telling us.  Yet the solution in Galway is a road.  All the public transport elements have been tagged onto it.  In fact, only yesterday the news was that they have now delayed the public consultation period for the N6 project because of the massive volumes of submissions.  I predict that the vast amount of those submissions state: "Please, do not go ahead with a road, please, go public transport and please, go light rail."  That is my longest question and I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on it.</p></speech>

These are positives but Galway needs better solutions.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's comments on strategies.  To specifically address the Deputy's comment that a big part of the solution is a road, Galway, of the cities around the country, is the one city that really has not had a relief road, bypass or something that takes cars out of the centre.  There are very few people who I encounter who are more adamant about public transport versus roads than the people on the National Transport Authority.  My understanding is that they are supportive of the concept of a road in this case because it allows for greater public transport use through the city.</p></speech>

That is what they tell us.  I have a completely different point of view.  It is based on 17 years of going down a cul de sac in regard to an outer bypass with millions of euro spent on it.  Then we go forward with a road.  It is not an outer bypass; it is a ring-road.  The public transport elements are tagged on to it.  There is no paradigm shift here on the part of the Department and certainly on the part of the officials in Galway, on the reality that we cannot go on building roads.  In regard to the road, the evidence is that more than 90% of the cars want to go into the city because that is where the industry, the university, the GMIT, the hospitals, etc., are.  We need public transport.</p><p>The Department needs to examine its policies in regard to reducing emissions in the context of climate change and to develop a policy around reducing the volume of traffic on our roads in that context also.  The Department has a responsibility to do that.  Even if the road was the solution it cannot be built in the near future.  An increase in school transport provision for the pupils of the 30 to 35 schools in this 2 km zone would reduce the volume of traffic on this road.  I am sure the response to that proposal will be that school transport is a matter for another Department.  However, it is one solution.  </p><p> We must insist on public mobility plans in every industry and institution.  The bicycle scheme mentioned is very limited.  I am a cyclist.  The scheme is tourism rather than commuter based.  While it is welcome, it is limited in terms of what it can achieve.  The philosophy appears to be one of add on public transport but keep going the road. </p></speech>

Public transport must be central in all that we do.  Leaving aside all of the issues around climate change and so on, the level of commuting is expected to increase significantly over the next number of years.  As there is not sufficient road space to cope with this, the only way we can handle it is through increased public transport provision.  For that reason, public transport is central in all that we do.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that only 8% of people in Galway use the bus service.  People in Galway do not use the buses because the service is not frequent enough.  There have been many proposals for a light rail system.  I read an article in one of today's newspapers in which Mr. Conor Faughnan calls for a light rail system.  A group of us in Galway have continually called for such a service as the most sustainable way forward in terms of the current road infrastructure.  I would welcome further engagement with Mr. Doyle on the issue of sustainable transport but I will settle at this point for a response to the other questions I posed.</p></speech>

The current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been very vocal about Glenalbyn swimming pool, which is in his constituency.  It also happens to be in my constituency.  This pool was closed in December 2013 and in-filled in December 2016.  What is the role of the Minister and the Department with regard to swimming pools?  I am sure this is not the only swimming pool alluded to today.  This is not a desirable situation.  It is, in fact, an extremely upsetting and distressing situation for the local communities concerned.  Perhaps Mr. Doyle would provide some feedback on this issue.</p></speech>

The funding is carried forward.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred earlier to the carry forward of capital in our Vote.  Funding carried forward under the swimming pools programme would form part of that.  As I said, funding in regard to the particular swimming pools mentioned is not lost rather it is carried forward if there is a delay.</p> <p>  In regard to swimming pools in general, I accept the comments made.  As a Department, we are very supportive of swimming pools contributing to our overall objectives in terms of participation in sport and physical activity.  This will be taken into consideration in the context of capital funding provision under the sports programme over the next number of years, the review of the capital plan and in terms of the sports policy on which work is currently under way.  </p></speech>

The city centre, in terms of traffic, comes to a stand-still on a rainy day never mind during stormy weather.  What work is undertaken by the Department in terms of projecting assistance in that situation?  As a result of stormy weather, there were lengthy delays on the DART and Luas services this morning and traffic congestion was very bad.  It is not acceptable that this is allowed to occur in our capital city.  More funding should be directed towards research programmes to address this issue. Are there programmes of this type in place?</p></speech>

The NTA operates various models in regard to traffic congestion.  For example, we know that an additional 5% increase in traffic on our roads leads to a significant increase in the level of congestion on our roads.  Our objective in terms of being a facilitator for transport and economic activity that helps to energise the economy, is to avoid that.  We want avoid congestion in a general sense or of the type that occurred today which causes a drag on the economy.  It is the case that weather on a given day can impact on congestion unless people are prepared to travel by bicycle in windy conditions and so on.  We see an exaggerated sense of a congestion problem on a day like to day.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

The other third comprises vehicular traffic.  The smarter travel programme involves making small interventions, for example to improve cycling facilities, and there is also a demonstration element to the work.

There may be a potential to extend it on a year-by-year basis for up to three years.  There was a review of search and rescue and the new contract provides for significantly updated and more capable helicopters.  We previously used S-61 helicopters with 30 year old airframes but they were replaced with the S-91 helicopter.</p></speech>

Why did that happen and is there a departmental policy not to use the PAS?  Please do not tell me that it is down to each agency to decide.  Surely the Department can issue a policy to the effect that it believes in and supports the PAS and that the PAS will be used for the filling of all major vacancies.  First, why did that not happen at F&aacute;ilte Ireland?  This is not a political point, as I have done the political thing with the Minister, Deputy Ross.

When did someone within the Department first discover that in the context of the deal done with Norwegian Airlines to fly into Ireland, which is being announced as we speak and which is welcome in a broad sense, the majority of the flights would be in and out of Dublin?  This has been going on for 15 months.  There was a good announcement for Cork today but the fact is that it was hung off the concept that the flights would be in and out of Cork.  In fact, for 15 months, all we heard about was Cork.  I understand that what has been announced today is that there will be 12 flights for Dublin, six flights for Belfast, four flights for Shannon and three flights for Cork.  As far as I am concerned, this is a Trojan horse.  I welcome the fact that they are coming into this country and the fact that we will have our first ever transatlantic flights out of Cork as opposed to the other airports.  There are no flights for Knock which supported this, which raises other questions.  When did the Department first know that there would be flights out of Dublin?</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he could also provide me with correspondence - e-mails or letters - between the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and the Department about this matter over the past 15 months?  There might not be much material but I would appreciate it if we could receive it.  The DAA, which is an agency under the remit of the Department, sold a project that was then supported for bringing transatlantic flights to Cork.  What we have today is an announcement that is effectively part of an agenda to bring a third terminal to Dublin.  Coincidentally, the Minister announced a few days ago that a study into a third terminal would take place.  What we have here is a strangulation of the other airports.  After today, I have no confidence in the board of the DAA.  By using Cork as a Trojan horse, the DAA has effectively pushed up passenger numbers for Dublin.  I welcome the fact that Norwegian Airlines is being brought in but the way this was done needs to be investigated.  We need to get to the bottom of what was really going on here.  If you look at projections for all other airports in this country, from 2012 to now, Dublin has gone from 81% to 86% of all passengers while all other airports have gone down.  Mr. Doyle has a very good knowledge of this area.  I want to find out how long this was going on.  As far as I am concerned, there was a DAA agenda and I want to know whether or not the Department was complicit in this.  I take Mr. Doyle's bona fides.  He told me that he only found out a couple of weeks ago.  I want to know who in the Department first knew about this.</p></speech>

The issue for me is very simple.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is driving down to Cork today to welcome this.  I welcome the fact that there will be three flights into one destination and not into Boston or New York, as was said.  I believe they are going to Providence.  This was sold as a game changer and it is a positive move for Cork.  However, it was sold as being about Cork.  I want to know if the DAA was always looking at Cork or whether there was underlying agenda in order to get it into Dublin.  By coincidence, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has just announced his review regarding a third terminal at Dublin.  This needs to be worked out.</p></speech>

Being a rural Deputy, I am aware of the importance of such services.  I come from Kilkenny.  Expressway services are important for connectivity in rural Ireland.  We have PSO lines, many of which go to Dublin.  The format for Expressway should be changed.  I am speaking about the south east.  I accept a bus starting in Waterford, stopping in Kilkenny and Carlow and going straight to Dublin is an express bus but, as Deputy Cullinane said, I do not accept a bus that starts in Waterford and stops in Ballyhale, Mullinavat, Paulstown and Gowran, which are all little towns in Kilkenny, and connects up the whole way is an express bus.  This involves nine stops.  That is not an express bus.  That is a different criterion and the sooner the NTA or the Minister - whoever is in charge of this - changes the statement that it is an express bus, the better.  It is not an express bus.  I can understand an express bus involving getting on in one place, having two stops and then heading on to Dublin.  The reason I am saying this is because of the PSO.  My understanding is that under the law, we cannot subsidise an Expressway route but if the criteria were changed, it could be looked at.  Due to the ongoing negotiations and the possible breakdown of the talks between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions, I fear that we will lose services in rural Ireland.  The Minister needs to meet the parties.  I know the matter has nothing to do with the Department.</p><p>The Minister must get these people around the table.  He must get in representatives of the National Transport Authority, the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann and sit around the table with them.  The free travel is another issue.  It has been frozen since 2010.  Figures were mentioned and that can be looked at.  At least half the money could be got from those and the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann could work out the other problems they have.  Can the witness influence this so that connectivity can be kept in rural Ireland in order to keep it alive?  The Government is talking about keeping rural Ireland alive but unless people have services every day to go to colleges, the airport or shopping, we will see more isolation, particularly with older people.</p></speech>

They were dealt with through what is called a direct award contract.  The package of services within that is open to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to contract with the operator, or Bus &Eacute;ireann in the case of many of its services.  It provides funding or subsidy to enable those services to operate.  The services mentioned by the Deputy as going through a number of towns - which they do in many cases - were presented by Bus &Eacute;ireann as commercial services.  At the time they were profitable and would not have received subvention.  I explained to Deputy Cullinane earlier that the National Transport Authority licences those services.  It does not require Bus &Eacute;ireann to make the stops that it does and it is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to seek revision of those licence conditions in terms of where a bus stops and taking into account where other operators stop.</p> <p>  If Bus &Eacute;ireann decides to do that, to the extent that those services were covering a public service or a need for a public service, it is open to the NTA to bring about a solution that prevents people who need those public services from being denied them.  It does that in a number of ways.  It can extend existing PSO services in some instances to backfill the service.  It can make changes in some of the rural transport programme to provide the services or it can tender services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann or somebody else could apply for those.  That is how it would be dealt with.</p></speech>

They were the national primary routes.  When the motorway was built, they were not changed.  We opened the services to private contractors but they are taking the cream.  They are not under obligation to go to the small villages and towns off the motorway that are in need of services.  We need to change the criteria fast and if we do not, we will lose the services.  In fairness, Bus &Eacute;ireann is still giving a service on many routes but it will lose &euro;9 million this year.  That cannot continue.</p> <p>  Can private operators take this cream and go away?  Should there not be an obligation on them to provide some kind of service to rural areas?  If there is not, the public service obligation should be given to Bus &Eacute;ireann or whatever private operator can provide the existing services.  They need subsistence to keep the services in place and they are not viable on their own.</p></speech>

It is regulated competition, with the National Transport Authority being the regulator.  One must apply for a licence and get it or an altered version if one is prepared to accept it.  The NTA has refused more licences in this regard than it has accepted over recent years.  There are large chunks of the public who want to travel on direct services.  At this point the market has grown to the extent that there are approximately 23 million passenger journeys on commercial services, of which Bus &Eacute;ireann at this point accounts for approximately 30%.  The market has grown very significantly and we see many more people travelling on public transport as a result of that measure.  If this results in a position where Bus &Eacute;ireann can no longer serve towns that must be served, there is a mechanism that can be used.  In fairness to the National Transport Authority, it has been at pains in recent times - as recently as yesterday in a committee room here - to point out that it has the power to step in if Bus &Eacute;ireann pulls away and a public service need must be met.</p></speech>

Old people are being put in minibuses, etc.  I am talking about existing services, with buses of 45 or 50 seats, that go to Dublin.  The luxury buses are being taken away and a substandard services would be substituted.  That will not work.  Rural Ireland deserves its whack too from the PSO.  Much of it goes to Dublin, although I know there are 1.2 million people here and they need public services.  We in rural Ireland need public services too and it is a matter of balancing the issue.  That must be done.  We cannot have some kind of substandard service that people will not use because of timescales and buses not being up to scratch.  I attended a presentation last week relating to this and I have been told a substandard service has been substituted and it is nothing like what was there before.  It is not working.  I want to hold what we have with a proper service.</p></speech>

The Department is very anxious to serve the transport needs of citizens throughout the country.  I can give the Deputy a rough figure as it is while since we have run the calculation but my understanding is that we spend approximately 80% of our overall budget outside the greater Dublin area, depending on how that is cut.  We are very anxious to provide services throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am being very parochial in mentioning Waterford regional airport again.  There are four regional airports getting subsistence of &euro;12 million.  Is that correct?

With Kerry and Donegal there is a PSO air service, with a subsidy in that instance paid to airlines to operate a route, essentially, between those airports and Dublin.  In other cases, all airports can apply for funding.  At this point there are approximately four funding streams and what they really amount to is an ability for the Department to assist an airport in funding its safety and security activities.  Last year, Waterford Airport was the biggest recipient of funding under that programme, getting just over &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

Since the downturn in 2008, there has been a big shortfall in local authority funding.  Roads are funded partly by the authority itself and then by grants from central funding.  Are there plans to increase the funding because roads are falling behind?  I have seen reports stating they are falling behind by four or five years and that we will have a big problem if we do not start to increase funding.</p> <p>  Vehicle taxes in general are all going into the Exchequer.  Is all the money from vehicle tax around the country spent on roads or was some syphoned off to Irish Water and such bodies?  What is the division in places such as Leitrim, which would not have a high number of vehicles by comparison with the likes of Kilkenny?  What way is it divided up?</p></speech>

There is a link between the local government fund and the expenditure on regional and local roads.  We are very anxious to increase the expenditure on regional and local roads in terms of exactly what the Deputy describes.  If we end up in a situation in which roads are under-maintained over a period, then the costs of correcting them become much more significant later on.  We do not want to store up that problem.</p> <p>  In trying to answer Deputy Catherine Murphy's questions earlier on, I spoke about a significant analysis we had done that has informed our input into measures such as the capital plan, for example, whereby we quantified the underexpenditure in relation to what it cost to maintain what we call the steady state, or what it costs to maintain what we have, whatever about investing in new stuff.  What it costs to maintain what we have is significant because once one builds it, one must maintain it.</p></speech>

I have a number of short questions about some of the subheads.  The main one, which was touched on earlier by Deputy Connolly, relates to the environmental element of some of the programmes.  An additional sum of &euro;74 million was allocated in respect of and spent on heavy rail in 2015.  At what point does Mr. Doyle think the Department and its agencies will start to seriously consider expenditure to electrify the entire network?  That also includes the heavy rail carriages and locomotives.  I appreciate that there is a national policy element to the question but it is within the strategy of the Government and previous Governments to do that.  What sort of spend on a year-on-year basis has been invested in electrification and is there a significant programme of work to be undertaken before the roll-out of such an option for the national rail network?</p></speech>

In an overall sense, between PSOs and capital investment in rail, it takes up approximately 60% of expenditure on public transport.  The electrification of services can be very beneficial as one can run more train paths and it is a nicer and, quite often, better service for people to access.  We talked earlier about the DART underground project, but for that to work it is not just the tunnel itself, it is the wider electrification and that is what brings the benefits.  What we are trying to pursue in terms of priorities around electrification includes starting the works in Balbriggan under the spend in the capital plan.</p></speech>

Possibly, there was nothing in 2015.  In terms of the Balbriggan project, the spend will be of the order of &euro;180 million.  It is of that magnitude.

Rail works best when one is dealing with travel from one high population centre to another and spreading the fixed costs, which are very heavy.  Deputy Farrell does not need me to tell him that.  I do not have an answer for the cost of doing it but I suspect it is in the billions.  Realistically, what we would have to do in terms of expenditure of the efforts and financial resources that we make out under capital plans is that we have to look at what the priorities are.  It is clear to us that the key priorities are the projects I have mentioned, one of which is certainly in under the existing capital plan and we will be pushing for others.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Doyle's point regarding the capital plan.  I am a firm supporter of it.  Clearly, my constituents would be great beneficiaries of it for a number of reasons &ndash; metro north, the airport and the DART extension to Balbriggan - but that is not the sole reason for my raising the issue this morning.  In fact, the primary reason is from an environmental perspective but also from the public expenditure side.</p> <p>  My other question relates to metro north.

A lot of the work was done a number of years ago.  The DART expansion programme, as we prefer to call it, rather than the DART underground project, based on what we see already, has a positive cost-benefit analysis.  We believe that it has the potential to make significant changes in public transport in Dublin.  We are very supportive of the project but it is a megaproject in the context of Ireland's economy.  It is of a magnitude that it just was not possible to consider in the timeframe of the existing capital plan but for us it is a project that we will be pushing strongly at the centre to try to bring about.  Work was done a number of years ago on the project in very different economic times.  It is the expectation that some of that work can be re-used and, unfortunately, some of it will not be.</p></speech>

The new proposal is coming in significantly cheaper than that but one of the main concerns for a certain cohort of my constituents and beyond on the north side of Dublin is the capacity issue for the metro and its linkages with the existing network.  In terms of the planning and development of metro north and its integration with other transport services within the greater Dublin area the capacity should be front and centre in any consideration of platform length, tunnel capacity, access and egress to those underground stations and other such measures.  It is all well and good to talk about the savings to the Exchequer, which is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts exists, but it is also important to recognise that if we do not build in capacity, at a future point we would end up spending vast sums later in the process on extra carriages but also in terms of ancillary exits and access points for emergency purposes and for general access to stations.  That would be in no one's interests.</p><p>It is a long question, probably with a short answer.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we must future proof these projects.  Work is happening on the Luas cross-city project to extend platforms to provide for longer trams to increase capacity.  That capacity is needed in those tramlines.  This is very important.  The original design of the tunnel for the DART underground was of a particular time and it was where the project was being engineered at that time.  Without falling into any of the traps the Deputy has rightly pointed out, we must redesign it in a way that allows us to find an optimal project that delivers the benefit to public transport we think it can deliver without over-engineering it at the same time.</p></speech>

As a former councillor since 2004, not unlike my colleague Deputy Connolly, although not for as many years as she, I am aware of the spatial strategies of two or three governments.  Is that level of planning still present within the Department, and is the growth of the GDA over the next 20 to 50 years under active consideration along with the infrastructure that would be required?  Have these been costed or is there actual expenditure on it?</p></speech>

Although on a matter completely unrelated to this committee, it was perhaps timely of Warren Deutrom of Cricket Ireland to send me an e-mail at 9 a.m. today.  He lives across the street from the area he talks about, one which will involve the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the near future, and I hope it will also involve the Minister and Ministers of State.  In the context of developing other sports and in looking at strategies for the likes of National Sports Campus Development Authority and the potential investment across the range of services provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department must not just be about sport and transport but must also look at the tourism potential of sport.</p> <p>  For example, 600 million people in India watched a match that was televised in Malahide a couple of years ago.  These are markets we are simply unaware of.  This sport is considered a minority sport in Ireland and yet it has incredible reach.  Cricket in Ireland is about to go up a level in the league structure, which offers incredible potential to Ireland to put its foot in the door of the super league of cricket internationally.  Despite this, we do not have a national stadium or arena for the development of the sport.  Cricket Ireland has quadrupled its membership in four years.  We are talking about an explosion in support, and not just in the north of Dublin.  It is also happening elsewhere.  There is an active cricket club in each of the 32 counties in the island of Ireland.  This should be considered by the Department.  I appreciate the Chairman's leeway to me, but I believe the Department should consider this in terms of future planning whenever the policy decision might arise.  I wanted to take the opportunity to address that.</p></speech>

The first round of speakers have put their questions.  We will have some supplementary questions shortly, but I first want to ask about local sports grants.  Perhaps the witnesses can give the committee a breakdown county by county of grants, between public bodies and the voluntary community sporting organisations.  There was a time they would all go to public bodies but now an increasing amount of a county's allocation seems to be going to local authorities to enable them to do work, which is also good.  I would appreciate the breakdown, however, county by county.</p> <p> The Department might also supply the committee with a breakdown of the funding for the Olympic Council of Ireland for 2014 to 2017, inclusive.  Will the witnesses indicate the Department's satisfaction with spending by the Olympic Council of Ireland given the funds provided to it by the Department?  Please start with the figures.</p></speech>

This work is about ensuring that those penalty points delivered at that point in time are put on a licence, so we do not have people out there who should have received penalty points on their licences who are not getting them.

That is not a satisfactory arrangement in terms of road safety issues.  I have to start at the beginning because Mr. Doyle has told me that he has not solved this problem at all.  The problem today is as acute as it was before he looked at it a few years ago, and it has not yet been sorted.  I mentioned a lot of different databases in the system that do not talk to each other and that is still the case.  For the benefit of the public, can Mr. Doyle explain fixed charge notices versus penalty points?  A driver gets penalty points, but there are also get fixed-charge notices and these are separate from penalty points.  Are they on-the-spot fines?  Can Mr. Doyle explain who gets what?</p></speech>

We have extensive databases around the national vehicle and driver file.  The concern about this is that there are a number of parties involved.  We have garda&iacute; issuing fixed-charge notices, ourselves processing, and then the courts.</p></speech>

I accept that this is a crude way of doing it.  What factors are these figures measured against?  New communities that consist of nothing more than a collection of houses will not have the same ability to deliver as communities that are able to add to what is already there.  When these figures are being drawn up, is the level of need analysed or measured, or are these decisions made purely on the basis of who comes forward to make an application?  The cities seem to do quite poorly when these grants are allocated.  When the figures are set out on a per capita basis, Dublin, Cork and Limerick are all at the lower end of the scale.  A similar point can be made about some counties that have had recent growth.  Although Dublin definitely benefits when funds are given to national bodies like the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, the benefits of that expenditure are felt more widely.  It strikes me that such allocations should be catalogued separately, at least in part, in the interests of fair play in the distribution of these moneys.  What are these allocations matched against?  How is the level of need captured?</p></speech>

We are careful to have clear criteria when we are assessing applications under that programme.  When we make a call for applications, we set out a range of principles and criteria that will be considered.  Essentially, marks are assigned to those factors when applications are being assessed.  I understand that the Minister and the Minister of State intend to publish detailed criteria in this regard tomorrow.  They will explain that the assessment will be carried out in line with what was set out in the requests for expressions.  Consideration is given to a range of criteria including participation levels, the involvement of disadvantaged groups and the numbers that may benefit from the sports facility in question.</p></speech>

Is there an analysis of what should be there but is not there?  What needs are not being met by the scheme as it currently operates?  I can look at those questions separately.</p> <p>  My second question relates to our climate obligations.  We will have to pay hard cash if we do not meet certain targets.  Given that transport is one of the three big areas that have an impact on climate, is it likely that the failure to meet these targets will have a direct impact on the Department's budget?  Has an analysis of that been done?  Has consideration been given to how this would be handled?</p></speech>

If Ireland fails to meet its targets and ends up having to pay fines, those fines will not be levied on the transport sector or any other individual sector.  They will be levied at central level and that is where such payments will be made.  The Deputy is correct when she suggests that the challenge in the transport sector is very significant, especially as we try to service increased levels of economic activity.  Transport accounts for approximately one third of emissions.  Approximately 60% of emissions in the transport space come from private cars, 20% of such emissions come from the freight and haulage industry, and a range of other factors, including public transport, account for the other 20%.  The private car accounts for a big chunk-----</p></speech>

At the same time, we are talking about getting more people to use public transport.  That is a comment.</p> <p>  My specific question relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which does great work.  I do not mean to be parochial when I mention a premises in Galway that has been empty for a long time.  The building in question is in a prime spot in Salthill.  The loss of revenue associated with the non-use of this premises is probably an expense.  I do not know.  Does Mr. Doyle know whether F&aacute;ilte Ireland or any of the other agencies under the remit of the Department have similar buildings that are empty?</p> <p>  I also have a general question.  I got a bit carried away when I asked at length about the wonderful smarter travel document, which covers the period from 2009 to 2020.  One of the 41 actions that are to be carried out under the document involves the introduction of a sustainable plan.  When I asked yesterday about what has happened to the sustainable plan, I was told it was decided not to go ahead with it.  Was the smarter travel document reviewed?  How many of the actions were implemented?  When did the review take place?  What did we learn from it about where we are going?  Everyone here believes in public transport.  We know we have to do something about climate change.  Was this wonderful document implemented?  If not, why not?  Was it reviewed?  If not, why not?  What have we learned from it?  As I said earlier, the most recent estimate of the cost of a 16.5 km road that is planned in Galway was &euro;500 million, or over &euro;30 million per kilometre.  It seems that the estimated price of the road has now increased to &euro;600 million and nothing has yet been done.  How can such a price be justified?  I remind the committee that the road will affect two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of residential zoned land that was bought by the city council at a time when prices were at their prime.  One part of this parcel will be the subject of a future meeting of this committee.  The development of two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of land has been frozen because of a proposed ring road that is contrary to every one of the policies on my table, which themselves represent a small proportion of our policies on sustainable transport.  I ask Mr. Doyle to respond to my comment, my specific question and my general question about the need for sense to prevail in Galway.</p></speech>

The key point in response to the Deputy's question is we do not have a view that sustainable transport is something that should exist separately from what we do in transport.  It has to be mainstreamed into what we do in transport.  That has to guide principles.  For example, as Luas cross-city works are being done, significant consideration has to be given on that project to how cyclists can co-exist with the trams.  We should not be considering smart ticketing or any of the other issues that are critically important in terms of getting people out of their cars on to public transport separately.  It is something we should be absolutely mainstreaming.</p></speech>

I forget the exact title of it.  The answer given yesterday is the same one given by Mr. Doyle, namely, that there was no need for an Act because it is part of all Departments' remit.  I will not waste time.  I am disappointed by that because we need overarching legislation.</p> <p>  Of all these action plans, how many were implemented?

When the First Vice-President of the European Commission, Commissioner Frans Timmermans, was here on Tuesday, I took the opportunity to mention the huge progress that Georgia had made.  It has made significant strides on the path to EU accession.  As Mr. Timmermans said, the current mandate of the Commission does not include enlargement policies.  It is important, however, to put on record the huge progress that Georgia has made.  Hopefully, we will see that further step in future.

The organisers of an event and the Provost of the college quite rightly condemned the fact that the Israeli ambassador was denied an opportunity to speak.  People should always be given the opportunity to speak and engage in dialogue, regardless of what views we may hold on the content of their speeches.  The diplomatic corps is about communicating and representing one's country.  That was an unfortunate incident and I hope it will not be repeated anywhere in Ireland in respect of representatives from any other countries.</p></speech>

It is not right that anyone should be denied the right to speak, particularly an ambassador.  The Israeli ambassador, Mr. Boker, does a good job here.  We do not always have to agree on everything.  As the Chairman said, however, it is crucially important that everyone has the right to ventilate his or her point of view.  I strongly condemn the actions of that small group of students who denied the Israeli ambassador the right to speak in Trinity College earlier this week.</p></speech>

From the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, I welcome Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Gioll&aacute;in, chairperson, and Mr. James Clarke, secretary, both from the national management forum.  They are accompanied by Mr. Donald Yourell, director of Longford MABS.  Members have already been circulated with the MABS presentation on 8 February and a copy of the most recent parliamentary question answered by the Department, as background information.  I will invite both bodies to make their opening statements and members will then be invited to address their questions to them.  I remind members to confine their initial round of questions to five minutes.  They can ask supplementary questions after that.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matters of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  It is not just an interference with the meeting as the proceedings are recorded and mobile phones interfere with the sound system.  I invite Ms Mangan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Mangan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#D00300"><p>I thank members for the invitation to address the committee on the matter of the restructuring of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  As members are no doubt aware, the Citizens Information Board, CIB, is the statutory authority responsible for the delivery of MABS services and the use of the State resources for MABS services.  I think I should also point out that CIB is also the statutory authority for the provision of information services and advocacy services.  It provides some of these services directly; for example, it is directly responsible for the Citizens Information website which receives 17 million hits annually.  I realise that today's discussion is about the organisation of MABS but it is important that the context is recognised and that the staff of the CIB have many other responsibilities.</p> <p>  MABS services are entirely State funded.  There are 51 MABS companies, each of which is subject to company law and is required to use the resources provided by the State, that is, by the people of Ireland, in the manner agreed between that company and the CIB.  As the chair of the CIB, I am required to sign off on the annual accounts.  When I do that, I state that I believe and know that the allocated money was spent in the manner outlined.  I am similarly required to sign off on the use of State funds by 42 Citizen Information services' companies.  Within the resources available to the CIB, the many other tasks which it is required to undertake, and the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of State funds, it is very difficult for the board or for me as chair to so satisfy ourselves.</p> <p>  The issue of reorganising the delivery of MABS and Citizens Information services, CIS, has been on the CIB agenda for some time.  In fact, since 2009 when MABS came under the remit of the CIB.  It is regrettable that it has taken so long to reach the point which has now been reached.  While the decision to restructure MABS and the CIS was taken in 2014 by the then board of the CIB, the decision to restructure MABS into eight regional companies was only taken at the most recent board meeting of the CIB last week on 15 February.  The executive of the CIB is now beginning the process of developing the detailed operational project plan for the restructuring.</p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that this decision is about governance, accountability, value for money and using the skills of the employees of the MABS and CIS companies to provide the best possible service to the people who need those services.  The service users will not see any change in the services they receive.  When this decision is implemented, people in need of mortgage advice or struggling to meet a utilities bill or needing advice about any choices they may have about social welfare payments will go to the same place, be looked after by the same people and get the same level of service they currently receive.</p> <p>  In the longer term, the changes will almost certainly result in a better level of service but in the immediate term, there will be no change from the service user's point of view.  The governance of the service providers will have changed but the person in need of the service does not care about the governance.  If one has a serious mortgage problem, one needs the sort of help that MABS can provide and one does not care who is delivering the service.  Similarly, employees of the services &ndash; approximately 2,800 people - will continue to work from the same place and provide the same services.  Nobody will lose his or her job or be moved.  This is a governance issue.  Given that the employees will be relieved of administrative duties, they should be able to provide services to more people or more intensive services than they currently do.</p> <p>  There will be changes for the approximately 800 members of the current local boards.  They will no longer be the employers of the people providing the services but they will have the opportunity to continue as local advisory boards if they wish so they can use their expertise to help their local communities but shed their current administrative burdens.</p> <p>  I would like to give the committee some history about how the current decision was reached.  I do not intend to read out the entirety of the statement, which goes into all the detail, because I recognise that everybody can read and can follow what happened.</p> <p>  A feasibility study was carried out in 2014, and that was the point at which the basic decision to regionalise the structure was taken.  A design group considered the recommendations of the study and in 2015 the design group carried out its work and identified a preferred option for a new regional model for CIS and MABS.  This model was seen as the best solution to the difficulties being experienced by CIB in the delivery of services.  Unfortunately, there was a hiatus while there was no board of CIB and no decisions could be implemented because there was not a quorate board in existence.</p><p> In October 2016, the board, having met all the representative bodies, took the decision to go ahead with the restructure on a regional basis.  We set up a restructuring committee, which I chaired.  It was in place for a period of three months and consisted of three members of the board, four representatives of CIS and MABS and three members of the CIB senior management team.  The decision to regionalise had already been taken so the committee&rsquo;s mandate was to come up with the most appropriate design for a regional structure.  The committee reported back to the board at its meeting last week.  At that meeting, the decision was taken to proceed with the structure as recommended by the restructuring committee.  I emphasise that there is no one perfect structure that will meet all requirements.  We are not suggesting that this is the perfect structure but it is the best we could come up with in the circumstances.  It will involve eight MABS companies and eight CIS companies.  They will each be responsible for a number of counties but there will be roughly equal resources and work involved for each company.  That was the basis on which the decision was made.  </p><p> In terms of regionalisation in Ireland, nobody has ever quite agreed on what should be the appropriate regional structures apart from the provinces and, for example, the GAA in the provinces.  We have had regional assemblies and various forms of regional administration but no one perfect model has emerged.  We have decided on this particular model.  That decision was made last week.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level.  There will be no job losses, no closure of services and no change to the location of any services during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff and, most importantly, there will be no disruption to service users who need to use the services.</p><p> A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources.  At present, we have a very large number of companies, all of which have to be administered and involve a certain level of bureaucracy.  That will be removed and the people who have skills - the information givers and money advisers - will be able to spend their time actually providing information and money advice.  That is the objective of this.  It will improve the service user experience and allow for the development of additional specialist roles where required.  The MABS organisation has, at the request of the Government, taken on a greater role in helping people with mortgage arrears.  It is a specialised area of activity that needs to be further developed.  There are still an awful lot of people in mortgage arrears who are not availing of the service and we want to extend the service to as many people as possible.  It requires skilled staff and we are building up that core of skilled staff to provide the service.</p><p> In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services.  The governance requirements of State boards and voluntary organisations, which the MABS companies are, have all become much stricter and more demanding in recent times.  The feasibility study we carried out recognised, among other things, the need for consolidation of the services in order to provide effective governance and management capability.  The management of and accountability for grants from Exchequer funds is the subject of a 2014 circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The main principles required of companies in receipt of grants are clarity, governance, value for money and fairness.  A comprehensive checklist for grantees, coupled with an increased focus on compliance via reporting requirements is an unsustainable burden for the CIB at present in the context of 93 boards, many of which do not have the capacity or desire to focus on these aspects of their roles.  That is not a criticism of them because their primary role is to provide services to people.  Their primary role is not to be accountable for public money.  The CIB has to be accountable for public money.  A new code of practice for the governance of State bodies came into effect in September 2016, with an associated robust performance agreement with which the CIB needs to comply. </p><p> Recent reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General have requested the CIB to review its financial control arrangements for MABS companies and to request compliance statements for each MABS company supplemented by on-site visits in order to ensure adequate controls are in place across each funded company.  This task will be impossible to fulfil unless the number of funded companies is significantly reduced.  I emphasise that we are amalgamating companies.  We are not changing the level of service but are hoping to improve the level of services.</p><p> One of the most important considerations in the case for change is the potential to improve the services available.  Potential improvements could include greater availability of services in areas where services are not currently available and greater access to a wider range of expertise and services.  The need to ensure that all citizens can access a high-quality, consistent and accurate service throughout the country is critical for both CIB and the services.  Recent developments in quality standards have been progressed in both the CIS and MABS services.  While acknowledging that much has been achieved and that there are some really high-quality services being provided, there is still serious concern and evidence, including direct complaints to CIB about service in some companies, that not all the services are delivering a quality service.  MABS, like most other services in Ireland, provides services that range from extremely good, to average and quite poor.  Very many of them are extremely good, which I acknowledge, but there is no such thing as a service that cannot be improved.  There are significant areas of the country that are not covered by the services.  All of these are factors in all our considerations.</p><p> Under the current structure, there is little that can be done to address these problems because of having to deal with 93 companies.  This lack of a co-ordinated approach can have a detrimental effect on service users.  It also creates risks for services such as leaving them open to complaints relating to poor quality, inaccurate advice and even litigation.  Recent research commissioned by the CIB has confirmed there are variations across services in the level of accuracy and relevance of the advice provided.  While CIB will continue to develop tools to assist services, there are no economies of scale to be derived from having to implement the standards across 93 separate companies.  If the CIB was to carry out all the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 93 companies, we could say goodbye to providing a decent information service which we currently do.  We could also say goodbye to providing a decent advocacy service, which we currently do.  It would not be a good use of resources to keep an eye on all the 93 companies, even if those resources were made available to us.  Instead those resources should be directed towards the provision of better-quality services in information and the money advice services.</p><p> The boards of management and service managers have expressed concerns in recent years about the considerable amount of managerial time being directed into administration with a consequent negative impact on the management of service delivery.  In addition, boards vary in their level of engagement and buy-in to national service developments and in their capacity to oversee the manager&rsquo;s role in implementing these.  Many managers are managing very small numbers of staff and are duplicating the same administrative responsibilities associated with reporting to the board of management and CIB as much larger companies.  The new structure will remove much of the administrative burden and duplication and will free managers up to promote skill development and resulting service improvement.  The existing managerial resources within the networks could potentially be assigned as dedicated service development-delivery managers, business managers and quality managers within the new regions.  Local managers would be asked to focus on quality assurance tasks and could get involved in projects at a regional level such as public personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, services, which deal with insolvency matters, and administration of bankruptcy services.  These are areas in which the CIB and MABS are trying to provide better services in which developments are progressing at present.</p><p> In each region, a dedicated management team approach could be taken rather than individual managers working independently within silos.  This team will be managed by a senior manager who will hold responsibility for board and CIB reporting, finance and overall staff management.  Ultimately, this will have more direct benefits to service users as the quality of the service provided is supervised and assured.</p><p> At present, boards vary in their ability to fulfil their role in overseeing operations.  The level of engagement with CIB as the funding body is also variable.  The responses of some boards to audit reports is concerning.  Oversight of the operations of companies and performance management of managers does not happen consistently.  A reduced number of services will enable more regular auditing and a more effective follow up by the CIB on the implementation of these recommendations.  Improved governance within a smaller number of companies will mean that time and resources can be better directed to the provision of high quality services.</p><p> The Citizens Information Board, CIB, is in receipt of Exchequer funding for which it must account to the Department of Social Protection.  As I said initially, I personally have to sign off on all the accounts.  The board of the CIB has to be satisfied that everything has been done properly.  At present, the Comptroller and Auditor General is not satisfied that all of the necessary steps are being taken to ensure the proper use of resources, and we have to operate within his recommendations.</p><p> The CIB must also operate to a strict employment control framework.  There is nothing unusual in that respect in that all Departments and bodies are subject to employment control regulations.  In order to continue to meet the governance and compliance demands created by 93 companies, the CIB will be forced to redeploy staff into these roles.  However, as I said, that would not be a good use of resources. </p><p> An important issue is the need to ensure that during any change process the service users will not be adversely affected.  It is our intention to ensure that the service users will not be adversely affected during the change.  They should see no disruption in the service being provided.  As I said at the outset, they will still go to the same place, they will looked after by the same people and they will get the same level of service.  It is only the backroom aspects of the delivery of services that will be affected.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Clarke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members for being here this morning to listen to what we have to say.  We circulated a six-page document to the committee which I am sure the members have had an opportunity to read, so I will not read it all verbatim.  I will pick the important points from it and elaborate on those on basis of what some of the chairperson of the CIB has said about what the difficulties are.<br/><br/>The MABS national management forum, which we represent, is the umbrella body that represents the 51 MABS companies throughout the country and we speak entirely on their behalf.  We have the remit to speak on their behalf.  We are not here as three people with our own agenda but to speak on behalf of them all.  We are also here as volunteers.  We work as volunteers in our local communities.  I was on a project board in the CIB yesterday as a volunteer.  I give my time to that for no monetary return for the benefit of MABS and the citizens we serve.  It is not as if there is a major row between the CIB and the MABS national management forum on issues.  We work quite well on committees.  I believe the chief executive officer of CIB will fully accept that this is the way we operate.  <br/><br/>We are seriously concerned about the issue under discussion.  We have outlined the concerns in the document we submitted.  MABS was not the product of a Government decision.  It was an initiative developed by the late Brendan Roche in Cork in The Lough Credit Union in the late 1980s when he became aware of difficulties people had in meeting their debt, difficulties with illegal moneylenders and other related matters.  He established a small group of people and decided they would do something to help those people concerned.  It worked so well that the then Minister, Michael Woods, decided it was a very good idea and that the Department of Social Welfare, as it was then titled, would take it on board and set up six initial pilot projects.  Those projects worked so well that the idea was rolled out throughout the country, culminating in the establishment of 51 MABS companies, all in individual locations, picked as necessary where the needs arose.  Those 51 companies are still operating today.<br/><br/>The local voluntary community involvement was and remains, the key success to the MABS service.  Regardless of what anyone else says, its key success is in the local involvement because volunteers volunteer locally.  People getting involved in their local communities and democracy at all levels is what we are talking about.  It is a bottom up service.  There is a major difference between a bottom up service, which comes from the ground up, informing Government policy and change and something that is being developed at the top level in Dublin and decision being made that such a model will fit throughout the country and that it will work.  That is the real difference between MABS and the service that the chairperson of CIB spoke about.<br/><br/>We are here today because we are aware that there is a plan to abolish the 51 MABS companies and replace them with eight regional companies.  Those eight regional companies will be far removed from their communities.  The chairperson of the CIB said it would not cost anything but it will cost a good deal of money, and I will give some of those figures later.  This is the biggest decision that has ever been made about any organisation in the country.  The members will know of MABS and of the work we do.  They will know the organisation provides an excellent service.  I am sure many members refer constituents who are in debt to MABS.  That is what we want people to continue to do.  The proposed decision is a major one for MABS.<br/><br/>The question of volunteering at local level is what matters.  The Central Statistics Office produced figures recently.  I might shock the members by revealing that if every volunteer in Ireland was paid the minimum wage for what they do, it would cost the Exchequer &euro;5.5 billion a year, nearly half the HSE budget.  That is the reality.  The CIB is saying we are no longer necessary.  There are also many volunteers working in other organisations.  Why is every such organisation not being brought in, abolished and their work centralised in the way that the CIB is talking about centralising MABS?<br/><br/>The programme for Government for the period 2011 to 2016 refers to undertaking a range of initiatives to shift power from the State to the citizen and to engaging with &quot;partners from outside the public sector itself - particularly on initiatives of strategic importance - to act as a catalyst for effective delivery, feedback and learning&quot;.  What is being proposed is going in the opposite direction.  It is removing everything from the citizen and centralising it to the State.  We do not believe that is the correct approach.<br/><br/>We were directly under the Department of Social Protection between 1992 and 2009 and responsibility for MABS was then transferred to the CIB.  The idea at the time was that the CIB had expertise in governance and in supporting the delivery of local services.  We are a little disappointed with the support we got, and I am not aware of what support we actually got.  The IT system in MABS, for instance, is the same as it was in 2009.  We are still working off Excel sheets and such like.  We have a telephone system that was introduced a few years ago at a cost of &euro;400,000, not an inconsiderable amount of money, which does not work today.  All the other telephone systems were thrown out in the bin, this system was installed, now it does not work and the CIB will have to consider how to replace it.  We expected to get a different type of support from the CIB than we got. <br/><br/>The notice from the Department at the time states:</p><blockquote>[this notice is to inform you that] The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has signed a Commencement Order to give effect from 13 July 2009 to Part 4 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 which extends the functions of Citizen Information Board to include the provision of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service. ... The MABS will be a separate distinct service within the Citizens Information Board.  There will be no chance in the status of independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management nor in the employment status of their employees that provide the local services.  </blockquote> <p>Is that gone out the window today?  That was the basis outlined, namely, that there would be no change to the companies and that all the companies would remain as they were.<br/><br/>Many parliamentary questions have been tabled in the D&aacute;il on this issue.</p><p>Deputies throughout the country have been asked by constituents to raise this issue in the D&aacute;il.  There have been several responses by the Minister.  He recently spoke about the difficulty in managing 93 companies.  The issue of governance came up repeatedly.  Governance is a wide issue, but today was the first time I heard that the CIB board had received complaints over how any MABS was run.</p><p> We are the umbrella body that looks after it.  One would imagine that if we did, the first persons to be approached would be ourselves if someone had a difficulty with a particular company.  That has never happened.  If we do not know there is a difficulty, if the CIB does not inform us there is a difficulty, how can one deal with it?</p><p> We have a responsibility for employing all the people.  When there are IR issues, we have to appear in the Labour Court and defend the position.  It is not the CIB because it is not the employer.  We fully acknowledge that the CIB has these accounting responsibilities.  However, let us consider the reality of the budget.  I am chairman of the Longford service and have a budget of &euro;180,000 a year.  Some 84% of that is predetermined by the CIB, by way of salaries, rent and other outgoings.  We have discretion over 16% of the budget.  We give our time.  The people who are there are not fools.  They are professional people, solicitors, accountants etc. who come in and give of their time after their work to provide a service in their local community.</p><p> We ask the Minister to tell us what the difficulties are.  We have consistently demonstrated that we are open to listening and effecting change for the improvement of the service.  That offer remains on the table as we speak.  If the CIB has a problem with governance, it should tell us what it is.  If the Minister has a problem with governance, he should tell us what it is.  Let us sit down and try to work it out.  We do not know what it is.  As I sit here, I have no idea what it is, other than general broad statements about the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We all know public funds are very important and need to be looked after.  We all know about the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular 13 of 2014 about spending public moneys.  I report four times a year to the CIB as to how we spend the &euro;180,000 of which I have discretion on 16%.  I have audited accounts completed by a professional auditor and sent to the CIB.  Let us put that to bed; it is a red herring.  I do not believe it is reality at all.</p><p> The Minister spoke about the trouble in managing 93 companies.  A good analogy is the community employment scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Do members know how many of those there are?  There are 660 limited companies, the same as MABS.  In a small county like Longford there are 16 of them.  There are two people in the Department of Social Protection in Longford to look after them.  They have no difficulty about the Comptroller and Auditor General and circular 13 of 2014.  They provide an excellent service in local communities, cleaning up areas and doing work on a voluntary basis.  Again all those directors are volunteers.</p><p> The Fine Gael and Labour Party 2011 programme for Government provided for a commitment "to convert the Money Advice and Budgeting Service into a strengthened Personal Debt Management Agency with strong legal powers".  Clearly it was suggesting it did not fit in its new home in the CIB and it needed to be taken out, put back on its own and given more powers to deal with the issues that arose.</p><p> On many occasions the chair of the CIB and the Minister said that there would be no changes to front-line services.  Let us put that one to bed.  On what basis were these assurances given?  There was no research or investigation to underpin this conclusion.  We say, with respect, there is none.  There will be no control over the governance and budget or over the management of front-line services if the MABS is regionalised.  That is because it would establish eight independent companies that will be given budgets of more than &euro;2 million each.  The CIB will have no control over these.  There will be independent directors of independent companies running the services on a regional basis.  How can the CIB and the Minister claim there will be no change to front-line services?  I see Deputy O'Dea is present.  A regional company could decide that it will not give as much to Limerick next year and that it will reduce the staff numbers because they have too much there.  That is what can happen.  There is no control over it.  They are talking about more control when we would end up with less control.</p><p> What will a budget for the regional companies look like?  Who will control the allocations?  Nobody will control the allocations.  The CIB can give a particular company a sum of &euro;2 million, but there is no control over what it might do with it.  What will the management costs versus the current costs be?  Starting from the top down and changing structures without detailed analysis of the impact on citizens is putting the cart before the horse.  The one thing that is missing is the suggestion that there would be a better service to the citizens we serve.  The service is very good as it is.  There is nothing to suggest it will be better.  That is our prime importance.  We are there as volunteers.  We work to ensure the services work and that citizens get the best service they can get, and that is it.</p><p> On the issue of attracting volunteers to be directors of these regional companies, I presume the CIB will not create eight new quangos, God forbid.  However, I am not sure it will get people who have a day job to become directors and run eight regional companies with responsibility for 80 or 90 staff and a &euro;2 million budget, and do it for nothing.  Is that what is being suggested?  It is not reality.</p><p> They say they will retain the present directors as members of local advisory groups.  We all know what local advisory groups do.  They will sit for one or two meetings, make a few suggestions and be shot down by the CIB, the Minister or whoever it might be.  That will be the end of local involvement in MABS and CIS.</p><p> When the local boards are wound up, there will be no going back.  There will be no more involvement in the delivery of service.  The breaking of the link between local communities and MABS will decimate the entire ethos upon which its success was established, which was bottom up rather than top down.</p><p> I refer to the credit union movement, which is critical to MABS.  We need to have the credit union onside to do the special accounts.  It is now looking after the recently introduced micro credit scheme.  Credit unions do not work on a regional basis.  They are all local and run by voluntary local people.  Every credit union has a member on the board of the local MABS.  That is what they do.  That link will be broken.  Do members think we would get the same co-operation from credit unions if we tell their representatives that they are no longer fit to be a director of Longford MABS?  We certainly will not.</p><p>The Minister was speaking at our conference in November.  He spoke about using the savings, as did the chair of CIB, that were going to be achieved to enhance the service.  Let me tell the committee, the figures that are in there are not actually correct because we have done a few sums on it since.  Very conservative estimates of the cost of winding up the existing services and setting up the new companies are &euro;1.2 million.  The annual running costs thereafter will be &euro;2.3 million per annum.  That is the actual figure.  I have papers here, if CIB wishes to look at and examine them.  I have erred on the side of caution.  I have not been exaggerating.  I expect it will probably be approximately &euro;3 million a year.  Is that &euro;3 million going to be provided from more State borrowing or will it be taken from the CIB budget?  I am not sure the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe would like to give us another &euro;3 million for that.  If CIB take it out of its own budget there will be a reduction in services.  </p><p> MABS was recently designated as the Government&rsquo;s gateway to debt advice and cannot be diverted from the mission.  No consideration has been given to the disruptive aspect of this proposed restructuring at this time - HR issues, negotiations with unions, new lease agreements, legal issues in winding up companies and all the rest.  </p><p> Next week the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister will launch a big communications plan.  They will roll out MABS as the front line for the new Abhaile service.  At the same time they are abolishing MABS, because you can take it for granted that if the 51 companies are abolished, MABS will be gone. </p><p> MABS boards locally have always been highly responsive and adaptable.  New Government initiatives have recently been professionally embraced and implemented with minimum fuss.  We took on the debt relief notices under the new legislation, the dedicated mortgage arrears advisers and the court mentoring service.  Let me tell the committee about the court mentoring service and the importance of local involvement in that.  That court mentoring service is run in tandem with the courts.  I was able, as chairman of Longford MABS, to go in to the county registrar.  I was able to sit down with her, say that we would try out this court mentoring service and ask for accommodation in the courtroom.  She was supportive and asked what we wanted.  I asked for a room and she said that she would certainly arrange that; she would dedicate a room for us, allow us to put our signage outside and she would inform every person in there that MABS was outside if they wished to see us.  Would that happen on a regional basis?  No.  It is all on a personal basis, it is all local, it is all in the community.  That is the way it works.  </p><p> The chair of CIB has spoken about all these recommendations that came from consultants.  I am not going to go into the cost of consultants because I would scare the Chairman.  The Pathfinder consultants, commissioned in 2014, identified that the two services, MABS and CIS, could not be integrated.  We suggest that regionalisation may not have the same effect on CIS as it may have on MABS.  If there is a desire to go regional there is a possibility if the appetite is there.  I am not saying it is there, and CIS is not here today, but it I am hearing on the ground from CIS people that they would not mind regionalisation.  However, they are two totally distinct and separate services so it would not make any difference.  I would suggest to my colleagues from CIB to have a look, and possible regionalise the CIS services as a pilot.  </p><p> To regionalise eight MABS services without any pilot is to move ahead on a wing and a prayer.  Nobody has any idea what will come out at the end.  We know what we have today but we do not know what will come out the end of this.  Nobody knows.  They do not know and we do not know, but we do know that the people who are involved locally are not going to be involved.  The chair of CIB spoke about all these great sub-groups that were involved; design groups, steering groups, Pathfinder reports and all the rest.  Each of those groups had a majority from CIB.</p><p> Pathfinder was quoted as stating: &ldquo;The Government through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has been driving significant change programmes through the public service.&rdquo;  MABS employees are not public servants.  They are employed by independent limited companies and they do not enjoy the public sector perks of public servants.  Common sense would dictate that it was DPER&rsquo;s concern to achieve savings, not to increase costs.  I have shown the committee, and will demonstrate to it and challenge anyone to question it, that it will cost money.  It is all very fine to talk about these things but in reality implementing them and making them work is a totally different story.</p><p> In summary therefore, we suggest that the Minister and CIB have both failed to evidentially demonstrate the existence of a problem, the solution to which they consider to be regionalisation.  They have failed to deliver a cost benefit analysis.  We have never seen it and they have never prepared any figures.  They have failed to quantify the real monetary cost of the endeavour.  They have failed to cost the loss of the input of voluntary local boards of management.  They have failed to be explicit on what the value of this costly exercise will be to the vulnerable clients served by MABS.  They have failed to address the status of the national representative groups in MABS, that is the national management forum and the national executive committee, who represent staff, in any new structure with their existence likely to be  dispensed with.  That is most likely what will happen because they will not be there any more.  They are doing all of this at a time when MABS is dealing with the greatest personal debt crisis and can ill afford such disruption, distraction and destabilisation.  Contrast this with what is happening in the UK at the moment, where this week they are introducing legislation to look specifically at debt issues facing families with young children.</p><p> So, finally, what can the Minister do?  The committee, I am sure, can report back to the Minister and can tell him what it heard today.  The members can make up their own minds.  They do not have to believe everything I have told them, but I think that I have set it out fairly clearly.  The Minister has the power under the 2007 Act to issue a directive to the board.  We are suggesting that the Oireachtas might suggest to the Minister that he abandon this whole idea of regionalisation and examine all the reasonable issues that have been raised and provide space for all parties to discuss and agree a workable alternative.  His late predecessor, Deputy Seamus Brennan, whom I met, was faced with a similar dilemma.  When the facts were put before him he put his foot down and said that it would not happen, and it did not happen. </p><p> Finally, I will say it is never too late to make the right decision.  The chair of CIB spoke about a decision made by the board last week.  If that decision is going to be carried through without any real addressing of the issues I have raised, I think we are going into very dangerous territory.  Effectively, it is the back door to seizing control of MABS with the option to walk away if something goes wrong.  What do I mean by that?  What CIB did not tell the committee is that they are going to select the directors of the eight new boards.  They will select them.  They are going to interview the people who will chair these new boards.  They are effectively going to become the shadow employer.  By becoming the shadow employer, responsibility will transfer to the Government and the staff will have claims to be civil servants with all the perks that go with that.</p><p>That is the reality.  This has never been examined.</p></speech>

We have heard comprehensive and detailed opening statements that were substantially longer than usual.  They were worth doing because they set out clearly the two positions.  Mr. Clarke made one important point, which is that this committee will make its decision based on the evidence provided by him and others.  That is the process and the purpose of these hearings.  They are open and transparent and the committee will make decisions based on the evidence as presented.  In terms of the questioning, I ask members to be detailed and specific on the issues they have heard because the questioning needs to help inform us as to where we go from here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#J00300"><p>I thank both groups for their presentations.  At the outset, I note that both my party and I are concerned about these proposals and what I have heard today does nothing to allay my concerns.  One thing that jumps out at me from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, presentation is that in 2009, when the then Department of Social and Family Affairs was running the show instead of the Citizens Information Board, CIB, there were four staff dealing with the entire operation.  There are now 74 staff employed by the CIB, if I am reading it correctly, and they are having difficulty managing.  I am not clear on the reason for the radical restructuring proposed.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions for the CIB.  Ms Mangan stated in her presentation that everyone will be going to the same place, everyone will be doing the same job and nothing will visibly change.  I assume that only applies during the process of the restructuring.  Can she give the staff, who have been in touch with me and many of my colleagues, any guarantees as to what their position will be when this is all over?  I took time to speak to people who through my constituency clinic, I had referred to MABS.  I spoke to some volunteers and staff in MABS.  Every person to whom I spoke, without exception, was horrified by this proposal.  The representatives of the CIB should indicate what sort of consultation there has been with the stakeholders and the clients who are the people this is supposed to serve.  The feedback coming back to me is there has been no consultation.</p> <p>  One would need to be an actuary to follow some of the figures flying around but as far as I can make out, no cost-benefit analysis has been done.  There are vague statements that this will cost less and there will be money left over that can be put into front-line services.  On the other hand Mr. Clarke makes a compelling case that this could actually cost more, which would mean the taxpayers of this country could be asked to fork out more money for the same services or alternatively, depending on the state of the budget, the service could actually be cut.  That is the last thing we need in this country at this point in time given the expanded responsibilities MABS has taken on.</p> <p>  I also wanted to ask about volunteers, who volunteer locally.  All the people I know in Limerick who volunteer to work with MABS and other local organisations have no interest in working with an organisation in Waterford.  At a stretch, they might consider the part of County Clare that adjoins Limerick city.  Volunteers tell me that they have no interest in volunteering in a regional situation.  If something is done that will risk losing volunteers then the whole thing is in danger of collapse.  What strikes me is that in the UK, which has been doing this for longer than us, they have both embraced the present situation we are now trying to radically change and are boasting about it.  The report of the UK's Citizens Advice service of 2014 states "Our bureaux are staffed with local people who are passionate about their local communities and sensitive to local needs."  MABS is based on a local-volunteer ethos and we appear to be moving away from that and taking a gigantic step in the dark.  There has been no dialogue or cost-benefit analysis.  If this does not work out the unfortunate clients of MABS will suffer, that is, the front-line people who are struggling with their mortgages and debts.  They are the sort of people who come to me and who are at the very sharp end of society.  The people I speak to praise MABS and the work it is doing.  The clients do not see any difficulty and there is an old saying that if it is not broken, why fix it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.708" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#J00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for allowing me the opportunity to speak today.  I am not a member of the committee but it is an issue about which I am highly concerned.  Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Gioll&aacute;in is a neighbour of mine from Ballinamore and I am very conscious that MABS in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, has done tremendous work for many people down the years and I have worked very closely with them.  As Deputy O'Dea has said, it is really about the volunteers who are on the board and how they network.  There are people there from social welfare, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the local credit union, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Countrywomans Association and a whole range of organisations.  It is broad and it encompasses everybody.  People work together and it is seen as being part of the community.  In other words, it is a community response where the community comes together in a generous way to help people when they fall on hard times or get into trouble.  That is how it is reflected.  The danger is that presenting MABS as changing to a regional structure would take that away.  On a gut instinct the majority of people would be opposed to that.</p> <p>  I would like to raise a couple of issues.  There was mention of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Revenue requirements around employment, the requirements of the Departments around how money is spent and that due diligence must be carried out in these matters.  I take it that the 51 MABS companies must do their returns and make sure that they are done correctly.  There have been no issues.  I spoke to someone in Revenue off the record recently and asked whether there was a problem with MABS not doing their returns correctly.  I was asked where I had heard that and was told there has never been a problem with MABS beyond the occasional late form, as happens in every organisation everywhere.  I was told the broad thrust of it was there is no problem with MABS and the individual companies around the country were doing their job properly.  That is the information that has come back to me.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that there will be no closure of any service or change to the location of any service during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  I would like to get an idea as to what is that lifetime.  How long will that take?  Why put that in there if there will never be a change?  That suggests to me there is an intention to have changes once this restructuring is over.  That is the logical conclusion of having that sentence in there in the first place.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that there have been complaints about how some of the MABS organisations have been run.  I would like specifics on that.  About which MABS companies have there been complaints and what is the nature of those complaints?  That has not come to the fore up to now.  One fear I have is that what this is trying to do is set up the organisation in a way that it can move from being a community-based organisation that is providing a service to the community and the people in it to a more Civil Service-type organisation.  I think that is a dangerous path to go down.  One fear I have concerns the emphasis that has been put on JobPath and how that has become a private company, in that two private companies are now running that system.  I fear this is the direction in which the provision of services to people who have debt problems is going, namely, the State does not need to be involved in this and should step back.  That is how these things work out in most cases and I fear that if we agree to take on this restructuring and agree that it is the way forward, we actually are agreeing to go down a path that is very dangerous and which we do not need to go down.</p><p>I would like to get the specifics on exactly what companies had problems, the nature of the problems, when they occurred and on whether they have been resolved.  We are being told there are problems we have to fix but today is the first time that I have heard that there are specific problems.  I would like to be assured that there are problems and if there are, let us deal with them.</p></speech>

Certainly the question of a cost-benefit analysis is very important as is clarity around the cost.  In a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, confirmed there has not been a cost-benefit analysis, but I am also interested in a risk analysis.  When I read Ms Mangan's presentation, I saw some of the reassurances but it seems unclear how those reassurances can be made.  She spoke about people going to the same place and being looked after by the same people.  She was speaking of the CIS and the MABS restructuring, on which we have received submissions.  </p> <p>  As I understand, of the 2,800 staff in the CIS, 1,900 are volunteers.  If we are looking to restructure the delivery of those services, it is very hard to understand how there would not be a severe risk in respect of the board of MABS but perhaps more crucially in respect of the volunteers at the front line of the Citizens Information Service around the country.  What is the risk in terms of loss if we are looking at 1,900 volunteers?  Potentially, that could be disruptive to those seeking support.  It would be very useful to get a breakdown on who is delivering those services.  </p> <p>  I refer to the rationale for this proposed restructuring.  We heard about governance and questions have been asked about that.  In her presentation, Ms Mangan mentioned that it had become increasingly challenging in recent years due to staff reductions to meet the needs of these companies.  She also explicitly mentioned the concerns in terms of compliance with the employment control framework levels.  Is this a matter of staffing?  Could we have clarity on what the staffing levels were in 2009 when MABS was originally amalgamated?  What are the staffing levels today and what is the employment control framework?  We have lifted the recruitment embargo so if this is a matter of staffing and staffing resources, it might be like using a sledgehammer to break a nut to seek to restructure all these companies if the key problem is simply one of staffing supports at the central level.  It would be good to clarify that, so that we do not put it in as a rationale for something which might be much more easily fixed and addressed without such radical costs.</p> <p>  Ms Mangan spoke a little about the consultation process and very real concerns have been raised about it.  It was mentioned that CIB had a majority on those various groups which the process moved through.  Perhaps she could comment on that and on whether it has affected the outcome.  She mentioned meeting and consulting people but the key point for us is agreement.  Has there been agreement from either CIS or MABS?  It seems that there has not been agreement to these proposals and models.</p> <p>  Ms Mangan mentioned what was agreed between that company and the CIB.  If concerns have been raised, maybe she could clarify them.  We have had some indication that due to confidentiality arrangements around these processes, there may have been difficulties in those who were taking part, for example, on behalf of MABS or CIS, in these processes engaging in their own consultation on the ground with their members and clients.  What was the consultation on the ground?  Was there further consultation with staff, volunteers and service users feeding into that?  That is crucial.</p> <p>  On governance, I would respectfully disagree with one point which Ms Mangan made where she suggested that the persons using the service do not care about its governance.  Perhaps they do.  Currently, in the cases of both MABS and CIS, we have a situation where service users maybe on the board because there is voluntary and community representation on those local boards and the same could be the case with some of the volunteer staff.  It is quite deeply ingrained in terms of 25 years of MABS and 40 years of the community services.</p> <p>  I have two very explicit questions.  It does not seem to me that there is agreement.  What will happen to services that do not agree?  That is very important.  The county based option was discussed as a model.  It seems to have been in place for 20 years or so with the community information services.  The county based model would be one other way of amalgamating them and would perhaps be less drastic than reducing the number from 98 to 16.  Why was the county based model rejected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.713" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1417" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#K00500"><p>I probably have a slightly historical insight into this.  There have been incredible successes with CIB and MABS.  Without the active support of CIB we would not have had microloans from the credit union and we would not have gone into the Court Services.  Mr. Clarke pointed to his relationship with the Longford court house, but we had to put in place an agreement on a national basis to get back into the courts and that was done as overarching thing.  There was a local and a national approach.  Everybody I have dealt with in regard to CIB, MABS, microloans or otherwise had the one intention which was to try to improve the service.  There was no attempt to seize power; there was nothing like that.  As a Minister of State, I might have had disagreements with people I worked with but I never questioned their commitment to improve the service.</p> <p>  I refer to the local advisory board.  What is CIB talking about?  What would MABS see as that local advisory board?  On the process itself, Senator Higgins has raised the inbuilt majority of CIB in regard to the process.  It would be interesting to know how many times that came to a vote and how many times CIB used its majority.</p> <p>  On the set up and the different sets of figures, I do not think anyone has entered this process to try to save money.  It is not a money saving exercise.  I do not think previous Governments set this up as a money saving exercise, so it would be interesting if MABS could share its figures and do a proper analysis of those figures.  If anything the intention was the provision of more money into the service.  </p> <p>  In many ways, we have probably become very politically correct and our response to every crisis in a service, whether it is in the charity sector or otherwise, is to raise the bar of reporting which affects everyone.  I am a volunteer in another national group where we are now putting three strands into one.  We are putting three sections into one committee because the reporting standards are so high that the volunteers are taking more time to reach the standard than actually doing the work they volunteered to do, which is frustrating.</p><p>It is frustrating because they had a connection.  The process has worked well as people can see the overall vision.</p><p> As I have said on many occasions, my wife worked for MABS.  The work she carried out for MABS with the local credit union was the single payment and sharing out the money.  Some money went to the ESB bill and some went elsewhere.  That has grown and changed to an extent where MABS has changed and is very different in different locations.  Some MABS advisers' time is taken up working with mortgage arrears rather than arrears on the ESB bill.</p><p> The credit union movement has greatly changed, and there is the question of how we are going to interact with that credit union movement.  My local credit union was the Sandymount Credit Union but it is now the Dundrum Credit Union, with about four or five different credit unions coming in to make up that.  We are dealing with a bigger entity.  Some are more like a credit union movement and some have grown to the same size as small banks.  There will be a different relationship with those and how that relationship is managed.</p></speech>

I have huge admiration for the work done by MABS.  I am from County Clare and regularly engage with MABS.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny has asked legitimate questions, particularly in terms of the line that there will be no change to the location of any service during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  We need clarity on that.  So much in terms of managing this is volunteer centred that if the volunteer element cannot be brought with us, how will the service be managed after that?  What was the level of consultation in that context?  It was said there was extensive consultation.  What did that entail?</p> <p>  I would like to hear more about trying to arrive at a more streamlined governance model.  What are the advantages of that model?  The witnesses speak of trying reduce administration, which is a good thing in many ways.  If they cannot bring the volunteers with them, how will they manage the service?  My fear is that if they cannot do that, it will spill on to the service users, so to speak, and will have an impact on them.  I would like if the witnesses could convince me in terms of what they are trying to achieve.  How will the service user benefit from the changes the witnesses are trying to implement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.716" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#L00300"><p>From the point of view of the citizen, the Citizens' Information Service and MABS have been very important in communities.  The closer they are to communities, the better.  When they are taken away, they become more distant and they cannot be accessed.  There was a Citizens' Information centre in Ring Terrace in Dublin 8 which was moved to Thomas Street.  When it came to elderly people and others trying to access it, it created all sorts of problems in trying to access services.</p><p>The point about no change to location in the lifetime of the restructuring is important.  Why at the time, in 2009, did the Department of Social Protection transfer responsibilities to the Citizens' Information Board, CIB?  It put a lot of responsibility on another organisation to play a role.  When that responsibility was passed over, it was noted:</p><blockquote>This notice is to inform you that the Minister for Social &amp;amp; Family Affairs has signed the Commencement Order to give effect from ... 2009 ... which extend the functions of the [CIB] to include the provision of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service. ... MABS will be a separate distinct service within the Citizens Information Board.  There will be no change in the status of the independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management nor in the employment status of their employees that provide the local services.</blockquote> <p>It is quite clear from 2009 what the roles of the CIB and MABS were and that they were distinct.  There must be more clarity around why this proposal is being made and why it has started already.  It is my understanding that the process has started already.  Maybe that should be put on hold for a period until we go through this process.</p><p>In 2014 and 2015 all the Citizens' Information services and MABS were tested and received a gold star, which is a service delivery quality mark.  I do not know where the questions are coming from.  If the services are being provided in the way that has been done for the last period and they are working, we should maintain them and put more work into them to build on them and provide better services.</p></speech>

I will not repeat any questions that colleagues have raised.</p> <p>  As public representatives, we see at first hand the work done by the Citizens' Information and MABS.  Public representatives and both organisations deal with the same people.  We see at first hand the positive impact that both organisations have on communities.</p> <p>  I will not go over the same points but I have one or two very specific questions.  If the witnesses do not have the answers here, they might forward them to the committee.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Mangan, and it comes from her opening statement.  As part of the rationale for the decision to change and have a new model, she said there was concern expressed by the delivery services themselves that a considerable amount of staff time was being diverted into administration with a consequent negative impact on the delivery of services to citizens.  I have not heard that point reflected in what the people from MABS said.  It is a basis for making a decision to change structures, it is a point that has been made, but the evidence to support it has not been presented to the committee today.</p> <p>  Ms Mangan, in terms of the rationale behind making the decision, referred on a number of occasions to letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 and 2015.  Perhaps she will tell us specifically what is in those letters.  Maybe, from the point of view of correspondence after the meeting, those letters might be forwarded to the committee.</p> <p>  There is a divergence of views in terms of finances in the context of the rationalisation programme being done.  Ms Mangan seemed to suggest that there were economies to be made and money could be reinvested in additional services.  Mr. Clarke was quite specific when he spoke about an additional &euro;1 million a year.  I would like that, if the witnesses have figures to back up their cases, and they may not want to present them today, those figures would be circulated to the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Mangan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#L00700"><p>Quite a large number of questions have been asked and I will try to deal them in the time available.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea said that the Department had four staff when it looked after MABS before 2009 and that 74 staff work in the CIB.  Yes, something like 74 staff work in the CIB but they also provide an information service, an advocacy service, training, the hearing service for the deaf and all sorts of other services.  It is quite ridiculous to compare the two issues.</p> <p>  When the CIB took over MABS in 2009, it had 92 staff but it only has 74 today.  I want to kill that one immediately.  I do not think it would be a good idea to get more staff to do a compliance job.  The CIB does not want simply to be a compliance organisation.  We want to be an organisation that encourages the further development of Citizens' Information services and MABS.</p> <p>  In case people get the wrong impression, I would like to point out that I personally was involved in setting up Citizens' Information services in the 1970s.  I realise that dates me very considerably but it nevertheless is the case.</p><p>I absolutely reject any suggestion that the people on the board of the CIB now have anything other than the best interests of the CIS and MABS at heart.</p><p> I will now turn to the question of what happens when the restructuring is over.  We expect that the restructuring will take approximately 18 months.  We cannot guarantee, and nobody can, that there will never be any further change.  Life is not like that.  I could not say, with my hand on my heart, that there would be no further change at some future date.  It is my hope and expectation that there will be massive improvements after the implementation is fully conducted and that we will have more MABS services and more CIS and they will get into every corner of the State.  I hope that everybody with mortgage arrears will be in a position to access MABS.  I accept that MABS grew out of a local desire to provide services but the reality now is that all the recent developments in the services offered by MABS came from the top.  It was the Government that decided we should have a dedicated mortgage arrears service.  It was the Government that decided we should have the Abhaile service.  It was the Government that decided we should have the court mentoring service.  These are all great developments and I am delighted about them but they came from a national level.  They did not come from a local level.  The establishment of regional boards will not necessarily remove the local aspect because of the people who work in MABS.  With regard to volunteers I should point out that the services MABS provides are delivered by professional staff.  There are some 800 board members who give their time voluntarily.  Staff that works for MABS will be, as I have said, in the same place, delivering the same service and conscious of all local needs.  If the existing MABS companies take up our suggestion that they be local advisory groups, then they will be able to give the local input that is desirable and which would be helpful to the people concerned.</p><p> On the issue of costs, I make the point to Senator Higgins that there are no volunteers working in delivering MABS services.  There are some 1,000 volunteers working in the CIS.  We are in the process of developing a new volunteer strategy.  It is our intention to foster further volunteering within the CIS.  The change from local boards to regional boards will not change the role of volunteers who work in the CIS in any way.  If a new board is established, a volunteer in Bray, for example, will still work as a volunteer in the Bray information service.  There is no reason why there should be any change in the volunteering by people in the CIS.</p><p> With the boards of MABS, the reality is that some boards actually do the administration themselves and I accept that - Mr. Clarke is one of those people who do that - but most MABS administration is undertaken by the people who work in MABS.  This takes away their time that they could be using in their role as qualified money advisers.  The dedicated mortgage arrears advisers are qualified to help people with their mortgages.  Dedicating their time on returns to the Companies Office and the Revenue Commissioners is not a good use of their time.  With the regional structure we hope there will be a common pay system, a common HR system and savings in those areas.  This brings me on to the cost-benefit issue.  Costs have been examined in some detail in the various reports.  We will forward the details of these to the committee because it would take too long to go through them all now.  The costs have been examined and we looked at having a county model, a regional model and a national model.  The simple reason the county model is not acceptable is that we would end up with 52 companies and we do not believe that a reduction from 93 to 52 is enough to achieve what we want.  In fact, eight and eight are probably the outer limits of the manageability of the scheme.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny asked about the specific complaints about MABS companies.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me to mention such complaints, but I assure the Deputy they exist and are being dealt with directly with the companies concerned.  The representatives here today are not the employers of MABS staff, they are the representative body of the employers of the MABS staff, so we could not - in all fairness to everybody - bring individual complaints to their attention.  It would be entirely inappropriate and is not the way to deal with complaints.  We have all had a lot of experience recently in how to properly deal with complaints to properly deal with complaints one of the things we do is to deal with the direct employer, that is the local board in these cases.</p><p> I apologise that I cannot remember exactly which member asked about the level of consultation.  Consultation has been going on for several years and, as I said in my opening statement, I regret that the decision has taken so long, but that is the way it is.  The various consultation mechanisms are outlined in all the reports and again, we can provide the committee with the exact details of that.  I chaired the recent restructuring committee myself.  Obviously, I was not involved, as chairman, in the earlier discussions about restructuring but I was involved in the recent round.  There was no dissent from the decision of the restructuring committee.  I absolutely accept that the MABS organisation is not happy with the proposed restructuring, but it is not that we did not consult.  We did.  We are faced with a situation where, as the group responsible for public money, we must make the decision and we must stand over that decision.  I accept that MABS are not happy with the position.  It is very obvious, but I do not believe there is anything we can do about that.</p><p> There are responses to the extensive consultation that took place in 2014-2015 and we will provide that to the committee afterwards.  We will also supply the Comptroller and Auditor General's letters which specify exactly what we are required to do.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked about why the Department of Social Protection handed over responsibility to the CIB in 2009.  The simple reason is that at the time the Department realised it did not have the mechanisms for proper oversight of the spending of the funding.  The Department generally hands money to its own staff to distribute and oversee.  The analogy with the community employment service, as referenced earlier, is not exactly on point because community employment services are provided by other organisations that are financed by various Government Departments, which have their own control mechanisms.  Some CIS providers have community employment schemes in operation and there is a difference between them.  Lots of community employment schemes are run by non-companies.  There are all sorts of different employment schemes so I do not think it is comparable to the status of MABS or the CIS.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr James Clarke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#M00200"><p>As there were not as many questions directed to me I will not be as long in dealing with the queries.  The main issue and one upon which every member spoke today - nearly without exception - is the importance of local involvement and the local advisory boards.  That is why we are here today, to talk about this issue and ensure it is retained.  If it is lost, we are going to lose a huge asset.  We will be left with people who are running the service from afar and who will not have the same interest in it.  It would be very difficult to deal with it.</p> <p>  The issue of consultation has come up regularly with regard to CIB and MABS.  We have continually complained about it.  CIB's idea of consultation is to appoint a consultant who they send out to meet various MABS organisations.</p><p>One gets a report back from a consultant and more likely than not, there will be nothing in it.  For example, the CIB employed Indecon to produce the last CIB strategic plan.  We put a huge amount of work into the plan and met the Indecon people to present it.  We gave them a paper.  The person from Indecon asked us to send it to the CIB.  I said that we were told to meet Indecon to consult and that Indecon would take the paper and include it.  He said "oh, that's not the way it works" and told us that he was working for the CIB.  That is what the CIB understands consultation to be and that is our continuous difficulty.  I was a member of several of those steering groups and can tell the committee it has always been the same.  The last group was weighted six to four in favour of the CIB.  The proposal was made to introduce restructuring.  The committee was picked by the chair of the board and each representative body was asked to appoint two people so there was six-four-nil game before one started.  That was the reality and that was the way it was going to end.  There would be no change because the people who had the issues would still have them but it did not make any difference.  </p><p> It is very easy to blur the lines with regard to administration.  The management of the company in which I am involved does all the administration.  In response, the chair of the CIB talked about wasting time dealing with Revenue and company returns.  MABS companies do not do that.  The auditors appointed by MABS companies do all the paperwork in respect of Revenue returns, the Companies Registration Office and the Charities Regulatory Authority so no time is taken up.  Where the time is taken up involves requests by the CIB for this, that and the other.  Those requests must be answered and supplied on the basis of a spreadsheet because that is the best we have had on offer for the past seven years by the CIB.  That is what staff time is taken up with - completing returns on a monthly basis about waiting times.  I am not saying the CIB should not have this information but at least we should have a proper case management system.  The CIB was tasked with providing the proper support to MABS to enable this to happen.  That will continue to be the case.  I can tell the committee there will be no reduction in the amount of work that the manager at local level will have to do.  The quarterly returns are a simple process.  They do not really work.  </p><p> I do not buy the idea that there will not and cannot be change.  We always accept that change can take place but change must be on the basis of an identified need for change and being satisfied that change will make a difference.  This is where we are today.  Unfortunately, if we have these eight regional companies, not only will MABS local companies and local volunteers lose any input into it, the Government will lose any input into it.  It will be taken out of the Government's hands and will not be there.  It will be for somebody to decide.  I do not know where.  If one goes around the country and ask the MABS companies, the Citizens Information Service, CIS, companies and the end users, one will find that nobody complains but still the CIB has a problem.  </p><p> The Chairman and Senator Humphreys mentioned many great examples of strides made by the CIB in respect of dedicated money advisers and the court mentoring service - areas that are very important, as is the debt relief notice .  What they might have forgotten to mention concerns MABS National Development Limited, which is a support company for MABS based in Blanchardstown.  When CIB was given that responsibility, it handed it over to MABS National Development Limited and told it to look after it.  MABS National Development Limited implemented every one of those items in conjunction with the companies.  They were all streamlined out.  There was not a single issue with any of those measures but it was MABS National Development Limited that did it.  We love working with the CIB; it did the donkey work and fought with the Department for the moneys.  If we can work together and are allowed to work together, it will work better.  That is where it is.  </p><p> The chair of the CIB has said that we are not the employers.  I wish to God that someone would tell us that because we are facing a claim for an increase in wages from the Unite union and a claim in respect of sick pay entitlements and will shortly end up in the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is not the three people sitting here today who are going to go there.  We are going there to support their position.  The committee must understand the hat we must wear.  As we are limited in the funding we have, we cannot tell MABS staff that we will give them a 15% increase because we must talk to Ms Black, Ms Mangan and Mr. O'Connor.  In that way, we work together.  It is not as if we are at total war every day of the week.  I am only saying that to keep that going, the CIB should put a little bit of effort into respecting - a word I do not like using lightly - what the volunteers do on the ground and the value of that volunteerism more.  </p><p> The Chairman mentioned the letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I can tell the Chairman that the Comptroller and Auditor General has not yet audited a MABS company with the exception of MABS National Development Limited about three or four years ago.  I am not sure where this information comes from.  The chair of the CIB said that all community employment schemes are not funded by the Department of Social Protection.  Who are they funded by?  Of course, they are all funded entirely by the Department of Social Protection.  The money comes directly from the Department to the companies to employ the people.  They are not funded by the CIB.  </p></speech>

That is the reality.  I did mention MABS National Development Limited as a company that provides all the support to the companies delivering the services.  I suggest that if the CIB has a difficulty, why not transfer responsibility for the management of the 51 MABS companies to MABS National Development Limited?  It is a competent company that does excellent work and has very good people working for it.  Some of the people in MABS National Development Limited have influenced legislative changes.  Senator Humphreys knows this because of issues that arose in some of the legislation passed, particularly relating to debt relief notices, where it was inoperable because of deficiencies.  It was MABS National Development Limited that identified that, not CIB.  They are the issues we need to look at.  We should not destroy that structure.</p></speech>

A similar argument applies.  I want to make it clear, despite insinuations to the contrary, that I am not suggesting for one moment that there is any bad faith on the part of anybody or that it is the intention of anybody, on the board of the CIB or otherwise, to do down MABS.  I never insinuated that and do not mean that; I simply observe there is a seismic change.  All parties across the spectrum have received many representations on this matter and we are entitled to bring the people responsible for that change in here and ask them to justify it.

I get the point.</p> <p>  Ms Mangan has mentioned that the board's staff number has decreased from 92 to 74.  I offer congratulations but I notice the board has access to consultants.  In addition to the other information we have requested, could we have an account of how much the CIB has spent on consultants over the past five years?</p> <p>  If CIB and MABS were to be amalgamated, how many companies would one finish up with?  I suspect there would be slightly more than half of 52, perhaps 30 or so.</p> <p>  I asked whether any comfort could be given to the staff as regards what is to happen when the amalgamation is concluded.  I thank the delegates for the clarity on this.  Ms Mangan said it was her hope and expectation &ndash; I wrote that down &ndash; that the new arrangement would grow and grow.  That is the answer to that.</p> <p>  As regards complaints, Deputy Martin Kenny asked a valid question.  He asked a simple question as to the general nature of the complaints.  I do not believe he was looking for specific details on some guy making a complaint about some individual on 14 August.  Members are entitled to get an answer because the committee is trying to decide how the new structure will deal with those complaints.  As far as consultation is concerned, I repeat myself: the volunteers and clients were not consulted.  Mr. Clarke outlined very well the nature of the consultation process with MABS.  Again, we are no wiser as regards costs.  I look at the figures with great interest because, while reference is made to various reports, studies and this and that, why have these not been brought together and presented to us as a justification?</p></speech>

I could list a dozen categories of complaints, some of which include staff being put on the wrong salary scale, failure to give rights to staff commensurate with the current body of supports for natural justice and for the rights of employees who were demoted or unfairly dismissed etc.  Others include failure to comply with audit requirements, failure to report variances in significant amounts of expenditure and failures generally in governance and in the quality of the management of the companies.  These come to our attention all the time.  At any given time, we have to deal with up to a dozen issues extending from a complaint right up to, and including, litigation.</p></speech>

Some believe the advisory boards do not have any teeth.  On the making of changes to legislation, which was mentioned, I have seen advisory boards making significant changes.  The 10% social and affordable housing measure was brought in by a non-statutory advisory board under the then Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey.  I accept the position outlined but contend a significant role was also played by the CIB and the Department's own staff on the initiatives that came through.  Those should always be acknowledged.  It was always very much a question of a team rather than individuals.  How do the delegates envisage the local advisory boards operating and having a true impact with regard to volunteerism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2017022300002#O01300"><p>I would like to make just a couple of points.  I do not believe any inference is being made.  We are simply responding to the multiple representations we are all receiving in terms of ensuring restructuring is not simply efficient but also effective, well grounded and well rationalised.  That is the spirit in which we try to ensure the process is considered.</p> <p>  With regard to the cost-benefit analysis, we have asked for the costs.  It concerns me that we saw in the response to a parliamentary question shared with the committee a statement by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that there had not been a cost-benefit analysis.  That seemed to be on the same date.  We received it on 14 February.  On 15 February, we were told the decision was made to restructure.  Given the concerns that were in the public realm, regardless of how strongly one might have been committed to this model and acknowledging the importance of ensuring it is managed carefully, it seems surprising that the decision was made on 15 February in the absence of a cost-benefit analysis.  Is there one?  Are there plans for one before the move to the next stage of implementation?  That would be important.</p> <p>  I asked earlier about the risk analysis.  We have talked about the delegation's hopes for what might later.  A risk analysis allows an organisation to genuinely look to that.  What is the risk analysis explicitly in terms of the questions of the independence of the CIB and MABS services and in terms of the volunteers and the current level of volunteer participation?  I thank the delegates for the clarified figures in respect of the numbers of volunteers in both the CIB and MABS.  What is the risk regarding changes that may occur?  While, of course, we cannot guarantee them, we should be able to predict what they might be.</p> <p>  The two issues mentioned explicitly were the location of services and the terms and conditions of operation.  I asked explicitly what will happen if we do have services that refuse the plan or are resistant to it or if there are those who do not wish to amalgamate.  What will the plan be in that event?</p> <p>  If we are to have further information, what will be the scale of complaint or concern in this regard?  Deputy Joan Collins mentioned that in 2014-15, all the MABS and citizens information services had received gold-standard accreditation.  We are hearing that while hearing there are complaints.  While it would not be appropriate to have the detail on the complaints, we need to know the scale of concern.</p></speech>

The two sentences that alarm me indicate there will be no closure of services, no change of location and no changes to the terms and conditions of staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  This infers there will be changes in all these areas after the completion of the restructuring programme.  Otherwise, why would those sentences be included?</p> <p>  On my second question, I am not asking for the exact detail.  Most of the complaints pointed out, such as a member of staff having a problem with his or her salary scale, are normally dealt with in every company in the country.  There is not a SuperValu in the country that does not have a member of staff who believes he or she is on the wrong pay scale.</p><p>That is normal, and it goes on everywhere, but it is far-fetched to suggest that is the reason all the boards have to be closed down and all the companies dissolved.</p><p> We were told that weapons of mass destruction was the reason a war was waged on Iraq but when the war was over, no weapons of mass destruction were found.  We do not want to be in a position where we are told there are many issues and, for that reason, this huge restructuring and the closing of all these boards is needed only to discover at the end of it that there was no reason for it.  We do not want to be back here saying what a mess we made of it.  We centralised the Health Service Executive, HSE, and many other organisations and they turned out to be a disaster.  This programme is not broken.  There is no reason to try to fix something that is not broken.  That is my position, and I have yet to hear where these serious problems have been identified that require such a massive change.</p></speech>

I should have addressed the local advisory boards in my earlier reply.  Currently, the local boards that run MABS are helping the people who work in the MABS centres and they are the administrators.  All we are asking to do is not have them as administrators.  They can still remain as local advisory boards and be helpful.  The range of people who serve on MABS boards is very wide.  They include many local credit union people and some community welfare officers.  Various people serve.  There is nothing to stop them being available to assist the staff in the delivery of the services.  What we are trying to do is take away that administrative burden.  They can still operate as boards if they wish.  We would encourage them to do that and to provide their expertise, if possible.</p> <p>  Some MABS boards have the same people as members since the day they were established.  Some boards change very frequently, so the level of interaction varies hugely throughout the country.</p> <p>  On the costs and risks, we have done a cost-benefit analysis and a risk analysis.  We will forward the results of both of those to the committee.  I have not seen the figures from the representative, Mr. Clarke, so I cannot comment on them.  We recognise that the initial change will cost some money.  Ultimately, they will save some money but that is not the object of the exercise.  The object of the exercise is to do with improved governance, and saving money is not a particular objective of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny asked what would happen if MABS services do not co-operate.  Our plan is to set up the eight regional companies.  Under the normal terms of the law, transfer of undertakings will apply and the staff will transfer to those companies so they will not be affected.  They will transfer on their normal terms and conditions.</p> <p>  The companies will have to dissolve themselves.  That will be their job.  The Citizens Information Board, CIB, cannot tell any particular company to dissolve.  They can stay in place but the CIB will not be providing financing to it. That is the significant difference.</p> <p>  On the question of no change during the lifetime of the restructuring-----</p></speech>

That particular sentence was inserted to make it clear that there would not be a loss of jobs or movement from premises.  We could have left out the words "during the lifetime of the restructuring" but it would have given a false impression.  Changes happen all the time.  If this process does not go through, the likelihood is that significant changes will occur anyway.  All we are saying is that any reason for change will not be because of the restructuring.  There are various reasons for change in many areas.  I have said already that it is my hope and expectation that we will have more services available and that we will establish new services in various areas.  We should not forget that the existing staff will be in a position to apply for promotions within the region, which they cannot do at present because they are in such small services.  We cannot make promises into the future that we cannot keep but there is a possibility that the staff themselves may recognise that some changes need to be made, that a new office needs to be opened or that some offices need to be amalgamated.  Deputy Collins instanced a case in her constituency where a service closed.  That decision was taken by the local board in her constituency.  It had nothing to do with the CIB.  Local boards often make changes in their deliver of services for very good reasons, and that will continue.</p></speech>

I can make as many complaints about CIB as she has made.  I can talk about correspondence unanswered for months or issues not dealt with.  At the moment the MABS have no service agreement with CIB.  It is paying out public funds without service agreements in place.  These are the people who talk about governance.  The last agreement expired on 31 December.  We raised this with CIB in March 2016 to ensure that a service agreement would be in place.  We have met CIB twice since January and it takes the line it is our way or no way. </p></speech>
