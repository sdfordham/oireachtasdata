We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to this committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit.</p>  <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Marc MacSharry.</p>  <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 15 and 16 February 2017 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  I do not think any particular matter arises from the minutes.  If there is we can discuss the matter under any other business.  </p>  <p>  The next item is correspondence for today's meeting.  No. 297A is a briefing document from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for today&rsquo;s meeting.   Is it agreed that we note and publish it?  Agreed. </p>  <p>  No. 312A is an opening statement from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.   We will note and publish that.</p>  <p>  Category B correspondence is from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers in follow-up to previous meetings.  The first item, since the last meeting, is correspondence dated 6 February 2017 from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This is a follow-up to the appearance of the Department and Tusla before the committee on 19 January 2017.  We will note and publish that.  People are free to make comments once the correspondence is published.  </p>  <p>  No. 300B is correspondence dated 16  February 2017 from Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, An Ceann Comhairle, regarding the staff resources and the PAC secretariat.  As we dealt with this matter in private session yesterday we can note the matter. </p>  <p>  No. 301B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills regarding the production of financial statements at the National College of Art and Design.  The correspondence states that the college is working with the Comptroller and Auditor General and that while there are ongoing compliance issues the Department is confident that these issues will be rectified in the near future.  I am sure through the natural course of the examination of the accounts and statements laid weekly we can keep an eye out for this.  We will watch and monitor the matter as we go along.</p>  <p>  No. 302B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the presentation of the 2012 and 2013 financial statements for The Gathering Project 2013 Limited.  They were laid on the 2 February and were noted by the committee at last week's meeting.   We will note the correspondence.  </p>  <p>  No. 303B is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, Director General of the HSE.  The letter recommends that before the Department and the HSE are before the Committee on 9 March 2017, to discuss the fair deal scheme, that the committee visit a public residential community facility.  Would any member like to comment on the invitation that is worthy of consideration?  We have received a letter from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien who has suggested that when considering this matter we should look at some of the State nursing homes and see how a good one operates.  I note that he has recommended we visit a place in Mountmellick, County Laois.  Perhaps it is a coincidence but the place is located in my area.  Maybe it is not a coincidence.  I do not know.   Mr. O'Brien has a point.  We must get a proper feeling of what is provided in HSE institutions versus what is provided in nursing homes.</p> <p>We know HSE institutions have a lot of people that the nursing homes do not cater for.  If we are evaluating them strictly on a cost basis and on value for money we have to take into account the quality of the service being provided.  I think that is what is behind that particular letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00200"><p>I certainly welcome that because the level of dependency that I have seen in public nursing homes in Galway and in the county, when we had one in Galway, was extraordinary.  There is a facile debate, not even a debate but a facile public relations campaign, going on into private nursing homes to suggest they are much cheaper.  Certainly I welcome that as the complexity of finance for public nursing homes is not being looked at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00300"><p>I will put in one more item on this.  While I stress I had no role in or knowledge of the invitation before it arrived, if the committee agrees to visit Mountmellick I would put in a proviso that we visit the Abbeyleix community nursing unit on the same day, though not to add any extra time.  The reason for this is a decision by the HSE to close that unit.  In all published documentation, it is listed as the most expensive unit in the country per patient per week.  I think we should have a short visit there.  The level of patients in it has diminished dramatically but the cost structure is very high.  It think it would give a good balance.  Mountmellick might be excellent in terms of facilities and costs whereas Abbeyleix might provide a contrast.  I leave it open to the committee.  I am not suggesting anything.  I am guided by the committee and I am conscious that it is my own constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00400"><p>I assume the proposal the HSE has made is in the context of the cost comparisons between public and private facilities.  I have no difficulty with it.  I think it is a good idea for us to visit any one of the public ones but if that is the case should we also, on the basis of balance, visit a private facility?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00700"><p>We will try to set a date for the visit to Mountmellick.  Perhaps we might arrange with some of the nursing home associations to have a visit to a private nursing home that can be reached on the same day, rather than heading to somewhere 150 miles away or something like that.  Or do we want to go there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00800"><p>I think it is a good idea.  The comparison has to be fair.  I do not think any of us will dispute that.  It is more than money.</p>  <p>  Where there have been such visits previously, is there a better take-up from committee members when it is closer?  If only one or two people go will we get full value for it?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C00900"><p>We will agree that we will not travel unless there is a reasonable quorum.  There is no point in two people travelling.  Unless four, five or six are travelling, and if more all the better, we will not go.  It would not inform the full committee if only two or three people were to go.  Will we ask the secretariat to contact members to try to determine a suitable day?  Perhaps Tuesday morning before we get here would be appropriate.  We could do a 9 a.m. visit.  Mountmellick is only an hour from Dublin.</p></speech>

She could take it into Portlaoise from Galway and Portarlington.  We will work out the transport arrangements.  We agree that it is a good idea.  Maybe we will drop the Abbeyleix visit but should we visit a private nursing home at the same time?  I am very conscious of a group of us walking into a nursing home.  I am sensitive about that.  I would not like to intrude on any patient or resident's dignity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C01400"><p>I do not think we should rush off to look at nursing homes.  I do not think it is our role.  A particular point has come up here in respect of high levels of dependency in public nursing homes.  That is our starting point.  We should make decisions on what we will do after that, rather than rushing into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C01500"><p>Okay.  We will thank them for the invitation and we will hold over the issue for now.  We will just hold on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C01600"><p>I beg the Chairman's pardon.  I am not saying that we should not visit a public nursing home but that the issue that has come before us is the high dependency level and issues like that.  I do not think we should rush off to visit a public nursing home and feel we have to balance it with private nursing homes.  I do not think that is necessary at this point.  I think it is necessary to gather information and elucidate what the HSE is trying to point out to us, that is, that there is an unfair comparison.  Perhaps we could include such a visit after that.  I would have no problem with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300004#C01700"><p>Perhaps then we will pick a private nursing home more convenient to here.  We will agree in principle to accept the invitation, subject to timing, but I think it will probably be after Easter in any event.  We will not set a date just yet.  I am not quite sure.  We will ask the secretary to liaise with a view to facilitating this.  We want to respect the dignity of the residents when we visit the place too.  I am sure the HSE will ensure that happens in any event.</p></speech>

Perhaps a Tuesday morning.  We will ask the secretariat to liaise.  If we get it far enough in advance it should be possible.  Again I stress that a minimum number going is an important factor as well.  We will move on.</p>  <p>  No. 307B is correspondence dated 15 February 2017 from NAMA regarding clarification of information sought from Project Eagle.  What is that?</p></speech>

It is just clarifying information.  We will note that.  We have already examined that in our report.</p>  <p>  No. 308B 1-3 is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Maurice Quinn, Secretary General at the Department of Defence.  This is in follow-up to the appearance of the Department before the committee on 26 January and its subsequent request for information.  We might hold this over until next week.  I have not had an opportunity to study it and I would like to do so.  We will hold it over to next week.  It will be on next week's correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  Category C correspondence is regarding private individuals.  No. 299C is correspondence dated 10 February 2017 received from an individual in respect of the North Meath Community Development Association.  This matter is being dealt with in the Department and we await a response from the Minister.  When we receive that we will advance it further.  We will note that.</p>  <p>  No. 304C is correspondence received from an individual alleging misconduct by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a waste of public money by garda&iacute;, the Judiciary and State-paid solicitors in another Department.  I propose that the Clerk to the Committee advise the person to take the matter up with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the first instance.  If there is alleged corruption in the Garda or use of resources to intimidate then that may be investigated.  Is it agreed that we tell the individual, if he has a complaint against the garda&iacute;, to take it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  No. 305C is correspondence dated 13 February 2017 from an individual following correspondence from the committee.  While the individual may feel that the committee is dismissing his correspondence by contacting the Arts Council for an explanation, it is normal procedure for the secretariat to contact the relevant body.  We considered this individual's correspondence at some length quite recently.  We will write back to the individual and state that we are noting his correspondence and we now consider the case closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  No. 306C is correspondence dated 13 February 2017 from the social care division of the HSE in follow-up to correspondence to the committee received regarding Nua Healthcare.  Does Deputy Cullinane want to comment on this?  Should we forward it to Nua Healthcare or does he want to come back to it next week?</p></speech>

The Deputy is happy to note that.</p>  <p>  That is correspondence received.  The next item is on reports and statements of account received since the last meeting.  I will open up this particular topic by acknowledging a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published on this issue during the week, that is, Special Report No. 95, financial reporting in the public sector.  It was published on 21 February 2017.  It was completed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the timeliness of financial reporting in the public sector.  Most public sector bodies are required to have their accounts prepared within three months.  Two thirds of all bodies missed that deadline.  That is 200 out of approximately 300.  We are not talking about the direct line Departments, which meet the deadlines for annual audit and the appropriations account.</p> <p>It is to do with the bodies and I have therefore asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to produce a list of those on a Department-by-Department basis to see which Departments are the principal offenders.  We will then call in those Accounting Officers.  The Department of Health one, due to the establishment of the ETBs, was a set-up situation so there are understandably quite a lot of delays in that area.  Notwithstanding that, the education sector has been a particular problem.  I do not believe the Accounting Officers have paid sufficient attention to this area.  They come in looking for money for public bodies every year and they have no idea why they are not in the audited accounts that have already been submitted in respect of prior years.  Our committee will be putting down a marker on that.  It is directly related to the report, Financial Reporting in the Public Sector, which was published only two days ago.  </p> <p> The Comptroller and Auditor General might say a few brief words on this topic to which we will return as we have a special report on it.  We will not discuss it today but I just want to highlight it.</p></speech>

Since this committee has been in office, I have been trying to push the idea that prompt submission of financial statements is important.  There are structural difficulties in the system and I have tried to set those out in a fair way in the report.  I hope it is comprehensive and I will try to repeat it.  This relates to the 2014 year of account.  I will try to update it for 2015 so the committee will have up-to-date information.  I will also try to replicate that reporting annually in order that a focus can be kept on this.  The committee, ourselves and the audited bodies have succeeded in bringing forward the financial report and progress has been made.  I would like to put that on the record.  Even further progress has been made in 2016 but we are still in a situation where many bodies are quite late in completing the financial reporting process.  That means that information is coming to the committee too late to address problems in a timely way.</p></speech>

At year-end of 2016, a full 12 months after the end of 2015, we had just 16 sets of financial statements where the audit had not been completed.</p></speech>

We will return to that topic because there is a special report.  The item before us today is to note the financial statements and accounts received since our meeting of Thursday, 16 February 2017.  The first item is 4.1 - the Health and Safety Authority, which has a clean audit report.</p>  <p>  The next item, 4.2, is the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency's &euro;16.9 million turnover.  It has a clear audited opinion and it relates to the 2015 accounts.  It provides services and supports for social housing to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can explain a reference in his report to the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  At the end of the 2014 audit that agency seems to have been substantially in arrears, according to page 30 of the report.  Is that the same organisation we will be asking the Department about?</p></speech>

Even at the stage we were doing the report, we were indicating that it had not been completed by the end of 2015.  Therefore the 2014 audit dragged into the beginning of 2016.  The Chairman can see there that was probably in January or February of 2016.</p></speech>

Today the committee is dealing with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Next Thursday, 2 March, it will be the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We will be dealing with the central fund of local authorities, as well as progress on land aggregation and the departmental Vote.</p>  <p>  On Thursday, 9 March it will be the HSE, dealing with patients' private property accounts, financial statements on the fair deal scheme and the health repayments scheme donations fund.  Those are three specific topics for the HSE, so it will not be a general HSE discussion. </p>  <p>  On Thursday, 23 March we will have the Department of Education and Skills.  Can we start by agreeing some suggested dates for the third level colleges?  We do not want it to take too many weeks.  It is now in front of us on the screen.  These are possibilities that are all subject to confirmation.  I want members to have an indication of where we are going but the dates may change.  They are possibilities for people to work on, however.</p>  <p>  On 30 March we will examine the University of Limerick, University College Cork and NUI Galway.  We will have to bring in each group separately, but it is a matter for us to decide.  We will have a limited time for each group.  If we did them one or two at a time it would take us from here to the summer recess.  We want to cover them all, so we might restrict the number of questioners.  Some members might ask questions of the first institution, while three or four might ask the next one.  We will work that out, but if all 13 of us ask questions of every institution that comes in we will be here forever.  We might therefore plan our own progress and timetable.  </p>  <p>  The plan is to try to do three institutions, but they will be long days if we are having three.  There will be breaks at the end of each session, but if we did them any slower we would be here for far too long.  There are other items to get on to.  That is a possibility for 30 March.  </p>  <p>  On the 6 April, we will examine Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology and the Higher Education Authority.  Can they come any earlier or is that the suggested date?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300006#E03000"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The 2015 appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport received a clear audit opinion, with no material issues arising for reporting.  The account records gross expenditure of &euro;1.73 billion in 2015.  Receipts into the Vote totalled &euro;406 million, &euro;370 million of which was accounted for by a transfer of funding from the local government fund, which the committee will be aware is substantially funded by motor taxation receipts.</p>  <p>  The gross Vote expenditure in 2015 was spread across five expenditure programmes, as outlined in the diagram on screen.  The bulk of the spend was under the Department&rsquo;s land transport programme, accounting for 81% of its total expenditure.  I understand that the Accounting Officer will provide more detail on the programme expenditure in his opening remarks.</p>  <p>  Just under 85% of the Vote expenditure related to funding provided to other public bodies in the form of current and capital funding.  A number of the bodies are significant grant awarding bodies in their own right.  I have prepared a diagram which is on the next page of my statement - it might be put up the screen - which tries to summarise and categorise the bodies under the aegis of the Department.  I will explain the diagram.</p>  <p>  A number of the bodies the Department overseas are within my audit remit and so there are reports on the financial statements of those bodies and they come before the committee.  The more substantial ones that fall into that category are Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Sport Ireland.  All of those are substantial grant awarding bodies in their own right.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are other bodies under the aegis of the Department which are substantially funded by the Department for their operations or which are regulators.  All of those come within my remit, for instance, the Road Safety Authority, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the Commission for Railway Regulation, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</p> <p>Funding is also provided from the Vote to Tourism Ireland Limited.  This is an all-Ireland body that was set up under the 1998 agreement which is audited by me in conjunction with my equivalent in Northern Ireland.  It also receives funding in Northern Ireland.</p> <p> Then there is a set of commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department that are not audited by me - members will be familiar with that - and therefore do not directly fall within the remit of the committee either.  These include the CIE Group, the harbour boards, Dublin Airport Authority, the Shannon Group and the Irish Aviation Authority.  I also pointed out that there is funding from the Department to Sport Ireland and through it to national sports governing bodies and local sports clubs and so on.  Again, they are not audited by me but, depending on the scale of the funding, I may have inspection rights.</p> <p> Finally I draw attention in the diagram to the existence of the Irish Coast Guard, which is part of the Department.  It is an agency within it.  I prepared the diagram because I thought there were quite a number of bodies and it might be helpful to the committee to understand the relationship between the bodies and the Department. </p> <p> On the Vote outturn for 2015, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved a Supplementary Estimate of a net &euro;100 million for Vote 31 in November 2015.  This was mainly to allow additional capital funding for investment in roads, rail and light rail networks and bus fleet.  At the year end, a net &euro;22 million remained unspent.  The sum of &euro;16.1 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2016 with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result, just under &euro;6 million was liable for surrender at the end of the year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-23a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017022300007#F00300"><p>I have provided members with a detailed briefing on the 2015 appropriation account which is the subject of today&rsquo;s hearing.  My Department was not the subject of focus in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2015 so the briefing the committee has describes spending programmes across the entire Vote.<br/><br/>In 2015, the Department&rsquo;s overall gross expenditure was &euro;1.6 billion.  Our final outturn for the year, thanks to a Supplementary Estimate, was over &euro;1.7 billion.  The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided between five main expenditure programmes and the administrative budget.  As Deputies will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the Department&rsquo;s aegis which we oversee in accordance with the code of practice for the corporate governance of State bodies.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for the diagram, which is very helpful this morning.  Much of the funding within this Vote is channelled through these State agencies and, as pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, they are audited separately in terms of that expenditure.<br/><br/>In 2015, 80% of the Vote went towards the land transport programme, at almost &euro;1.3 billion.  This programme provides for spending in the area of roads and public transport.  The roads programme spent almost &euro;730 million, covering national, regional and local roads as well as PPP operational payments.  The bulk of this funding is spent on the maintenance and upkeep of our road network, with some limited funding for new road developments.<br/><br/>Investment in the public transport infrastructure totalled almost &euro;340 million that year, including Luas Cross City works.  That project is still on target for completion of works and commencement of services this year.  Funding was also provided to the National Transport Authority for PSO buses for the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann fleets and for the continued implementation of various programmes around sustainable travel, traffic management, regional cities and accessibility grants.  The public transport subhead also provides capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann primarily for maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network nationwide under the multi-annual infrastructure manager contract, IMMAC.  In 2015, &euro;209 million was committed towards public service obligation for public transport services.  This was the first time since the fiscal crisis that funding was maintained rather than decreased.  Subsequent budgets for 2016 and 2017 have seen the level of public service obligation funding increase substantially.<br/><br/>The tourism services programme, accounted for 8%<b>, </b>or &euro;120 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  This comprises the programme and administrative spend of the two tourism agencies, that is, F&aacute;ilte Ireland at &euro;56 million and Tourism Ireland at &euro;15 million, as well as the tourism marketing fund at &euro;34 million and the tourism product development programme at &euro;13 million.  At the time, 2015 was a record year for visitor numbers to Ireland, with a total of 8.6 million visitors, an increase of almost 14% on 2014.  These trends have continued.  In 2015, a tourism policy - People, Place and Policy - was launched which set ambitious goals for the sector to 2025.  The year 2015 also saw the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, building on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It is clear that Brexit presents a particular challenge to the tourism sector.  Over recent months, we have been working very closely with the tourism agencies and tourism stakeholders to ensure Ireland is positioned well to address these challenges.<br/><br/>The maritime transport and safety programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;91 million, of the Vote in 2015.  The main expenditure programme here relates to supports to the Irish Coast Guard at &euro;76 million.  In 2015, the Coast Guard responded to over 2,600 incidents and the search and rescue helicopters were tasked over 1,000 times.  The year 2015 also saw significant progress in the modernisation of equipment and processes within the Coast Guard, including a new IT-based incident logging system within the three rescue co-ordination centres.  This new system has greatly improved operational effectiveness and efficiency within the centres.<br/><br/>The sports and recreation services programme accounted for 6%, or &euro;90 million, of the Department's Vote in 2015.  The programme supported the Irish Sports Council and National Sports Campus, at &euro;57 million.  Both have since merged to form Sport Ireland.  We provide funding to the sports capital programme and the swimming pools programme.  During 2015, significant progress was made in the development of facilities at the National Sport Campus, including work on the development of a new high performance centre, a new multi-purpose campus conference centre.  Work also commenced on the National Indoor Arena which has since been completed.<br/><br/>In 2015, the gross expenditure provision for the aviation programme was &euro;26 million, or 2%, of the Vote.  The largest beneficiary of the funding is the regional airports programme, at &euro;12 million.  This programme also covers costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol and subscriptions to other international organisations.  The year 2015 saw the publication of the national aviation policy following significant stakeholder consultations.  A key element of the policy was the subsequent establishment of a National Aviation Development Forum which had its first annual conference last Monday. <br/><br/>Finally, the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget, at &euro;34 million, represents 1.7% of overall spend.  It covers pay costs for the Department&rsquo;s staff of around 450 in 2015 and administrative overheads such as IT, travel, utilities and accommodation services.<br/><br/>Over recent years, the Department has been proactive in developing new policy responses across its remit on a strong evidence basis.  I have mentioned a number of these already.  However, a particularly important piece of evidence-based policy was the strategic framework for investment in land transport, which we call the SFILT, that was published in August 2015.  This strategic framework considered what role transport needs to play in the future development of the economy and to estimate the appropriate level of investment in the land transport system.  The evidence analysis provided important inputs to the existing capital plan and it will also inform our input to the review of that plan which was announced earlier this month.<br/><br/>I hope that this opening statement has provided the committee with a broad overview of the expenditure areas under my remit and that it has been helpful to the committee as it examines the 2015 appropriation account.</p></speech>

However, I wish to establish the Department's role in terms of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I also want to deal with the public service provision payments, which are under Mr. Doyle's Department's remit.  My first question relates to the public service subvention for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Does Mr. Doyle have the figures on the levels of subvention going back, say, over the past seven or eight years to hand?  For example, would he have the figure for 2010 at his fingertips?</p></speech>

It is not necessarily a level playing field.  I have mentioned just one example.  There are other examples.  The CIE express service cannot use the full motorway, whereas the private operators can do so.  Mr. Doyle has explained that competition rules constitute a legal impediment to the provision of additional subventions, but does he not see that the absence of a level playing field for the public and private operators is a problem in that context?</p></speech>

We have just established that there has been a significant decrease in the subvention payments for public service provision since 2010.  We have also heard from Mr. Doyle today that there has been a freeze in the free travel contribution.  All of this tells me that Bus &Eacute;ireann is facing significant challenges as it seeks to provide a service without the levels of subvention it would have received in the past.  The current situation is of relevance in this context.</p></speech>

The changes that are being made bring that about on a general basis, so, I suppose, the benefit to Ireland is that if we were in that same space again we would actually have to make a prior notification in relation to it.

I signalled to the Chairman in advance that I would raise this and I have sent a copy of the transcript to Mr. Doyle.  The Department made additional funding available for regional airports, but we had a Minister in Waterford who said there was absolute resistance from departmental officials to fund Waterford Airport and went on to say that the airport would have been closed were it not for the Minister, Deputy Ross, who was sitting there.  His experience was that it was a terrible job, as he described it, dealing with officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Mr. Doyle has seen that transcript.  I give him the opportunity to respond.  It is a serious charge to make.  It would concern people in Waterford and other areas if the departmental officials were offering that type of resistance to funding regional airports.  I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on that.</p></speech>

The Department has been hugely supportive of the airport over the last number of years.  In the last decade I think approximately &euro;20 million has been allocated to Waterford Airport under the various programmes.  My own experience of dealing with the Department in regard to the airport was always very positive.  While I would not want to put words in other people's mouths, I would be surprised if the airport itself would cite anything other than huge co-operation from the Department in relation to its efforts to try to bring new carriers to the airport, as it has suffered from the loss of a variety of carriers over the last couple of years.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss the PSO aspect of CIE.  If some of the Expressway services were relinquished and returned to PSO, is it true that the National Transport Authority would have to find money out of its current funds to cover the PSO aspect of those services if they went out to tender?</p></speech>

It did that a couple of years ago in relation to the X5 and X7 routes.  It looks at existing services to see if tweaks can be applied to existing services, be they existing PSO services, rural transport services or otherwise, to try to fill the public transport need.  It will apply some of its budget to do that.  On the last occasion, yes, there was a cost.  I do not have it to hand.  I believe it was a relatively small cost in terms of the backfill that the NTA engaged in.  However, the NTA does ensure it has flexibility in its budget.  While we would always like more budget for PSO services, it does ensure there is flexibility to make changes where it needs to make them.</p></speech>

I am sorry to be giving the Deputy a figure of the top of my head, but in relation to the X5 and X7, my recollection is the cost was something of the order of &euro;1.5 million.  It was a relatively small cost to extend services and they were quite substantial routes.</p></speech>

What is the relationship between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Department of Social Protection in covering those?  There is no obligation on the commercial providers to offer free travel to those with a free-travel pass; some do and some do not.  What evaluation happens between the two Departments to ensure that people are provided with transport?</p></speech>

However the demand varies in relation to that.  That has been what it has been receiving for the last number of years.  The Minister is on record publicly as saying that we are engaging with the Department of Social Protection at the moment in relation to the matter of free travel.  We have a concern that the funding in relation to it has been frozen for a period of time and the demand has been increasing.  So we are engaging with that Department at the moment in relation to the overall amount provided for free travel, which is primarily provided to the CIE group of companies, but, as the Deputy says, is also provided to some private operators.</p></speech>

Some of that is made up from the motor taxation fund.  By my reckoning about a third of that comes from what is collected in motor taxation.  Just after the crash we heard that we would sweat assets.  It is possible to sweat them to the point that they become liabilities.  Might we, or somebody else, be here in five or ten years' time talking about the multiplier effect of not spending now, particularly on road maintenance?  What are we likely to have to spend in addition to what would be required if we had a maintenance budget that was adequate?</p> <p>Is there a projection for that?  There is a significant shortfall.</p></speech>

We carried out a significant piece of work which I referred to earlier on, the strategic framework for investment in land transport, SFILT.  The SFILT had a few aims.  A primary aim was maintaining roads.  It is one thing to make a case for opening new roads but it is another to maintain them, although less glamorous.  It is critically important because if the maintenance is not carried out over a period of time then the cost of restoration at some point in the future becomes very significant.</p>  <p>  We found from that work that if we applied our total Department Vote to maintaining the land transport network, both roads and public transport, it would be about &euro;300 million per annum shy of what would be needed to maintain what we termed the steady state.  That is if we applied our entire budget to that end.  The shortfall for what we believe we should be providing for the road network compared to what we are providing to maintain it is very significant.  It accumulates over time as I think the Deputy was suggesting in her question.  That has been a significant concern.  That thinking and analysis fed into the capital plan.  It was our primary point of argument for the capital plan as well as looking at key roads projects.  Primarily, we would have argued very strongly to get up to maintaining our current road network.</p></speech>

There is a very significant amount foregone from value-added tax.  It is projected to be &euro;626 million in 2016.  That would not necessarily have found its way into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but is a risk analysis being done about Brexit, currency fluctuations and such?  Is an evaluation being done about whether a different approach might need to be taken, requiring a different funding mechanism?</p>  <p>  The &euro;626 million foregone is not exclusively from restaurants and hotels.

We have supported it over the last number of years.  The sector is a significant employer and has been a mainstay of the economic recovery.  We have supported the VAT measures for the industry.  It is probably the key support for the tourism industry, notwithstanding all of the very important work done through our agencies and the various budgets that we provide.</p>  <p>  There are some areas, around Dublin and in other parts of the country, where we have been dealing with problems of growth due to concerns that we maintain our cost-competitiveness in the tourism industry, particularly in the light of Brexit, and about constraints in capacity in accommodation.  We are keen to continue to support the industry in the context of Brexit.  We are supportive of the VAT rate and we will argue to maintain it.  I am sure we have some analysis on that.

It is very much a demand-led programme so we pay out on the basis of stage payments or completion of works in regard to the projects themselves and we can only do that as we receive those funding requests.  There were delays in a number of those projects.  What we have done more recently is we have looked at the funding available and we put out a call for submissions in regard to other swimming pool projects that could be funded.  Three of those were considered and funding was applied to two of them.  That is the approach we took last year in responding to the fact that funding was not being drawn down.</p></speech>

However, there is a trend, if we look at it on a <i>per capita</i>basis, where areas that would possibly not be in a position to come up with matching funds feature poorly.  For instance, Westmeath was top of that and that could have been for local reasons in a given year but there are places at the bottom of it which are getting a very poor amount of funding relative to their population.  Does the Department look at that scheme in terms of varying the scheme depending the wealth of an area and its ability to come up with matching funding, for example?</p></speech>

What happens is that an assessment of the projects, as they fall, is carried out and there is a rebalancing at the end in terms of spreading the funding to make sure that there is a fair crack of the whip across the country.  The requirement for matching funding in that regard, which was the first part of the Deputy's question, is about 5%.  It is a relatively small percentage, which I appreciate can be difficult to raise, and I know that clubs raise it in a variety of ways from particular sponsorship lump sums, from fundraising activities or whatever.  It is a feature now of very many grant programmes that a certain level of matching funding is required but we keep it relatively low in the sports capital programme.</p></speech>

In terms of how we split it, we have three main programmes which go towards roads - restoration maintenance, which is the surface dressing programme; restoration improvement, which is rehabilitation of payments; and a discretionary grant programme.  Normally, they account for maybe over 85% of our budget for regional and local roads and they are all mileage based.  The only exception is that there is a factor of 1.3 applied for Kildare and Meath because of traffic volumes, and the cities have a factor of 2 applied to them.  Apart from that, it is on a per kilometer basis.</p></speech>

There are actually three different types of contract.  In the first, the contractor carries all the risk regarding traffic.  That was the original batch of PPPs.  The one we have now is simply availability payments and the contractor is not carrying any risk in relation to what traffic uses the road.  Then there were two schemes which were part of the first batch but were too large to have the normal arrangement so that one would not get contractors to carry the risk.

It arises from a representation I received but it is also general point as well and it relates to the decal symbol that one is obliged to display on a taxi.  Taxi drivers seem to be obliged to display these 24 hours a day.  According to the representations I have received, it has serious implications for their insurance.  Could the Department clarify that for me?  Why can they not remove it or use a magnetic system where that could come off when they are using the taxi for family purposes?</p></speech>

I was elected first elected a public representative in 1999.  I cannot tell Mr. Doyle how many public transport documents I have seen in my 17 years.  Smarter Travel Galway is, I would say without exaggeration, the 15th document for Galway alone.  We have massive congestion on our roads at peak times.  Galway, in particular, is a medieval city and it has massive traffic on its roads at peak times only and an unsustainable reliance on cars.  I am not blaming the cars.  We have put nothing in place, despite all of these documents.</p>  <p>  I have here another lovely framework.  I could not but praise the Government on Towards a National Planning Framework.  I am actually praising the Government on this matter.  The document states the framework will address matters, including "Promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas including measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the necessity of adaptation to climate change".  It sounds wonderful.  The reality is far from wonderful, despite all these lovely documents.  In fact, for Galway city, there is an N6 project - another road.  This is under the Department's watch, where we have one window of opportunity in regard to climate change.  This is the last D&aacute;il that will come up with meaningful action on climate change.  Otherwise, it is too late.  That is what all of the non-governmental organisations are telling us.  Yet the solution in Galway is a road.  All the public transport elements have been tagged onto it.  In fact, only yesterday the news was that they have now delayed the public consultation period for the N6 project because of the massive volumes of submissions.  I predict that the vast amount of those submissions state: "Please, do not go ahead with a road, please, go public transport and please, go light rail."  That is my longest question and I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on it.</p></speech>

These are positives but Galway needs better solutions.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's comments on strategies.  To specifically address the Deputy's comment that a big part of the solution is a road, Galway, of the cities around the country, is the one city that really has not had a relief road, bypass or something that takes cars out of the centre.  There are very few people who I encounter who are more adamant about public transport versus roads than the people on the National Transport Authority.  My understanding is that they are supportive of the concept of a road in this case because it allows for greater public transport use through the city.</p></speech>

That is what they tell us.  I have a completely different point of view.  It is based on 17 years of going down a cul de sac in regard to an outer bypass with millions of euro spent on it.  Then we go forward with a road.  It is not an outer bypass; it is a ring-road.  The public transport elements are tagged on to it.  There is no paradigm shift here on the part of the Department and certainly on the part of the officials in Galway, on the reality that we cannot go on building roads.  In regard to the road, the evidence is that more than 90% of the cars want to go into the city because that is where the industry, the university, the GMIT, the hospitals, etc., are.  We need public transport.</p> <p>The Department needs to examine its policies in regard to reducing emissions in the context of climate change and to develop a policy around reducing the volume of traffic on our roads in that context also.  The Department has a responsibility to do that.  Even if the road was the solution it cannot be built in the near future.  An increase in school transport provision for the pupils of the 30 to 35 schools in this 2 km zone would reduce the volume of traffic on this road.  I am sure the response to that proposal will be that school transport is a matter for another Department.  However, it is one solution.  </p> <p> We must insist on public mobility plans in every industry and institution.  The bicycle scheme mentioned is very limited.  I am a cyclist.  The scheme is tourism rather than commuter based.  While it is welcome, it is limited in terms of what it can achieve.  The philosophy appears to be one of add on public transport but keep going the road. </p></speech>

Public transport must be central in all that we do.  Leaving aside all of the issues around climate change and so on, the level of commuting is expected to increase significantly over the next number of years.  As there is not sufficient road space to cope with this, the only way we can handle it is through increased public transport provision.  For that reason, public transport is central in all that we do.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that only 8% of people in Galway use the bus service.  People in Galway do not use the buses because the service is not frequent enough.  There have been many proposals for a light rail system.  I read an article in one of today's newspapers in which Mr. Conor Faughnan calls for a light rail system.  A group of us in Galway have continually called for such a service as the most sustainable way forward in terms of the current road infrastructure.  I would welcome further engagement with Mr. Doyle on the issue of sustainable transport but I will settle at this point for a response to the other questions I posed.</p></speech>

The current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been very vocal about Glenalbyn swimming pool, which is in his constituency.  It also happens to be in my constituency.  This pool was closed in December 2013 and in-filled in December 2016.  What is the role of the Minister and the Department with regard to swimming pools?  I am sure this is not the only swimming pool alluded to today.  This is not a desirable situation.  It is, in fact, an extremely upsetting and distressing situation for the local communities concerned.  Perhaps Mr. Doyle would provide some feedback on this issue.</p></speech>

The funding is carried forward.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred earlier to the carry forward of capital in our Vote.  Funding carried forward under the swimming pools programme would form part of that.  As I said, funding in regard to the particular swimming pools mentioned is not lost rather it is carried forward if there is a delay.</p>  <p>  In regard to swimming pools in general, I accept the comments made.  As a Department, we are very supportive of swimming pools contributing to our overall objectives in terms of participation in sport and physical activity.  This will be taken into consideration in the context of capital funding provision under the sports programme over the next number of years, the review of the capital plan and in terms of the sports policy on which work is currently under way.  </p></speech>

The city centre, in terms of traffic, comes to a stand-still on a rainy day never mind during stormy weather.  What work is undertaken by the Department in terms of projecting assistance in that situation?  As a result of stormy weather, there were lengthy delays on the DART and Luas services this morning and traffic congestion was very bad.  It is not acceptable that this is allowed to occur in our capital city.  More funding should be directed towards research programmes to address this issue. Are there programmes of this type in place?</p></speech>

The NTA operates various models in regard to traffic congestion.  For example, we know that an additional 5% increase in traffic on our roads leads to a significant increase in the level of congestion on our roads.  Our objective in terms of being a facilitator for transport and economic activity that helps to energise the economy, is to avoid that.  We want avoid congestion in a general sense or of the type that occurred today which causes a drag on the economy.  It is the case that weather on a given day can impact on congestion unless people are prepared to travel by bicycle in windy conditions and so on.  We see an exaggerated sense of a congestion problem on a day like to day.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

The other third comprises vehicular traffic.  The smarter travel programme involves making small interventions, for example to improve cycling facilities, and there is also a demonstration element to the work.

There may be a potential to extend it on a year-by-year basis for up to three years.  There was a review of search and rescue and the new contract provides for significantly updated and more capable helicopters.  We previously used S-61 helicopters with 30 year old airframes but they were replaced with the S-91 helicopter.</p></speech>

Surely the Department can issue a policy to the effect that it believes in and supports the PAS and that the PAS will be used for the filling of all major vacancies.  First, why did that not happen at F&aacute;ilte Ireland?  This is not a political point, as I have done the political thing with the Minister, Deputy Ross.

This has been going on for 15 months.  There was a good announcement for Cork today but the fact is that it was hung off the concept that the flights would be in and out of Cork.  In fact, for 15 months, all we heard about was Cork.  I understand that what has been announced today is that there will be 12 flights for Dublin, six flights for Belfast, four flights for Shannon and three flights for Cork.  As far as I am concerned, this is a Trojan horse.  I welcome the fact that they are coming into this country and the fact that we will have our first ever transatlantic flights out of Cork as opposed to the other airports.  There are no flights for Knock which supported this, which raises other questions.  When did the Department first know that there would be flights out of Dublin?</p></speech>

I cannot tell the Deputy exactly when people in the aviation division in the Department found that out.  I can certainly come back to the Deputy about it.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he could also provide me with correspondence - e-mails or letters - between the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and the Department about this matter over the past 15 months?  There might not be much material but I would appreciate it if we could receive it.  The DAA, which is an agency under the remit of the Department, sold a project that was then supported for bringing transatlantic flights to Cork.  What we have today is an announcement that is effectively part of an agenda to bring a third terminal to Dublin.  Coincidentally, the Minister announced a few days ago that a study into a third terminal would take place.  What we have here is a strangulation of the other airports.  After today, I have no confidence in the board of the DAA.  By using Cork as a Trojan horse, the DAA has effectively pushed up passenger numbers for Dublin.  I welcome the fact that Norwegian Airlines is being brought in but the way this was done needs to be investigated.  We need to get to the bottom of what was really going on here.  If you look at projections for all other airports in this country, from 2012 to now, Dublin has gone from 81% to 86% of all passengers while all other airports have gone down.  Mr. Doyle has a very good knowledge of this area.  I want to find out how long this was going on.  As far as I am concerned, there was a DAA agenda and I want to know whether or not the Department was complicit in this.  I take Mr. Doyle's bona fides.  He told me that he only found out a couple of weeks ago.  I want to know who in the Department first knew about this.</p></speech>

The issue for me is very simple.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is driving down to Cork today to welcome this.  I welcome the fact that there will be three flights into one destination and not into Boston or New York, as was said.  I believe they are going to Providence.  This was sold as a game changer and it is a positive move for Cork.  However, it was sold as being about Cork.  I want to know if the DAA was always looking at Cork or whether there was underlying agenda in order to get it into Dublin.  By coincidence, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has just announced his review regarding a third terminal at Dublin.  This needs to be worked out.</p></speech>

Being a rural Deputy, I am aware of the importance of such services.  I come from Kilkenny.  Expressway services are important for connectivity in rural Ireland.  We have PSO lines, many of which go to Dublin.  The format for Expressway should be changed.  I am speaking about the south east.  I accept a bus starting in Waterford, stopping in Kilkenny and Carlow and going straight to Dublin is an express bus but, as Deputy Cullinane said, I do not accept a bus that starts in Waterford and stops in Ballyhale, Mullinavat, Paulstown and Gowran, which are all little towns in Kilkenny, and connects up the whole way is an express bus.  This involves nine stops.  That is not an express bus.  That is a different criterion and the sooner the NTA or the Minister - whoever is in charge of this - changes the statement that it is an express bus, the better.  It is not an express bus.  I can understand an express bus involving getting on in one place, having two stops and then heading on to Dublin.  The reason I am saying this is because of the PSO.  My understanding is that under the law, we cannot subsidise an Expressway route but if the criteria were changed, it could be looked at.  Due to the ongoing negotiations and the possible breakdown of the talks between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions, I fear that we will lose services in rural Ireland.  The Minister needs to meet the parties.  I know the matter has nothing to do with the Department.</p> <p>The Minister must get these people around the table.  He must get in representatives of the National Transport Authority, the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann and sit around the table with them.  The free travel is another issue.  It has been frozen since 2010.  Figures were mentioned and that can be looked at.  At least half the money could be got from those and the unions and Bus &Eacute;ireann could work out the other problems they have.  Can the witness influence this so that connectivity can be kept in rural Ireland in order to keep it alive?  The Government is talking about keeping rural Ireland alive but unless people have services every day to go to colleges, the airport or shopping, we will see more isolation, particularly with older people.</p></speech>

They were dealt with through what is called a direct award contract.  The package of services within that is open to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to contract with the operator, or Bus &Eacute;ireann in the case of many of its services.  It provides funding or subsidy to enable those services to operate.  The services mentioned by the Deputy as going through a number of towns - which they do in many cases - were presented by Bus &Eacute;ireann as commercial services.  At the time they were profitable and would not have received subvention.  I explained to Deputy Cullinane earlier that the National Transport Authority licences those services.  It does not require Bus &Eacute;ireann to make the stops that it does and it is open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to seek revision of those licence conditions in terms of where a bus stops and taking into account where other operators stop.</p>  <p>  If Bus &Eacute;ireann decides to do that, to the extent that those services were covering a public service or a need for a public service, it is open to the NTA to bring about a solution that prevents people who need those public services from being denied them.  It does that in a number of ways.  It can extend existing PSO services in some instances to backfill the service.  It can make changes in some of the rural transport programme to provide the services or it can tender services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann or somebody else could apply for those.  That is how it would be dealt with.</p></speech>

They were the national primary routes.  When the motorway was built, they were not changed.  We opened the services to private contractors but they are taking the cream.  They are not under obligation to go to the small villages and towns off the motorway that are in need of services.  We need to change the criteria fast and if we do not, we will lose the services.  In fairness, Bus &Eacute;ireann is still giving a service on many routes but it will lose &euro;9 million this year.  That cannot continue.</p>  <p>  Can private operators take this cream and go away?  Should there not be an obligation on them to provide some kind of service to rural areas?  If there is not, the public service obligation should be given to Bus &Eacute;ireann or whatever private operator can provide the existing services.  They need subsistence to keep the services in place and they are not viable on their own.</p></speech>

It is regulated competition, with the National Transport Authority being the regulator.  One must apply for a licence and get it or an altered version if one is prepared to accept it.  The NTA has refused more licences in this regard than it has accepted over recent years.  There are large chunks of the public who want to travel on direct services.  At this point the market has grown to the extent that there are approximately 23 million passenger journeys on commercial services, of which Bus &Eacute;ireann at this point accounts for approximately 30%.  The market has grown very significantly and we see many more people travelling on public transport as a result of that measure.  If this results in a position where Bus &Eacute;ireann can no longer serve towns that must be served, there is a mechanism that can be used.  In fairness to the National Transport Authority, it has been at pains in recent times - as recently as yesterday in a committee room here - to point out that it has the power to step in if Bus &Eacute;ireann pulls away and a public service need must be met.</p></speech>

Old people are being put in minibuses, etc.  I am talking about existing services, with buses of 45 or 50 seats, that go to Dublin.  The luxury buses are being taken away and a substandard services would be substituted.  That will not work.  Rural Ireland deserves its whack too from the PSO.  Much of it goes to Dublin, although I know there are 1.2 million people here and they need public services.  We in rural Ireland need public services too and it is a matter of balancing the issue.  That must be done.  We cannot have some kind of substandard service that people will not use because of timescales and buses not being up to scratch.  I attended a presentation last week relating to this and I have been told a substandard service has been substituted and it is nothing like what was there before.  It is not working.  I want to hold what we have with a proper service.</p></speech>

The Department is very anxious to serve the transport needs of citizens throughout the country.  I can give the Deputy a rough figure as it is while since we have run the calculation but my understanding is that we spend approximately 80% of our overall budget outside the greater Dublin area, depending on how that is cut.  We are very anxious to provide services throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am being very parochial in mentioning Waterford regional airport again.  There are four regional airports getting subsistence of &euro;12 million.  Is that correct?  There are probably eight or nine regional airports in total in Ireland.  What criteria was used to give subsistence to four regional airports and why was Waterford not included?</p></speech>

With Kerry and Donegal there is a PSO air service, with a subsidy in that instance paid to airlines to operate a route, essentially, between those airports and Dublin.  In other cases, all airports can apply for funding.  At this point there are approximately four funding streams and what they really amount to is an ability for the Department to assist an airport in funding its safety and security activities.  Last year, Waterford Airport was the biggest recipient of funding under that programme, getting just over &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

Since the downturn in 2008, there has been a big shortfall in local authority funding.  Roads are funded partly by the authority itself and then by grants from central funding.  Are there plans to increase the funding because roads are falling behind?  I have seen reports stating they are falling behind by four or five years and that we will have a big problem if we do not start to increase funding.</p>  <p>  Vehicle taxes in general are all going into the Exchequer.  Is all the money from vehicle tax around the country spent on roads or was some syphoned off to Irish Water and such bodies?

There is a link between the local government fund and the expenditure on regional and local roads.  We are very anxious to increase the expenditure on regional and local roads in terms of exactly what the Deputy describes.  If we end up in a situation in which roads are under-maintained over a period, then the costs of correcting them become much more significant later on.  We do not want to store up that problem.</p>  <p>  In trying to answer Deputy Catherine Murphy's questions earlier on, I spoke about a significant analysis we had done that has informed our input into measures such as the capital plan, for example, whereby we quantified the underexpenditure in relation to what it cost to maintain what we call the steady state, or what it costs to maintain what we have, whatever about investing in new stuff.  What it costs to maintain what we have is significant because once one builds it, one must maintain it.</p></speech>

I have a number of short questions about some of the subheads.  The main one, which was touched on earlier by Deputy Connolly, relates to the environmental element of some of the programmes.  An additional sum of &euro;74 million was allocated in respect of and spent on heavy rail in 2015.  At what point does Mr. Doyle think the Department and its agencies will start to seriously consider expenditure to electrify the entire network?  That also includes the heavy rail carriages and locomotives.  I appreciate that there is a national policy element to the question but it is within the strategy of the Government and previous Governments to do that.  What sort of spend on a year-on-year basis has been invested in electrification and is there a significant programme of work to be undertaken before the roll-out of such an option for the national rail network?</p></speech>

In an overall sense, between PSOs and capital investment in rail, it takes up approximately 60% of expenditure on public transport.  The electrification of services can be very beneficial as one can run more train paths and it is a nicer and, quite often, better service for people to access.  We talked earlier about the DART underground project, but for that to work it is not just the tunnel itself, it is the wider electrification and that is what brings the benefits.  What we are trying to pursue in terms of priorities around electrification includes starting the works in Balbriggan under the spend in the capital plan.</p></speech>

Rail works best when one is dealing with travel from one high population centre to another and spreading the fixed costs, which are very heavy.  Deputy Farrell does not need me to tell him that.  I do not have an answer for the cost of doing it but I suspect it is in the billions.  Realistically, what we would have to do in terms of expenditure of the efforts and financial resources that we make out under capital plans is that we have to look at what the priorities are.  It is clear to us that the key priorities are the projects I have mentioned, one of which is certainly in under the existing capital plan and we will be pushing for others.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Doyle's point regarding the capital plan.  I am a firm supporter of it.  Clearly, my constituents would be great beneficiaries of it for a number of reasons &ndash; metro north, the airport and the DART extension to Balbriggan - but that is not the sole reason for my raising the issue this morning.  In fact, the primary reason is from an environmental perspective but also from the public expenditure side.</p>  <p>  My other question relates to metro north.

We have been told on a number of occasions that the vast majority of the product of that investment is being reused in the new metro north.  Could Mr. Doyle comment on that?</p></speech>

A lot of the work was done a number of years ago.  The DART expansion programme, as we prefer to call it, rather than the DART underground project, based on what we see already, has a positive cost-benefit analysis.  We believe that it has the potential to make significant changes in public transport in Dublin.  We are very supportive of the project but it is a megaproject in the context of Ireland's economy.  It is of a magnitude that it just was not possible to consider in the timeframe of the existing capital plan but for us it is a project that we will be pushing strongly at the centre to try to bring about.  Work was done a number of years ago on the project in very different economic times.  It is the expectation that some of that work can be re-used and, unfortunately, some of it will not be.</p></speech>

The new proposal is coming in significantly cheaper than that but one of the main concerns for a certain cohort of my constituents and beyond on the north side of Dublin is the capacity issue for the metro and its linkages with the existing network.  In terms of the planning and development of metro north and its integration with other transport services within the greater Dublin area the capacity should be front and centre in any consideration of platform length, tunnel capacity, access and egress to those underground stations and other such measures.  It is all well and good to talk about the savings to the Exchequer, which is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts exists, but it is also important to recognise that if we do not build in capacity, at a future point we would end up spending vast sums later in the process on extra carriages but also in terms of ancillary exits and access points for emergency purposes and for general access to stations.  That would be in no one's interests.</p> <p>It is a long question, probably with a short answer.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we must future proof these projects.  Work is happening on the Luas cross-city project to extend platforms to provide for longer trams to increase capacity.  That capacity is needed in those tramlines.  This is very important.  The original design of the tunnel for the DART underground was of a particular time and it was where the project was being engineered at that time.  Without falling into any of the traps the Deputy has rightly pointed out, we must redesign it in a way that allows us to find an optimal project that delivers the benefit to public transport we think it can deliver without over-engineering it at the same time.</p></speech>

As a former councillor since 2004, not unlike my colleague Deputy Connolly, although not for as many years as she, I am aware of the spatial strategies of two or three governments.  Is that level of planning still present within the Department, and is the growth of the GDA over the next 20 to 50 years under active consideration along with the infrastructure that would be required?  Have these been costed or is there actual expenditure on it?</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority has published that strategy and it ultimately had the consent of the Minister at the time.  The NTA is now working on an implementation plan and it will have to be presented.  I am not entirely sure of the timeframe but I believe it is going to be relatively shortly.</p></speech>

I want to ask about a current and active project relating to sports capital, which Deputies and Senators are always happy to talk about it.  I note the underspend in this area and I appreciate it is specific to Sport Ireland and the campus.  I assume the moneys will be spent and it is just a matter of the procurement and delivery.

Although on a matter completely unrelated to this committee, it was perhaps timely of Warren Deutrom of Cricket Ireland to send me an e-mail at 9 a.m. today.  He lives across the street from the area he talks about, one which will involve the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the near future, and I hope it will also involve the Minister and Ministers of State.  In the context of developing other sports and in looking at strategies for the likes of National Sports Campus Development Authority and the potential investment across the range of services provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department must not just be about sport and transport but must also look at the tourism potential of sport.</p>  <p>  For example, 600 million people in India watched a match that was televised in Malahide a couple of years ago.  These are markets we are simply unaware of.  This sport is considered a minority sport in Ireland and yet it has incredible reach.  Cricket in Ireland is about to go up a level in the league structure, which offers incredible potential to Ireland to put its foot in the door of the super league of cricket internationally.  Despite this, we do not have a national stadium or arena for the development of the sport.  Cricket Ireland has quadrupled its membership in four years.  We are talking about an explosion in support, and not just in the north of Dublin.  It is also happening elsewhere.  There is an active cricket club in each of the 32 counties in the island of Ireland.  This should be considered by the Department.  I appreciate the Chairman's leeway to me, but I believe the Department should consider this in terms of future planning whenever the policy decision might arise.  I wanted to take the opportunity to address that.</p></speech>

The first round of speakers have put their questions.  We will have some supplementary questions shortly, but I first want to ask about local sports grants.  Perhaps the witnesses can give the committee a breakdown county by county of grants, between public bodies and the voluntary community sporting organisations.  There was a time they would all go to public bodies but now an increasing amount of a county's allocation seems to be going to local authorities to enable them to do work, which is also good.  I would appreciate the breakdown, however, county by county.</p>  <p> The Department might also supply the committee with a breakdown of the funding for the Olympic Council of Ireland for 2014 to 2017, inclusive.  Will the witnesses indicate the Department's satisfaction with spending by the Olympic Council of Ireland given the funds provided to it by the Department?  Please start with the figures.</p></speech>

It was referenced in the 2015 account.  Mr. Doyle tells me today that it is two years away but he has not convinced me that anything substantial has happened in the mean time.  He told me there is a project team and although I am sure the principal officer is an outstanding individual, it might a greater concentration of effort.  We want to know the membership of the project team and whether it includes personnel from the Courts Service, the Department, the Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need a report on the operation of that group.  I will leave the point at that so as to give others the opportunity to contribute.  When we receive the information we may have further questions by way of correspondence.</p>  <p>  As we are on our second round of questions, I ask people to be conscious of the time.</p></speech>

I accept that this is a crude way of doing it.  What factors are these figures measured against?  New communities that consist of nothing more than a collection of houses will not have the same ability to deliver as communities that are able to add to what is already there.  When these figures are being drawn up, is the level of need analysed or measured, or are these decisions made purely on the basis of who comes forward to make an application?  The cities seem to do quite poorly when these grants are allocated.  When the figures are set out on a per capita basis, Dublin, Cork and Limerick are all at the lower end of the scale.  A similar point can be made about some counties that have had recent growth.  Although Dublin definitely benefits when funds are given to national bodies like the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, the benefits of that expenditure are felt more widely.  It strikes me that such allocations should be catalogued separately, at least in part, in the interests of fair play in the distribution of these moneys.  What are these allocations matched against?  How is the level of need captured?</p></speech>

We are careful to have clear criteria when we are assessing applications under that programme.  When we make a call for applications, we set out a range of principles and criteria that will be considered.  Essentially, marks are assigned to those factors when applications are being assessed.  I understand that the Minister and the Minister of State intend to publish detailed criteria in this regard tomorrow.  They will explain that the assessment will be carried out in line with what was set out in the requests for expressions.  Consideration is given to a range of criteria including participation levels, the involvement of disadvantaged groups and the numbers that may benefit from the sports facility in question.</p></speech>

Is there an analysis of what should be there but is not there?  What needs are not being met by the scheme as it currently operates?  I can look at those questions separately.</p>  <p>  My second question relates to our climate obligations.  We will have to pay hard cash if we do not meet certain targets.  Given that transport is one of the three big areas that have an impact on climate, is it likely that the failure to meet these targets will have a direct impact on the Department's budget?  Has an analysis of that been done?  Has consideration been given to how this would be handled?</p></speech>

If Ireland fails to meet its targets and ends up having to pay fines, those fines will not be levied on the transport sector or any other individual sector.  They will be levied at central level and that is where such payments will be made.  The Deputy is correct when she suggests that the challenge in the transport sector is very significant, especially as we try to service increased levels of economic activity.  Transport accounts for approximately one third of emissions.  Approximately 60% of emissions in the transport space come from private cars, 20% of such emissions come from the freight and haulage industry, and a range of other factors, including public transport, account for the other 20%.  The private car accounts for a big chunk-----</p></speech>

At the same time, we are talking about getting more people to use public transport.  That is a comment.</p>  <p>  My specific question relates to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which does great work.  I do not mean to be parochial when I mention a premises in Galway that has been empty for a long time.  The building in question is in a prime spot in Salthill.  The loss of revenue associated with the non-use of this premises is probably an expense.  I do not know.  Does Mr. Doyle know whether F&aacute;ilte Ireland or any of the other agencies under the remit of the Department have similar buildings that are empty?</p>  <p>  I also have a general question.  I got a bit carried away when I asked at length about the wonderful smarter travel document, which covers the period from 2009 to 2020.  One of the 41 actions that are to be carried out under the document involves the introduction of a sustainable plan.  When I asked yesterday about what has happened to the sustainable plan, I was told it was decided not to go ahead with it.  Was the smarter travel document reviewed?  How many of the actions were implemented?  When did the review take place?  What did we learn from it about where we are going?  Everyone here believes in public transport.  We know we have to do something about climate change.  Was this wonderful document implemented?  If not, why not?  Was it reviewed?  If not, why not?  What have we learned from it?  As I said earlier, the most recent estimate of the cost of a 16.5 km road that is planned in Galway was &euro;500 million, or over &euro;30 million per kilometre.  It seems that the estimated price of the road has now increased to &euro;600 million and nothing has yet been done.  How can such a price be justified?  I remind the committee that the road will affect two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of residential zoned land that was bought by the city council at a time when prices were at their prime.  One part of this parcel will be the subject of a future meeting of this committee.  The development of two thirds of an 18 ha parcel of land has been frozen because of a proposed ring road that is contrary to every one of the policies on my table, which themselves represent a small proportion of our policies on sustainable transport.  I ask Mr. Doyle to respond to my comment, my specific question and my general question about the need for sense to prevail in Galway.</p></speech>

The key point in response to the Deputy's question is we do not have a view that sustainable transport is something that should exist separately from what we do in transport.  It has to be mainstreamed into what we do in transport.  That has to guide principles.  For example, as Luas cross-city works are being done, significant consideration has to be given on that project to how cyclists can co-exist with the trams.  We should not be considering smart ticketing or any of the other issues that are critically important in terms of getting people out of their cars on to public transport separately.  It is something we should be absolutely mainstreaming.</p></speech>

I forget the exact title of it.  The answer given yesterday is the same one given by Mr. Doyle, namely, that there was no need for an Act because it is part of all Departments' remit.  I will not waste time.  I am disappointed by that because we need overarching legislation.</p>  <p>  Of all these action plans, how many were implemented?
