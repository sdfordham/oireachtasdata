And can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  We begin today with session 1, public hearing with Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Department of Finance.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today, we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Department of Finance.  John McCarthy joined the Central Bank as an economist in 1996 but has spent most of his career on secondment to the Department of Finance.  At all times in the Department, he worked in the economic section of the budget and economic division.  He was appointed chief economist at the Department in November 2013 following an open competition.  Mr. McCarthy, you are very welcome before the committee this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  If I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. McCarthy, please?</p></speech>

I can be very brief, Mr. Chairman, as I have submitted a more detailed witness statement to the joint committee already.  Just by way of introduction, you have directed me to give evidence relating to my role as chief economist/assistant secretary and all other roles in the Department of Finance.  As you mentioned, I was appointed to the position of chief economist in November 2013.  Prior to that I worked at a technical level in the Department, at grades equivalent to that of assistant principal and principal officer from about 2001 onwards, with the exception of 2004 when I was back working in the Central Bank.  For the most part, during this period, my work involved producing economic forecasts for the Department, as well as undertaking some technical work on the public finances, mainly related to the Stability and Growth Pact, the structural budget balance, fiscal stability treaty and so forth.  Please let me briefly summarise the, the main points of ... or what I see as the main points of my witness statement.</p> <p>  As I've outlined, the stance of macroeconomic policy during the first decade of monetary union was completely inappropriate.  While monetary policy was exogenous, it was determined externally by the European Central Bank with regard to economic conditions in the euro area as a whole, fiscal and incomes policies in Ireland should have been counter-cyclical with the view to stabilising aggregate demand in the Irish economy, which was essentially operating at full capacity or even beyond full capacity for most of this period.  The contraction of the tax base and the ramping up of public expenditure on a permanent basis were clear policy mistakes and ultimately led to a very large structural deficit once the crisis kicked in.  That the public finances were in broad compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact during most of this period provides no comfort.</p> <p>  Let me say a little bit on the ... on the Department's warnings.  The Department did advise, both internally and externally, regarding the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy, regarding the loss in competitiveness, as well as the over-dependence of the economy on new house building and construction more generally.  This is acknowledged in various reports, Wright and Nyberg being good examples.  However, it is also clear that the Department should have adapted the tone of its warnings as the imbalances were becoming more acute and I would certainly agree with this analysis.</p> <p>  Now, in relation to the housing market, the general approach in the Department was to highlight the central scenario of a soft landing but also to outline, in various internal memos and so forth, that there were risks to the ... to this ... such a benign outcome.  I think it's important on the outset to stress what is meant by a soft landing.  This was the assumption that prices would level off or even decline moderately so that with continued consumer price inflation, real house prices would realign with fundamentals over time.  In addition, it involved the assumption that activity would revert to more sustainable levels in a gradual manner, rather than in a very disruptive manner.  Clearly a soft landing did not materialise and this was an incorrect call.</p> <p>  Finally, if I could just say a few words on the resources of the Department, and specifically within the economic division.  Certainly, when the crisis hit there were very few economists working in the economic division.  The number of people that I would consider as technical economists you could count on one hand, I think it's fair to say, in the division at that time.  But I think it's fair to say the picture has changed in the intervening period with improved resourcing, especially on the quality.  Okay?  I think we are now approaching a critical mass of economists within the Department and we are publishing some of our technical work, something which never happened before, and we are engaging in a more structured manner with the wider economic community.  So, from an economic perspective, I think it's fair to say that the Department is in a much better place now.  Chairman, with this brief summary I will conclude my opening statement.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Senator, you have 15 minutes.</p><p>Thank you very much, Chairman, and I welcome Mr. McCarthy.  I echo the Chairman's welcome to you.  You were just saying there the critical mass of economists, what's the number that you would put on that?</p></speech>

Not all of those are filled at the moment.  I have about 15 people on my team.  There are a number of vacancies including one crucial vacancy on the macro-economics side.  I am holding that vacancy for the next month or two because there is an excellent economist employed in the Department but in another division, so I am willing to wait.  When his job finishes there he will move across.</p> <p>  I think you need to look beyond the economic division as well, there are economists elsewhere in the Department and I also think it's important to highlight the fact that the role of the Irish Government economic and evaluation service, which was established I think in about 2011 or 2012, it is situated within the Department of Public Expenditure and the rational for this is to create an economic service for the Civil Service as a whole.  So there has been a large amount of recruitment there both at the AO level, there is currently recruitment ongoing at the AP level so the rationale and I'll finish here is to create a career structure for economists all the way up to and including chief economist which is at the assistant secretary grade.</p></speech>

That is a reasonable guess.  It is not zero and it is not 200, it is somewhere of that magnitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#D00700"><p>Thank you for that.  Some of the literature says that those specialists should move on after three years.  I take it that what you're doing is integrated fully into those departments and there wouldn't be a suggestion that specialists should depart the scene.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#D00800"><p>Absolutely not.  One of the problems in the past has been that there is this generalist versus specialist approach.  I think there is a general recognition that there was a lack of specialist at the time.  Not just in economics but I think in other areas as well.  There was no career path for economists within the Department.  John FitzGerald has spoken about this, I think in this forum, but certainly at other fora he has spoken quite a lot about this.  He had to leave the Department because he felt if he wanted to move up he would have to move outside the economic space and into the sort of ... and that is what we are trying to address now is to create a career structure so you can join as an economist and you can move up the ranks as an economist.  So as I mentioned, there is currently a competition under way for AP economists and as I said before you can go all the way up to my position, to assistant secretary, and remain an economist.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#D00900"><p>Very good.  Now 2003, did the interaction between the Government's economic analysis function with the economic research section of the Central Bank because of the restructuring and the creation of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, did that change or was there a change in emphasis when the Financial Regulator was established in 2003?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#D01000"><p>No, not on the economic side, Senator.  The reason for that is that we would engage - when I talk about "we" I am talking about the economic division - we would engage with the Central Bank on an informal basis and the nuts and bolts of our discussion would essentially be about the short-term outlook for the economy.  We would, sort of, exchange views on where things were going.  There were a lot more people employed in the bank, so you could argue maybe there was a comparative advantage there but we would have informal discussions pretty much around the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin, we would discuss where things were going.  We might often, or from time to time, we might run some technical issues past the economic division of the bank, but this was purely in the macro-economic space.</p><p>So, the whole rationale was to ... you know, if the bank were talking about a forecast of, we'll say, X%, we would say, "Well, what's the savings rate that underpins your consumption figure?  What's the exchange rate that underpins your export?"  It was purely a technical discussion.  We did not have, in the economic side, any dealings with the Financial Regulator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#E00200"><p>In your own core documents, on Vol. 1, page 38, what Nyberg says on that arrangement, Mr. McCarthy, is, "Had the DoF [Department of Finance] taken a greater interest in financial market issues early on, preparations for dealing with the financial crisis would have been more comprehensive."  So, in retrospect, was that a flaw in the way we organised the relationship between the Department of Finance and the regulator?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#E00300"><p>The responsibility for dealing with the regulator within the Department was on the banking and finance division.  My own department, or the department ... the section that I was engaged in, or employed in, was purely looking at macro-fiscal issues.  We did not look at financial stability issues, so I couldn't comment on any discussions that may have taken place between our banking and finance division and the regulator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#E00400"><p>Wouldn't the two overlap, though, if you saw credit expanding at 25% a year?  You know, that must have implications for the macroeconomic state of the country, so you couldn't have remained immune from such a heavy increase, year after year, in the amount of credit that the banks were extending.</p></speech>

I do think there was a lack of joining the dots, if you like, between the real economy and what was going on on the credit side.  We tried to address that in 2006.  I think there was a proposal to establish a working group within the Department and possibly involving others, to look at everything, to make sure everything was joined up, but at that stage, I suppose the horse had bolted and, from what I recall, the group never met.</p></speech>

And you mentioned Professor FitzGerald earlier.  He said to us that there was a cultural change in the Department of Finance in the last decade, that they became more concerned about the politics of things and less interested in technical detail and he, in the ESRI, and yourselves had had less interaction.  Did you have any response to what John FitzGerald was saying in that very chair?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#E00700"><p>Two points on that.  I think John FitzGerald, when he was in this chair, made reference to two sets of interactions between the ESRI and the Department.  He referred to technical level discussions and he referred to political level discussions.  He was quite complimentary regarding the technical level discussions and those technical level discussions would have involved myself and some of my team.  He expressed concern about the over-politicisation of some of the ... well, maybe I'll ... of some of the comments coming from other parts, or more senior levels, within the Department.  They were very political.  He was complimentary on the technical discussions.  He has also ... my second point is he has also been very complimentary of the various changes that have taken place within the Department over the past couple of years: the fact that we now publish working papers; the fact that we now publish technical papers; that I speak at conferences, both domestically and internationally; that my team speak at conferences; that people have published in the <i>Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland</i>; <i>The Economic and Social Review</i>.  He has been quite complimentary about the technical capacity of the Department; less so about the over-politicisation of some of the-----</p></speech>

And particular, on page 17, their discussion of a deposit insurance scheme and, you know, a warning on page 12 that it would be:</p> <blockquote> 	[I]mportant to be prepared for the worst.  In this context, pay-outs from the bank deposit insurance scheme should be available more rapidly and the scheme better funded to reduce liquidity concerns in case a bank comes under pressure.  Enacting an insolvency process specifically adopted to banks [would] should also be considered. </blockquote> <p>I mean, given what happened, wasn't it unfortunate that we ... that Ireland asked the IMF to take those chunks out?  For instance, &quot;the housing boom is over&quot; was replaced by &quot;the housing market cycle has turned&quot;, that, if we're going to rely on the IMF and the ESRI to say they supported what we were doing in policy, we shouldn't be engaging in, kind of, altering those documents before the public gets to see them.</p></speech>

Just the ... these were, they're not my own comments I would stress Senator, but I would agree with you.  It is good to have people making these recommendations.  Sometimes they're not entirely accurate and so forth, but they are good to provoke thought and certainly on the deposit guarantee scheme and some of those other issues, they were important.  Just because there is a suggestion from somebody in the Department, and its not myself, that these be removed, does not mean that they were actually removed.  This report, and its an OECD report I think from 2008, the twice ... every two years review of the Irish economy.  That is ... the ownership of the report belongs to what's called the economic development and review committee of the OECD.  So just because we ask for changes doesn't mean changes are taken.  There is a meeting every ... there is a meeting around this and the committee can take on board any comments or they can delete comments and see them as inappropriate.  But I would accept your point in the sense that it is good to have some of these recommendations.  They may not necessarily be correct in all circumstances but it is good to provoke thought and it is good to have the debate as to whether they are relevant.  But I would also point out, and it's the final point, every finance ministry in the world when they come to deal with the IMF or the OECD in this case, would come back with recommended changes.  Some of them are just nuances, some of them are more substantive.</p></speech>

It seemed to be just the consumer price index and wage claims.  Was the property influence on competitiveness, if you take that Deputy Higgins has repeatedly drawn attention here as you know, that the fact that house prices are rising by more than the average annual income in every year, so that must have been reducing Ireland's competitiveness and did that not set off alarm bells in discussions of competitiveness in the Department?</p></speech>

There is no single measure of competitiveness but the most comprehensive one that we would look at would be what's called the real effective exchange rate.  So if ... essentially the effective or the trade weighted exchange rate adjusted for relative price developments.  So you're taking into account how the exchange rates are going and then how prices are evolving, relative to major trading partners.</p><p>That's the one that feeds into our export model and I think that is, typically, among finance ministries and central banks, that is the key metric of competitiveness.  But you're absolutely right in the sense that rising rents, rising house prices, do damage the competitiveness of the economy and that was certainly, you know, something we were conscious of.</p></speech>

Vol. 2, page 105, which is a document prepared by yourself for the T&aacute;naiste and Anne Donegan.  The second paragraph of that document:</p> <blockquote> 	<b>In summary</b>, the OECD is forecasting a growth rate of [around] 3 per cent next year, with a slightly stronger pickup than we have assumed in 2009.  However, <i>the language regarding Ireland is somewhat 'sensationalist'</i>; we proposed (on a number of occasions) a number of textual changes but these have not been taken on board.  The comments on the property market pre-date the Budget confidence-building measures. </blockquote> <p>What was the sensationalist language being proposed by the OECD that you were commenting on there, can you recall?</p></speech>

But I would come back to a point I made earlier on - having dealt with the OECD and participated in meetings for years, every finance ministry will try and get changes to the text.  Actually, we do it less than other finance ministries.  I have seen finance ministries who will try to rewrite a whole document for the OECD.  We will try and maybe nuance the text somewhat - the "boom" being a good example.  Sometimes they take them on board, sometimes they don't.  To be honest, it doesn't really bother me if something is sensationalist.  It is good from an Irish Inc. perspective to have outsiders making comments that may be a little bit provocative, that maybe force us to think, to get rid of the kind of groupthink that we may have.</p></speech>

He said:</p> <blockquote> 	We would be discussing or interacting with the IMF and the OECD, in particular with the OECD country reports, it was embarrassing.  When I used to go to Paris to ... with people to look at the reports, almost every line was parsed and any, anything of a negative nature needed to be taken out. </blockquote> <p>Was that your experience too of how those events would happen?</p></speech>

My experience is that some issues might need to be nuanced, so for instance, when in the 2006 report of the OECD, which is the one that talked about house prices and some over-valuation, there was some nuancing of the word but no attempt to change the overall message that the OECD was trying to convey.  Remember, it is a report, not compiled by the Irish authorities, but compiled by the economic development and review committee, the so-called EDRC: it is their language.  So, if they want to say black is white, they can say it.  They have to stand over it but what we can try and do is say, "Well, listen, a better understanding of the Irish economy might involve looking at the wording here, a little bit of nuancing here and there."  But I would stress we do not engage in as much of that as a lot of other countries.</p></speech>

It was referred to in the Honohan report, I think page 84.  Morgan Kelly, in an article which was published in it, argued that most house price surges had ended in a fall of at least 50% in values.  Furthermore, he went on to say there had been no quantitative, analytical evidence provided from the Central Bank, I think, at the time and there was a reference made to "The central scenario is, therefore, for a soft landing."  I think Senator Barrett has already touched on it.  To your recollection, what were the reasons for the Department of Finance in agreeing with the Central Bank in favouring a soft landing scenario for the property market over a hard landing?</p></speech>

Let me deal with the latter first.  We made the assumption in various budgetary forecasts, and we modelled a soft landing on the basis of we were currently, or at the time, producing 70,000, 80,000, 90,000 units at the peak.  At the time, it was estimated that, on the basis of demographic trends, and on the basis of fall in headship rates, in other words an increase in the percentage of the population who are heads of household, that there was an underlying need for about 50,000 units per annum.  Now how do you go from 90,000 to 50,000?</p><p>Does it fall like that or does it like it fall like that?  In the budget documentation, our central scenario was a gradual easing - a fall of about 5,000 or 6,000 units per annum.  So, operating over the medium term and converging towards sustainable levels of output.  That was the central scenario but we did model internally - in a document that I wrote with a colleague who is now the Secretary General - what would be the implications on the public finances of a hard landing if output was to go from 90,000 down to sustainable levels more rapidly?  In fact, it didn't go to sustainable levels, it overshot on the way down, as sometimes happened.  And we concluded that the impact on overall economic activity of each 10,000 reduction would be to shave about a percentage point of the growth rate, add about a percentage point to ... a half or a percentage point, I can't remember, to the unemployment rate,  add a half a percentage point to the deficit, and these were simply the first round effects.  Clearly, we went from 90,000 to 10,000 in the space of three or-----</p></speech>

The evidence for a soft landing ... we took the view that house prices in Ireland had never fallen in nominal terms and data have been collected back as far as 1970.  So there was no precedent for this in Ireland.  We did have a number of models.  So we looked at issues like price earnings ratio, price income ratio, we had an affordability model.  So, in other words, the ... when you looked at the growth of employment, the growth of wages, the decline in taxation, the new monetary regime, the portion of disposable income ... of household disposable income that is absorbed by debt payments or debt service costs was in line with the historical norm, about one third.  The problem was we didn't realise that these fundamental factors could change so dramatically, that employment would fall by nearly 15%.  Now, there is also ... economic theory is also quite consistent with a soft landing in house prices-----</p></speech>

Really what I'm asking you, Mr. McCarthy, is, there's very little evidence, from looking at other countries in particular, whether in the European Union or outside of it, to support the soft-landing scenario, and yet ... and I'm talking about the value soft landing scenario, not the reduction in units produced.  What evidence did you gather from looking at other countries to support the soft-landing scenario or was there any analytical work done to gather that evidence?</p></speech>

So if you looked at the situation in Japan, an advanced country ... it's outside Europe but an advanced economy nonetheless.  In the period leading up to - I think it's about '91 or '92 - house prices had risen by 180%, ballpark - 100%, remember, is a doubling in house prices ... so, 180%.  In the five years after the peak, price levels had fallen by just 15%.  That to me would be consistent with a soft landing.  Now, Japan subsequently got into a deflationary spiral and prices have subsequently kept going down but five years after the peak, price levels were just 15% below the peak.  So there was evidence-----</p></speech>

I mean, economists think of housing as not just an investment asset but also a consumer good.  In other words, it provides consumer services, accommodation and so forth.  So unlike a stock in share where if there is overvaluation, it can fall dramatically; in a housing market, if prices begin to fall, people will take the house off the market rather than sell at a loss.</p><p>So you can get prolonged periods of disequilibrium in the housing market.  So, in other words, if the actual prices here, the fundamental prices here, you can get a levelling off and eventually fundamentals catch up.  That's the theory and that's the sort of supporting evidence.</p></speech>

I need to turn to one more area, I've a half a minute left.  Comments from contributors to the Wright report indicated that there was a lack of leadership and direction in the Department of Finance during 2000 to 2010, and its effectiveness was limited.  Would you agree with those comments?  And I'd ask you finally what should have been done or is still to be done to improve the Department's role and effectiveness going forward?</p></speech>

There ... the Department wasn't called upon to lead during that period.  The Department was sidelined by the social partnership process, the programme for Government process, all of these had the effect that the Department simply existed to pay the bills.  I think that phrase is actually used in the Wright report.  The Wright report is also quite clear that the Department took leadership once the crisis kicked in.  The Department produced the national recovery plan upon which the programme was based, and it was a very successful programme.  The economy is now doing very well on foot of coming out of the programme and so forth.  So leadership was shown when it was needed and when the Department was called to lead, when it wasn't sidelined.  Sorry, I've forgotten the second part of your question now?</p></speech>

So how did it affect the work of your Department?</p></speech>

To me, there is no correlation between the number of economists and the quality of policy-making on the one hand, or the number of economists and the ability to foresee the crisis.  Let me give you a couple of examples, Deputy.  The IMF, an organisation that I have huge respect for, employs hundreds, if not thousands of economists, and they did not foresee the crisis coming.  So, in 2008, when we brought forward the budget, we based it on the IMF's forecasts, which were published at the beginning of October.  The budget was then in mid-October.  A week or so afterwards, the IMF revised its forecasts, so even though there was all of these economists, it simply was not possible to foresee the crisis.  The number of economists and the quality of policy-making: the ECB, not an institution I have particular affection for.  This was an institution that currently employs thousands of economists, and actually tightened monetary policy in 2008 and 2011 - absolute policy mistakes.  So I just wanted to get across the point that it's not necessarily the number, but, having said that-----</p></speech>

If we had 100 economists we still would not have foreseen the global crisis, but what we could have done, Deputy, is we could have allocated more resources to looking at where the imbalances were really becoming problematic.  Where the Chair mentioned, we could have shocked the property model, the construction model, to see, but we simply didn't have the resources to do that.</p></speech>

In my witness statement, which is why I asked where ... I do refer to the fact that the economics profession failed.  And I think it failed in a number of aspects.  I list them there - it's general ability to foresee the crisis ... sorry, it's on page 4 ... to even acknowledge that cataclysmic events were possible in a market economy.  There was a general herd mentality, to use your own phrase; there was a general herd mentality on 'the Great Moderation'.</p><p>There was a belief that the business cycle had been permanently tamed - clearly wasn't the case - and there was also a failure to understand the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector.</p></speech>

I think he said between 40% and 60%, so he is correct.  I think where his ... where his model was innovative was in the sense that we were looking at our own models - and I mention price earnings ratios, the affordability model - others were looking at the so-called residual-type approaches.  So you look at actual house prices and then you look at house prices when they're modelled on the basis of the driving forces ... the fundamentals.</p></speech>

I sent in the org charts to the committee.  My job between 2003 and up to 2006 was analysing consumer price inflation and competitiveness.  So it wasn't to advise on fiscal policy and so forth.  From the end of 2006 into 2007, I assumed overall responsibility then for the macroeconomic forecasts.  So an important distinction needs to be made between the technical level job, where you're modelling inflation, you're modelling competitiveness and so forth, and my job today, which is closer to the policy space, where anything that affects the economy, I advise the Minister on.  Back in 2006, I advised on price dynamics and competitiveness.</p></speech>

The question I have ... and to go back to the question is: can you give an example to the committee, right up until now, where economic policy was changed as a direct result of a report from the Department's economic division and can you also give an example to the committee, if you yourself offered any contrarian views to the consensus during the bubble period and up until now, and were those taken on board?</p></speech>

I think it needs to be remembered that the economics function was very, very small in the overall Department.  Our job was simply to produce the forecasts.  People did not come to the economics division to ask, "Should we do this policy or should we not?"  Our role was simply to produce the forecasts at the time.  That is no longer the case, where we are consulted on wider policy issues.  So you cannot have a situation in which there is a change in policy because the economics division is consulted-----</p></speech>

As early ... welcome.  As early as 2001, a paper presented in the MAC meeting on 26 April shows that the Department was facing a specific skills challenge and had a broad spectrum of skills requirements, amongst others, in economic modelling.  Can you give us your opinion if efforts made by the Department were insufficient after 2001 to further improve the skills level in there?</p></speech>

After 2001, the Department approached the Central Bank and the ESRI to second somebody to the Department to undertake technical work on their behalf.  I moved from the Central Bank to the Department at the time and a senior economist from the ESRI moved.  We undertook some of the technical work.  So, in other words, the economic capacity or the modelling capacity was improved.</p></speech>

Just following on from what Deputy Doherty had asked you there about you giving an example of a policy change as a result of advices coming from the economic division, can you give us an example - and perhaps the one the most relevant to our work here in the inquiry - of advices coming from your division being specifically suppressed and ignored by Government to the detriment of what played out?</p></speech>

In various publications, the stability programmes and so forth, if you look at the economic text there, we were the contrarians because we were saying that fiscal policy is inappropriate, we were saying that there is an over dependence on construction, we were saying that there is a loss in competitiveness that needs to be addressed.  That was coming from the economic division.  Did the Government act on it?  Well, to be fair, the Minister signed off on the budget strategy memorandum each year.  So he agreed with a more prudent fiscal stance.  That's typically June or July.  Unfortunately, later on in the year that process was overtaken by events.  So what was agreed initially and what was brought to Cabinet early in the summer was subsequently taken over by events and policy became-----</p></speech>

So the economics ... what you are saying is that the economics division within the Department was saying since 2001, you know, "Cool the economy, go counter-cyclical on policy ... on fiscal policy."  Is that your position?</p></speech>

It wasn't an economics division on its own at the time.  It was the budget and economic division.  So it was the co-ordinated view of the budget and economic division.</p></speech>

But between then and when the budget ... in early December, other events took over that allowed a more pro-cyclical fiscal stance.</p></speech>

So just so we are clear now, you're saying that at the beginning of your process, which was earlier in the year, you would sign off and you would say "Look, we want you to go more counter-cyclical."  Are you saying that the situation improved then, which allowed the Minister to take a pro-cyclical approach, or are you saying that your advice remained, so that these circumstances taking over ... I mean, did circumstances take over for the better so that your advice had become obsolete or was it the case that your advice was ignored and, albeit having signed off on it, the Minster of the day decided to go pro-cyclical despite what he had signed off on?</p></speech>

But I will give you my suspicion and I think it's probably a combination of both.  I think you had these other processes at play but also you had massive surges in tax revenue in the second half of the year which, typically, when corporate taxes come in and so forth ... which some would see ... if you get the tax revenue coming in, maybe you can spend a bit more and so forth.</p></speech>

You mentioned earlier about people above your pay grade, is how you put it, would tell you, ''Take that out, don't say this, we can't say the other'', I think, were in or around what you were saying.

I mean, there was a kind of departmental view that policy was moving in the right direction.  Most people bought into that.  Some were more vocal than others.  So I think there was a consensus within the Department that there ... there were problems but we simply weren't being listened to.  There was ... it was a case of the ... the boy who cried wolf, really.  We were talking about risks, these risks never materialised so we could almost be ignored.</p></speech>

I know there is another process whereby the Governor of the Central Bank sends a letter to the Minister in advance of the budget, it's essentially a pre-budget submission, and typically warns about the need for fiscal policy to be countercyclical and not add to the overheating of the economy. Maybe those ... maybe the bank's comments could have been a little bit harder hitting.  In fact, it would have helped us in the Department if they were harder hitting but I would have to go back and check and see exactly what they said.  But I'm certainly conscious that in many of the bulletins they would have raised the inappropriateness of fiscal policy at the time.</p></speech>

Can I raise the issue of the structural budget balance, or the cyclical balance as such, and you say on page 8 of your witness statement, "Measures of the underlying balance (the so-called structural balance [...] did not raise any red-flags either."  And you're referring to the pre-crisis period presumably.  So, can you just clarify for the inquiry, who measured the structural balance, was there a common methodology across Europe, for example, and what kind of figures were being reported for Ireland in, say 2006-2007, for structural balance?</p></speech>

Because if you look back, not just in real time - in other words in 2003, looking at the position in 2003 - but if you look now, going back, and I've spoken a bit at a Bruegel conference at the tail-end of last year, it shows that we were compliant with the requirements of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  We were running, I think it's every year, bar one, structural surpluses.  So, we were overachieving our medium-term budgetary objective.  So there was no-----</p></speech>

What is done there, Deputy, is twofold.  There is a harmonised methodology that is applied across all member states.  It is a huge problem for Ireland, for Slovenia, for small member states it is a huge problem.  This is a methodology that is designed to fit France and Germany.  Unfortunately, it is a one-size-fits-all approach.  It does not work for Ireland and I can say that quite definitively.</p></speech>

It gives counter-intuitive results in many instances.  Let me give you an example, if I can.  So, in theory, and for a large country like Germany or France, the change in the structural balance is tantamount to the fiscal effort.  So, in other words, if the fiscal ... if the structural balance deteriorates by 1% of GDP, that's equivalent to a fiscal stimulus.  So, in Ireland we consolidated since the crisis kicked in by 17% of GDP, whereas the change in a structural balance over that period is about 6%.  So, it gives a completely misleading picture of the fiscal stance in Ireland, even today.  There have been some minor improvements to the methodology but they are not game changers.</p> <p>  One of the inputs here is trying to measure the business cycle, so when a large country had a big problem estimating what's called the NAIRU, changes were agreed.  We've been raising issues for years, almost ignored, except this year when we did raise an issue regarding the so-called expenditure benchmark.  Now, can I just, I'm sorry for eating into your time, recognising the shortcomings of the structural balance, the so-called six pack - about two of the regulations refer to the Stability and Growth Pact the others are for the macro imbalances procedure - introduced the concept of an expenditure rule, the so-called expenditure benchmark, which is a little bit easier to measure because it smooths potential output over a ten-year horizon looking at just year-to-year changes.  So it's a little bit better but it's not the be all and end all.  It's ... this issue is still a problem for Ireland.</p></speech>

But are you saying that Ireland was actually complying with the structural balance requirements from Europe at the time, in accordance with how the structural balance was measured in harmonised terms during all of those years?</p></speech>

However, the nominal budget figures mask and underlying deterioration in the fiscal situation after 1999. </blockquote><p>So, in Regling and Watson, they're saying that there is a faultline in the Irish economy going right back into the 90s.  Why was that there and how was it not identified by people like yourself whose job would have been to examine, in micro-detail, the economic structure of the Irish economy?</p></speech>

We are legally bound ... legally, it's in the treaties, to apply ... it's not in the ... there's a gentleman's agreement among Ministers that, I think, was signed off in 2001, 2002.  But it stems from a legal provision, from a regulation, that there is a harmonised approach that applies to all member states.  So, we can produce whatever measure we like, but when it comes to assessing compliance with the pact, the Commission will apply the one-size-fits-all policy.  That's where the faultline lies.</p></speech>

Just because the sign says you can drive at 100 km/h, you don't do it.  Likewise, when there are rules like this, and you identify difficulties, you don't proceed exactly to the letter of the rule.  And that's the question I'm asking you.  Was this difficulty identified and was anything actually done about it?</p></speech>

We have made a number of submissions to DG ECOFIN, the economics Ministry in the Commission, including as recently as, I think it was, March, April of this year, in which we produced, myself and a colleague, a detailed critique of the expenditure rule.  And the Commission actually said, for the first time that I can remember, "Actually, Ireland has a point.  We are unilaterally changing the approach to calculating the expenditure benchmark."  That did not apply for all the years we have been saying, "This doesn't work for Ireland", we were ignored.  It was one-size-fits-all, but we have made progress this year.</p></speech>

You don't really need to see it on the screen:</p> <blockquote> 	The Commission [Nyberg's commission] considers that this pervasive pressure for consensus may explain why so many different parties in Ireland simultaneously were willing to adopt specific policies and accepted practices that later proved unsound. At the same time, the apparent consensus of banks and authorities around the view that markets remained sound and prospects remained positive gave further comfort to both. A number of banks essentially appear to have followed the example of peer banks in a &ldquo;herding&rdquo; fashion; there is little evidence of original critical analysis of the advantages and risks of the policies. Widespread lack of critical discussion within many banks and authorities indicates a tendency to &ldquo;groupthink&rdquo;; serious consideration of alternatives appears to be modest or absent. </blockquote> <p>Now, when you moved, or you were in the Department through the whole of the 2000s, and then you moved to the macroeconomic responsibilities in 2006, I think.  So, to what extent was this pressure felt and absorbed, or not, inside the Department, in your own experience?</p></speech>

We produce a model forecast, a central scenario, the most likely outcome, but then we look at various scenarios around that, upside risks, downside risks, and we model some of those.  So we modelled the hard landing, if output was to fall more rapidly than assumed.  We did that and we came up with results that ... I think the ESRI published a paper around the same time and they were very, very similar results.</p></speech>

I think ... and to give you a specific example, I think the models that we had, I'm talking here about, for forecasting purposes, were not dissimilar from models that other treasuries would have, that other central banks would have.  In fact, a couple of years ago the fiscal advisory council, as part of their mandate, looked at our forecasting model and concluded it was in line with best practice.  But where it failed, and where other models failed, was in one particular area, and that was they did not incorporate the impact of the financial sector onto the real economy.  The real economy, I mean, production, output, employment and so forth, and-----</p></speech>

The assumption was that markets were fully efficient, that the cost of capital was simply the policy rate plus a term premium, a liquidity premium, and so forth, and once you had the price or the cost of capital, financial intermediation then brought savers and investors together and everything was kosher.  That was proved to be incorrect.</p></speech>

In your opening statement you say economists failed "to acknowledge that cataclysmic breakdowns in a market economy were indeed possible" and "in the widespread assumption that the business cycle had been permanently tamed".  Now, presumably, going through college, economists learn, for example, some of the basic ideas of Karl Marx, who 170 years ago told us how inherent in capitalism was the boom and slump scenario, and explained it in detail.  And also, we had the experience, as you said, of Morgan Kelly's study of about 30 boom and slumps, and particularly-----</p></speech>

I mentioned before there, the IMF.  I could tell you every finance Ministry, every central bank ... my own job as the forecaster, I would participate at European Commission meetings, where all 28 member states would be discussing forecasts at an OECD level.  Everybody failed to see this.</p><p>There was this "Great Moderation" as it's called.  Inflation had been tamed.  In the past you had ... here's your trend growth rate and GDP, you know, fluctuates around that whereas it was now more like that, so this was the "Great Moderation".  I think it was the economist Hyman Minksy who famously said that stability breeds instability.  I think that was part of the problem here.  We had years and years and years of stability, so people assumed there was this new paradigm, this "Great Moderation", and the models couldn't capture financial disruption.  So models themselves failed, although I always think it's the users of the models rather than the models themselves.  But what we are doing is trying to develop a model that better incorporates the financial sector into the real economy, how the ... how financial disruption can be brought across into output and employment and so forth.  So this is being done in conjunction with the ESRI and I have a PhD economist working on my team, working on that, currently completing a PhD and working with the ESRI on it.</p></speech>

This report was ... the OECD came and did an on-site inspection on 20 February 2008 which was seven months before the night of the guarantee, per the report.  They say on page 25, "The economic situation and policies were reviewed by the committee in February 2008 and they were approved then on 5 March 2008."  The question I want to ask is there's wholesale changes within the two reports.  The word "boom" suddenly becomes "buoyancy", which is a very different connotation.  Two specific areas I want to look at are page 9 on the draft report, Chairman, which specifically deals with "financial stability risks remain".  And the relevant page on the revision is page 26.  Now that read, "financial stability risks remain"; when it came to the final report it went, "containing risk to the financial system" so they changed that.  And there's one specific reference that I want to make reference to, Chairman.  It says-----</p></speech>

That is completely deleted from the final report in page 26 and equally, Chairman, page 12 deals with a section then where it speaks around in the context, sorry, it says:</p> <blockquote> 	Payouts from the bank deposit insurance scheme should be available more rapidly and the scheme better funded to reduce liquidity concerns in case a bank comes under pressure.  Enacting an insolvency process specifically adapted to banks should also be considered. </blockquote> <p>That's on page 30 of the final report.</p></speech>

That's seven months before the guarantee is put in place.  The question I want to ask is who would have reviewed the report?  Would the Minister of the time have been involved in reviewing the report?  Who would have interacted with the OECD?

It's the third bullet down, which says:</p> <blockquote> 	The pace of economic activity was strong [from] 2001-2006 but the Department did not believe that this could continue.  In2005/6 the Minister was advised that the country was depending on unsustainable tax revenues that the economy had been dramatically over-heated and that problems would emerge which would be due to domestic policies and that a more sustainable fiscal position had to be maintained.  A presentation to this effect was made to [the] Secretaries General. </blockquote> <p>Now, in that regard, that's ... the big hidden message there, the country is very, very exposed in a lot of different ways and there is significant trouble pending ahead.  Can I ask you how robustly was the Minister challenged on the tax and spending policies implemented in that period by you, your officials and your Department, given that this was the summary and aggregates position of the Irish economy at that time?</p></speech>

I think it was undertaken by Indecon and possibly Goodbodys.  And all of the recommendations, from what I recall, or certainly the bulk of them, were contained in the Finance Bill for 2006.  In other words, the phasing out of all the ... the biases within the tax system that favoured construction and so forth.  However, quite clearly, the horse had bolted at that stage.  It was too late.  But we had been saying it for some time, the review was done, it was concluded that these tax expenditures needed to be reduced, that the tax treatment of construction needed to be made more neutral and the Minister acted on that.  But there was a transition phase, from what I understand, in that you didn't want to ... you wanted to avoid a sudden stop.</p></speech>

Given that a lot of these tax incentives were due to be wound up in 2004, could the proposition be made that a review of these tax incentivisations was just a means to elongate their implementation and to put off the day of their removal?</p></speech>

So, it's ... this is an issues paper from May 2005 and, if you go down to the fifth paragraph, beginning:</p> <blockquote> 	The section has identified the need to explore data sources and development of analysis of non-residential construction as a priority.  Data is more limited in this area and up to now.  Non-residential construction accounts for about half of construction output so it is worth devoting time to. </blockquote> <p>So, can you recall, Mr. McCarthy, what steps were taken on foot of that paragraph in the issues note identifying construction related lending and property activity and the need to find more information or develop more data and look into it further?</p></speech>

So kind of building a database along those lines is what I strongly suspect was the, was the action point so to speak.</p></speech>

Well then if we ... if we fast-forward then to March 2006 issues note from the Department, it's on page 92 of the same booklet and it's the third paragraph down, and this is a year later:</p> <blockquote> 	The development and analysis of non-residential construction remains important.  Data is more limited in this area [and the exact same sentence, non-residential] construction accounts for about half of construction output, so it is worth devoting time to. </blockquote> <p>Now, this is a year from the issues note of 2005 and it's saying essentially the exact same thing.</p></speech>

I want to move on from that then, if I may.  I'll just go back a page, to page 91 in the evidence booklet, it's the Government saving scheme, the SSIA, and this note I think you're involved in compiling because your name is there, John McCarthy.  The second paragraph, "Impact of SSIA maturity remains an imponderable; we have assumed a low propensity to spend the proceeds."  So can I ... do you remember drafting this?  Were you involved in drafting this section?</p></speech>

So you had this kind of windfall gain that was coming to the household sector, what was going to be the impact on consumption?  So what we did, we actually asked the CSO to compile a study on our behalf and to make it public to everybody, so it's in one of their modules as part of the QNHS, to improve the evidence base for us.  They did it, they made it public.  And on foot of that, we made an assumption then what the marginal propensity to consume from these additional income would be.</p></speech>

The assumption of a low propensity to spend would typically be ... we would tend to have a cautious view anyway, and if it's stronger so be it.

Mr. McCarthy, specifically, did the Department make attempts to quantify the effects of a soft landing?  That is in terms of loss of revenue or increased expenditure, was that a specific task that was carried out?  I know you've referred to soft landing before that people have asked you.</p></speech>

So on the public finances, it is roughly a half percentage point onto the deficit for each 10,000.  So in other words, if housing out by the time went from 80,000 units down to 70,000, the deficit would have been half a percentage point higher because of lower tax revenue and because of higher unemployment payments ... social welfare payments, because unemployment would have gone up.</p></speech>

Senator, the ESRI who use the so-called Hermes model, it's a very large-scale structural model of the Irish economy, had published a piece of analytical work either just before ours or just afterwards ... we were doing it independently we didn't even know that they were doing it.  And what they did was, they went from, I think, it was 90 down to 50, and concluded that the impact on GDP would be 3%, similar on employment and other variables.  Ours was, each 10,000 shaves between a half and one percentage point off the growth rate - so let's call it the mid-point of that, 0.75%.  So you multiply that by four because it went from 90 down to 50 and you're getting very similar results to what the Hermes model was punching out.  So there was a kind of ... we were coming at it from two different ways, so to speak, but we were coming up with the same results.  So I think they are plausible results.</p></speech>

Because you've given in evidence here this morning and you've said to us that it was good to provoke thought, I think was the way that you put it, and you talked about changes being purely of a factual nature.  I would draw attention then to page 12 of that document, that's Vol. 3, page 12.  It says:</p> <blockquote> 	Prior to the weakening in the property market and the recent financial market turmoil, the Irish banks were highly profitable and well capitalised, which will help to adsorb the shock.  <i>But it would also seem important to be prepared for the worst.</i> </blockquote> <p>Now when that came out in the report, the final report, it said, &quot;The Irish banks are highly profitable and well capitalised, so they should have considerable shock absorption capacity, but it would also seem important to be prepared to deal with downside risks.&quot;  Now it seems to me there's quite a difference between saying the Irish banks are highly profitable and, prior to the weakening, the Irish banks were highly profitable.  And they should be &quot;prepared of the worst&quot; turns into &quot;downside risks&quot;.  Would you continue to describe that as a factual change?</p></speech>

That ... I think that probably falls into the definition of a nuance, but I would stress those sort of changes would not have come from the budget and economic division.  It could even be, Senator, that the OECD themselves ... I actually couldn't follow where the text was.  Sometimes the secretariat in the OECD can nuance these things themselves.  So it's not necessarily coming from the authorities.  They have an internal process themselves, but to come back to your question-----</p></speech>

I said at the ... earlier on that, on occasion, I would actually have preferred if the international organisations were even more hard-hitting.  So I don't take the view that we need to nuance it and make everything pretty for Government and so ... sometimes we need them saying even more difficult things because there's messages we can't say that they need to say.</p></speech>

I'm going to move towards wrapping up.  And just to deal with two matters before I invite Senator Barrett and Deputy Phelan to close themselves, if I maybe could ask you that in the past then - this is coming from our earlier discussions of this morning, Mr. McCarthy - a major problem was that there was no banking or financial experts working in the economic division.  Has this issue now been addressed or responded to in the meantime?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#T00300"><p>What we have, Chairman, is we have economists ... ramped up the number of economists in the economic division and we have ramped up the number of banking specialists in the banking division.  They're on secondment, typically, from the NTMA.  But we do interact much more.  So I mentioned the policy committee.  So there is more joined-up thinking.  The rationale behind this policy committee is to break down the silo approach to make sure that everybody is on the same page.  So not ... to specifically answer your question, not financial experts in the economic division - they're in a separate division - but we work closely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#T00400"><p>Okay.  And just on the broader issue of groupthink, which was mentioned earlier and you mentioned it yourself and the mentality that goes with it - specifically in your response to Deputy Phelan's question, how is it now ensured today that no groupthinking culture can take hold again in the economics division?  If you move people out of silos and move them into a broader sphere, you can still have a groupthink on a broader sphere, even not in a silo, so how is that being addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#T00500"><p>Well, I mean, what we're doing, and what the economic division is doing, and what we've been very proactive is ... is engaging much more with the outside economics community.  I have encouraged my team to publish a lot more of the technical work.  So we have technical papers, we have working papers - they're all online.  You can see some of the views that we have.  Let me give you a specific example: we recently, somewhat controversially, made a submission to the Low Pay Commission, which was actually contrary to Government policy.  The Minister was in favour of us doing it, not because he necessarily agreed but he doesn't want the, sort of, groupthink to take hold again.  This was reported in parts of the media.  So we are making these submissions on issues that we think are important and they're not necessarily in line with Government policy.  So there is a practical example in that particular one, Chairman.</p></speech>

And, finally, just in reference to Senator O'Keeffe's earlier question on quantifying the effects from soft landings on Government finances - and just maybe to expand upon that - that apart from the general impact on GDP and the impact on Government surplus/deficit, were there also concrete and specific estimates made on changes in the amounts of stamp duty, capital gains taxes and other property-related taxes?</p></speech>

I also note that paragraph 90 on page 17 was deleted and what it ... it ... it says how to deal with bank failures and how the regulator could have closure authority and you could ensure there wouldn't be a run on the banks and - a deposit interest run - and that the losses should be confined to shareholders.

Mr. McCarthy, earlier, when I was asking you about analysis of other crashes, you referenced Japan.  Can I ... as the chief ... or one of the countries that have been examined, why were we analysing a country with an independent monetary policy, given that our own monetary policy is exogenous and, you know, it's a complete difference from Japan, I suppose?  And, furthermore, you referenced, when you were talking about why the soft landing theory gained such traction, that in Ireland we hadn't had reductions in property values before.  Is it not a central tenet of macroeconomic forecasting that you don't derive future outcomes from localised past history?</p></speech>

So I think that point needs to be borne in mind.  On the second point, I mean, typically, economists, when they're looking at issues, they look at what's happened at the past.  Does it set a precedent?  Or they look at kind of cross-country experiences.</p></speech>

I mean, you had not seen nominal price declines.  The big problem at the time, Deputy, was that, you know, you had seen massive structural change in the Irish economy from the mid-1990s up to 2007.  Now, some of that was real - it was the Celtic Tiger, it was the convergence of<i>per capita</i>incomes, it was real growth, it was driven by the traded sector of the economy - and the price increases were all justified on that basis.</p><p>The problem was from 2002, 2003 you saw a misallocation of resources away from the trading sector and into the non-trading sector.</p></speech>

Isn't that the way economics works?</p></speech>

So it was a point I was making earlier on that you can see modest declines in prices-----</p></speech>

The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session, and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.</p> <p>  Today we continue our hearings with the senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during the crisis period.  At our next session this morning we will hear again from Mr. Kevin Cardiff, former Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  This second session will focus upon developments during Mr. Cardiff's tenure from January 2009 until he left the Department.</p><p>Mr. Kevin Cardiff was Secretary General at the Department of Finance from 2010 to 2012.  He joined the Department in 1984 and had a number of roles in the Department including responsibility for the taxation and financial services division and tax policy.  In March 2012 he was nominated as Ireland's representative to the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg for a six-year period.  Mr. Cardiff, you are welcome back before the inquiry today.<br/><br/>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence. You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<br/><br/>The witness has been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So if I can now ask the Clerk to administer the affirmation to Mr. Cardiff.</p></speech>

As you have already made your opening statement in your last appearance before the inquiry, we will proceed directly to questions.  However, there is just one or two issues that I would like to address first before we go into the formal questioning.</p> <p>  Mr. Cardiff, on pages 235 to 243 of your composite statement, you include copies of handwritten contemporaneous notes made on the night of 29 September 2008.  You also include your own transcription of these notes on pages 231 to 234b of your statement.  A substantially identical typewritten version of these notes, provided by the Department of Finance, was included in documentation sent to, among others, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, former chairman of AIB, in connection with his appearance before the joint committee.  During his evidence to the joint committee on 23 April 2015, Mr. Gleeson disputed the accuracy of parts of these notes, as he says that remarks attributed to Mr. Burrows were, in fact, made by himself.  The reference to this is the final paragraph, page 33, of Mr. Gleeson's evidence transcript.  Mr. Gleeson subsequently repeated his assertion in correspondence with the joint committee dated 27 April 2015 and on 15 June 2015.  Could you please verify the text of your own note and confirm that the remarks are correctly attributed to Mr. Gleeson?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#X00300"><p>No.  Mr. Gleeson is right and wrong at the same time.  If you see, my notes are ... as I explained to you, these were notes I wrote in a jotter - a habit - they weren't intended to be a minute, they're not a minute.  So you'll see that there are notes there attributed to Mr. Burrows and then, a couple of lines down, there's a change in indentation, which, in the way I generally note these things, means that someone else spoke.  So I don't think you can take it ... and I've seen, incidentally, in the package I think there are two different versions of transcripts ... so, my transcripts are accurate transcripts of my notes and, as I think I said to you last time, one shouldn't over-read notes that were intended for that purpose.  But what was said was said.  What's written down was said; it was said, it was written down at the moment it was said and where there's a line attributed to somebody ... someone said that line, but that doesn't mean they said every line afterwards.  And, as I say, in the notes you can see there's changes of indentation and so forth.</p></speech>

And just on another matter related to your statement, you say that on the night of the guarantee, you do not recall any suggestion from any of the official parties at any stage that undated, unsubordinated debt, should ... would be recovered by the guarantee.  However, you refer also to a previous meeting on 26 September at which some of the Merrill Lynch team had felt that inclusion of dated subordinated debt in any broad guarantee was warranted.  You go on to state that your mention of this at the meeting of the 29th led to the inclusion of such debt in the guarantee.  Was the inclusion of subordinated debt accepted by all present, were any contrarian views expressed in this regard and was any elaboration sought by either the Taoiseach, the Minister or anyone else present?  And if you could maybe please elaborate on that.</p></speech>

I don't recall anybody saying "No".  But the matter was discussed in the sense that at least it was raised and discussed.  There was a slight bit more discussion - because I discussed a little bit more - about the issue of existing bonds but, no, I don't recall a contrarian view.  On the other hand, when I've had contrarian ... when I recall my own contrarian views, not everybody recalls them, so.  You recall better what you say yourself, I think, Deputy.</p></speech>

The committee has gone over NAMA in a lot of detail already but there are still certain elements that we want to look into.  And one thing I'd like to ask you about is, the first tranche of loan valuations by NAMA was completed in March 2010 and Governor Honohan has written that &quot;it was clear then, extrapolating from this information at the time, that this would be the most costly banking crisis ever recorded&quot;, and that's page 76 in the book <i>Lenihan: In Calm and Crisis</i>.  Was this clear to the Department in March 2010, after that first transfer of loans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#X01000"><p>I don't think it mattered.  We were dealing with the crisis we had, we weren't going around trying to compare this with someone else's crisis and say which was the most costly and which wasn't.  That's simply the case.  The more pertinent issue for us was that the first round ... the first tranche, was coming in at a discount of, I think, around 50%, certainly heading for that, maybe 47%, and the NAMA draft business plan which was only a short few months old at that stage, had been based around a 30% discount.  So the more ... much more pertinent concern than whether it was better or worse than someone else's crisis was what this meant for our crisis.  And what this meant, in fact, was more capital and that was a serious consideration - and it was a serious consideration from then on.  More seriously still, the discounts got bigger as we went down to the smaller borrowers.  Remember the first two tranches, I think it was, covered the first 30 borrowers.  The tranches later had a great many more borrowers in smaller amounts and, as I recall it, when NAMA got to those borrowers, they were finding a lot of incomplete legal work, a lot of concern about title, a lot of those kinds of issues, which wouldn't have been evident at the time the NTMA was working on the NAMA business plan because they were working at that point, as was very explicit, on data from the banks themselves.  Some other factors in the meanwhile would have been that the ... all this had to be cleared with the European state aid people and they were quite explicit that they wanted very strict adherence both to their guidelines but also to valuation procedures and so forth.  So there was a serious issue; but the issue wasn't whether, you know, ours was the best crisis.</p></speech>

But just to follow on then from that, in May 2010, the IMF mission chief to Ireland phoned the Governor to discuss the possibility of Ireland applying for one of the IMF's new precautionary programmes, just in case.  Was this suggestion put to you at the time?</p></speech>

I'm not saying it wasn't.  Just to be clear, the idea of a NAMA programme or of an IMF programme, one imagined the guarantee and the associated responses in 2008 or 2009 had gone badly wrong.  Well, at that point, we might have looked for some .... we might have had to look for some external support.  Certainly, it wasn't the plan ... it was nobody's intention but the first time I asked for some very, very preliminary and informal work on, you know, how one actually gets an IMF programme, was in September 2008, and at that point, I was thinking, you know, there was no work done on it.  I just asked a colleague to make a discreet inquiry as to how you get into these things, if you do need them, just as a precaution because things were very bad from then.  Then in 2009, I believe there were hints in Washington, possibly also in Dublin, that, you know, IMF would be available if we wanted them.  At that point, the Minister gave a pretty firm instruction to me and to others that we were not engaging with that suggestion but in part because ... remember, a bank crisis means you have to fill gaps in liquidity and gaps in bank liquidity are enormous.  Capital is a lesser problem; liquidity is an enormous gap.  And you really need the firepower of a central bank to do that.  Now, in 2009 and into 2010, we had no problem getting funds for the Government, which is what the IMF provides.  What we had a problem with was the banks getting funds for themselves and, for that, we needed the ECB.  So there would have been no huge advantage, let's say, to an IMF programme before we got it, if it didn't come with some ongoing access to bank liquidity.   The banks were our problem and then by the time we got into the IMF programme, the sovereign itself had a problem and that's what IMF programmes are for.</p></speech>

Do you recall any conversation with Governor Honohan around the time in relation to a precautionary programme?</p></speech>

I don't recall myself ever putting him in his place.  In fact, we had a very respectful, professional relationship.  So, if he's implying that tone, then it couldn't have been me.  But, certainly, at that stage, the Minister and myself would have said, "Well, hang on now", if we were asked.  There is a real problem there because that programme would not fill our gap.  We would need, if there were to be a programme, we would need something bigger and we would need European assistance as well.  So, I would have thought ... I don't remember the conversation but I would have thought if I had been asked at the time, I would have thought this is a little bit premature.  But I wouldn't have ruled it out because, I mean, we had a difficult situation and had had for two years.</p></speech>

Thank you.  Moving forward then to the end of July 2010 and the dependency of the Irish banking system on emergency liquidity assistance is increasing.  Anglo is approaching, I think, &euro;15 billion, and the guarantee is due to expire in September and again, Governor Honohan has written how he made sure the ECB was fully aware of how this situation, the dependency on ELA was shaping up and the consequences for the sovereign.  Did the Governor make the Department aware ... fully aware in July?  Was the Department aware of this September bank funding cliff and the implications for the State in July?</p></speech>

There was no ... this was no great secret, Deputy.  In fact, we had been working very hard with the European Commission to ensure that the guarantee,  on which many of the deposits still relied, was renewed at the end of September, so as to help with that.  In fact, they only finally conveyed approval, I think, in ... excuse me, if I have the date a day or two wrong ... but I believe it was around 21-22 September 2010 when the guarantee was due to expire ten days later or, you know, only around a week later.  That was a problem.</p></speech>

July and August, I think, maybe even June.  We were in discussion with the Commission over a lengthy period.  I don't recall the details of their objections, Deputy; if you wanted, I could probably find out.  But, remember, they didn't like the guarantee.  It was a problem for them.  It was a state aid that was going on for a long period in all sorts of philosophical and principled ways, it was ... this was not a thing they wanted and, on the other hand, they knew that the Irish financial stability was relying it, so eventually they ... after a lot of toing and froing, negotiating back and forth, they conceded an extension.  As I say, I can't remember the details of their objections but I'm sure they're available to you in documents.</p></speech>

If you had a three-month, then it was going to be unguaranteed for two months.  So, I can't see how it would not have had some impact and, in that sense, I think, yes, it must have exacerbated the situation but I don't see how you could quantify it at this stage.</p></speech>

There was no ... this was seen coming from a long way.  And you'll notice, for example, I think when the ELG guarantee expired finally, the Department did a report.  I have it if you want it.  At the break, I can give it to you.  And that report outlines the regular views of the guarantee schemes over the whole period.  So, every three or six months, there was a review.  So, at the very moment that one review finished, you would be talking to them about the next review.</p></speech>

Not everybody wanted to give us that money.  In the IMF, there were naysayers, people who said: "Look, this is beyond our normal range; this is, I think, ten times the quota that is usually available to a country like Ireland for the size of the borrowing".  In the ECB, there were people that were saying, "Look we are too exposed to Ireland, this is ... it's not worth the trouble of keeping them going."  Philosophically, legally, we were at the edge and a lot of people in those organisations would have thought, "Actually, this is not ... it's not our role to keep this happening."  So when we talk about, as I do quite critically, ECB and even the IMF on some points, the fact is there were people in there who were willing to fight for us and keep us in.  So it wasn't a foregone conclusion that we would get that money and it wasn't a foregone conclusion in, say, 2011, early 2011 in particular as things kept getting worse, that we would continue to get the money.</p></speech>

It was based on both legal considerations but, more importantly, on the advice from the NTMA that this would be a bad thing and I think my statement is ... or my long ... what Senator O'Keeffe calls my "long statement" goes into that in a certain amount of detail.  Remember, the NTMA was concerned, quite rightly, that it had to fund Ireland in the market.  It had a view that if we were burning senior bondholders, we could easily lose that access to the market.  Two months on, it was pretty clear that we didn't have access to the market, so the balance of advantage for Ireland changed.</p></speech>

You talk about what your next step is going to be at all, at any stage, Deputy.  So it was settled policy, but the situation was changing and the NTMA was, sort of, saying, "Well, look, we can't, Ireland can't burn bondholders but it might suit us if Europe forced us to because then you wouldn't have any negative impact on, you know, the group of bondholders that were also financing the Irish Government."  They wouldn't be upset or offended or they wouldn't pull their funding, he would have thought, if at the same time there was a European diktat in some legal from that said we must.  So, I think in September, certainly by September and into October, the balance of advantage was changing and people were talking about, or were thinking about and were talking about, where we would go if things changed, but the policy was, and continued to be, that were not burning senior bondholders through October and into November.</p></speech>

But I just want to look at the relationship, maybe, between the Irish Government and the troika partners and in particular, the ECB and I want to look at some of the language you use in relation to the ECB at various parts of your long statement.  You talk about the "fiction that the ECB was present in negotiations only to do with banking matters"; "an increasingly hectoring tone on the part of the ECB'' - this is in October after the Deauville Declaration; then moving into November, "increasingly strident rhetoric from the ECB"; "the ECB's panicky state of mind"; the November Trichet letter to Lenihan was "a very direct warning and threat"; "It is easy to attribute a bullying attitude in retrospect"; on recapitalising the banking system, "the ECB had a different agenda"; on the proposed interest rate, "ECB showed a little less solidarity''; on burden-sharing you talk about "the fallacy that the ECB was simply giving advice".  So what was the relationship with the ECB like?  And do you blame the ECB for the fact that we had to enter a bailout?  And do you blame them for those terms that were not favourable to Ireland in that final agreement?</p></speech>

All parties have something they want out of it.  So, I mean you have read out a lot of comments I made there and they are honest and I mean every one of them.  But almost every single time I made the comment, there is a counter-comment in the next paragraph, almost always, which you haven't read out.  Remember, think of us and Anglo or not Anglo.  Just take Ireland and a bust bank and just reverse the situation somewhat.  We had all of the same problems with the bust banks as the ECB would probably say they had with us.  And the bust banks might say that were increasingly hectoring in our tone and so forth.  This was a negotiation.  People who I was dealing with were very tough at times, definitely hectoring.  Sometimes they changed their minds and it didn't suit; other times they seemed to make a promise and it didn't seem to be kept.  But they were doing their job to negotiate.  So, I mean if you were to go into any negotiation that's a tough negotiation with a lot of different agendas and found that there was no one was being tough, then there was something wrong with the negotiation, frankly.  I don't think they were doing anything other than what they saw as their job and, remember, as I make abundantly plain more than once in my statement, they were giving us a huge amount of support.  The slight irony in it was that they were dong so with a public reluctance, which actually made the level of support that was required, I think, slight  ... bigger.  So if the ECB had said November 2010, just after we had agreed to go on the bailout ... if they had said in a very public way, ''Okay, so long as the Irish are sticking to the programme, we are supporting them come what may'.'  They would probably have actually have to give us less support than actually arose because in the event, they, sort of, said it's a good thing that they are joining the programme but no big supportive statement.  The big supportive statement only came in March after a lot of effort and, you know, the ECB will tell you, legally, they couldn't make those kind of statements.</p><p>I don't know if that's true, I expect it's not, or they might tell you that, you know, it wasn't appropriate because we hadn't done all that they wanted us to do, those kind of things.  Or, they might have just been holding their fire in order to make us concede a bit more than we wanted to on the various issues between us.  But that's life, that's negotiation, that's discussion.  They had their agenda; we had ours.</p></speech>

Mr. Trichet spoke about a global consensus against burden-sharing.  Was Minister Lenihan part of that global consensus in November 2010?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#AA00500"><p>No, there was no global consensus.  If global means everybody, no.  What he may mean ... well I explain in my statement.  When the IMF programme discussions started and the EU programme discussions started in ... so, 21st thereabouts of November 2010, even a day or two before in truth, the IMF was not just saying, as I say in my statement, that they were in favour of, but I've looked over my notes since then, in some ways they were saying, "We might even make it a requirement, this might be something that we would think is essential," - this burden-sharing with senior bondholders to be clear.</p> <p>  The other partners were clearly not so anxious to do so and while we genuinely tried, because we needed this programme to hold together, we genuinely tried not to force differences between the parties.  We did explore a little bit more with the IMF than with anybody else about this.  They said, "Look, we've talked to Dominique Strauss-Khan [their managing director], he thinks that he can get the other parties, the big European and American governments over the line, he thinks he can persuade them that this is a good thing to do."</p> <p>  Myself and the Minister in discussion didn't think that we could, so if Strauss-Khan could do it that would be wonderful.  So the plan was that Strauss-Khan would speak to these sort of G7 types, the big countries, and he was pretty confident.  There was even, at least as recounted to us by the IMF staff on the ground, and there was even a hint back, we got an e-mail ... or I got an e-mail, I think on about the 24 November or thereabouts, 24th or 25th, maybe the 25th, that Strauss-Khan had reason to believe that Geithner, the American secretary ... the American finance minister, Secretary to the Treasury, that he would ... he was sort of showing himself to be a little bit favourable.  And then ... so they have the telephone conversation as I understand it and the message we got back was actually the opposite - it was very negative.  What we were hearing was that among the negative people were Geithner and Trichet of the ECB, but others too.</p></speech>

Those that were already guaranteed wouldn't have been included in the numbers, those that were secured on loans and so forth probably wouldn't have been included in the numbers because they had other protections.  So I recall the number of about &euro;19 billion being in the mix, but the numbers moved around a little bit depending on, you know, exactly how you wanted to define them.</p></speech>

Just two very quick questions at the beginning which arise; we had John McCarthy in earlier from the Department of Finance and while it goes back perhaps to the evidence of the other day, he told me in questioning that his Department were vocal and consistent in their recommendation for counter-cyclical policies throughout the period.  He said, right from 2001 up but ... that this, that's how he put it - circumstances always changed between the agreed budget strategy signed by the Minister and what happened later.  Do you agree with that statement?</p></speech>

At times I was on the tax side, but the people who put it all together were in a different division.  So it wouldn't have been me who was doing that but I mean, yes, I'm aware that we were given advice at different times, and I've read the Wright report, like all of you have and it's clear from that that we were given advice.  Wright says that we should have been more, I forget the word he says, strident or more vocal, at different points than we were.</p></speech>

If a document is a Minister's speech or is a policy statement or whatever, well it's the Minister's statement and it's not ... so long as we have a democracy it's not for civil servants to insist.  Civil servants ... and there's a real question about how ... to what extent the Civil Service should be an internal opposition, but I don't think Ministers particularly ever want it that way.  But certainly the ... you would, if you were framing a response to a parliamentary question or you were framing a public speech, what you would be framing would be the document that you think the Minister wants.  If you were framing your own advice, that would be different.  So if you were framing your advice to the Minister that might have one thing in it, but once the Minister has decided a policy or once there is a policy line for something, then in terms of what you have the Minister say, because you draft the speech for him, or a line or a parliamentary question answer, then that's his speech you are trying to draft, not your own.</p></speech>

I don't recall ever hearing of a property tax incentive being something that the official level would have thought was a wonderful thing to suggest.  But that's not to say they weren't, but in general we had concerns about property tax incentives, in particular because if you incentivise a lot of things, then the incentive effect actually is reduced.</p><p>You have ... if you have only one property tax incentive then that ... that policy objective really is incentivised.  But if investors have 20 different options, all with an incentive, then the incentive effect for any one of those options is much reduced.</p></speech>

The &euro;3.5 billion was an assessment at the time, but, at the time, the assessment was that they needed a couple of billion more, not that they needed &euro;19 billion, and a couple of billion more was to be made up by themselves because they had assets that they could sell which would accrue to capital.  In particular they had a Polish subsidiary which was sold later.  So their plea, if you like, was, "Don't give us more capital; please, please, not more, not more capital.  We'll find it ourselves; we'll find the balance ourselves."  So that's why, at the time, they got less capital than was estimated to be required.</p></speech>

What was really important was not ... much more salient, if you like, was not whether those would be merged together, and I gave a slightly glib answer, in part because I don't remember all the discussion.  Much more important than whether those would be merged together would be what would happen their deposits, which, as you remember, were passed on to other institutions.  That mattered because if those institutions lost those deposits they had to rely, even more, on ELA, which meant that we had to rely even more on the ECB to continue to sanction that.  So, a lot of our concern about this was not ... about these rearrangements was about protecting the deposit base and ensuring that we would continue to have as much ... as many deposits in the system as possible.  And we were afraid we would lose those.  So when the deposits were moved out of IBRC, and into other institutions, at the time we were relying on a, sort of, a tacit agreement from the ECB that that would ... you know, they would make up the difference, and they would allow the difference to be made up in ELA.</p></speech>

They ... this is ... they have an absolute belief in their legal position as being independent.  And it's not purely self-serving.  Remember, some of these people, in some of these countries, don't have a tradition of independent central banking or of a ... or, don't have a tradition of a lack of political interference in central banking.  Some of these countries are ... have done enormous things to make themselves democracies in a very short period of time, from a ... you know, a transition from an out and out dictatorship, where nothing was independent.  So there's a reality to their desire to be independent but they try to protect that, sometimes in ways that we mightn't all like.

So we are there, we have a particular national problem and we're fighting hard and he's trying to think well, what's the implication of this for the entire eurozone.  So he has a different perspective.  What was really important to us might seem to him, you know, that to achieve a saving of several billion is quite a good deal, if we got a 15% reduction on that 19 that would be nearly &euro;10 billion.  That was really important to us but for him ...  if you're sitting in Frankfurt and you're saying &euro;10 billion and we could have risked the whole project, you might think it is not worth doing.</p></speech>

So he took a view that was different to the Minister's and different to mine at the time as to when was the time to talk more openly to the Irish public.  I think, in truth, there was only a day or two in it.  It was very clear, at that stage we were having gone, in the lingo, from contacts with the EU-IMF to by then what were being called short and focused discussions actually in Dublin.  I mean, it was clear that there was a momentum building.  I think probably what Patrick said on the Thursday, the Minister would probably have been willing to say himself on the Friday evening.  So I was not especially upset by it, I thought, "Well, I would not have done it but he has to do his duty as he sees it."  I think Minister Lenihan thought the same because there was no sense of rancour between them afterwards.  I think they just saw each other as doing a slightly different job.  It was a little bit... I would have liked an hour more notice of it, that's all.</p></speech>

I mean, we had done so on the basis of what-ifs because, you know, we couldn't run ahead of Government agreements.  Everything was done very closely with the Minister, so the officials were not running ahead of the Minister, but the Minister was having to manage this ... the discussion, the prior discussion was all about "If we were to join a programme, what would be the terms?"  So, by then, we were at that point where a lot of the, "Well, if you do, then the terms will be X, Y and Z", a good deal of that had been discussed.  So, I'm not sure.  So long as his statement didn't lead the other side to start rowing backwards and say, "Well, we could get more", then it wouldn't have made a huge difference.  I don't think it did make an enormous difference to the endpoint.</p></speech>

Just to put the question to you and that is: did the structure or design of the bank guarantee, along with its period of duration, have any bearing on the Irish State entering a bailout programme two years and two months after the bank guarantee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#DD01000"><p>Clearly, yes, but maybe in a slightly different way to the way people have suggested.  It clearly did, because the structure of the guarantee ... the structure of any guarantee puts the sovereign credit behind the bank credit.  And the combination of circumstances in ... from about May of 2010 onwards, meant that that was a difficult situation to be in.  If you remember, in April, or thereabouts, 2010, there was actually an optimistic moment or two.  The Central Bank had announced its stress test results.  The Government had announced what it would do, in terms of capital, about those stress test results.  I think the Bank of Ireland even got in a modicum of private sector equity, which implied that, for that month, the private sector was convinced that things were changing in Ireland.  And then the sovereign crisis happened - April, May, a little bit of it in March, even, but accelerating a lot into April, May, June; the Greek crisis.  And at that point bond investors became really, really risk averse, both in relation to banks and in relation to sovereigns.  So the Irish guarantee became worth less, if you like.  So, by the time we got into September 2010, at the time when ... well, even June, July, August, September 2010, at a time when really the banks ought to have been renewing their long-term loans to deal with the end-September cliff, it simply wasn't possible for them to get into the market because they were relying on the sovereign credit and the sovereign credit was suddenly less good, so in that sense, the combination of the two was difficult but, you know, it wasn't so much the structure of the guarantee as that the end of the guarantee happened to coincide with this huge risk averseness arising from the Greek crisis and then spreading to others later.</p></speech>

That was the letter of 21 November 2010.</p></speech>

I think they were at that time.  Anglo might have had a brief period when it wasn't really, earlier on, but it was covered by periods of ... well, they were solvent in the sense that it was always the case that the State would stand behind them, so they could only then be insolvent ... and when I mentioned Anglo, there was a moment when, you know, there was ... the State had to say, "Yes, in fact we are behind them" to make sure that they remained solvent."  And then your ... the next question would be, if the State is insolvent, how would its credit make the banks solvent?  But the State wasn't insolvent, the State was, as has proved to be the point ... proved to be the case, the State was capable of adjusting in such a way as to come out of the ... of its problems provided it had a supply of funding, which came from the EU-IMF programme.</p></speech>

Given that the adjustment programme ... that the bailout programme actually brought was approximately addressing a &euro;30 billion deficit, could the proposition be made that the Irish State was actually now insolvent and that's why the bailout programme was required and, therefore, the banks were not solvent at the time of that letter?</p></speech>

The fact was that the Irish State did access funding and, as it turns out, it was not insolvent, it was able to meet all its obligations and, therefore, the banks were not insolvent at the time.  But it was not an unreasonable concern of the ECB to be coming to the Minister and sending him a letter saying, "Actually, look at what's going on.  We are concerned about the solvency of the Irish banks, who owe us a lot of money and we're concerned, in part, because they are relying on your solvency and you owe the world a lot of money."</p></speech>

In your witness statement, when you were with us last, you comment on Jean-Claude Trichet's letter of 19 November 2010 to the late Minister for Finance and your comments were, &quot;In many ways, this letter was entirely superfluous since it was already clear by the time of the letter that the Government was going to opt into a programme.&quot;  Speaking on the same, related matter, Jean-Claude Trichet, when he appeared at the IIEA event in Kilmainham, said:</p> <blockquote> 	[As] you know, we could also have continued on our side after having gone up to 100% of GDP go to 200% of ... GDP, and why not 300% of GDP?  And why not 300% of GDP?  Then what would ... the Commission [of] inquiry [be] asking for [relating to this inquiry].  You would say, &quot;Were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue when we going in the wall at 100 miles per hour to continue to provide liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?&quot; </blockquote> <p>So, Mr. Cardiff, can I ask you, was Mr. Trichet right in this regard?  If this action hadn't happened and the entry to the programme had been delayed, would the cost of the bailout have actually been bigger for Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.628" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#DD01600"><p>Well, I'd like to say this was wonderfully planned but remember what happened in 2011: things got a lot worse in sovereign markets before they got better.  And had we waited until, say, March 2011 to get the programme, it might have had to be bigger, it might have been ... had conditions that were a lot stricter.  It might have had ... it might not have worked, so the amount of moneys required at that point mightn't have been available.  Because the programme started in the relative calm ... it didn't feel calm at the time, but the relative calm of November 2010, we had funding for all of 2011 and 2012 and we didn't need to rely on a market that was extraordinarily difficult and so, yes, in that sense, it was better to start earlier than later.  Remember, in July 2011, the interest rate on two-year Irish money wasn't the 2% or the 1% or the 0% that you might find it at now, it was at 20%.</p><p>So, people wouldn't even give you money for a short ... for a relatively short term, unless getting that interest rate.  That's how bad things were.  By the end of 2011, November-ish probably ... but certainly by the end, that was down to 8%.  We weathered the storm.  That was the stormiest period and we were able to weather it much more happily, with much less problem than we would have had, had we not had the programme.  But remember in that period ... I mean it would be interesting to talk to ... I haven't done it, but it would be interesting to talk to people about what's, what was going on inside the IMF and inside the ECB at the time, because I would bet you that they were starting to say it looks like we've done a really bad deal here, look at the way things are going, if it continues like this we'll never get our money back.</p></speech>

But to come back to the question, was the entry into the programme in November, even though the costs were quite, quite significant, of a lesser cost if the programme had not been entered to at that time and had been delayed into, let's say, quarter one or quarter two of 2011?</p></speech>

But let's be clear, you might not have been able to get a programme in March, or certainly in July of 2011.</p></speech>

And there was a genuine, I think, a genuine sense of solidarity behind it.  It wasn't ... there was some altruism in it, it wasn't just a cynical decision.  But the decision would have been ... would have been a more difficult one to make in March or in certainly in July of 2011 because things were much worse.  You would have less chance of your loan, your very significant loan to Ireland, having the desired outcome at that point.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was about to ... was coming close, I suppose, at that stage at finalising his mind and other people were coming close to finalising their minds so I suppose it was a check on where we were around the room.  As to whether, as to why Brendan was outside, well Brendan was outside because the people in the room ... the senior people in the room, didn't choose to bring him in.</p></speech>

Qualification, Mr. Cardiff:</p> <blockquote> 	Anglo has &euro;3.3 bn of loans on the watchlist.<br /><br />A 10% fall in commercial property value would result in an additional provision of &euro;7 bn.<br /><br />&euro;23 bn liquidity deficit by the end of the year.<br /><br />Additional &euro;17 bn of liquidity expected to be lost once information becomes public.<br /><br />Total &euro;40 bn.   </blockquote> <p>I mean, those are startling figures.  How could the Minister for Finance subsequently - I know they didn't go down the route of SLS, but the numbers were so enormous - how could it be stated that this would be the cheapest option available to the Government at that stage?</p></speech>

I can't recall when they finished that work - probably after the nationalisation.  But there was also a due diligence process which looked at the ... some of the legal aspects, some of the blown aspects and so forth of the bank, and that was a process that went on over ... mostly over the course of December and into January in ... of 2008 into 2009.  But in the ... of its nature, a one-month exercise doesn't provide for you what, you know, the nine or ten-month NAMA exercise later provided, which is a loan-by-loan exposure.</p></speech>

But, no, I mean, certainly it would have been around the time that the Pricewaterhouse-Jones Lang LaSalle work was concluding that we started talking about bigger amounts of capital.  But, remember, the outcome of their discussions and of the initial thoughts on NAMA were not for anyone to say that, you know, there's a ... there's suddenly a &euro;30 billion hole here.  The outcome was that we were looking at a capitalisation of the two big banks that amounted to &euro;7 billion, with a requirement for them also to raise capital.  So for the two bigger banks, we're talking about &euro;10 billion and then ... I forget what we were talking about for Anglo.  We were saying ... I think by then Anglo was going to be put on a drip feed, so it was ... it was never going to get all of the capital it might want upfront.  But even into the middle of that year, I don't think anyone was talking about &euro;10 billion for Anglo.</p> <p>  The ... there were two things happening at once.  First of all, with the NAMA process later in 2010, the loans were being exposed and their loan qualities were being exposed in a way that wasn't known before.  But, at the same time, the economy was performing worse and worse and the property values within the economy were performing worse and worse.  So there was a sort of a rolling worsening on almost all fronts of the situation, which hadn't happened.  I mean, it got worse and worse so if you pick any time between September '08 and, you know, the middle of 2010 or into 2011 probably, you could find you'd have a different estimation of capital requirements based on what the particular position of the economy was at that moment.  </p></speech>

Could you elaborate ... on page 23 of your own statement where, speaking about NAMA, when Dr. Bacon and the NTMA presented a proposition they had been working on to the Minister for Finance, it came as something of a shock to the Minister and to the Department of Finance officials.  Can you just elaborate on that - your views at the time?</p></speech>

We had been working very closely with the NTMA all along but, I suppose, they had, over a course ... over the course of just a couple of days, they had finalised their view on what NAMA should look like and they were preparing to report on it to the Minister and, I think, just the morning before they reported on it to the Minister they reported on it to a small group of officials.  The scale of ambition they had in mind was huge.  The value of the property loans that they ... the book value of the property loans that they were intending to ... or suggesting would be taken from the banks was ... I think it was &euro;140 billion or &euro;150 billion, so a huge amount of additional Government paper would have to be issued to make that work.</p></speech>

I think there was a discussion in which people, including the Secretary General and the Minister said:</p> <blockquote> 	Look, lads, that looks like it's more than the Exchequer will be able to bear.  It will cause problems for the sovereign credit, and are you sure it's necessary? </blockquote> <p>And they said well ... they, sort of, seemed to have a fall-back position that came ... came readily to hand.  So they clearly had given it some thought which was that we take a particular type of loan, the ones which are most likely to be stressed.  That would probably achieve most of the benefit with less potential for knock-on effects for the sovereign.</p></speech>

People get the loan, they pay it back, that's fine.  But if you get to the point where you're worrying about the collateral, then if there's any flaw in the legal documents, just as an example, you're loan is worth less.</p></speech>

Okay.  Can I take it that the fact that the original NAMA draft plan was based on a 30% discount, which would have been the ... the ... NAMA paying around &euro;54 billion for &euro;77 billion of gross loans and that ended up ... that NAMA paid over &euro;20 billion less.  So for &euro;74 billion they ended up paying &euro;32 billion, so, instead of a 30% discount, it was nearly 60%, so &euro;20 billion less went into the banks and we had reports in 2010 were ... could one bank bring down a country?  If those level of discounts hadn't arisen in NAMA, was it ... did it have an impact in bringing a banking crisis to a sovereign crisis and precipitate our, as a country, going into a bailout?</p></speech>

We would have had to put a lot less money into recapitalising the banks and if we had to put a lot less money into recapitalising the banks, in theory, that would have mean ... meant less need for external support.  So that ... that's part of the equation.  On the other side of the equation is that it would have become evident quite quickly because we would have been transparent about the valuations, unless we were hiding it - it would have been evident quite quickly that NAMA was sitting on a very large loss, which would sit immediately on the Government's balance sheet.  So, instead of having the loss in one pocket of area where the State was supporting, you'd put it in another area where the State was supporting.  So it would even out.  The only way you could have ... it could have avoided a bailout, you know, precipitation or a worsening would be if we were ... if we had hidden this in some way.</p></speech>

In your statement, on page 26, you say, "Rightly or wrongly, there was a view that the ECB did not fight &lsquo;fairly&rsquo; in all cases ... [what] they would ask for actions ... [to] a particular direction".  Did the ECB and Mr. Trichet play fairly with Ireland, both in terms of the guarantee and the bailout?

Remember, there were two things ... two almost prerequisites for NAMA to work.  One was that it didn't immediately add, in an accounting sense, to the national debt - and that was that was managed by a ... we were very transparent about what we were doing but we created an extraordinarily artificial structure to keep it off the debt in which, you know, the entire NAMA structure sits on about a &euro;20 billion investment from the private sector, it's an amazing ... it's a fiction.  It's a real fiction, I mean, there's no credit problem but in terms of accounting, it's a fiction.  And we were very transparent that we were doing this.</p> <p>  On the bailout, well, remember what I was talking about was negotiating tactics and in a negotiation there are tactics but, in the round, the ECB gave, at its risk, enormous amounts of capital ... of funding to Irish banks, without which Ireland, as an economy, would have had much greater difficulty.  So ... and I think I brought attention to this ... what I think is the irony.  The irony is that, at the same time as they were talking down their involvement with Ireland, they were in practice giving us much more.  So, practically speaking, they gave us great help but, publicly speaking, they were a little bit reticent.  So I ... I ... and that's what I'm trying so bring attention to.  This is a public inquiry about bringing the facts to light.  Some of the presentation of the ECB actions are not as transparent as they ought to be.</p></speech>

I just want to tidy up one matter, if you can deal with it promptly, and then we'll take a short break.  In describing the principal reasons why the NAMA option was chosen over the only other realistic alternative of an insurance scheme, given especially the scale, complexity and relatively untested nature of the NAMA option - this relates to an engagement you had with Senator Barrett last week - could you maybe just explain why that option, the untested option which was the NAMA option, was ultimately the decision, against maybe some type of insurance scheme or some other model that could have been outlined?</p></speech>

I mean, a bad bank/NAMA-type operation had been done in a number of different jurisdictions ... and they had always, you know, they had always proved ... always in the jurisdiction they were used in, they proved to have some effect.  The asset protection scheme-type approach had been just started in the UK.  The big difference ... about pros and cons, the big difference is that, with the NAMA approach you value every single loan and you know exactly what your exposure is but it takes a year to do it - big problem.  The asset protection scheme, you take a punt up front on what the values are going to be.  Now, as it happens, had we taken the punt up front, we'd have been very wrong.</p><p>That's a simple fact.  The banks would've made a killing at our expense.  We were afraid ... at the time, we were afraid that the asset protection scheme exposures were too unknowable - turned out we were right.  But in the UK case, where they did much the same, they actually did okay out of it.  So ... but they were different type of assets.  It was probably one of those instances where you can claim wisdom after the fact.  But we didn't ... we weren't sure, which was best, but we thought it was better to have a transparent, though slower, NAMA operation than an asset protection scheme operation.  The other great advantage of the NAMA operation was that it meant that the ECB, very willingly, handed over billions and billions ... tens of billions of euro to Irish banks; the asset protection scheme wouldn't do that.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Cardiff.  Briefly, at the start, I want to ask you about NAMA, and, in particular, the effectiveness of NAMA now, I suppose, with ... in reference to what was envisaged before it was established, and, principally, in relation, if you could, maybe, give the main strength or weakness of NAMA in terms of its effectiveness.  I also want to ask you in relation to NAMA, we've had evidence from them of interest roll-ups of up to ... of &euro;9 billion on acquired loans, lending backed by paper collateral only, substantial issues relating to varying degrees of due diligence, and significant debtor borrowings across different institutions.  And against that background, can you comment on the steps that were taken pre the establishment of NAMA to establish the true loan book positions of the covered institutions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#JJ00300"><p>Yes.  Before NAMA was established, there was an interim board set up, and an interim chief executive, which was Mr. McDonagh.  And as I recall it, because he would have been reporting to us at the time, he was in very intensive discussions with the banks even before NAMA was established to see ... to establish the facts about their loan books.  So, in a sense, he's much better placed than I to say, and I'm recounting what he told me, but I know that he has afterwards said to Oireachtas committees that the information he got turned out to be incorrect, and in some ways very incorrect, quite a long way away ... quite a long way from the actual position.  I don't know whether that was because the banks themselves didn't understand their situation or because what ... I don't know why.  But certainly that's what NAMA found as it worked.  It, sort of ... it emphasises the wisdom of acting on the basis of a loan-by-loan valuation for all the big loans, even though that loan-by-loan valuation did have the problem of delaying the whole process.  It was a much slower way of acting.</p></speech>

And you responded by saying, "Well, if they knew that two weeks later, then they were "bowsies", because they didn't tell us that."  On the night of the guarantee, just for clarification, did anyone from the State side ask any of the institutions present about the likelihood of capital injection by the taxpayer, can you recall?</p></speech>

And also I just, bear in mind, I think the way the question was put was along the lines of that they really needed capital at that point, and the minutes you've sent to me talk a bit more about precautionary capital.  Capital is ... in a sense, they're consistent with what I was saying last time, that at this point, there was a need for capital mostly based on changing market expectation, that they're already saying, even on 18 October, "Look, let's look at that."  And also, you'll recall from ... I'm not sure if I said it last week ... but we and the official system started to focus on capital also almost immediately, probably around the 15th or so, I think, I sent an e-mail to people saying we have to now do an exercise about capital, and about whether nationalisations may be required, and so forth.</p></speech>

I don't think they were entirely upfront, let's say, about their own desires.</p></speech>

And further on, then, on the 17th, Mr. Goggin, the chief executive, was quoted in the minutes.  There was proposed a range of immediate actions that he sought endorsement from the Court of Bank of Ireland, including to explore a capital injection by the State; and that was 17 October.  Again, I'd just like to ask you briefly for your reaction to that evidence?  And seeing those minutes now, you used the word "coy", can you elaborate maybe a little bit more, particularly in light of the fact that Bank of Ireland, proportionately to other institutions, didn't receive as much of an injection subsequently?  We haven't had any other evidence from other institutions that at that point in time, in their minutes at least, that they were aware of the need for a possible State injection.</p></speech>

I looked at what records I had, and there seems to have been a discussion with the Central Bank round about the 18th.  I'm not sure of the date because, as I say, I haven't been able to check for sure, but in and around the same time as that board meeting was happening.  And that discussion was probably the first, - it may have been, I don't know - the first discussion where the Central Bank, the regulator, was pressing on the banks to say what were their next plans.  It seems from my notes of that conversation - I wasn't at that meeting but it was recounted back - that they were a little bit frustrated by the Bank of Ireland, who seemed to be saying they had less available, less to do.  So, that together with the fact that even two months later, we were still having discussions with Bank of Ireland, and other banks, where we were saying, "Look, you know, what's going on?  What are you doing?  How can we raise capital for you?"  And which they weren't averse to taking capital, but there was a sort of a toing and froing going on as to how much, and how-----</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff, at the end of 2008, PricewaterhouseCooper's loan bank analysis of the core banks showed 22 borrowers had total loans of &euro;29.4 billion, and, in 2010, in the total debt of &euro;74 billion taken in by NAMA, 29 borrowers accounted for &euro;38 billion.  Can I ask you if the Department of Finance tracked, through 2009, for example, the situation <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>the banks, these developers and NAMA, to guard against moral hazard, to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer, and to make sure that no one was taking extra advantage?</p></speech>

If you look at the NAMA legislation, for example, there are even lobbying offences, I think unheard of before in Ireland, where a person other than an agent of a borrower may not lobby on their behalf. I think that even if ... and if they do, NAMA is legally obliged to report the matter to the guards, or it is committing an offence.  There's all sorts of provisions and so forth in there about confidentiality, about ensuring that the State's position is protected.  There are even provisions in there about ... we had a concern about ransom strips, in other words that if a borrower had control of both a building and a piece of land outside the building, that he wouldn't be able to manipulate the control of the piece of land outside the building to the, to manipulate also the value of the underlying asset.</p><p>There were planning provisions and so forth to make sure we could ... that NAMA could get access, could complete its business.  So, there was a huge effort in the NAMA legislation to try to anticipate what kind of tactics could a reluctant borrower engage in and to address each one of those as much as we could in legislation.  So, a very big effort there and then in relation to the institutions themselves, well, I mean Anglo had been nationalised, new board, new management and they were expected to manage in the best interests of the bank, not in the best interests of any borrower.  And in 2010 then ... beginning of 2010, the NTMA was given a ... had a form of roll up to them but it was given the job of being the Minister's ... acting for the Minister in negotiations with the various institutions and to ensure that there was a professionalisation, let's say, of the relationship management with the institutions and at that stage then, new chief executive in NTMA and so forth, they were able to bring in a new approach, a new set of staffing to deal with that.  So there was a pretty intensive effort to make sure that ... that things were being looked after more or less right but it still, and still I imagine even now, relies hugely on the managements of individual institutions to ... to do their job.  NAMA was a bit different.  NAMA, sort of, progressed from a point of not really trusting because we were taking all these loans on to the State's balance sheet.  So, there's a lot of anticipated cynicism in the NAMA legislation that probably doesn't ... didn't exist in Irish law before.</p></speech>

Now, last week we looked at a meeting on 7 September of the regulator and the banks where AIB and Bank of Ireland said, "INBS was insolvent".  We don't need to go over that again.  But, I wish to look in the evidence at two instances which I would put to you would say that clearly INBS was insolvent.  So, if we take Doyle, first of all, because this not in your core documents, Mr. Cardiff, but Doyle, Vol. 1, page 163, which is the Goldman Sachs analysis and you are probably familiar with this, anyway, Mr. Cardiff.  But, page 163, total loan book of &euro;11.7 billion, then mark-to-market the best mark of 67 ... 69.1%, worst mark 40%.  So, giving a situation where a potential loss from &euro;3.6 billion to &euro;7 billion, which is quite a spread, no question about it, and in page 152 of the same document, total regulatory capital of INBS is put down as &euro;1.8 billion.  So, on that basis, INBS is clearly insolvent.  If I can move forward quickly then-----</p></speech>

Go on, I'll let you continue but just be mindful of making any narrative on it, okay.  Just state the facts.</p></speech>

Going forward to your own core document, Vol. 2, page 54, Mr. Cardiff, and this is the presentation by Merrill Lynch to the National Treasury Management Agency on 26 September and the top right-hand corner of page 54, "INBS has &euro;11.7 bn of loans ... Writedowns of 30% - 60% results in an impairment of &euro;3.6 bn - &euro;7 bn", which is more or less exactly what Goldman Sachs said and remembering that regulatory capital is &euro;1.8 billion.  On the face of those figures, was INBS insolvent?</p></speech>

First of all, if you mark-to-market ... remember, a bank typically earns ... I don't know, a few per cent on a loan.  In fact, it earns the difference between the few per cent they pay to the depositor and the few extra per cent that it gets on the loan.  So, it's working on a return of, you know, a net return of a margin of a couple of per cent on any given loan.  Now, if you take that loan and you sell it into the market, which is what a mark-to-market approach would do, then you're selling it to people who are looking for a return of maybe 10% or 12% or 15%.  So, the market value of that loan will be ... could be quite heavily discounted relative to what the value it would be on the bank's books and the banks assume, generally speaking, unless things have changed very radically, they assume that over time, they will hold that loan over time and they will get the full payment in the end less whatever provision they might make for the likelihood of a default and the amount they get on default.  So, the mark-to-market value would be quite different from the going concern value for a bank that is in ongoing mode.  Now, at the end of, you know, in the week before 29 September 2008 just to be clear, we spoke to Goldman Sachs and they were saying, "Well, look actually the loan book may be not quite so bad as we had initially thought it might be and that, in fact, over time, they might just trade through all this, they could trade through all this without actually burning through all their capital, assuming they are allowed to trade through."  That was the difference in the assumption, I suppose, assuming allowed to trade through, they were saying, "Not, on that basis, insolvent."</p></speech>

Was somebody or some bodies working to hide the insolvency of any institution on that night?</p></speech>

The answer is no.  Nobody that I was aware of was working to hide anything.  We wanted the best decision that we could get.  Secondly, nobody ... there was no evidence to suggest that INBS was insolvent at that moment.  But, certainly, if it had to sell all of its loans straight away or if market conditions deteriorated over time, they would start to burn through their .. first of all, through the whatever profit they were earning, then through their capital and then could eventually fall into a negative capital position.  So they were likely at some stage to need capital.  Why was the document redacted?  It was redacted probably on my judgment for legal reasons or for commercially-sensitive reasons ...sensitivity reasons.  But to be clear, Deputy, I spent two hours I believe it was in July 2010 in private session at the public accounts committee - the previous version of it - and we went through the records and I explained why things had been redacted.  I explained the philosophy or the approach I had taken to all the redactions.  I explained, even, probably going beyond where I should about what was redacted for legal reasons ... or for legal privilege reasons and so forth.  So it wasn't that the public accounts committee was given this set of documents and no explanation for redactions.  They got explanations for the redactions.  But in the end, I had to make a judgment.  You might just remember ... well, you won't remember, Deputy, but initially, the public accounts committee asked me for a document ... a single document.  I gave a lot more than that because I didn't think they could get a perspective without that.  But I had to ... in the light of my job, in the light of the legal position, in the light of the market position, I had to make quite a few redactions which I tried to explain.</p></speech>

Can you tell us about the level of co-operation by both AIB and Bank of Ireland at the time of the ... capital-raising options, including asset sales, that you mentioned and, in particular, whether the level of co-operation may have contributed to the amount of capital ultimately required by both institutions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#MM01000"><p>I don't know if it made much difference to the end number, Deputy, but we didn't ... AIB, in particular, was very slow on its asset disposals.  They really, really liked their Polish subsidiary and they didn't want to sell it.  Actually, it was probably a much better bank, as it turns out, than the head office was, so that's understandable - other subsidiaries too.  So they ... we thought ... but, again, this is ... as I said, you don't know until the very end, until someone turns over the cards, you don't know exactly what cards people were playing.  But we thought that they were going much too slow on that.  I recall a quite tough conversation in which AIB said, ''Look, you've always been [I've always been] negative on the Polish subsidiary'', and I said, ''No, I think the Polish subsidiary is great.  The problem is I'm negative on AIB and you need to sell the Polish subsidiary to support AIB''.  It was the jewel in the crown, naturally they didn't want to get rid of it.  But there were other subsidiaries too, other asset disposals they could do.  In ... in Bank of Ireland, at least they thought ... they started thinking quite quickly about their UK mortgage book.  I mean, it's evident, from that document you just gave me last night, they were at least thinking "Well, here we have this mortgage book if we could sell that we would ... that would generate capital also".  So we had a sense that the co-operation could have been better.  We pushed, eventually it happened.  Had we been able ... had we had the advantage of time, that Polish asset could probably have been sold three days - two or three years later for a good deal more.  But we didn't have that advantage.</p></speech>

It's the document that recommends the burning of bondholders - senior bondholders - in all of the six institutions to the Government at that time.  I think the eligible senior debt they estimate across the six banks was &euro;16.367 billion that was up for burning.  It goes on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	[Given that] fact that the markets are expecting and have priced in burden sharing with subordinate and senior debt,<br /><br />it is the recommendation of the NTMA that, subject to a view being taken by Government on the potential implications of an adverse reaction from the external authorities and the implementation of an appropriate legal framework, immediate steps should be taken following the announcement of the PCAR/PLAR results to enable burden sharing with both senior and subordinated debt. </blockquote> <p>Can I ask you a particular question?  Given that the NTMA is responsible for ensuring the country stays in the market and that our funding under the programme would have been exhausted at the end of 2013 and a requirement on us to be back in the markets by mid-2013 ... in your view, how was the NTMA recommending burning senior bondholders while at the same time knowing that they would have to be back in the markets within two years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#MM01200"><p>Actually, it might have been three ... two and a half.  And the reason for that is that you know the Johnny Logan song "What's Another Year?", well, we had a thing called the Johnny Logan working group, which was to find from our own resources an extra year of funding and we actually found that we could probably generate quite a little ... quite a lot.  Maybe not a full year of funding, but we could find ways to extend the funding of the State beyond the end of ... of 2013.  Now, that was important because, even in 2011, people were starting to say well how are they going to be able to fund in 2014?  The answer is we were already working on that.  It ... it started you know, we had plans, we would have been able to ... we would have been able to extend the moneys we were getting from the programme.  That's ... that's ... so ... so we weren't quite so ... quite so pressed as you might suggest.  But okay, so there ... a few months at least of extra funding was potentially available.</p> <p>  Now, why would the NTMA suggest this?  Well, the ... the suggestion was that if we could reduce our debt by a few billion arising from this exercise - in other words give less capital to banks, reduce debt a little bit - that would improve our overall situation in such a way as to make us a little bit more of a ... a good bet for the market in terms of giving us money.  The downside was that if you want to continue to get funds from your funding partners, then they had to be on board.  And, in the final analysis, I think the Government's view was that actually, they should certainly or would be anxious to burn the senior bondholders in the banks that are not going to survive.</p></speech>

And my particular question was that the NTMA were supporting the burning of senior bondholders while at the same time being of the view that they would be able to access money from the ... the international money markets within a number of years.  That the case wasn't that we'd be shut out for a period for an extended period.  Would that be a true reflection of what the NTMA were arguing at the time?</p></speech>

It was a stopgap arrangement, it wasn't a ... a permanent arrangement.  So I don't think there is any ... any conflict between those two positions.</p></speech>

Of course there remained differences arising from differences in the economic forecasts, but the basic thrust was generally acceptable to them. </blockquote><p>Can you clarify that to ... for the committee that the memorandum of understanding that was drawn up between the troika and the Government, it was based mainly on Irish Government proposals?</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff, in your statement, on page 2008 or 208 - 2008, Freudian slip there - 208 you say, "I had spoken to the Minister during the summer [this is the summer of 2010] about the necessity to make greater upfront fiscal adjustments for 2011, and to announce them early."  You go on to say that at a gathering of senior civil servants in September or early October you outlined the issues and "demanded their active participation in the adjustment processes that would be required."  Is this the "be a hero speech" that you're referring to in terms of your address to the civil servants that is referenced in the documents that you attached?</p></speech>

And then you pose a question where you say "in four years' time we'll look back and we'll ask ourselves what type of character we were in a crisis, be a hero".  It is five year's time since that speech was delivered.  Mr. Cardiff, the question I have to you is were you a hero during that period?  And is that ... is the actions of these heroes what the Irish public expected in budget 2011 when you were asking them to think the unthinkable, which included cuts to child benefit, to social welfare, the introduction of USC, cuts to the carers' allowance, disability cuts, cuts to the blind, cuts to the minimum wage?  Was that the type of heroic actions that the Irish public expected from their heroes?</p></speech>

If you read what I said, I said get into it, deliver the best services you can, with less money, because we had less money, there was no choice about that.  We had less money.  We had two possibilities at that point; either the country could go bankrupt ... three possibilities ... either the people would continue to lend to us, in which case we could continue to provide services, but nobody would lend to us based on the level of fiscal adjustment that had been planned up to the middle of that year.  There had to be more or we would have no lenders ... no market lenders.</p> <p>  The second possibility was that we would have to seek assistance from the EU and IMF, and it was fairly clear at that point that they also would require very substantial fiscal adjustments, therefore, we would have no choice there.  And the third possibility was that we would cease to be able to fund ourselves at all, in which case our fiscal adjustment would have had to be, instead of being of the order of 4% or 5% of GDP, it would have to have been of the order of the entire scale of our deficit, which in 2011, even without the adjustment, was around about 10% of GDP.  So, that would have meant cuts and tax increases of &euro;16 billion, even before we'd taken account of the negative buoyancy effect, so even more.</p> <p>  We, you know ... look, I also said in that speech that at that time our ... the scale of our deficit was about the budget, I think, of the education and health sector combined.  That's what we had to find.  Without fiscal adjustment, without cuts that really hurt people, we would have had to do an awful lot more.  And even if it was a dreadful situation for us to find ourselves in, it was a situation in which people a whole lot more vulnerable than the people making the decisions would suffer, but the alternative was a decision ... was a non-decision approach where we would let worse things happen.  So that's what I was saying and when I was telling people to fight, I meant it.  They had to get out there and find ... I mean if we were going to have that much less money, I wanted people to be out there finding the ... fighting to improve the services, to do the best they could for their citizens within that.  I don't think that's wrong.</p></speech>

There were real heroes, people who worked through illness, worked through stress, worked through family difficulties, who really kept going.  So I'm not classifying myself with them, but there were real heroes, there were people who ... there were real sufferers but there were real heroes and I saw them.  I saw people, you know, in about 2010 I had a series of transfers in the Department in 2011, some of them were just purely because the people concerned were at the end of their physical endurance.  So ... and there were the same in other Departments too and the same even in banks, you know, because they had to be rescued and they had to saved too, so I mean, I saw heroes.  I'm not going to start naming them, and I'm not saying I was one, but I did see them, they were there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.821" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#NN01600"><p>There was a lot of merger options considered and the real problem, Senator, was that no one of them was really sound enough to take the others on.  You see, what you hope when you do a merger is if you take, say, a bank that's reasonably well capitalised but is short on funding, and you put it into a bank that has plenty of funding but may need the capital, you have a synergy there that really works, but there didn't seem to be a strong enough case for doing that, especially since you would lose time and effort in the merger arrangements.  There was a significant ... I think the most likely merger that didn't happen, if you like, was between ILP and EBS, in part because EBS had access ... EBS had a set-up of what they call a covered bond bank, so it had a mode of funding which ILP did not have, and ILP had a very high loan-to-deposit ratio and this might have helped.  But, to be honest, as things went on, it seemed clear that first of all EBS's loan-to-deposit ratio itself wasn't so healthy and it was not big enough to create a big difference for ILP and even covered bonds, in other words secured bonds, were getting hard to issue, so at that stage, I think people just said, "Well, look, there's not much more to pursue here."  So it ... it mostly was because there were no marriages of institutions that looked like it would make a stronger couple than they were as individuals.</p></speech>

The idea was to deleverage the sector and to have a couple of pillar banks.</p><p>The place where there is the most disagreement, if you like, was on ILP, where some parts of the troika wanted to wind it up on the basis that, look, it was hanging out there and it was a bit vulnerable, and, you know, let's be a bit macho now and just close it down.  And others were saying, well, like ... for example, the competition people in the European Commission were saying, "But hang on now, we're here, we're supposed to protect competition, and if you do that you only have two banks in ... each with a huge retail franchise in Ireland, so let's keep it going."  And we were towards that side.  But since ... since ... so we didn't have to fight too hard since they were fighting with each other on that particular point, so ILP survived in part, despite the advice of some parts of the troika, and ... even in the ... because I was interviewed recently by the IMF evaluators, evaluating their own programme, and they were ... this was one of the points they were focusing on.  Shouldn't we really have got rid of ILP?  So those kinds of discussions did happen, yes.</p></speech>

If you knew that interest rates would be 3% or 4% as opposed to at 6%, then you might have been much more tempted earlier.  If you remember, we went in at about the 6% interest rate and then they were negotiated down, and then the Greek thing came along and that helped even more.  So, the first discussions ... I mean, they're quite early, but there were discussions on reducing the interest rate even in the spring of 2011, so very soon after the start we were back saying, "Look, you should think about this."  And actually, I remember, in March 2011, Minister Noonan's first contact with Mr. Rehn.  Mr. Rehn was quite positive.  He was saying, "Yes, well, let's see if we can get you a reduced interest rate."  But we didn't know that up front.  We assumed we could do some negotiation on it, but if he knew he had a 4% interest rate when the Government was being charged 6% or 7% in the market, you might have ... it would have changed the calculus a little bit.  We might have been more tempted to go in earlier, yes.</p></speech>

Now, he will give evidence to say that part of the reason he made the phone call on that day was that the previous day had seen an outflow of &euro;900 million of retail deposits, by far the largest daily figure before or since.  Do you remember that figure and do you remember whether there was concern about that figure or that whole question?</p></speech>

I would have almost certainly have been hearing the total number, if not the retail number, and it was very large.</p></speech>

My electronic files show ... I was subsequently involved over the next twenty minutes or so in preparing a revised draft of the statement which set out its intended scope.</p> <p>  I wonder if you can explain to us why there was, in existence, at such an early stage, a press release that said a guarantee has been agreed, when in fact people were still in ... still with the Taoiseach, having the conversation about whether there would be a guarantee.</p></speech>

I had nothing to do with that at the time, so I just don't know.  I can only speculate, and the speculation would be that ... two possibilities, either the Central Bank had in mind, before the meeting started, the possibility that there would be a guarantee, or else they communicated in the course of the meeting, but I simply don't know.</p></speech>

So, you never saw those drafts, is that ... am I correct in understanding that - the drafts that Mr. Beausang has provided?</p></speech>

But Mr. Beausang was there, so he could have been guiding the drafting with me.  I mean, when I was passing drafts back and forth, he might well have been involved, so.</p></speech>

Now, in that original draft it said the Government guarantee will remain in place initially for six months.  Obviously, that's not what materialised at the end.  Do you recall whether there was an agreement or a suggestion of a six-month guarantee, and at what point it might have changed to a two-year guarantee, which was what was in the final statement?</p></speech>

I don't think it's ... my memory is not exactly like that but it's not a complete fabrication at all.  Remember, we didn't know that night that the guarantee would work, so, almost immediately one would ... one would have been thinking, what's next?  What's the next thing?  And if you look, even at my notes, there's a suggestion.  Mr. Doyle asked the Taoiseach, you know, what about such and such a measure, I think swaps, and the Taoiseach says,"Yes, get that prepared", and then he says, "And what about [you know] NPRF?", in other words, getting the ... throwing more public money into them, and the Taoiseach said something like, you know, "Prepare it but don't do it yet."  So there was a sense that this was the thing we were doing tomorrow, but it mightn't be the last thing.</p></speech>

So why do you think that letter was sent and why do you think the threat, for want of a better phrase, on possibly withdrawing the ELA support for the banks, why was that so explicit and why did the letter have to be sent, if all of this was in train anyway?</p></speech>

You know, like one of those little ... when you throw a weight with a string on the end of it over an edge, you know, it falls but everything attached to it falls too with increasing momentum, so they were afraid of the contagion effect of Irish difficulties on, first of all, Portugal but then on others.</p></speech>

If you could see, you know, if there was some particular thing about to happen that would change the trend, then you would say "Let's wait for that", but there wasn't.  The thing we had waited for all along in some one sense was the four-year plan, what became the national recovery plan, and the fiscal parameters of that but those had been known since October in the market and they hadn't done the trick.  The problem was that even if the market was saying "Okay that's a good effort by Ireland, we could trust that", they had to look at it against the international backdrop, which was getting worse and worse.</p></speech>

The interest rate on the official programme, the bailout, 5.8%, was that higher than the Government expected at the time?  Certainly there was a letter from the Governor on 21 November when these issues were emerging and at that time he was stating that the interest rate looks like it would be higher than expected.  The NTMA subsequently said 5.8% was not unreasonable.  So to what extent was it a negotiable element of the programme?  The IMF element appears to have been pretty fixed, the European side perhaps less so.  So to what extent was there an actual negotiation on the interest rate?</p></speech>

The Minister had done some talking to other Ministers in the Eurogroup and so forth, so far as I know.  It was fairly clear there was not much shift on that.  So the focus was on other things.  But even in the memo for Government saying "Let's join this programme", there was a line saying "and by the way, the interest rate could be lower and we are going to continue working on that".  And there was, you know, people were making approaches as early as February, I think February, certainly March ... of the ... of the following month.  We almost succeeded and it would have been a pity because, in fact, we got an even bigger reduction than we had been looking for or than we had been hoping for, let's say, in July.  So in a sense, the little bit of delay helped.  We also had in mind, I mean, we talk about other people being cynical, we were a bit cynical ourselves.  We also had in mind that if things got worse in other parts of Europe, the case for an interest rate reduction for those other parts of Europe would be much stronger than for Ireland even and that we would be able to piggy-back on that, which is more or less what happened.</p></speech>

I think in the late summer probably.  We were ... a low point in terms of ... initiative was in probably summer 2010.  We had done an awful lot of work, which seemed to be paying dividends in the late spring-early summer and then the - late spring - and then the sovereign crisis accelerated and seemed to be unravelling all the work.  We were sort of stuck there and the Government was a bit at a loss I think too.  Well, what next, what haven't we done?  The answer was, well we haven't produced for the market and for the public a picture of how we are going to progress over the next four or five years and perhaps that would produce some credibility to the Government's actions.  So it was in the course of that summer, I can't remember exactly when, but I do recall taking aside one or two technically very able officials and saying "Guys, can we produce this, do we have the skills to do this?"  They said "sure", so we said "Okay, well start."  Then the Minister would have been much more involved in it because it was becoming more of a product into September and October.  But we were talking about it with Europe and so forth a little bit, even in September so it was clearly in train by then.</p></speech>

The 30% discount.  It's not that ... you know, in a sense that was ... that was a problem.  We might have been much better to say nothing about what the discount was going to be and just do the work because we ended up disappointing both the public and the market and it would have been, you know, in terms of a single thing, we were trying to create a credibility as to our actions, as well as, you know, as well as the impacts of the NAMA process itself, which were positive.  We were trying to add to our credibility and our status in the market so as to be able to continue borrowing from it and, actually, the continuing ... continued worsening of the NAMA discounts over that year were actually sucking the credibility away from us rather than enhancing it.  I got the opportunity a while ago to speak for about three minutes to a finance minister who was considering a bad bank and he said "what would you do different?"  I said "Don't, for goodness sake, predict the loan values until you know what they are going to be."</p></speech>

And I know you weren't directly involved in the telephone conversations that day with Frankfurt but what is your understanding of how far the ECB went on that day in conversation with the Taoiseach, with the Minster for Finance?  You make reference to a statement from the ECB that they wouldn't come out subsequently and support the banking strategy if the Government had gone ahead and imposed losses on senior bondholders, but did they say that emergency support would be withdrawn?

And we would have advocated ... I would have, had it been ... I mean, by the time I got to the job, it was fairly ... the policy line was fairly distinctly set out but we wanted, in what we were doing, to try and ensure that those silos would be capable of being overcome.  So, even in the legislation, you'll see things like a requirement for staff exchange between the two sides of the new structure.  You heard that they'd no economists in the regulator.  Well, I'm a bit surprised because we set it up so that there could be people moving from side to side within the regulator.  But every time we did something like that, there'd be a political instruction to do something else, so, you know, we did that but then ... I'm not sure is it directly in relation to that, but there's a political instruction to ensure that the chief executive of the regulator would have a legal entitlement to hire staff separately, off his own bat, separate from the overall organisation.  So, quite a lot of involvement in the legislation itself but, in my tenure later as a Secretary General, I didn't come across anything like that so with the particular change of Minister or the particular Ministers or the particular issues, they weren't as ... as hands-on on legislative change as was the case for this.  This was quite unusual.</p></speech>

But, at that point and this is a different thing, this is not the bailout, this is not the burden sharing, this is something different, this is back in 2008.  At that point we were anxious that the ECB would know that we had some stresses, because we wanted them to be positive in terms of the collateral they would accept from our banks.  In particular that, and because we wanted them ... we wanted to use them as the bellwether for whether there was anything else going on around Europe that might be of use to us.  So there was discussion, and I can say this quite explicitly because its ... I have notes to say so, explicitly there was discussion between a senior Central Bank official around about 17 September, and again around about the 28th, 29th ... the first case, Tony Grimes, who was the director general and at that point might still have been the acting governor, I'm not sure ... 28th, 29th the Governor.  And of course there would have been discussion at different levels in between, but explicitly two points at which you can say that the Irish Central Bank system was talking to the ECB and explicitly my notes say, and of course I'm getting this back from the Irish central bankers, not from ... not from having been at the meetings.  But explicitly, according to my notes, there was a discussion with Mr. Trichet on the 28th or 29th and he was told that in fact one of our banks was, you know, would be in difficulties within a matter of days.</p></speech>

Thank you, Senator.  Just a couple of matters.  Earlier, when I was speaking to you about the nature, the structure of the design of the banking guarantee and how ... what bearing it had, if any, with the State entering the bailout programme two years later.  Would it have possible to design the banking guarantee that would not have lead to a bailout?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#RR01000"><p>The bailout happened because the scale of our economic and fiscal difficulties, which were not caused by but seriously exasperated by our banking difficulties.  And the real issue was the cost within the banks, the cost of losses within the banks rather than the guarantee itself. We could've designed the guarantee differently in the ways that Professor Honohan has talked about, to make it more possible within Irish circumstances to burn bondholders earlier, especially to burn the senior bondholders earlier.  But from a policy point of view, and especially about what we learned later about the European reaction, that might not have been practically possible.  So, one could only speculate, Chairman, one might have, you know ... one might have saved a small number of billions here and there according to Professor Honohan, I'm sure he's right, but you might not have, and then would a small number of billions made it difficult ... made a difference to whether we went into the bailout or not.  Probably not.  But every ... but you have to assume that everything else being equal over a period of years where they might not have been.</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff, your period in the Department of Finance came to an end when you moved into the Court of Auditors.  Did you apply for this position, were you headhunted for it and was there resistance from the Department of Finance for you ... from you leaving to go to the Court of Auditors?</p></speech>

I thought about it for a couple of days and I said &quot;Yes&quot;.  The Minister of the day, current Minister, told me that he had not ... this was not his suggestion or initiative.  I suspect this because I had said to him some months before, not long after he joined the Department, I said to him, &quot;Look, physically speaking, I'm not sure I can keep going for five more years&quot;, which would have been my term.  In fact, I wasn't sure I could keep going for two more years at the current pace.  I might have ceased to be effective, so I had said to him, &quot;Look, you know, let's get you settled in, I'll stick with it for as long as you want, but you have to be aware that there's that issue.&quot;<br/><br/>So when the Taoiseach talked to me I thought maybe this was coming from the Minister, the Minister said &quot;No&quot;, not from him.  So ... but the timing, from my point of view, was reasonably good.  The Government was in ... was bedding down, they'd been there for six months, I would be still <i>in situ</i>for another four or five months.  The transition had happened, so it was, you know, it was positive.  I was quite positive also to the idea that we would have a, you know, that the Department could have a new Secretary General that was based ... that was selected from the broad universe of people available, which is what happened in effect.  In fact the job was thrown open worldwide and there was a real attempt globally to bring people into the, you know ... to have the best possible field.  So that's what happened, there's nothing sinister that I'm aware of.</p></speech>

Just a couple of brief questions.  Why even think about a bailout in 2008?

So why did it flash across your mind and then why did you act on it?</p></speech>

In April, the Governor of the Central Bank told the Minister that he thought we could be up next for a bailout.

Why didn't we react more quickly?  Well, at the time, we were still funding quite well in the markets so we didn't need an additional funder at that moment, and we didn't have any difficulty in the funding markets really until the end of the summer.  So, it would have been one you would file away as being potentially useful.  Really, the great thing is so long as you know the facility is there if you need it, or could be there if you need it, you don't need to exercise it.  The knowledge that it's there is very powerful in itself.  So, I think that it would just be a matter of timing after that, Deputy.</p></speech>

And you provided a memo to us written on 15 October 2008 in which you write to the NTMA, the regulator and Central Bank, the Attorney General and the Department, and you say:</p> <blockquote> 	I think we need to think about  	A. What recapitalisations might be required<br /><br />B. What consolidations might be required<br /><br />C. Whether any nationalisations might be required  </blockquote> <p>You say that at the time, it was simply clear that the guarantee would need to be supplemented by other efforts and we may as well get started or restarted.  And that was October 2008.  And then when you go to the memorandum of understanding for the bailout, you have recapitalisations, consolidations and quasi-nationalisations and you've got a four-month timeline to complete those.  So what was happening in the two years then from guarantee to bailout that prevented that work from happening that you then implemented very quickly once the bailout was agreed?</p></speech>

I mean, the ... excuse me, you ... the committee's request ... instruction to me to attend arrived before I'd done the capitalisation chapter but, basically, between 2000 and ... well, from ... okay, phases - and I'll go through them very quickly because I know you ... the second ... the last quarter of 2008, engagement with the banks - a lot of it - on whether and what capital they need and, more importantly, on whether there's private sector capital available, so ... and there was a lot of people around to claim they had money available but in the end none of them delivered.  First half of ... first quarter of 2009, Anglo nationalisation, actual recap work going on and the first engagements on NAMA.  The second half of ... second quarter and third quarter of 2009, great deal of effort on NAMA and more work on recap.  That work ... work on NAMA, in particular, goes into the end of 2009.  2010 we're saying, "Look, time to take stock," big effort on stress tests and so forth, PCAR, and, again, just see ... and an effort to see if the recap effort is sufficient.  For AIB, it turns out not.  More work on Anglo as the Anglo book gets going.  So 2010, April-May, two good months, April in particular.  Work on private capital for Bank of Ireland, down to their own efforts as much as to the public effort.  May, sovereign crisis starts - coping with that through the summer.  Then implications of that four-year plan start.  There wasn't a moment when we weren't working on it pretty hard.  Maybe the consolidations was the only thing that you would accelerate because, remember, the recaps happened as the information became available.  Consolidations could have happened earlier but I'm not sure it would have made much difference.</p></speech>

I know you're anxious to get going, so just very briefly.  You spoke there to Senator Barrett in relation to the nationalisation of Anglo, in particular, and why didn't it happen on the night.  You had said to us that you had a preference for that - it didn't pan out.  In his report, Mr. Honohan said, "it is hard to argue that the delay of five months in eventually nationalising Anglo had a major financial impact."  Are you able to put a number on what cost you think would have been saved or is far too much made of this issue?</p></speech>

It may be that too much is made of it, but what might have been saved is the ... I'd have to ... no, I'd have to go into areas that we're not supposed to go in.  There was a reputational problem at the end of that year for Anglo.  That caused a reputational problem for the whole country.  That might have been saved.</p></speech>

Just one very final issue, and it's just to clear up with regard to your engagement with the inquiry last week.  And on page 16 of the transcript of your engagement with us, you went on to say that "Anglo passed us in a document about themselves."  Now, being mindful of matters that are taking place outside of this committee room and so forth, would it be possible for you to elaborate as to what the key message of that was and to elaborate as to when you actually received it, or not?  And mindful of other matters, yes.</p></speech>

It was received in the Department and I ... when I was talking to the PAC, I was a little bit confused about it so I surmised and then I turned out to be wrong, so I won't surmise.  Certainly, it came in in the middle of September, maybe towards the 18th, 19th, 20th, in around then.  The document itself is in the PAC records, so it's not ... it's available to you.  I don't recall what's in it much except that it was a relatively upbeat view of their current position.</p></speech>

In essence, this related to putting in place, in the Statute Book, the regulatory framework applying to financial institutions.  In practice, this primarily involved my unit participating in the negotiation and transposition into Irish law of what was at the time described as an avalanche of EU financial service directives, under the EU financial services action plan or FSAP.  The FSAP was designed to put in place a common pan-EU framework for the regulation of the financial sector.  This was considered essential to building a single market in financial services in the EU and promoting the provision of financial services on a cross-border basis.  Each of the directives was the outcome of an extended period of expert analysis and debate at the EU level.  The process involved in advanced ... in addition to finance ministries, the European Commission, committees of the EU financial supervisors and intensive consultation with industry representatives.  The financial service directives were regarded and represented as embodying cutting-edge modern models and approaches to financial regulation, such as the state-of-the-art Basel II accord for banks, which I'll say a little bit more about later.</p> <p>  The existence and presumed full implementation of this detailed and comprehensive EU regulatory framework, endorsed at EU level by all member states and supervised domestically by the Financial Regulator, provided very substantial reassurance to the Department as to the safety and soundness of individual institutions and indeed, of the stability of the domestic financial system as a whole.  Once this EU-determined regulatory framework had been put in place in legislation by the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator was responsible for implementing and enforcing it and supervising the financial firms to which it applied.  The legislation establishing the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the EU regulatory framework did not provide the Minister of Finance with any statutory role in overseeing or scrutinising the Financial Regulator's performance or the exercise of its supervisory functions and responsibilities.</p><p>Strict supervisory independence was a key principle internationally, such as under the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.  The concept of supervisory independence was also central to the design of the EU framework for financial regulation.  The authoritative expert consensus at the time was that banking supervisors should benefit from the same high degree of independence as central bankers.  It was therefore integral to my area of the Department's relationship with the Financial Regulator that we should not take any significant action or step which could interfere or encroach on that strict supervisory independence.  This was essential to rule out any scope for any perception of political interference in financial regulation and supervision, given the major conflicts of interest that might potentially arise.  Any perceived breach of that principle would certainly have given rise to major concerns at regulatory authority level, given the authority's statutory mandate.  In addition, the professional secrecy obligations under which the Financial Regulator operated, set out in EU and domestic law, prohibited the disclosure of information held by the Financial Regulator by virtue of the exercise of its statutory role and responsibilities.  This was a very wide non-disclosure provision.<br/><br/>The strict independence conferred on the Central Bank under the CBFSAI legislation, and the EU treaties as part of the Eurosystem, created an identical dynamic in terms of my area's responsibilities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Central Bank on financial stability matters.  The stability of the financial system was a core function of the Central Bank under national legislation and the EU statute establishing the European system of central banks.  My unit in the Department did not therefore have any legal mandate or statutory role which would have permitted it to seek to critically assess or second-guess the Central Bank's assessments of the financial conditions and the capital buffers available to the banks to deal with economic shocks, as set out in the Central Bank's financial stability reports during the relevant period.  <br/><br/>Against this backdrop, the Basel II accord provided what proved to be entirely unwarranted reassurance to the Department that the supervisory, prudential and financial stability systems in the CBFSAI were operating effectively.  Basel II was the detailed and comprehensive regulatory regime for determining capital requirements and carrying out bank supervision introduced under the EU capital requirements directive or CRD.  The CRD was officially adopted by member states in June 2006 to enter into force from the start of 2007.  The very substantial programme of work in both the Financial Regulator and the credit institutions involved in transitioning to compliance with the CRD is evidenced, for example, by the extensive consultation documentation issued by the Financial Regulator in October 2006.  Basel II and the CRD were characterised as modernising and making capital requirements for banks more robust, comprehensive and risk-sensitive, fostering enhanced risk management in credit institutions, as well as strengthening financial stability overall.  However, as early as February 2009 the high-level group on financial supervision in the EU, commissioned by the President of the Commission to make proposals to strengthen European supervisory arrangements, concluded that the international banking crisis heightened the need for a fundamental review of the Basel II CRD framework.  The high-level group concluded that Basel II underestimated some important risks and overestimated banks' ability to handle them, that the Basel methodology seemed to have been disproportionately based on recent past economic data and good liquidity conditions and that these mistakes led to too little high-quality capital being held by the banks.<br/><br/>In summary, from my perspective the sophisticated and technically complex modelling of banks' risks and reliance on risk weightings based on assessments by external credit rating agencies to determine capital requirements under Basel II helped contribute to an entirely misplaced confidence in the capital adequacy of banks and the efficacy of bank supervision, even as the liquidity crisis intensified.  Indeed one regulatory expert in his evidence to the UK parliamentary commission on banking standards characterised Basel II as &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;.  It contributed to a situation where bank supervision seems to have essentially comprised an administrative procedure to review systems and processes for the management of risk put in place by the banks themselves.  According to the Nyberg report, prudential supervision comprised tick-box checks that formal procedures were in place, not checks on how they operated in practice.  The false sense of security engendered by the CRD was compounded by the outcome of the stress tests reported in the Central Bank's financial stability reports.  These extreme but plausible scenarios appeared to show that even if a hard rather than a soft landing occurred for the property market, capital buffers in the bank were adequate.  <br/><br/>I turn now to contingency planning in the period 2005 to 2006.  Financial stability planning carried out in my unit involved the development of contingency plans for any Government intervention required to resolve an individual financial institution in distress or stabilise the banking system as a whole.  There are a number of distinct strands to this work stream in my area of the Department over the period from mid-2005 onwards and an important focus of our work, at least initially, was in reviewing the Central Bank's crisis management manual, the black or red book, and reviewing the case for putting in place a corresponding manual for the Department.  It also encompassed a first assessment of the many legal issues that arose in relation to the successful resolution of a distressed financial institution.  This included consideration in particular of the legal issues involved in facilitating a market solution, where a large overseas bank might be encouraged to take over a distressed, at risk, domestic institution.  It also identified the need to review the legal framework for crisis management, and examine the legal powers that should comprise part of the public authority's toolbox where intervention was required to support an individual institution or the banking system as a whole.  There was also a significant EU dimension to this work at the EU financial services committee, at which the Department of Finance was represented at second secretary general level, relating to arrangements for responding to the failure of a cross-border financial institution.  A critical backdrop to this work throughout 2005 and 2006 was that the Financial Regulator consistently and strongly highlighted to the Minister and the Department that the credit union movement represented the most significant risk to financial stability in Ireland during ... at that time.  In light of the Financial Regulator's assessment of national financial stability risk, in the Department we prioritised the assessment of the credit union sector and undertook and completed a major programme of work to review, assess and respond to the various issues and concerns raised.  In parallel we continued to progress broader financial stability planning, tracking developments and recommendations at EU level.  <br/><br/>Turning to financial stability planning in 2007 and 2008, in terms of broader financial stability planning, an important focus in 2007 was aligning national planning with developments at EU level, given the growth in the cross-border provision of financial services and following participation in the EU crisis simulation exercise in April 2006.  A key next step flowing from deliberations at EU level was the establishment of a national ... of national domestic standing groups, on which work commenced in the Department in the last quarter of 2006.  This led to the formal establishment of the DSG, comprising representatives of the Department, the Financial Regulator, and the Central Bank in July 2007.  The DSG played a crucial role from August 2007 with the onset of the liquidity crisis, ensuring that the Minister was fully informed of the Financial Regulator's and Central Bank's assessment ... assessments of financial conditions and the funding pressures on the banking system.  The stringent confidentiality requirements that I've already referred to would otherwise have seriously inhibited communication between the public authorities and this crucial information flow from Dame Street to Merrion Street.  The DSG was a forum for communication and information exchange.  It provided the basis for multiple reports to the Minister and Government on financial conditions, many of which are in the public domain.  The DSG did not have a decision-making role, nor did it have any joint mandate in relation to the distinct and differentiated responsibilities of the organisations participating on it.  <br/><br/>As the crisis intensified in 2008, and as foreseen by the governing documents for the DSG, management of the crisis migrated to the top management level in the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance, with the NTMA involved from end-2007 and increasingly prominent.  As set out in my written statement, from the autumn of 2007 we did seek to utilise the DSG to seek to develop the principles and agree a shared analysis and methodology that would better guide and inform crisis management on a co-ordinated basis among the public authorities.  This work did not progress significantly beyond the Department's February 2008 scoping paper on financial stability planning on account of, for example, the important differences in emphasis with the Central Bank's assessment, as reflected in the Central Bank's comments on the Department's scoping paper, and its own paper on resolution options circulated in June 2008, the Financial Regulator's evident preoccupation over that time with the resolution of the CFD-related share overhang issue in one institution and the Central Bank and Financial Regulator's enduring assessment that the crisis was exclusively attributable to international liquidity situation, and the consequent sole focus on supporting bank funding.</p><p>The Department, therefore, continued to prioritise over the period, the preparation of draft emergency legislation to nationalise a bank.  In early September 2008, this work was reorientated to taking a building society into public ownership on the basis of a major contribution from the office of the Attorney General, and, at a late stage, the Department's commercial legal advisers.  By end September 2008, our contingency planning advanced to the point that legislation to do either could be finalised for publication and enactment at very short notice.  The draft legislation also contained provisions to set aside competition law requirements to facilitate a market solution, provide financial assistance to credit institutions in the form of guarantees or capital, and provide the required legislative basis for the proposed secured liquidity scheme for bank funding.</p><p> In conclusion, my written statement and the supporting document I have submitted to the committee covers the foregoing issues, as well as those lines of inquiry which I have not referenced in this overview in considerably greater detail.  Thank you.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I suppose as things intensified, as the crisis intensified into September 2008, as I think other witnesses have mentioned, there was a real impetus to ensuring that we really reinforced the difficulties that we were experiencing at that time at European level.  Indeed, in work that I would have done, in a, sort of, scenario note that I would have done back in November 2007, I would have identified the possible requirement for an EU-level intervention to deal with the systemic difficulties that were arising in the Irish financial sector.  I mean, this was, kind of, presented as something, you know, what could happen next, what could happen ultimately in terms of how things were moving at that point in time?</p></speech>

So even at that stage, and reflecting the discussions that I know the Governor would have had with the president, even in advance of that, there was awareness that what we might need to stabilise the Irish financial system was an EU-level response, dealing with all the difficulties that were emerging.</p></speech>

I mean, you would have to ask the Governor, I suppose, at what stage, or look at his evidence as to what point he might have made that argument to the president, or indeed, did he ever make that point to the president?  I know at a much later stage, and I think I enclosed the document with my written statement, around 17 September or so, we had a meeting of the DSG, and one of the specific action points from the DSG was to alert the European authorities, the authorities in the ECB, as to our difficulties, and the significance of our difficulties at that time.</p></speech>

So there was a high degree of sensitivity and secrecy around our own work.  But more than that, I mean, there was a strong sense, and this probably reflected the work that had been done at EU level up to then, in looking at the issues that would arise if there was a failure in a cross-border financial institution, that there was a major ... I mean, all of the crisis management done at EU level related to this issue of, "Well, what about if a major European cross-border bank got into difficulties", and what arrangements would need to be put in place for what they used to, what was referred to, and what I'm sure is still referred to as "burden-sharing", where governments in different member states where that bank operated would get involved in resolving that, those issues.  So that was the focus of work at, kind of, in the, sort of, the EFC, that is the economic and financial committee, and the FSC, two high level European committees.  There was no sense of there, I mean, that was as far as that, there was a sense of any kind of EU response to difficulties in any particular member state, and that would arise if you were talking about a cross-border bank.  And it's interesting to make the point that, I mean, those kind of, that work stream I won't say broke down, but where it really got into difficulties was getting to a point with member states where there was any sense the member states were willing to agree, kind of, burden-sharing arrangements.  That was a step too far for most member states at that time.</p></speech>

I think what the Secretary General was asking me to do was make sure that we had more information on an option that was increasingly emerging as one of the options that would be put on the table whenever this thing came to a head.  I mean, I was reviewing, obviously, the paper trail myself, and what I established was that the power to actually provide a blanket guarantee in the contingency legislation only went in around then, around 25 or 26 September.  Up to then, there was a power to provide financial support to a distressed institution, but just a single institution, there wasn't a sense of that we were providing a power that could provide a broad blanket guarantee across the whole of the financial system.  So that gives some indication, I suppose, as to the point that the guarantee came very clearly, you know, was very formally on our radar or in our planning in terms of it being in the contingency legislation that was being developed at that time.  Up to then, it wasn't in the Bill.</p></speech>

So there was a nationalisation Bill prepared and more or less ready to go.  I mean, there would have been some ... some finalisation required if the Government decision had been to nationalise the ... any institution but the legislation was essentially ready.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#ZZ00300"><p>What ... well, I mean, I think it's ... it's quite clear that the ... given the systemic nature of the crisis that we were facing - and I think it's borne out in, certainly, the Nyberg report and the Honohan report - that allowing an institution to fail in those circumstances would have been catastrophic.  So ... obviously, in our planning we had looked, at different times, at the whole issue of winding down of a financial institution, at a special resolution ... a special resolution regime for the banks.  What we concluded was that there was huge, you know, technical, legal, policy, potentially constitutional difficulties in putting such a regime in place.  But, in any event, I think it's very important to make the point that, you know, the SS ... the SRR that's now in place - the Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act - it's explicitly set up on the basis that the resolution powers only ... only play out - are only available to be implemented - in a situation where the decision has been taken not to wind down the bank.  So the special resolution regime that we have from 2011 is explicit that the resolution powers - things like bridge banks, the transfer of liabilities and special manager and all that - those things only happen if the decision is made that the bank shouldn't be subject to an orderly wind-down.  So, I mean, that's important to, kind of, feed in to the discussion on the special resolution regime and proposals for orderly wind-down.</p></speech>

What's your view on that?</p></speech>

I mean, in talking about ... I mean, the fundamental issue and, I mean ... it's ... like, there's nothing new here, it's in the Nyberg report ... the fundamental issue, when you're looking at other options and whatever options were availed of, was senior bondholders, you know, the bail-in mechanisms and, I mean, as Nyberg himself said, you know, a special resolution regime, for example, that wouldn't have been a panacea at the time, unless costs are ... there was burden-sharing going to be achieved under that special resolution regime and, I mean, I don't need to go in with the committee all of the issues that have arisen around the non-availability of that option up until the new SRR or the new ... sorry, I won't remember offhand, but the new European-wide regime for banking resolution that came into effect relatively recently.  And, of course, as things stand, it's currently untested, so it remains to be seen how effective that kind of model will be or the impact it will have - once it is implemented - in terms of the cost of bank funding and so on.  So, it's a ... it's a very broad issue, I suppose, to consider.</p></speech>

I'd no direct discussions with Merrill Lynch or with the NTMA, I think, in advance of the guarantee coming into effect.</p><p>I mean, you know, personally at the time the guarantee was introduced, I wouldn't have had a kind of a deep knowledge or awareness of, let's say, the distinction between dated and undated subordinated debt.  And indeed, it was only subsequently when I was reporting to the European Commission to DG Competition in the context of our state aid application that I gathered information from the NTMA from an e-mail from Brendan McDonagh that I think I submitted with my written evidence and also presumably an oral briefing from Merrill Lynch that explained, I suppose, the market reason, the funding reason the sovereign reason why dated subordinated debt should be included and why that case should be made to the Commission for the inclusion of dated subordinated debt.  I wasn't present at any discussions on the 29-30 September where this was discussed.  If they were discussed at that meeting.</p></speech>

I suppose there was a sense that there was one opportunity to take a, you know, whatever step that might be to try to create greater confidence in the Irish financial system.  What I think, just to elaborate on that a little bit more.  I would have been conscious myself that at the time, the UK authorities provided guarantees for Northern Rock.  The guarantees over time extended into their capital structure.  Now they didn't extend as far as our guarantee did, but they did find themselves in a situation where they guaranteed the deposits first and then they had to move into, you know, wholesale funding and beyond.  So there was a sense that you wanted to avoid a situation with a guarantee.  I mean, if you are going to ... if you're going to take that approach, you want that approach to be as impactful as possible and not find yourself in a situation where you are tweaking it at a later stage because that would obviously damage your credibility.</p></speech>

I was working on the legislation at that time so, you know, it's clear from the attendance list at those meetings I wasn't at them.  So I wasn't party to discussion.  I mean, one of those ... one of the meetings was a meeting where Merrill Lynch gave a presentation on resolution options or the state of the Irish financial ... the Irish banking system, whatever.  I wasn't at that meeting and I think there was maybe another meeting in the Central Bank which obviously I have seen reports of subsequently but I wasn't present.</p></speech>

I was present for the first phase of the discussions.  I think Kevin Cardiff's note, there's a sort of a segment of the meeting where Jim Farrell the chair of the Financial Regulator comes in and makes the case for the guarantee and then the discussion extended, you know, there was sort of a broader discussion about other options that were there.  The nationalisation option being the main one, I suppose.  And at that point, you know, looking at that hand written note at that phase of the meeting, I left the meeting because there was some preparation to be done.  What was clear was that contingency arrangements needed to be put in place for the Central Bank, perhaps to provide ELA to the institutions the next day and that would only happen ... the Central Bank will only lend if they have a guarantee, a Government guarantee of that lending or, as it turned out because we wouldn't have had power to give a guarantee for that lending at that point, what they looked for was a letter of comfort saying that any losses on that lending would be made good by the State.  So that's what I was involved in, in just putting together ... or perhaps talking to the director general of the bank as to what was the specific language required.  But that was part of the contingency planning that was required at that point, Senator.</p></speech>

Can I ask, in your opening statement you mentioned Basel II framework was expected to foster stability in the EU, financial system by strengthening incentives for banks to conduct sound risk modelling and managing and by involving supervisors more directly in the review of banks' risk profiling, the risk management practice and risk bearing capacity.  With the benefit of hindsight and everything that has happened, how did Basel II incentivise conduct in risk management practices?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1000" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#BBB00200"><p>You see Basel II created a whole infrastructure, a whole industry, there was a Basel II industry around applying what was ... I mean maybe a good illustration of the complexity that was involved in Basel II; the original Basel I framework I think is described is 30 pages long, the second one is well over 300 and is, you know, hugely complex, technical, based on what was considered, at the time, best practice in terms of risk modelling, credit assessment and so on.</p> <p>  I think part of the difficulty was that from, obviously from the banks' perspective - to the extent that they paid any attention to this - but certainly from the regulator's, that as sometimes happens with all kinds of models, the model itself becomes the oracle in terms of whether something is working, is perceived to be working, or otherwise, rather than, as I'm sure people more expert to talk about Basel II would tell you, that it's meant to be just an aid to decision making or to the exercise of supervisory judgment.</p> <p>  But, I mean, it's important to make the point that when you talk about Basel II that it wasn't just a kind of technical modelling exercise.  There was three pillars to it and one of the most ... the second pillar to it was what was called the supervisory review.  It was characterised by the IMF in June 2008 as the heart and soul of the framework, which adds a solid layer of supervisory judgment to more rules-based approach of pillar 1.  That's the modelling piste.  It's built around principles that define roles and responsibilities of banks and their supervisors in the assessment of capital adequacy which include, as well as go beyond, the risk covered in pillar 1.</p> <p>  So, Basel I envisaged that you'd have this modelling and you'd have this sophisticated risk management systems but you'd also have supervisors assessing whether the modelling of risk was capturing all the risks in the institutions.  But, I mean, it's absolutely clear, although I don't have direct knowledge of it, that the time, energy and resources in the Financial Regulator in just putting that model in place in a small country - you would have heard in talking to the people from the FR, you know, their staff resources, the limits on staff resources - it was a huge exercise, and in the banks themselves.  And I think that point is made, either in the Honohan report or the Nyberg report that, as far as the banks were concerned, the risk management experts were taken off the day-to-day assessment of the risks the banks were carrying, to help create this infrastructure that the banks would need going forward to be competitive in capital markets, you know, under the Basel framework.</p></speech>

But certainly and ... I mean, it comes across very strongly from the work that the UK commissioned on banking standards did, that they concluded that ... and this was in their report on the failure of HBOS, they say, and this is a parliamentary committee:</p> <blockquote> 	The requirements of the Basel II framework not only weakened controls on capital adequacy by allowing banks to calculate their own risk-weightings, but they ... distracted supervisors from concerns about liquidity and credit; they may also have contributed to the appalling supervisory neglect of asset quality. </blockquote> <p>So that's in a bigger country with a much better-resourced supervisory body and that's the conclusion they're coming to in terms of the impact of Basel II on the efficacy of financial supervision over that period and in relation to the different supervisory approach that it encouraged, where as I said, supervisors were encouraged to review the model not to review the risks.</p></speech>

I mean, you know, in terms of what the Department ultimately has to do, which is advise Minister and advise Government, that works through the hierarchy, the management system, and those views are then represented, or those options are then represented, to the Minister.  I mean, in terms of my area of responsibilities in the Department, I'd no direct interaction with any individual in the Department, or, indeed, in the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator, that was articulating strongly very contrarian views around where the banking system was or where the economy was, more generally.  But, I mean, in terms of my responsibilities, my focus was very much on financial regulation and the stability of the banks rather than the broader macroeconomic framework, which was the responsibility of another area of the Department.</p></speech>

In your time, have you ever experienced, or during this critical period, was there an undue political influence which determined the direction of policy?</p></speech>

I mean, I think, in the Department ... I mean, because I had worked as an economist on the economic side in the late 90s, and, at that time, we were writing papers warning about the risk of a hard landing.  So you could imagine that there was a, sort of, I think, a loss of credibility in the ability of the Department, and certainly ... and I can't say because I'm not part of the political system, but I mean, in a scenario where, at that point in the economic cycle, the Department is saying there's big risks here now, house prices are taking off, credit is taking off, the fact that then the economy rolls forward and performs very strongly and shows ... and demonstrates a capacity to grow, you know, into the early 2000s, you know, quite sustainably, at a rapid pace, you can imagine that there was a certain scepticism around the Department's ability to call the economy correctly, even maybe within the Department itself.</p> <p>  Maybe to elaborate on that a bit more, I mean, when I first joined the Department in 1990, there was a designated economic service, and part of that work would have looked at things like, you know, longer term or medium-term economic forecasts, but, as we moved towards EMU, and moved into EMU, that kind of resource, increasingly, was looking at meeting the, kind of, governance requirements around our membership of EMU, things like the Stability and Growth Pact, and the kind of fiscal forecasting that was involved in ... that was required in that context.  So, I mean, you know, at a point in time in the Department, there was ... it was somebody's job to worry about the current account of the balance of payments, which would have reflected the flows of finance into the State.  You know, by the time the new century came around, and with our membership of EMU, and the fact that the monetary policy division of the Department, that would have been very involved in looking at monetary factors in the run-up team, you know, the fact that that had been recast as what, essentially, was my area, the financial regulation area, meant that there was a significant diminution of expertise in the Department at that ... you know, like, at that time, and it's ability to maybe call issues. As you know, more generally, as you probably heard from other witnesses ... I mean, kind of, macroeconomic modelling or forecasting ... I mean, the financial sector was, kind of, ignored in that work in a lot of instances, and that there wasn't a realisation maybe more broadly amongst the economics profession of the importance of monetary factors in assessing, you know, the current economic state.</p></speech>

Mr. Beausang, you're welcome.  On page 3 of your opening statement, Mr. Beausang, you state, "The model of 'principles-led' 'risk-based' supervision was set out in IFSRA's Strategic Plan."  Section 5.4, you also state, "We knew that IFSRA&rsquo;s supervisory approach was, therefore, strongly underpinned by a comprehensive system of technical regulation encompassing specific rules, regulations, codes and the supervisory powers necessary for their implementation."  And this is a question that I put to other witnesses, Mr. Beausang.  Why did the Irish principles/rules-based regulation, which was similar to other EU countries' rules-based regulation, fail so much worse than those other countries who had similar regulatory systems?</p><p>This is a question I have put to other witnesses Mr. Beausang.

We put in place those rules, that was our job.  As I outlined in my witness statement and in my overview, we took, as far as prudential regulations were concerned, consumer protection legislation was done and it was obviously a domestic initiative but we took these models of financial regulation.  They were carefully worked through by experts in Brussels, committees of financial supervisors, significant consultation with industry.  We took those models, having negotiated those models and those models had been agreed by all member states and put them in place.  It was then the responsibility of the Financial Regulator to implement the regulation and to supervise the banks in the manner that those regulations suggested.  So the contrast that is often drawn is between the approach taken in Ireland and let's say the approach taken in Spain.  Although I couldn't say this definitively, in broad terms they were operating the same framework, they were operating the same pan-EU framework of financial regulation.  Of course they had their own difficulties in Spain eventually but the Spanish regulator is seen and the Spanish central bank is seen to have been more intrusive and having people on the ground in the banks rather than as occurred in Ireland.  So that is the conclusion I would come to as to why things were disproportionately worse here.  Apart from the conduct of the banks which is a separate issue there were significant supervisory failures as documented in Nyberg and as documented in the Honohan report.</p></speech>

The Department's involvement then, on my area of the Department, in looking at the banks specifically, is actually very specific and looking at the regulatory structures itself, the responsibility for the legislation that we have, but it's also then the planning for a difficulty but we don't have a role and we didn't have the information and we would have been precluded from getting the information that would have allowed us to make any independent assessment.  And I think it's Donal Donovan, in his book, makes the point that, I mean, the Department ... the Central Bank would certainly have given the Department short shrift, if it had arrived at its door, telling ... and I'm ... asking or requesting to get involved in financial stability analysis.  In my evidence in section 5.9, I go ... because I mean it's obviously a hugely legitimate question to ask, but I go through a range of issues which we took reassurance from in relation to banking ... in relation to the stability of the banking system.  I've mentioned already, yes ... I mentioned the Central Bank and IFSRA's legal mandate; I mentioned the regulatory framework that was put in place under Basel II; I mentioned that the Central Bank was part of a broader financial stability surveillance, as part of the euro system, as part of the ECB; there was the financial stability reports; There was the IMF, FSAP and the OECD reports; there was the favourable ratings from the Irish banks-----</p></speech>

In spring '08, the DSG was party to the drafting of legislation to provide for the nationalisation of a financial institution or the issuance of a guarantee by the Minister.  We see that the Attorney General provided levels of secrecy in relation to those that didn't go through the standard structures because of the importance of the legislation.  You discussed, with Senator MacSharry, the SSR legislation.  Why was the legislation not prioritised in 2007 - the special resolution regimes?</p></speech>

I can deal with that issue.  I already spoke to Deputy MacSharry's question on that issue.  I mean, our analysis at that time was that the legal difficulties involved, the constitutional difficulties involved, the policy difficulties involved in putting in place such a piece of legislation were ... were not surmountable.  I mean, we would have been breaking new ground at EU level in introducing that type of legislation.  So our analysis at the time was that a nationalisation Bill certainly achieved some of the important objectives of a special resolution regime, for example, by taking out the shareholders, by taking an institution into public ownership, by dealing with the moral hazard that would otherwise be there.  So, I mean, it was an analysis at that time that ... that the right approach was to prioritise nationalisation legislation rather than a piece of legislation that might not be technical ... technically achievable and, indeed, might not be implementable, in legal terms, because of the legal risks around it and the constitutional risks in-----</p></speech>

In terms of your question on the referendum, I mean, I know the Attorney General will be speaking to you in due course and he might be in a better position to advise on the constitutional issue.  I do recall very clearly that at the time that we put in place the first ... the emergency special resolution regime at the end of 2010, that there was a lot of concern at the time, and I think it was articulated in the Houses that the approach wasn't constitutional and, indeed, I think at the time the President referred it to the Council of State for a consultation but ultimately decided to sign the legislation into law.  So it wasn't ... it wasn't as if ... I mean, I think that ... that that demonstrates that there was a concern around constitutionality.</p></speech>

The DSG compromised a group of experienced officials.  How did the group fail to conclude that a serious banking crisis was on the rise and given the ... the following indicators?</p><p>The financial markets were warning from mid-2007 about the Irish loan book concentrations.  The reduced availability of liquidity to the financial institutions from late 2007 and the comments of the health of the Irish banks contradicted market sentiment.  Market sentiment was quite clear in terms of, in particular, Anglo and INBS, that their loan books were in a very poor state.  How did the DSG not predict the extent of which there was a serious problem coming down the tracks?</p></speech>

And, indeed, when people try to do this work and try to identify a series of indicators that works, or certainly seems to have some predictive value, what they're kind of identifying ... obviously high domestic credit growth and rapid growth in property prices is there, but they're also saying, "Oh, low economic activity or low bank profitability are issues as well."  So, I mean, it's not ... obviously, with speaking with the chief economist earlier today and I wasn't ... I didn't see his evidence but I mean it's ... I don't think economists really have much of a track record in successfully, or officials, in successfully predicting or forecasting recessions or economic collapses-----</p></speech>

The Financial Regulator had prudential access to the largest exposures.  That was subsequently shared with the Central Bank and CBFSAI, both of whom were party to the DSG with yourself.

I mean, obviously there was, presumably, a very significant engagement between the forecasting side, the economic analysis side of the Central Bank, and the forecasting side of the Department.  Because, you know, they'd be tick-tacking on their forecasts in the work that they were going on in that area.  From my perspective in the banking, finance and international division, we would've had little contact with the Central Bank, <i>per se</i>, maybe around issues like the national payments strategy, movement to e-payments and so on and so forth.  Our main interaction would've been with the Financial Regulator around the discharge of the various accountability requirements put in place in the legislation or the need for approval of the budget or commenting on the strategic plan or issues around the various ... the two panels that were in place.</p><p>And then down the line in my area, obviously, officials would have had quite intense engagement with experts in the Financial Regulator on particular, what they'd call, dossiers at EU level that would have been negotiated at that point in time.  So from my perspective the relationship was, you know, at my level was quite operational.  Of course, the Secretary General of the Department sat on the board of the Central Bank, so that was a separate flow or a separate relationship with the Central Bank.</p></speech>

You know, the way that the thing worked was we would ... and remember, it kicked off formally just as the liquidity crisis kicked off, maybe if you're taking the ECB intervention in August 2007 as being the starting point, so from then on, around a whole range of issues that were kicking ... that were arising in the financial sector, we'd access to the DSG, to their analysis, to their briefings, that we could bring to the Minister and the Government.  I would have imagined that would've been a very cumbersome process up to then, because there would've been all kinds of issues around the basis on which that information was being provided but, even in administrative terms, we wouldn't be meeting them regularly, we wouldn't be sitting down with them, we wouldn't have a structure, you know, to move the thing forward.</p></speech>

How would you describe that secret team or that secret work?

I mean, the reason why you wouldn't see a lot of that work was a huge amount of it - and it was very intense - was engagement with the Attorney General's office in the terms of the preparation of emergency legislation, or looking at ... for advice on a whole range of issues that would arise.  For example, if ELA was provided for an institution, would it have to be disclosed into the market?  You know, transparency requirements under the market's abuse directive.  The Irish Takeover Panel's rules, how they might work in terms of a market interaction.  But ... so all that information wouldn't ... all that paper trail, I suppose, you wouldn't have seen it because it's legally ... it's legally privileged, it's not available to the committee.</p></speech>

But, I mean, just to be very clear, I mean, in terms of the work that Kevin was referring to, it was very much under the aegis of the DSG, it was very much related to the DSG, it was us going back to the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and saying, "Well, this is what we're doing, this is the legislation that we're preparing, these are the legal questions that we have".  So that was the ... that was the kind of the framework for the work that was being carried out in that area.</p></speech>

I've one last thing if I may put to you there, please.  Mr. Daly, when he was giving information to the Wright report, Frank Daly, and this reference is the review of the Department, the Wright document.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	With regard to the Department's response to the crisis, there was quite late engagement.  The Department relied on the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and was let down by them.  Given the tools at the Department's disposal, they responded fairly well.  They didn't have the information to determine that there was a liquidity and a solvency problem. </blockquote> <p>What do you say to that?</p></speech>

I mean, going back to, going back specifically, say, to November 2007, work kicked off in preparing legislation to provide Government with options to deal with a systemic crisis, or the need to resolve a distressed institution.  So I think, you know, the file record demonstrates that there was a significant amount of contingency planning carried out in the period from 2005 and intensified from 2007, late 2007 onwards.</p></speech>

But, I mean, wouldn't necessarily accept what perhaps other people have reflected that there was some inherent flaw in the structure itself which contributed hugely to the difficulties of ... the major difficulties that arose in due course.  I mean, there's no ... there's no analysis or research which says that one form of structure ... one form of regulatory structure is better than another.  I mean in some countries they might have a stand-alone regulator, in others they might have a regulator that's wholly integrated into their Central Bank.  There's pros and cons to both, so that I wouldn't ... I wouldn't necessarily accept the analysis that there was something inherently flawed in the structure.

Clearly, looking at the regulatory structure, the supervisory structure, the financial stability structure, there was huge failures.  The regulatory structure didn't prove effective.  I talk in my witness statement and in my overview that I gave this evening that was seen to be the mainstay of financial regulation, the Basel framework, subsequently has been, you know, by very authoritative bodies, it's ... the conclusion is that it was deficient and it had serious weaknesses and it didn't contribute to ... it didn't contribute to meeting the objectives that had been set for it when it was originally adopted.</p></speech>

So ... and it was something that the ... Kevin Cardiff was closer to and is more directly involved in terms of talking to the NTMA and the Minister at the time.  But there was a move to seek to demonstrate confidence in the institutions, to demonstrate confidence in the institutions, all of the institutions, by ensuring that the NTMA placed deposits with those institutions but I'm not really <i>au fait </i>with the details.</p></speech>

Obviously, the note that you prepared for the ... for the T&aacute;naiste for that meeting deals with the fact that the NTMA were keeping this under review and they had, as you say, placed deposits with most of the main financial institutions.

Okay, I just want to move on to a couple of questions there, so if I can get the first one up there, which is this.  I'd like ... it just comes back to your own witness statement on page 1 of it, Mr. Beausang, and to ask you as to what extent was Irish financial regulation policy geared towards development of the IFSC?  And do you believe this, in any way, compromised the regulation that would otherwise have been put in place in respect of domestic banks?</p></speech>

So clearly, that's evidence of a situation where there was a, sort of, a backwash from the IFSC into the domestic financial institutions.  But I mean, candidly, the domestic financial institutions wouldn't really have been on the radar in terms of the developmental agenda for financial services in Ireland at the time.  The focus was very much on the international institutions, some of which, of course, were some of the domestic institutions, providing services on a cross-border basis from the ... out of the IFSC.</p></speech>

There has been some discussion with other witnesses before this committee that because of the development of the IFSC, that ... and the particular type of financial product that they brought with them, and you mentioned then the sectoral concentration limits as being one of them, was there a, kind of ... I'm coming back to Senator D'Arcy's question earlier, that we had the principle-based regulation on a global level, but we seemed to, in Ireland, to have maybe applied it differently or had a different interpretation of it, or how it was actually seen to have been modelled in a different way.  By your view, and by what you now know, do you believe that the IFSC had any impact, or other, in determining how principles-based regulation was operated in Ireland in the wider financial-----</p></speech>

So, if there were concerns that too loose an approach was being taken, or too flexible approach was being taken in the IFSC, that would move the IFSC in the direction of being an offshore financial centre rather than an on-shore properly regulated financial centre-----</p></speech>

I'll summarise the question once more, like, the ... in what one considered proposition was, to invite businesses into the Irish financial services centre on the quays, obviously a retail window had to be put out to get them into the country, and that the ... one of the considerations, it's even touched upon in the Honohan report, is that that had an impact upon the broader regulation of the existing financial services in the country, and that, if you take an approach that ... you can't approach ... take an approach to one sector over another, you have to take the approach on a broad basis, and the dynamic that that created, created a broad brush approach.</p></speech>

The competition issues are certainly ... were very significant, not just looking at the IFSC, but looking at the UK, broadly UK institutions that were providing retail financial services into the domestic banking market, that level playing field issue was certainly influential, and was a concern where the Financial Regulator was talking about, or was considering taking particular steps, they'd say, "Well, the problem that might arise here is that banks will no longer be subsidiaries, and they'll branch in and provide those services and no longer be regulated by ourselves."</p></speech>

I want to move on there to another issue, and that is to deal with the financial stability issue and the scoping paper citing, this comes back to Department of Finance, Vol. 2, page 113 to 120.</p><p>The specific page I am talking about is going to come up on screen now.  It talks about, if you look at the second paragraph there going down on the page.  It says this memo sets out ... the memo is actually a memorandum from Merrill Lynch, Sunday 28 September:</p><blockquote>	This memo sets out the strategic options available on the Government.  There is no right or wrong answer and the situation is very fluid with financial institutions experiencing difficulty and being supported by governments on a daily basis.  Preserving flexibility is key and the solution may be different for each institution.  The important issue is for the Government to preserve the stability of the Irish financial system overall and to safeguard the interests of individual bank customers to avoid widespread panic.  That said, there is a limit on the financial resources available to the Government and there may be a need to preserve firepower as events unfold.  The implications for each option in terms of whatever constitutes State Aid also needs to be carefully considered. </blockquote><p>Could I ask you what discussions took place that you were a party to on this potential systemic risk?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#QQQ00400"><p>At the time it was clear ... post-Lehman's it was absolutely evident that we moved from a situation ... definitively, from a situation where you were talking about maybe individual institutions to looking at the stability of the system as a whole.  That was, I suppose, a clear break if you look at pre and post-Lehman's, the whole sector, the whole system was vulnerable and at risk.  And a solution ... resolutions to these difficulties needed to take into account the whole of the domestic financial institution, rather than looking at any individual institution in isolation.</p></speech>

In terms of weighing these, sort of, many, many difficulties and problems that were obviously being encountered by people who were party to trying to come up with some solution or strategy to deal with this, the issue of systemic risk, how heavily would that weigh against the other difficulties that you would have had such as liquidity and so on and so forth?</p></speech>

So in that regard, if I can maybe move on to the next question.  In section 5.9 of your statement you state that your area of the Department of Finance had no role or mandate in assessing the efficiency of financial supervision on overseeing systemic risk.  So who then was responsible for overseeing this important area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#QQQ00800"><p>That's the distinction that I talked about earlier, Chairman, about the role of the Department in planning for the resolution with possible Government intervention to systemic crises and the role of the Central Bank in being responsible for the maintenance of financial stability.  So it's that distinction between the role of Central Bank and its macro-prudential responsibilities and tools and the role of the Department in ... where situations developed to a point that Government intervention is necessary and being ready to advise Government on what steps might be appropriate.</p></speech>

If I can go then to page 3 of your statement, it's the very bottom of the page 5.9 and you say:</p> <blockquote> 	Under the legislation or in terms of the accountability framework, my area had no role or mandate in assessing the efficacy of financial supervision or in overseeing systemic stability. We were, however, cognisant of a broad range of factors which appeared to provide substantial assurance over that period that the supervisory and prudential system was operating effectively. </blockquote> <p>On the next page you go through a lot of the stuff that you have cognisance of and so on.  Given that systemic risk, by your own testimony here this afternoon, was the biggest of all the issues in the room in the approach to the guarantee and given by your own admission in your statement here that you had no responsibility for systemic risk, how would you care to comment upon that now?</p></speech>

On examining that now, and bearing in mind that this inquiry is about not just the past but the future and avoiding mistakes of the past and ... and other judgments, was that structurally ... was that structure, as it was laid out then, the best structure that could have been arrived at?</p></speech>

I suppose the point that I was making earlier was that if the DSG had been in place at an earlier point, it would have provided the opportunity maybe for a better pulling together of an assessment of those risks because what you would have started to do in that situation is bring together the people from the financial stability area in the bank, the macroeconomic forecasters in the Department of Finance and that you would have created at least an opportunity for more of a teasing out for the whole spectrum of risks facing the economy and the financial system at the time.  As it was, because the DSG was established in July 2007, by the time it actually started its work, it was already in sort of crisis mode in reporting on developments in the financial system.</p></speech>

I mean, they were tools, those macro-prudential tools in terms of direct restrictions on credit or restrictions on LTV ... on LTVs.  They would have kind of fallen out of fashion in terms of what regulators or supervisors did internationally, apart from a few notable exceptions, so that wasn't part of what ... for good or for ill, what banking supervisors or central banks did in the period running up to the crash.  But that certainly was what was missing in terms of trying to pre-empt the difficulties that ultimately crystallised with the ... with the events of September 2008.</p></speech>

They introduced ... the introduction of higher capital weightings on high LTV mortgages, the higher capital weightings on speculative property lending, so there was a number of measures they took and new liquidity ... new liquidity rules, so it wasn't that, from the outside, that they looked hugely passive.

With that said, I would now say that the witness ... that the witness ... that the witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence or matters that have been discussed before this committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until 18:10 and remind the witness that he is still under oath until we resume; is that agreed?</p></speech>

Mr. Beausang, in retrospect are you satisfied that communication between the members of the DSG group, domestic standing group, was maximised during the period of the crisis?  What areas, if any, were ineffective in the lead-up and during the crisis itself?  And I just want to refer to page 9 in your statement where you say, in paragraph 12.6, &quot;Ultimately in the course of 2008, the formal DSG structure fell into abeyance, replaced by frequent informal <i>ad-hoc</i>contacts&quot;.  So the question I'm asking is: in retrospect, why did it fall into abeyance?  And were the communication lines between the members of the group maximised to the maximum effect of the Irish taxpayer?</p></speech>

So that's what transpired.  I mean, the principals, you know, that's the Secretary General, the Governor, the Financial Regulator, were obviously operating under DSG rules in terms of the disclosure of information.  But, I mean, the DSG was, in practice, never more than a ... a structure to facilitate information flow and information exchange between the authorities.  And I think it was very, you know, it was effective in that respect in the regard that the Minister and Government were updated on the information on financial market conditions that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator provided, which, as I mentioned earlier, might have been a difficulty if no structure was in place or, indeed, if there wasn't an MOU to deal with the ... the confidentiality issue, the stringent confidentiality issue ... stringent restrictions on information exchange that would otherwise operate.  I suppose, as I've reflected in my witness statement, where it ... where it fell down was in that broader role that DSGs are intended to discharge around agreeing a kind of consensus view on how financial stability crises should be dealt with and the planning and the approach that should be adopted.  And the scoping paper that we were talking about before the break was an attempt to try to create an agreed model or a greater level of consensus about how we would deal with the issues that were unfolding in the financial system.  But, as I set out ... as I summarise and for the reasons I set out in the paper, that didn't come to pass.  The ... and ultimately the DSG structure was overtaken by the speed of events.</p></speech>

Now, these two statements, the draft Government press release, which is document TAB AM, and then TAB AN, which is the revised version, right, there's no great difference in those documents bar you say the first one states that "The Government stressed ... all institutions will continue to operate as normal with their customers on the basis of this guarantee", and the revised one said "All customers should continue to operate as normal".  First reason, I know I have a limited time, Chairman, the first thing I want to know, why did that change happen?  And secondly, comparing it to the Government press statement, that issued on 30 September, the content of it, outside of maybe changes, it's the same language, it's using, it uses "has decided", uses words like "market turmoil", it uses the "Government to remove any uncertainty", "objective ...[take] ..... decisive action ... to maintain financial stability", " designed to safeguard the Irish financial system".</p> <p>  The key differences are: in terms of the language used, I think, Mr. Beausang, it's very similar, one could state that it's just purely an editing of the, of language that's used, but the document, the press statement you prepared with Eoin Dorgan, is a six-month guarantee purely for deposits.  The revised, the Government guarantee deals with ... it covers, in addition it covers covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt, dated lower tier 2 debt.  Also, this was purely for six months but the Government's one is a two-year guarantee from 29 September 2008 to 28 September 2010.  So the question, I suppose, I'm asking you is, is that, when was the first occasion that you became aware of this Government press statement, where it stated the six-month guarantee, the one you received from David Doyle?  When was the first you would have become aware that this matter was being discussed with the Central Bank?</p></speech>

We here have a draft of a Government guarantee which came to you, that you received from David Doyle, the then general secretary of the Department of Finance, at 11 minutes past nine on the evening of the 29th.</p><p>The question I want to know is ... which is six months ... which is six hours prior to a guarantee being put in place, that we were told, up to now.  When did you first become aware that discussions were taking place with the Central Bank in putting in place what you received as the draft?</p></speech>

I suppose, from my perspective ... my personal perspective, having sat in at the start of the meeting, seen the Governor come in, seen the Financial Regulator - the chair of the Financial Regulator and the CEO - and argue very strongly for a guarantee, in my own mind I said, you know, "This is going in a particular direction now".  Because you'd be very slow at political level - the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance - to discount the advice of the appropriate authorities for maintaining financial stability and the soundness of individual institutions.  So, from my perspective, once they made that argument, notwithstanding that there was a lot of discussion subsequently, some of which that I was party to, it seemed to me that the direction of travel on things was set by the advice given by the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.</p></speech>

I think that the confidence and the credibility of the Department in doing that was lacking, notwithstanding that, as you know from other evidence, that the case was made that there were risks and that they were increasing risks and they should be influencing the conduct of fiscal policy and budgetary policy generally in the period running up to the crisis.</p></speech>

The hypothesis in the sentence is that, I don't know, a bunch of Marxists were trying to nationalise banks, but, in fact, it was the people in them were looking for us to bail them out for the &euro;64 billion.</p></speech>

Now, considering that in September 2008, the CBFSAI was saying that these institutions were, in fact, fundamentally sound, the scope to then implement a resolution action, which would diminish shareholder value or impact on the ... well, diminish shareholder value and, essentially, seek to, or start a process to, break up a bank, to bring it to a point where it could be orderly wound ... or liquidated, would not be something that I'm sure that existing bank board, senior management or, indeed, shareholders would have favoured, and would have, presumably, strongly resisted.</p></speech>

I will refer you to the speech given by the deputy governor of the Central Bank in February 2012, where he's making the point very strongly in talking about the use of macro-prudential policy and the important role that it needs to play in the future.  He says macro-prudential policy makers must enjoy independence because every now and again macro ... there'll be a requirement to constrain the economy during a boom, which obviously should have happened, and there would undoubtedly be strong pressure from financial institutions and from the political system, more generally, not to go down that road.  So, I mean he made a very strong argument that for as much as central banks, you know,  in moving forward on monetary policy there's a need for independence, the same independence has to apply for macro-prudential policymakers.</p></speech>

The question was about the Department of Finance and its role in regard to making interventions and being custodians in public purse.  The deputy governor of the Central Bank made a speech in 2012 but that's not relevant to the question that the Senator asked you.</p></speech>

Now, as borne out, the results of what were very top-down-type exercises - stress tests carried out at the time - there was no indication that there were major capital losses in the offing.  And that was confirmed I suppose by the PwC work done in the autumn, notwithstanding that they were applying loan-loss rates that were higher than analysts were saying at the time, which is I suppose isn't surprising given that you have to factor into account the subsequent declines in prices that happened post-September 2008, which obviously impacted very significantly on the value of assets in the institutions, in the covered institutions.</p></speech>

The transfer ... I mean, a post-guarantee designated banking unit was set up in the NTMA with banking experts to work as part of the public response, or the Government's response, to the crisis and that unit was, ultimately, transferred in the Department of Finance to provide the Department of Finance with the expertise that it needed.

But I never got a sense that I got a ... you know, it was never resolved for me in terms of what he said back to me because I always had that recollection that that document was there and, I suppose it was on my mind a bit in reflecting back on the events of the night.  So, I remember putting that to him on one or two occasions but not bottoming it out in the way that his evidence has done subsequently.</p></speech>

He proceeded on that basis.</p></speech>

I just want to move on quickly, Mr. Beausang, to your core evidence page 13.  You don't really need to bother looking at it.  It is in relation to an institution that is insolvent or approaching insolvency.  This document which was referred to earlier, a brief to the domestic standing group ...  financial stability issues scoping paper rather.  "If a period of liquidity continues it is likely that an [illiquid] institution will move closer to insolvency."  And then later, "it becomes insolvent because of its illiquidity".  Given the liquidity problems that were becoming evident in financial institutions in 2008, were there mechanisms that you identified or employed to try to identify if financial institutions were becoming insolvent, in danger of becoming insolvent at that time?</p></speech>

I think in that document itself or the presentation that followed on from that, we made the point that it was important that the CBFSAI had the information and tools to make the type of assessment that was needed at short notice, to advise Government on what resolution action should be taken.  And the response from the Central Bank was that in a rapidly changing and a rapidly evolving crisis situation, the information that they'd have would be not necessarily up to date or current or relevant, so they pushed back on the idea that there was some sort of core database that might be available to the authorities to assess these issues as final decision making had to be made.</p></speech>

It was trying to put in place a similar risk-based approach to the determination of insurance sector regulation.  So it is not related to the terms of reference of this inquiry.</p></speech>

So therefore on the night of the guarantee, it would have been absolutely vital for an institution's interest that it was not insolvent if it was to benefit from, would that be fair?  I am making a statement but it is a question.</p></speech>

And that obviously provided a major impetus for me, in my area, to engage with the Financial Regulator, with the registrar of credit unions, to address the issues that were being brought to the table around credit unions.  I suppose, in looking and having ... just very quickly having ... in light of further reviews I've carried out since I ... I submitted my written statement, I mean, I think I might have overstated the extent to which ... I wouldn't want to communicate that work stopped on broader financial stability planning at that time, but certainly work on credit unions took up a huge amount of the ... of my division's time and resources during that period, 2005 and 2006.</p></speech>

But I'm just interested in the process of that for a moment, Mr. Beausang.  What it says is that issues were brought to the table by the IFSRA, such as concerns.  Then, and we go on to 5.12, "This generated a major work programme".  Now, what this is saying here is that problem identified, action taken, over those two things.  Now, in your earlier testimony today, you said that systemic risk was the biggest issue facing into the guarantee period and lead up to the crisis period.  Why was the same level of urgency not taken with regard to that problem?  You've identified here that you had the ability to identify concerns and you have also identified the ability to be able to take action.</p></speech>

The first reason was because the Financial Regulator was formally bringing to our attention that they saw a major financial stability risk.  Secondly, we were, in terms of our legislative responsibilities, we had the tools to address the issues that they say were giving rise to the systemic risk in terms of scope for reforming the credit union, the legislation governing credit unions, or indeed in dealing with the major issues that was highlighted to us around our savings protection scheme.  So that's the distinction I'd draw between this scenario and the scenario we're speaking about earlier on.</p> <p>  The fact the Financial Regulator brought it to us, and that it related to an area where we had the tools to do something about it.  Whereas more generally around the growth in credit, they didn't bring that issue to us, but they had the tools anyway and the responsibility for dealing with it as I referred previously to the deputy governor's speech, where he says macro-prudential policy, which would encompass action to address excessive growth and banks' balance sheet, is the responsibility of the Central Bank and the Central Bank and the regulator, and they must be independent in discharging those functions because of the risk of political interference if it was otherwise.</p></speech>

And then you go on to 5.9.1, right down as far as 5.12, this is the area of cognisance that you actually have.  You also are on record here as saying that systemic risk was the issue in the room.  And you demonstrate here, as Deputy Higgins has shown, an issue of concern with the credit unions.  You get an analysis on it and you take action.  But the-----</p></speech>

So there you have, as the Governor said, IFSRA the body, you know in talking about dealing with financial sector matters, the responsibilities are first of all the Financial Regulator:</p> <blockquote> 	the body with the best knowledge and the condition of each bank;<br /><br />the Central Bank, able to form a policy view on broader financial stability issues and the provision of liquidity;<br /><br />[and then] the role of the Government relating to covering underlying losses via taxpayer support if necessary.   </blockquote> <p>So that's the demarcation responsibilities.</p></speech>

You are the assistant secretary with the responsibility for specifically, like, your role was to deal with banking, finance and international division of the Department of Finance.  You were also the point man for the Department on the domestic standing group.  Like the domestic standing group was not set up as a ... just another committee, this was a committee, as I understand, with a very specific role to kind of act like a crack commando team with any crisis coming down the line.  And so ... and a certain authority was given to this group.  So, I put the question to you, the action with regard to credit union is very clearly outlined in your witness statement, but I'm trying to gather the congruence with regard to all the positions that you had, all the information that you had, and yet the issues with regard to systemic risk were not actually acted upon by-----</p></speech>

And that's very clear from the scoping paper that was circulated in advance of the ... of the ... in January ... on 10 January ... or, the scoping paper that was drafted after the meeting of 10 January and the ... there's another document I think ... a paper maybe circulated in advance that makes the same point.  And, indeed, it's reflected in the MOU itself establishing the DSG, that it did not diminish ... sorry, that it didn't impact on the distinct legal responsibilities of the constituent parts of the constituent members of the ... of the DSG.</p></speech>

[that] this reflected the marked deterioration in funding conditions from August 2007 onwards. </blockquote> <p>Now, we're not talking about September 2008, we're talking about August 2007 and the period that led up to that.  And this role, as I said earlier this morning, the ... or this afternoon, the ... the construction of the Central Bank, with the sort of two divisions of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator was a ... was a creation of legislation.  There was always the ability, through legislation, to modify or to change.

So the work of the DSG over that period where it was formally operating is very transparent in that respect and what it was, was a conduit for information from Dame Street to Merrion Street as I set out in my overview statement.  We didn't have a role in managing the crisis but our role was to ensure that the principals, people at top level, had the information they required to assess and to take whatever further steps they thought were necessary to deal with the evolving difficulties.</p></speech>

Mr. Beausang, good afternoon.  Firstly, can I just refer to the document ... or the issue that Deputy Higgins referred to in terms of Irish Nationwide and its report ... or the report into it by Goldman Sachs?  Mr. Cardiff, in his statement two weeks ago, stated to the committee, "In the first half of September 2008 [and I'm quoting him now], when it was clear that INBS was in ... difficulty, I told the staff in the [regulator] that [Bank of Ireland] ... and ... AIB ... would have to be called in to assist in a resolution for [Nationwide]."  Were you aware that that was happening or were you part of those discussions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#FFFF00600"><p>I think going back ... and I wouldn't know the exact timeframe, Deputy, there was always an appreciation, acknowledgment, and I might have heard it articulated by the Governor of the Central Bank, that if one of the smaller institutions got into difficulty that, as would often be the case, and then trying to facilitate a market solution, that the bigger institutions would be asked to step up to the plate and try to resolve that difficulty.  So in terms of the specific evidence that you refer to, I don't have a clear recollection of being ... certainly, it doesn't sound strange or unusual to me as being what was on the Department's mind at the time in responding to concerns about INBS, which were obviously pronounced at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015062400002#FFFF00700"><p>Okay.  That's fair enough.  Mr. Cardiff then went on to outline how the decision to include Nationwide in the guarantee was largely based on this previously mentioned Goldman Sachs report into Nationwide which you have referred to in, I think, paragraph 17.8 of your opening statement.</p><p>I wanted to ask you, are you aware of ... I suppose you'd call them allegations that were published in a ... in a book called <i>The FitzPatrick Tapes,</i>by Mr. Brian Carey and Mr. Tom Lyons, attributed to Mr. FitzPatrick where he was referenced to have made contact with senior staff in Goldman Sachs in ... when they were carrying out the investigations for this report ... lobbying them, effectively, because, and I want to have ...  I've a direct quote from the book here, that &quot;he was worried that should the review be extremely negative about Nationwide, that officials might think that things were as bad or worse inside Anglo&quot;.  Were you aware that there was any such alleged lobbying taking place from Anglo towards Goldman Sachs at the time?</p></speech>

But ... at that point in time, excuse me, and given the importance of trying to get a fix on what we were dealing with, it struck me that the ... that events had unfolded to a point that it was certainly very unfortunate that we were, kind of, relying on Goldman Sachs, for example, who had been contracted ... had been asked by INBS over an extended period of time to work with them to facilitate their trade sale.  It certainly seemed to - certainly from my perspective - that there were ... there were  issues around relying on ... not so much relying on assessment from Goldman Sachs, that Goldman Sachs were the option available to us, or presented to us by the Financial Regulator, as ... for the review of the loan book in ... in ... in INBS.</p></speech>

But, you know, you have to rely on the, you know, professional standing and reputation of these organisations and their ability to deal with conflicts of interest.  But it reflects a broader issue, I suppose, that ... and to do with failures in our planning, that it was at a very late stage objectively that we were focusing on trying to get that fix on the institutions.  And the information that was then available to Government on the night of the guarantee objectively and you will have seen the papers yourself, were ... were quite limited ... or, sorry, and they weren't ... when I say available to the Government, they informed then the Merrill Lynch memorandum, it was a very ... it wasn't a deep dive.  And I think that ... that comment, that term cropped up maybe or may have seen it in some kind of ... maybe I didn't, but ... you know ... we needed information and we didn't have information.  We had some information but certainly, as events have proved, it wasn't sufficient information.</p></speech>

I suppose frustration, to some extent, that people might express that, you know, on the night of the guarantee decision itself ... that there wasn't a fuller basis of information for the Government available, particularly on the two, kind of, crisis institutions before they were included in the guarantee.  Why was there no direct action by the Department or other State agencies to investigate the ... those ... the loan books of those two particular institutions?</p></speech>

I mean, that was a recognition, in February 2008, that there was ... there was a need for that.  But, unfortunately, we weren't successful in putting that in place and ... you know, there would be ... you know, counter, not so much, argument made, that ... well as the bank said at the time, as I quoted a few moments ago, that information gets out of date quickly.  You know all kinds of reasons why ... you know, the argument would be made that the type of information that you say you want can never really be generated in ... in ... in real time. And, I mean,  you know, given the whole issue around when does a liquidity issue become a solvency issue?</p><p>I mean, when you look at the configuration ... when you look at funding markets at that time and you understand the importance of liquidity for asset values, I mean, would you say that any institution anywhere was ... you know, you can make the argument, was it solvent on that night because without any liquidity, there's no value in assets, there's no solvency?  And, I mean, what's influential in my view that, you know, that I'm ... I wouldn't be ... in looking at the difficulty that the authorities faced in surfacing that kind of information.  I mean, the deep dive that we asked PwC to do and that was done, didn't turn up some can of worms around the institutions, that that really only arose on the basis of the very strict loan-by-loan examination that the European Commission insisted would take place, prior to the transfer of NAMA.  So it was only at that point that all the flaws, all the weaknesses, all the issues around the way that loan underwriting had been done in the commercial property sector ... it was only at that point that it really came to light and reflected in the transfer value for the loans at that point in time.</p></speech>

The role of the authorities is to maintain financial stability and not to bailout shareholders of insolvent institutions.  Thus, the preferred outcome for an insolvent institution may be its failure and subsequent orderly wind-down. </blockquote> <p>I want to ask you, is that consistent with the advice of the domestic standing group in the period leading up to the bank guarantee?</p></speech>

The model, you know, a, kind of, an agreed or consensus model of crisis resolution, was never put in place.  So, that was a reflection of what is indeed, kind of, you know, good practice or the recommended approach for dealing with a failing institution.  I suppose one further distinction that I'd make that's important, at a point in time, you're, kind of, looking at the way things are developing in the financial sector, and you're saying, "Are we dealing with a problem in an individual institution or are we dealing with a systemic crisis?"  And I think the approach that you take in either of those situation differs.  It's not ... the best practice in dealing with a stand-alone failed institution isn't the same as best practice in dealing with a systemic crisis that's affecting the whole of the banking sector.</p></speech>

Minutes of the meeting of the domestic standing group's suggested that liquidity was frequently reported upon from 2007 right up to the pre-crisis period.  However, the drafting of legislation to enable the Minister to nationalise a financial institution suggests that the issue of solvency was also discussed.  Can you outline the discussions that took place at the DSG on the issue of solvency?</p></speech>

I mean, from the outset and from July 2007 or, certainly, August 2007, it was very much around the liquidity crisis that was impacting internationally but, obviously, impacting disproportionately on the Irish banks.  So, I mean, at what point in time?  I mean, the question was asked earlier around, "Well, wasn't the share prices for those institutions saying that there was a difficulty?"  But I mean, a year before that, the share prices had been ... might have been interpreted as saying that these were very strong institutions with a very bright future, so the amount of reliance or the information content of share prices is open to question.</p><p>But, at a point in time certainly, and I suppose it probably would be September 2008, you know, the realisation hit home in the Department that there was very ... that those concerns were concerns that would have to be addressed and examined and understood in advising Government on the way forward in dealing with the crisis in the financial system.  And that then informed the approach, well let's ... "Doesn't someone have to come in and look at the loan books here?"  And the, kind of, time spent in setting somebody up to that, and arranging for that to happen, and it, ultimately, happening at a very late stage with that advice, without ... with that information coming through, I think, the Sunday before, the day before the guarantee meeting.</p></speech>

But I think as reflected in the final MOU for the DSG, that role in terms of operate at macro level overseeing the financial stability environment generally, that that was not proceeded with on the basis that there needed be legal certainty around the responsibilities of the different participants in the DSG, and there was no question that it would operate on some kind of pooled or joint basis in exercising the powers the individual institutions had.</p></speech>

I just want to go to one other thing.  There's a document I referred to earlier before we went to the break, with regard to this Financial Stability Issues - Scoping Paper, and we established your relationship with that.  I just want to go through just a few bits of that with you very briefly, okay?  If I can move on to page 10 of it, and it's "3. Scenario 1 - An institution that is illiquid but solvent."</p><p>Okay.  And then, so ... if I can move on to page 11 to 3.2, okay?  It then goes on to the &quot;Department/Minister's role in this situation&quot; and it says: &quot;Traditionally, it would be considered that the Minister for Finance does not have a specific role when an institution is illiquid but solvent and there is no legal role for the Minister in such an event&quot;.  If I can then move on to page 13 and it talks about Scenario 2 and Scenario 2 is &quot;An institution that is insolvent (or approaching insolvency).&quot;  And I move on to page 15, which is on item 4.3 and it says the:</p><blockquote>	Role/Legal powers of the Minister in this situation [if, as] outlined above, if an insolvent bank sought ELA, the CBFSAI would be legally prohibited from extending it.  However, if the bank was systemically important and the Government agreed to extend a guarantee to it[s] liabilities, then [this would in turn, from an insolvency, sorry] ... this would turn it from an insolvent bank into an illiquid but solvent one. </blockquote><p>So if I can then move down to the bottom of the page, which is the very, very last sentence there:</p><blockquote>	The main principle contained in these instructions is that a letter [would] expressly, or by implication, give a guarantee or an undertaking not  already authorised by legislation, should not, in any circumstances, be issued.  The CBFSAI's view is that [the] letter of comfort from the Minister to cover the CBFSAI's risks would not be sufficient for CBFSAI to lend to an insolvent institution - a comprehensive guarantee would be necessary. </blockquote><p>You told us earlier in the meeting, Mr. Beausang, of a draft letter of comfort on the night of the guarantee.  Why would this be necessary if ... if scenario 1 or scenario 2 were the accepted position or the dilemma that you found yourself in that night?</p></speech>

So, how does that square with the comment on the end of page 15 that the main principle contained in these instructions is that a letter which expressly or by implication gives a guarantee or undertaking not already authorised by legislation, should not in any circumstances be issued?  The CBFSAI's view is that a letter of comfort from the Minister to cover the subsequent risks would not be sufficient for the CBFSAI to lend to an insolvent institution, a comprehensive guarantee would be necessary.  How does that square with what you just said?</p></speech>

I mean they were clearly happy to advance emergency lending ... ELA on the basis of a letter of comfort but I mean, it then links into what was the ... and the timing and the sequencing of the broader guarantee that was being provided because I mean, the fact that the State ... the Government were saying that they were guaranteeing the institutions was providing that guarantee that the Central Bank might wish to see in a circumstances where it was lending into institutions that there might be concerns about loan losses and so on.  So ... the Central Bank, whenever the question of ELA arises and it might be reflected in the black book, the black red book, if they're going to give ELA, they want a letter of comfort because they don't want to be on the hook for any losses from ELA.  So, that's always been the position and it was never ... it was ... I won't say traditional but it was the practice that if there was ever any question of ELA, the Central Bank would require a letter of comfort from the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015062400002#E00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend this meeting.  I have submitted my presentation to the committee and I propose to give a synopsis of it at this stage.</p> <p>  By way of personal introduction my career has been as a civil servant.  I should probably admit to being a lawyer by background but essentially my career has largely been spent with the Revenue Commissioners and latterly over a 20 year period with the Education Department in its various manifestations, more recently as the Department of Education and Skills.  Over that period I have been involved in most of the major issues in the Department and I had responsibility for very many of its functions.  Of particular relevance to today's meeting is the fact that before the State Examinations Commission was established I had responsibility for the State exams as they were then a function of the Department.  It was a difficult period in the history of the State exams and we attempted to deal with public confidence issues at the time by making the exams significantly more transparent than they had been up to then, most particularly, by allowing leaving certificate students to see their marked scripts which, frankly, was unthought of and unheard of at the time but is now very much part and parcel of the way the system runs.  It is probably an example of the fact that sometimes big changes, while they seem dramatic at the time, have a tendency in our system to bed down fairly quickly and almost become the new normality.</p> <p>  The State Examinations Commission is a major undertaking and the State certificate exams are themselves major life events for students.  They touch the lives of so many people every year and they attract a vast level of media print and attention, some good and some not so good in that it may be responsible for raising pressures and tensions for students where it would be better if that did not occur.  What is at the core of our examination system is the absolute essential need to maintain public confidence.  In my judgment and in my operational experience with this endeavour, public confidence can only be maintained if one does one's absolute level best to have as foolproof a system as possible and to minimise the potential for difficulties.  However, in the nature of operations like examinations and which is attested to internationally, the simple scale of examinations invariably gives rise to difficulties and there has to be an absolute immutable candour in dealing with those difficulties.  That is the core essential; no messing, straight down the middle, telling it as it is and sort it.  This is preferable to creating the sense that nothing can ever go wrong and it is the only thing that maintains public confidence.  That is a core function of the incoming commission, in my judgment.  </p> <p>  The exams do not operate in a vacuum.  They are part of a joined-up fabric in our system that involves entities such as the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and the third level institutions because the examinations are the entry point to third level.  Collaborative arrangements and relationships are very important in the running of the exams which cannot be operated in an isolated or ivory tower setting.  We will continue to need strong and good relationships with groups such as management bodies, teacher unions, parent bodies and so on.</p><p>Partnership is sometimes a word loosely used.  But the thing only works if you have that strong sense of shared ownership.</p><p> I would like to mention briefly that the five commissioners in the new commission are non-representative, as it is not a representative group.  Commissioners are appointed independently and operate cohesively as a commission.  It is essential that they bring a range of skills and backgrounds to the commission because that expertise will be needed in the coming years.  Apart from maintaining the delicate flower of public confidence, which is essential, there is also a need to follow a change agenda.  Some of the changes will be in areas such as the new junior cycle programme, while others will involve changes to the leaving certificate grading structure.  Other will be made as time passes.  We will need to use technology much more critically in areas such as marking.  It will be important to get it right because it is very much a question of public confidence, as it is with any entity.  We have to guard as best we can against losing that confidence or operating in a way that causes problems.</p><p> I thank the joint committee on my own behalf and that of my fellow commissioners.  I give it a personal assurance that I have taken on this role consciously and will give it 110%.  I will be unstinting in giving whatever is required to the role.  I know that this applies to my fellow commissioners also.</p></speech>

His background and career will certainly stand him in good stead.  He will be able to bring his experience to the scope of the State Examinations Commission's activities and I wish him well in his new role.  As he outlined, the State Examinations Commission has a daunting logistical task on its hands every year.  It carries out that role well.  As Mr. Burke pointed out, its transparent and honest approach is absolutely crucial to the confidence the public and students certainly have in the examinations system.  Some of the changes made in recent years - Mr. Burke reflected on the ability of students to see and review their examination papers - have contributed greatly to this.</p> <p>  I apologise because I will have to leave early.  Before I do, I will mention a couple of issues that I would like Mr. Burke to look at and take on in his new role.  </p> <p>  I ask the State Examinations Commission to review the use of retired teachers as examiners.  It is an issue that arises every year.  Perhaps Mr. Burke might seek to assess it when he takes on his new role.  Younger teachers who are in part-time and temporary employment should be prioritised when these posts are being filled in order that they can supplement their wages and develop their careers.  They need financial support to encourage them to develop their careers.  That is why younger teachers should be allowed to act as examiners and correct examination papers, where possible.</p> <p>  I also raise with Mr. Burke the issue of special accommodation for examination students.  I know that he has worked with the special needs section in dealing with this issue.  According to recent figures, the State Examinations Commission received 2,495 applications for special accommodation for students in 2012.  I refer to the provision of readers or other forms of assistance to help students in their leaving certificate examinations.  I understand that at junior certificate level decisions on accommodation are made within each school, whereas the State Examinations Commission is responsible for the provision of accommodation at leaving certificate level.  The number of applications increased from almost 2,500 in 2012 to 2,669 in 2014, but the number of refusals increased from 669 to 894.  Given that there was a significant increase of 37% in the number of refusals, I ask Mr. Burke to review the matter when he takes up his new role in order that students will have the accommodation they require.  </p> <p>  I wish Mr. Burke well and look forward to seeing him serve on the State Examinations Commission successfully in the next five years.</p></speech>

I want to touch on two issues.  I will come back to the issue of reasonable accommodation which has been mentioned by Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  </p> <p>  Is there any move to introduce an online system of paying examination fees to the State Examinations Commission?  I understand the fees have to be paid in a bank.  One cannot even pay them in a post office.  This creates difficulties for people living in rural areas, or those working full-time who may not have access to a bank.  Is consideration being given to the introducton of an online payment system?</p> <p>  I understand 13.5% of students who made applications under the reasonable accommodation scheme last year, including children with dyslexia, dyspraxia, Asperger's syndrome and autism, were refused support.  We have heard about many cases from people who have come to our offices.  I have printed the details of three cases with which I have been dealing.  A woman called Laura told me about her son, who has dyspraxia, Asperger's syndrome and various other difficulties, including physical ailments, outside of his learning difficulties.  She and her son applied in March 2014 for a scribe in the leaving certificate examinations, but they did not receive a decision until March 2015.  They were told the delay had been caused by a significant backlog of cases.  If people in such circumstances could be informed at an earlier stage, they could prepare.  I know of other cases in which occupational therapy reports requested by the State Examinations Commission were submitted in support of applications, but the applications were refused, despite the provision of documentation from qualified professionals.  This is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  In many cases, pupils who received support in the junior certificate examinations are being refused support in the leaving certificate examinations.  I know of a young girl who applied for a scribe because she has a difficulty with her handwriting.  The State Examinations Commission examined her application and asked her to take a short test - that is how her mother described it to me - before adjudicating that her handwriting was legible.  The point the family has made to me is that the requirements of a State examination over a number of weeks are not reflected in the State Examinations Commission's short handwriting test.  This was not taken into account and the student in question was refused a scribe.  I accept that her handwriting was probably legible during that short period, but it would not be physically possible for her to maintain that level of handwriting over the course of successive days of examinations.  </p> <p>  These real issues need to be addressed.  In cases in which reports have been received from professionals in support of the provision of assistance for students who previously received such assistance in the junior certificate examinations, how does the State Examinations Commission come to a decision not to grant assistance?</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him the best of luck in his great job.  </p> <p>  I am a great believer in the leaving certificate, just as I was in the "inter", as we called it.  The leaving certificate programme has served the country and families very well.  It has been kind, good and expansive.  It has also been highly developmental.  Mr. Burke made a point about its transparency.  It has been good and I like its structure.  Examinations are very important as we need to be able to form our minds and memories.  They are very good for young minds, both practically and from the point of view of memory.</p> <p>  I would like to mention something that disappoints me.</p><p>I have worked in the third level sector a lot and it blames the second level sector for the calibre of students.  I would tell the third level sector to look in the mirror because, at times, its teaching level is very low.  This is now all over the newspapers because it must do simple things with students and teach them the basics.  That is what university is about, namely, teaching new basics in a new way.  I am a great believer in the second level structure and believe it is a mighty and very robust one.</p><p> I wish to ask about two matters.  Mr. Burke must do something about the grading system for honours mathematics.  We talk about confidence in honours and pass mathematics, the business of grading and of doing pass if one does not really make it doing honours.  All of this is a complete mess.  Saying 29% in honours maths is the equivalent of 50% in pass maths is baloney.  One either passes or one does not.  Whatever way it is worked out, it must be clearer and restore confidence, which has been eroded.</p><p> I have been raising the following matter for months.  Some 25% is given to those doing mathematics and yet it is not given to those doing music.  It is a banking system of education and it is sort of a capitulation in terms of how we regard creativity.  We should award marks for creativity.  If 25% is given to mathematics, then give it to a language or choice subject.  I ask Mr. Burke to bear this in mind because it raises the question of the kinds of knowledge we empirically think are more important than anothers.  Dell, Microsoft and pharmaceutical organisations will look for creative minds as well as people who studied physics.  </p><p> I happen to be looking at end-of-life issues, loss and bereavement across Departments.  I wonder what the commission's policy is when it comes to dealing with students who suffer great loss and bereavement during examination times.  I am talking about family loss, sibling loss and bereavement.  How the bereaved are treated at examination time is very important.  Are extensions granted?  Are allowances made?  </p><p> Confidence in the examination system is very important.  It has been somewhat eroded and it is being eroded bit by bit in regard mathematics.</p><p> Another issue is externality.  I will not ask Mr. Burke for his opinion on an internal or external examination process.  I believe we should keep the process external as it maintains confidence in the process and keeps it arms length.</p><p> I wish Mr. Burke good luck in his new role as it is a wonderful job.  I believe totally in the junior and leaving certificate examinations and I hope things move onwards and upwards and that there good changes ahead.</p></speech>

I will continue on from where Senator O'Donnell left off and speak about how students are dealt with when they suffer a bereavement during the leaving certificate.  I am particularly aware of how much pressure such loss puts on students because as my niece sat her leaving certificate examination, her father was dying of cancer.  She took her exams at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and was driven to Dublin to visit her father in hospital and was back to sit an examination the following day.  I thought that was the most inhumane way to deal with somebody going through a crisis.  I experienced something similar with my son in that during his leaving certificate examination, his sister was in St. James's Hospital being operated on for cancer.  We must find a way to deal with human issues while at the same time retaining the integrity of the examination system.  That will be a challenge for Mr. Burke.</p> <p>  I refer to the leaving and junior certificate examinations and the CAO and everything that goes with that, including the life changing opportunities that arise as a result of a three-hour or four-hour examination.  I have left my trade union hat behind so I can say that there was some benefit in having ongoing assessment that could offset the damage that three hours might do to an individual.</p> <p>  One of the things that concerns me is the teaching of languages, which includes the teaching of our national language and our approach to international languages.  Recently, on a visit to Finland, a young 12-year old student spoke perfect English as he walked me around his school.  When I queried him on his level of English, he informed me that he was equally proficient in Swedish, Finnish, Russian and German.</p></speech>

The SEC will have a role there.  I am interested in hearing where the SEC intends to go.  Special accommodation has already been mentioned but it is a challenge for the SEC.</p> <p>  On a personal note, it is rare that somebody like me gets to meet somebody like Mr. Burke at the start of a new career.  I am 100% confident that public confidence will be 100% taken care of while the SEC is in his hands.  I have worked with him in the past and I know that he is a man who if he meets a difficulty will come straight out and tell people what it is.  He will not hide behind anything.  It is not often that we get appointments right but in this particular case, the powers that be have picked a great chairman.  I congratulate him and wish him all the best. </p></speech>

I also compliment him on being instrumental in the policy decision to open up scripts to students.  Mr. Burke is an innovative individual and I am sure some of my suggestions can be implemented as I see no reason they should not be.  I would like him to put to bed, or address firmly, one or two issues, if he can do so.  I have raised these issues in the past but I have never been able to get to the bottom of them.  My first point is on errors in examination papers.  I am not aware of the extent, or otherwise, of them this year.  I know there was an error in the junior certificate history paper.  The incorrect year was given in the essay section on various political leaders.  I understand that students were informed verbally of the error in the examination halls.  I do not know how many students were affected but in some schools, students with special requirements are located in outer rooms and I know of one case or two cases where such persons were not informed of the change.  In the first instance, there should not be a typographical error and papers should be fool-proof at this stage but if an error occurs, there must be a mechanism to ensure every student is informed.  In this case, the error was not earth shattering as it was a junior certificate examination but if the same happened in a leaving certificate paper, it could have had serious implications.  Some students may not have answered the question because it was incorrectly worded even though they could have answered it.  I am not sure whether the error generated publicity at the time.  </p> <p>  The second issue is in regard to scripts being opened up for perusal by students.  I raised the issue of the return of materials on the art course with the previous Minister for Education and Skills.  The scripts and materials are sent back to he schools where pupils can, quite rightly, view them.  I do not know what happens to them when they go back for re-examination or whatever but they may be destroyed.  I have been approached by the families of some students who would like the artwork to be returned to the students and I cannot see why their request cannot be facilitated.  For many of the students, it is probably the most important piece of artwork they will do in their career.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1207" speakername="Billy Timmins" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015062400002#G00700"><p>The artworks and materials are already in schools so it would be no problem for families to get them back.  Returning the items to students would save the SEC the difficulty of destroying them.  The items should be returned be it needlework, painting or whatever and I can see no reason not to do so.</p> <p>  Another important issue is the rechecking of examination papers.  Time and again I have encountered families who have sought a re-check but missed a course by the time an upgrade was granted.  As a result, students end up in places as far flung as Aberdeen or end up doing a different course.  In Britain, a re-check is done in such a timely fashion that it can be implemented in the same academic year.  Perhaps the matter is outside the remit of Mr. Burke and is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills or perhaps the teachers' unions</p><p>It is very unfair that if someone gets a mark in an examination that they sit in a particular year and the grade is raised, it is not taken into consideration for the CAO offer of college places for that year.  Surely, by the time the second round comes, it should be taken into account.  That should definitely be addressed.</p><p> My next point is anecdotal and may not be correct.  In the oral leaving certificate this year, I am told that one of the pieces might have been Donegal Irish.  I do not know if that was the case.  I do not know if there is a requirement in schools to do the various dialects, but if there is not, it is something that should be taken into consideration.  It is unfair if a school in Kerry is carrying out the Irish through Gaeilge Mumhan and the students are faced with Gaeilge Chonnacht or Gaeilge Donegal.  That may not be the case.  One student told me that and I do not know how true it is.</p><p> I also have a small technical point before I go onto my main point.  The changes to the travelling subsistence payment for supervisors this year were not articulated when they applied for the positions in the beginning.  They were in the small print later and the supervisors were not given leeway like the correctors were.  That has caused a bit of dissension.</p><p> My main point is particularly pertinent at leaving certificate level.  After the teachers mark their examination papers, they send in their first batch.  I do not know how it operates.  There are 50 or 100, or whatever.  I have been informed by correctors that very often the papers are returned to them and they are told to reduce the number of As or Bs.  I can understand that if the standard of marking is too lenient and is not standardised but there is a strong view from correctors that this is the bell curve coming into existence.  I have never been able to get to the bottom of this but there is an onus on the State Examinations Commission to publicly articulate not only the system of marking, but also the policy.  I know for a fact that last year's junior certificate biology papers were returned to the markers, who were instructed to reduce the number of Cs.  If it is a level playing field and everyone drops, that is fair, but I would hate to think that someone who might get a B in Kiltimagh would get an A in the same exam if they sat it in Gorey.  I see Mr. Burke shaking his head to say that does not happen but I would like to know why this policy exists in that case.  If it is because he is of the view that the marking is too lenient or too harsh, that is well and good, but the strong view I get from correctors is that the bell curve is coming into play.  If that is the case it is unfair but the State Examinations Commission should articulate fully what the position is.  I thank the Chairman for her indulgence.</p></speech>

The experience he has outlined is very relevant to his new role, as is the case for his fellow commissioners.  I am aware that the new commission was appointed through the new process under the Public Appointments Service, which is also very welcome.  Does Mr. Burke have any responses to the issues raised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Burke" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015062400002#H00300"><p>I will answer the questions in sequence and will try to be as straightforward as possible in my answers.  The first question related to using young teachers as opposed to retired teachers.  That is done.  Young unemployed teachers are given priority in the selection.  There is a tricky area here of ageism and there are constraints on how far one can go.  One cannot, for instance, rule someone out because they are over a certain age but it is permissible to give priority to unemployed young teachers or teachers with less than full hours and I am sure that is done.</p> <p>  I will now talk about the issue of reasonable accommodations, which was raised on a number of occasions.  There is no glib answer to this.  I would undertake that the new commission will look at this, get a full report from the State Examinations Commission executive, and satisfy ourselves that it is operating optimally.  Part of the difficulty is because at junior certificate level, the schools have discretion on this.  There is quite a loose - I am not using that word pejoratively - regime of special arrangements at junior certificate level.  That is legitimate enough, because the junior certificate is not high stakes.  It is not a competitive examination - an advantage to one student does not disadvantage another.  In real world terms, one can probably justify that.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that there is a tighter regime at leaving certificate level, with much stricter criteria.  I am not saying these criteria are perfect but let us take it that whatever scheme one has, one needs criteria, which must be applied objectively.  The criteria at leaving certificate level are tighter than they would be at junior certificate level.  There is little doubt about that.  That is for the good reason that there is a significant issue of inter-candidate equity and fairness at leaving certificate level, which is not the case at junior certificate level.  The one thing I am certain of is that the scheme is demand-led.  In so far as one can ever be certain in life, I am certain that the one thing that is not happening here is that somebody is trying to save a few bob by denying special accommodations.  I am pretty certain that is not happening.  It is a demand-driven scheme.  If somebody meets the criteria, they get the necessary arrangement.  Does the scheme need to be looked at?  A new commission should always look at everything under its remit.  With an open and honest objectivity, I undertake that we will do that and we will get a report.</p> <p>  Some issues have been raised by the Ombudsman.  There are issues of timing, there is no doubt about that.  Issues like that should, of course, be dealt with but with any scheme of special arrangements not everyone will be granted them and some of the arrangements being sought would probably compromise the test instrument.  We will approach this with an open mind.  The objective here is to be as fair and outreaching as possible to the special needs candidate, consistent with the requirement not to compromise the integrity of the test.  With that one stipulation, we will do as much as we can for the special needs candidate.  Within the culture of the State Examinations Commission and the people who work in that area, there is very much a pro-candidate ethos.  However, we agree that this is something we will review as a commission.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the online payment of examination fees is in train and should be.  Believe it or not, the giro system was a big initiative in its time, but it is very dated now.  There was a time when the kids were bringing either the medical card exemption or the examination payment into schools and schools were driven demented creating bank accounts for these fees, and so on, and that was changed in favour of a giro.  My understanding is that the idea now is to move to online payment and I expect progress on that shortly.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of the 25% extra for mathematics, I must confess that I was never sure when I was an official in the Department what the right thing to do with the bonus points was, because there is no absolute wisdom on this.</p></speech>

He could argue for a balance, that we could keep incentivising those taking higher level mathematics, but we could also do the same for other choices.  The allocation for mathematics capitulated to third level, which was the real purveyor of this.  However, it has come back to bite them because the situation is a bit up in the air now, between higher and lower levels, grades and lower level courses being harder than higher level courses.  It is about creativity and not necessarily about mathematics.  From an educational point of view, the Department should propose some kind of balance.  If 25 extra points are being allocated to mathematics, the same should be done for a language or arts subject.</p></speech>

However, the counterpoint, and I have the advantage of not arguing from a Department perspective now, is that the purpose behind the 25 point bonus was specifically to increase the uptake of higher level maths.  It has done that.  If we spread that around a range of other subjects, we would mute that impact.  If kids want to get the extra 25 bonus points, they do higher level maths.</p></speech>

Where are the studies that show that?  The Senator cannot say that, because we have no studies to show that.  We had an uptake.  Now we have a downtake and now we have a fail-pass take and a pass-fail honours take.  We have a pile of takes on it now.  Therefore, it cannot be said it has worked brilliantly because it had an uptake.  Ask the University of Limerick.  It has done a massive study on where it is at.  That study shows the uptake may be there, but the downtake in quality and in ability to add, subtract and multiply is very questionable.  That is my version of it.</p> <p>  We must wait for at least ten to 15 years and for studies on it to decide on its success.  Therefore I do not agree with it.  This is a beef of mine, but perhaps as the new chair of the State Examinations Commission, Mr. Burke would look at this.  Not everybody will choose to do music, because music needs massive ability to be able to do it at honours level.  Students would need to have been studying an instrument from the age of nine.  They must also learn the language of music and learn tempo.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the strict theology behind this is that this is a policy matter which descends from the Minister and the Department.  A strong argument existed that a proportion of kids doing ordinary level were scared of the higher level.  One would expect that as those kids now migrate to higher level, they will probably score the higher grade in the higher level, but in the C realm.  That is what we would expect.  What we are getting therefore as a policy objective is an exposure of a greater cohort of kids to higher level maths than we would have had previously.  With respect, that is a legitimate policy objective.</p></speech>

If we considered a similar system here, would the State Examinations Commission have the capacity to oversee such an initiative?</p></speech>

Obviously, any organisation, if it is well resourced, can probably undertake almost anything, but there is a huge pressure point in regard to the time deadlines.  This also arises in regard to some other issues.  Senator Craughwell mentioned the issue of bereavement.  Some issues in this regard are heartbreaking and I have seen that at first hand.  Awful things happen, often just at the time of an exam.  This has been a constant in the system over the years.  We do not have the capacity to run a repeat exam.  That leaves us with the question of whether there is some other way to provide a grade for kids in those circumstances.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that the commission cannot apply this discretion at individual level where there is documentary evidence to support the trauma a family may be going through at the particular time, particularly where a parent dies.  I will always admire my niece for how she came through her leaving certificate, having gone through this day in Dublin, day in Galway, type thing.</p></speech>

We now have the ability, if there is a national or localised problem, to run contingency papers or an alternative sitting.  However, the concept of dealing with an individual student who has suffered a bereavement or where something serious has happened on the day of the exam is very difficult.  Inexorably, this probably brings us in the direction of a repeat exam.  All things being equal, it is not that anyone would say a repeat exam is a bad idea.  After all, there are repeat exams at third level.  The difficulty we have is the immutable deadlines.</p></speech>

There were a number of other issues.  I take the point about the particular challenges we have in the area of languages and we are probably unusual in this country in having compulsory Irish, which may be a factor in the lower uptake of a multiplicity of languages than might otherwise be the case.  That is not an argument against compulsory Irish but an observation.<br/><br/>One question was on errors in the papers and the subject of the bell curve, and there is a slight connection between the two.  I will try to explain what our system is because one does not often hear it articulated.  In some jurisdictions there is a bell curve, where the top X% get grade A, the next grade B, the next grade C, etc.  They change the grade boundaries every year to ensure that happens and it might mean the boundaries for grade A are between 79% and 100% in a particular year.  That is an open and transparent thing but it is not the system we have.  We have a system that works on the assumption that, year by year, there is not a dramatic change in the cohort.  There may be slight variations but it would almost be perverse if the cohort for 2015 was appreciably different from the cohort for 2016.  One would have to ask why that would ever be the case as human beings do not alter in that way.  There is an expectation that, on a year-by-year basis, there will be a broad symmetry between the results, though it will not be absolute and there will be some variations.  <br/><br/>The marking commences with a marking scheme which is designed to reward fairly what the students do on their papers and to result in an outcome that is not materially different from the preceding year or two.  That does not mean that, over a period of time, things do not change in incremental steps because they do.  Sometimes there is a syllabus change and that brings about something more material.  If it emerges during the marking that we are getting a very significantly different outcome from the preceding year alarm bells ring.  It can be because there is something up with the paper, such as a question that is phrased badly.  In such a case the scheme is openly and transparently changed to reflect that.  The marking scheme is the piece of equipment our system uses to generate a fair outcome.  Some jurisdictions change the grading bands but we change the scheme in the way I have just described.  There are arguments for and against both systems.  It should mean that if in a given year - and it happens every year - there is a question that seems to throw a sizeable proportion of kids or is confusing it is, quite legitimately and transparently, dealt with in the marking scheme.  <br/><br/>There is not a bell curve but we do accept, as a legitimate proposition, that there should not be 25% getting grades A, B and C in one year while 50% get those grades in the next year.  It would be bizarre if that happened and it would only happen if there was something really strange in the test instrument and it tested the second cohort of kids less onerously than the first.  That is the best answer I can give to the question on the bell curve and it also partly answers the points about questions that throw kids.<br/><br/>The other question was on errors.  The fundamental problem with exam papers is that not that many people see them and that is for good reasons.  When I ran exams I never saw an exam paper and would not have wanted to see one until there was a problem with it after the event, in which case I would take it home.  Before the event, very few people actually see exam papers.  In some countries they pre-test exam papers but this is not that common and there would be all sorts of security risks.  There will inevitably be some <i>errata</i>but they should always be marginal.  If there was a serious mistake one would have to question whether the paper was fit for purpose and consider applying the contingency paper in substitution for the actual paper.<br/><br/>The purpose of sending in the batches is for individual examiners.  A supervisory regime applies.</p></speech>

Everybody's artwork is returned to the school so that students are afforded the opportunity to look at it.  Only a certain percentage look for a re-check.  After the re-check it is sent back up to the Department and even if a student does not ask for a recheck it is destroyed somewhere in the Department.  I cannot see the worry about it being destroyed in transit as it has been transported up and down already.  If a grade A student, who will not look for a re-check, wants their artwork it should stay at the school and be given back.</p></speech>

It is a foot-to-the-floor operation.  A certain timescale is allowed for the marking of the exams and, in the interest of safety, it cannot be shortened.  The results usually come out in mid-August, as quickly as is humanly possible.  My instinct is not to try to put pressure on those timescales because I would be worried that quality might suffer.  Immediately after the results come out there is a week when the CAO is executing.  We introduced the facility for candidates to come along and look at the marked scripts, which usually takes approximately two weeks from the results coming out.  It is probably no harm to allow that two weeks because many of these kids have got their CAO offerings, are quite happy and do not want to see these scripts again in their lives.</p><p>However, some kids will want to look at them.  All of that happens, which pushes back the timescales.  We are hitting September at that stage and then the appeal marking takes place.  The problem with the appeal marking is that some courses will be full.  I know this from experience in the past.  This can be a particular problem with pharmaceutical and medical courses.  In other courses, the kids might be a bit late starting, or they will be allowed to change from where they are into another one. I am not saying it is not a problem, but it tends to be a problem in a small enough and limited number of instances.  I just do not see where we can make the time savings without sacrificing quality.  That is my worry.  Third level institutions now have a modular approach.  I do not know if that makes it somewhat easier to start a little later.</p></speech>

I compliment the fact that we have dealt with the Kingsmill documents but it is a disgrace that the British have hidden documents.  This means that they are still participating in collusion.  If they continue to deny documentation and conceal evidence with regard to atrocities and terrorism - and this was state terrorism by the British - they are a participant and are as guilty of collusion as those who participated in the actual bombings.  I think we should be unequivocal about this.  There is a unanimous decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with regard to this issue, which has been ignored by the British now for some ten years.  It is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

The written request was to this committee.  It is an international matter between two sovereign governments.  We referred it to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement so that it would not feel we had ignored its remit.  Primarily it is a function of this committee.  We referred it on the basis that we would meet jointly with that committee if that was its wish and if not that we would meet on it ourselves.  I am looking for it to be on the agenda next week so that we do not have a debate like this under the minutes heading next week.  It is more important than that.

We get requests all the time from people who want to meet us but as Deputy Durkan said, they might not be matters for our committee, for example the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is a matter for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have to distinguish what each committee does.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#B04200"><p>I will go through the briefing document which we have sent to the committee and my colleague and I will then be happy to answer any questions from the members.</p> <p>  The briefing dealt with expanding Ireland&rsquo;s trade with ASEAN.  Our focus today will be on suggested solutions to clear problems that exist in Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with ASEAN.  We welcome the opportunity to brief the committee in its deliberations on expanding Ireland&rsquo;s trade with ASEAN.</p><p>Although starting from a low base, there is enormous market potential for Ireland in the key global economic growth region of Asia.  Although Europe and the US are now understandably the key priority markets, the Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia will double its share of global GDP to 52% by 2050.  Currently, a third of global wealth and two thirds of the global population are in Asia.  ASEAN alone has a combined population of 625 million, 8.8% of the world&rsquo;s population, with 3.49% in Indonesia alone.  Ireland needs to establish a strong presence in Asia and ASEAN for the future integrity of the Irish economy.</p><p> Asia Matters would like to advise the committee on the significant progress made since last presenting to the committee on 30 January 2013 and update on recommendations to expand trade with the broader Asia region with a specific focus on ASEAN.  Asia Matters was founded to fulfil the need for Ireland to have a dedicated Asia institute focused on business.  It works collectively for the national good as part of team Ireland with all key stakeholders.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has commended the work of Asia Matters as a valuable asset for Ireland in developing dynamic business links and informed understanding between Asia and Ireland.</p><p> Asia Matters is a not-for-profit, non-political, economic institute based in Dublin, dedicated to developing Ireland-Asia business relations and acting as an articulate voice registering Irish public policy within an EU-Asia context.  As an educational think tank, Asia Matters works in close partnership with Government and business and academic stakeholders in Ireland, the EU and across Asia.  The chairman is Alan Dukes, former Irish Minister for Finance, and I am the executive director.  Separate to Asia Matters, I have the privilege of being the honorary consul of the Republic of Indonesia in Ireland.</p><p> Asia Matters has shown a strong commitment to ASEAN since its foundation and was officially launched 10 May 2012 in the embassy of the Philippines in Dublin.  With a country focus on ASEAN+5, which are China, Japan, Korea, India and Mongolia, Asia Matters has good working relations with the ten ASEAN countries, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, although clearly these countries would have different priority rankings for Irish trade subject to sectors of interest.</p><p> Asia Matters provides a vital role in supporting Ireland by facilitating the development of enhanced partnership by Irish interests in EU-Asia business and cultural relations through engaging with a high-level Asian peer community in business, government and academic sectors.  As Ireland develops its partnership engagement with Asia, Asia Matters works with Irish diplomatic missions and business development agencies to raise awareness of the vast opportunities in key Asian markets.  Asia Matters delivers essential business learning for key stakeholders through briefings, conferences, policy research and publications.  To date, it has organised 51 briefings, 22 conferences and three Ireland-Asia business yearbooks, the annual book of reference for Asia-Ireland trade relations.  The recent edition, of which members have a hard copy, includes commentary from the Taoiseach and five Irish Government Ministers, along with profiles of the ten ASEAN countries, reflecting collective partnership and good working relations.</p><p> The year 2014 was a pivotal one for the work of the institute.  Asia Matters commissioned a report on unlocking Asia's trade potential for Ireland with economist Marc Coleman, which provides a benchmark for Ireland's Asia engagement and maps opportunities for future trade and investment.  This report outlines the need to: create a much broader awareness of brand Ireland in targeted sectors in key Asian markets; focus our market engagement in five sectors where Ireland has competitive advantage, namely, food and agritech, education and skills, tourism, ICT and international financial services; promote Ireland as the Asian business valley for Europe and expand the role of existing multinational companies to take on Asia responsibilities; comprehensively update our Asia trade strategy through collective stakeholder engagement to maximise the business potential of key relations; and build Asia competencies through educational programmes and graduate and young professional placements.  It is very unfortunate that the excellent Irish F&Aacute;S programme in Japan and the Farmleigh fellowship programmes based in Singapore have now ceased.</p><p> At EU level, Asia Matters took its signature EU-Asia top economist round table series, TERT, to Beijing for the first time and ran its second in the series in Tokyo.  The events reached an audience of over 500 key delegates and featured CEO-level speakers from top companies such as Airbus, Nokia, People's Bank of China, BASF, BNP Paribas, Nissan and Philips.  Asia Matters has now completed six successful TERTs, establishing Ireland as a key player in EU-Asia trade relations. The year of the sheep, 2015, looks set to be a landmark year for Ireland's engagement with its partners across Asia.  On the domestic front, Ireland is projected to be the fastest growing economy in the EU following years of contraction.  This growth will breed positivity internally and drive Ireland's positive brand in external markets.  The year began on a positive note for Ireland's Asia engagement with the conference, Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World, in Dublin Castle on 12-14 January.  On the invitation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Asia Matters took part in the forum and contributed our views and feedback from our network on upping Ireland's engagement with Asia.  Again, key themes echoed those highlighted by Asia Matters in our recent economic report, namely, education and global talent, food and agritech, tourism, ICT and international financial services.  The event was an excellent initiative allowing Government, business and civil society stakeholders to discuss possible paths forward to progress Ireland-Asia engagement.</p><p> The team at Asia Matters spends a third of the year in Asia as we deem it very important to be in Asia and to keep up to date with what is happening on the ground with local partners.  To date in 2015 the team has visited seven ASEAN cities from a total of 13 Asian cities, working closely with Irish diplomatic missions and team Ireland on the ground.  Asia Matters looks forward to continuing its role in boosting Ireland-Asia engagement in 2015 through its flagship Asia Business Week Ireland and other events and publications.  The 2015 edition of Asia Business Week Ireland will take place in July and will focus on the five key areas of growth.  Reflecting the collective team Ireland approach, there are six Irish Government Ministers, one European Commissioner and 30 Government agencies and business organisations participating.  In relation to ASEAN, a major development for 2015 is the ASEAN Economic Community, AEC, which is due to come into force under Malaysia&rsquo;s chairmanship.  Significantly, the EU and ASEAN have announced a resumption of their FTA talks with stocktaking planned for late 2015.  Following a seventh TERT in Dublin in July and an eighth TERT in Tokyo in November, Asia Matters plans to bring its signature EU-Asia TERT series to ASEAN in 2016 to continue to brand Ireland as an integral part of Europe and a trusted business partner for Asia.</p><p> I will move on to an update on recommendations made to this committee on 30 January 2013, taking into account developments in the past two years.  We are making ten recommendations.  One is to seek creative ways to overcome resource challenges to bridge the competitive gap to drive Irish business with Asia.  Ireland has started its engagement with Asia and ASEAN relatively late compared with other countries.  For cultural and geographical reasons, Ireland has largely no historical relations with Asia, although equally no colonial baggage. The shining light in the relationship is the number of Irish in religious orders who went to Asia as educators, contributing to some of the finest academic institutions and educating some of the most talented young people in Asia, a number of whom have gone on to assume leadership roles within their countries.  </p><p> Asia is only now beginning to feature on the Irish business radar.  The Irish Government is taking the lead in developing relations and yet compared to competitors, Ireland has limited presence and resources, so it is critical to seek creative ways, such as public private partnerships, to overcome resource and other challenges to bridge this competitive gap to drive Irish business with Asia.  A good example of this collective partnership was in 2012, when the APIBF business directory was produced In Ireland by myself and Mr. Peter Ryan, now Ireland's consul general in Hong Kong and Macau, with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This was an initiative of the Ireland-Japan Chamber of Commerce, a good example of both sides working together for the greater good.  Within ASEAN, Ireland is primarily concentrating its resources on Singapore, followed by Malaysia.  From this solid foundation, enhanced by the new missions in Indonesia and Thailand, we need to expand a greater, targeted regional presence to capitalise on the growing opportunities in Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar.</p><p>There could be a valuable role for team Ireland graduates or young professionals in Asia programmes, as recommended in the Asia Matters economic report of October 2014.</p><p> As we have seen on the ground, team Ireland in Asia works best when all agency and chamber representation is located in one building, the same location as the Embassy of Ireland, normally called Ireland House, with the Irish ambassador leading the team.  Tokyo is a good example of how this is done effectively.  Ireland needs to find a cost-effective and time-effective way to create a local presence to show that we are serious and drive business for Ireland.  For example, the Indonesian Government has allocated 20% of its annual budget to education.  Indonesia is sending students to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom but not Ireland.  If we were to allocate an education attach&eacute; to the Irish Embassy in Jakarta, he or she could fully focus on closing off a government to government MOU on education which would lead to significant numbers of Indonesian students coming to Ireland.  Such an appointment could involve secondment from a Department, Government agency or educational institution and-or could be co-funded or fully funded by the education sector in Ireland.  Irish education experts in Asia with clear competence could also be ideal candidates to fill the role.</p><p> Our second recommendation is to open an Irish Embassy in Manila and encourage ASEAN countries to open an embassy in Dublin.  In the 2013 briefing Asia Matters recommended opening new diplomatic missions in Jakarta, Bangkok and Manila.  It is significant that the new missions in Jakarta and Bangkok, led by very senior Irish diplomats, are already creating a very positive impact on the ground as focal points for Ireland which will drive business development.  It is clear that in the near future both Indonesia and Thailand plan to reciprocally open embassies in Ireland, creating a virtuous circle which will encourage more ASEAN countries to open an embassy in Ireland.  There is only one ASEAN embassy in Dublin, that of Malaysia.  It is clear that a London-based embassy responsible for Ireland, in addition to the United Kingdom, is stretched to commit the time and resources that it would wish to allocate to Ireland.  While we work very closely with the ASEAN ambassadors in London - they are sincerely committed to Ireland - it is a question of time and resources.  Vietnam is an example of a country that has committed significant time and resources to Ireland.  With our effective ambassador on the ground, we now have a very positive situation where Vietnam has moved from an aid to a trade country relationship.</p><p> It is now an important priority to open an embassy in Manila because of the importance of the Philippines and the need for local engagement with the Asian Development Bank to ensure Ireland receives its share of ADB contracts.  I recently visited the ADB in Manila and came across a particular opportunity for Ireland in the food and agri-tech sector.  It was a contract valued at US$2 million and the person in charge was not aware of Ireland's expertise in the food and agri-tech sector.  This is the kind of opportunity local people on the ground can unearth.  Obviously, I reported back to the relevant agencies in Ireland.</p><p> The third recommendation is to update Ireland&rsquo;s Asia strategy for the next five to 15 years, with specific plans for the next three to five years through collective engagement with key stakeholders in Ireland and Asia.  The original Asia trade strategy 1999 to 2009 created an excellent focus.  Although Asia has been incorporated into Irish Government reports and agency strategies, with a number of key bilateral agreements and economic forums, there is a need for a comprehensive updated national Asia trade strategy.</p><p> The fourth recommendation is to appoint a senior political-administration figure to co-ordinate a national Asia trade strategy.  In 2013 Asia Matters made this recommendation to the committee.  This political-administration figure, for example, a Minister of State, could work for Ireland within the EU-Asia context and engage with all Departments, Government agencies and key external stakeholders to co-ordinate trade, education, tourism and cultural activities.  The highly impressive work of the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, who has special responsibility for international banking, including the IFSC, and his leadership in creating the IFS strategy 2020, with a clear objective to create 10,000 further jobs in Ireland's financial services sector, is an excellent role model in this regard.</p><p> The fifth recommendation is to support the development of direct air links between Dublin and Asian capitals.  Regarding ASEAN, Bangkok is the obvious choice to progress, with almost 70,000 Irish visitors flying there annually.  There are no direct flights from Dublin to Asia.  By comparison - we understand the geography involved - there are more than 20 direct flights from Helsinki to Asia weekly.  Finnair started its first direct flights to Japan in 1983.  Competitively, we have a job of work to do.</p><p> The sixth recommendation is to move online to ensure a positive visa process for ASEAN business visitors and tourists.  The visa process is cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive.  While, of course, security protocols must be respected in terms of who is approved to enter Ireland, scanned passports and other e-friendly processes should be enhanced for bona fide applicants, particularly when applying from other countries or countries within which the physical distance is substantial.</p><p> The seventh recommendation is to create a three year forward plan of ministerial visits to key ASEAN cities and reciprocally seek to invite targeted ASEAN peer leaders to visit Ireland.  The priority focus, understandably, is on China, with a limited number of high level visits to or from ASEAN countries.  As with all of Asia, government is highly respected and enhanced visits by senior Irish figures would be a clear driver of business partnership opportunities.  Forward planning would allow maximisation of the business impact and create a multiplier effect.  For example, when in Singapore, a senior official could visit the Asia Europe Foundation, of which Ireland is a member.  The foundation is very active in the educational and cultural spheres.  Given how embedded Japanese business is across ASEAN countries and the pending role of the new China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, in which ASEAN countries will be a key focus, third party country visits by Ministers could also be maximised to explore how Ireland could partner with these countries in ASEAN markets.</p><p> The eighth recommendation is to follow the lead of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland by employing Asian staff in key Departments.  Chinese and Japanese staff in these Irish agencies play a very valuable role.  Within the cost limitations and resource structures, there is an opportunity to have some fixed-term exchanges with intern staff from peer agencies in Asian countries.  This could greatly enhance the understanding of ASEAN countries.</p><p> The ninth recommendation is to create ASEAN language content on websites for Departments and trade agencies.  This follows the logic of internships and exchanges with peiople from ASEAN countries.  I am sure members are familiar with the expression &ldquo;you buy in your own language; you sell in the customer&rsquo;s language&rdquo;.  If we are serious about selling to ASEAN countries, we must have content in their languages.  Tourism would be an obvious focus.</p><p> The tenth and final recommendation is to create multiple friendship agreements between cities, educational institutions and cultural bodies between Ireland and ASEAN countries.  Given the resource limitations, the objective is to create friendship agreements rather than twinning links around specific projects - they could be short-term - such as a Dublin-Bangkok direct flight and to create a national plan to twin Irish educational institutions and cultural bodies with Asian counterparts to enhance people to people relations.  This should be time fixed and target focused.  In the education sector it is obvious that educational institutions are essentially selling the same products within the same markets.</p><p>  Ireland needs to appoint a senior figure such as a Minister of State to consult and create an updated Asia trade strategy until 2020 which would co-ordinate the work of Government and non-Government stakeholders in a collective manner to overcome resource challenges in order that team Ireland can work better together on clear deliverables in key markets to bridge the competitive gap in Asia and essentially punch above our weight.  As the Irish expression goes, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile - there is no strength without unity.</p></speech>

Many presentations and submissions are made to us and this might be the third time we have addressed this topic.  I would not have a reputation for patronising people but it is probably one of the best and most focused presentations we have had, with clear recommendations and clear arguments underpinning them.</p> <p>  I have a few questions on the presentation.  I note that Mr. Murray mentions ASEAN+5.  I also note that recently Taiwan made overtures about having greater direct links to Ireland.  I wonder why it would be excluded from Asia Matters' particular countries of remit.  Would Mr. Murray have a view on that?  I am aware there are some political sensitivities with China.  Mr. Murray might like to comment on it?</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Mr. Murray comment that the F&Aacute;S programme in Japan and a fellowship programme which ceased.  Could he give a little more information the benefits of those and the reasons, in his understanding, they were discontinued?</p> <p>  We had a brand Ireland debate previously with a number of people.  What is the best way for us to harness an awareness and create a brand for Ireland?  This is a small island and sometimes we forget that.  Maybe we have influence beyond our size.  In many parts of Asia, one finds that not a lot is known about Ireland once one starts talking to the populace generally but there seems to be a connection with our music, musicians and bands.  I presume those who follow sport would have some knowledge of our sports personnel, particularly the fact that we are prominent in the golf arena.  I note Riverdance created quite an impact.  I wonder how can the State utilise the awareness of that, and achieve an attachment to Ireland, because sometimes the link with Ireland is not known to those who are aware of these particular bands or individuals.</p> <p>  Is language an issue?  Mr. Murray mentioned competencies in the educational programme and he also mentioned culture.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray raised in the recommendations what we would call the one-stop-shop of having an Ireland building, and he mentioned Japan as being a good example in that regard.  Has he had discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this regard and what responses is he getting because this strikes me as a good recommendation that we should be following up with the Department?  Obviously, there are synergies to be achieved from having staff working together where the symbiosis is greater than the individual attentions.  All Mr. Murray's recommendations have a great deal of merit and are ones we should be following up.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray mentioned the food and agritech sectors.  It is a little extraordinary in that it is one of our strong sectors.  When a committee visited Singapore recently, we became aware of companies, particularly the Kerry Group, which have an involvement in Malaysia.  It is significant that the Asian Development Bank, ADB, was unaware of our food and agritech expertise and, indeed, our leadership in that area.  Mr. Murray reported back, I presume, to the Department.  I would be interested to hear if the Department came back to him and what follow up was given in that regard.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray mentioned a move to online to ensure a positive visa process for ASEAN business visitors and tourists.  We have heard this from a number of sources, even those who have come in from some of those countries.  At this stage, should we join Schengen, forget about any inhibitions with Britain and let Britain do what it wants but act independently?  Is it to our serious disadvantage from both tourist and business points of view that we are not part of Schengen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1724" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#E00300"><p>I support absolutely the comments of the previous speaker, with whom I do not always agree on many issues, about Mr. Martin Murray's dedication and leadership in developing relations between the Asian countries and the Republic of Ireland.  I am half-embarrassed but must apologise that I will not be here to go to his conference in July.  However, I am conscious of the number of conferences he organises.  I am also conscious that he stands out as a representative of this country working in a phenomenally productive way with all of the agencies.  I concur with Senator Walsh's congratulations on Mr. Murray's presentation as it is comprehensive and well-thought out.  It is a document that we can literally ratify and pass on to the various Departments, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I thank Mr. Murray's organisation for doing such a professional job.</p> <p>  I will pick up some of the points Mr. Murray made that rankle with me.  We have dealt with education on quite a number of occasions and questions have been asked about the Irish higher educational structures, whether they are competing and whether there is a single umbrella organisation that can sell Ireland Inc.'s incredibly good and valuable educational standards to Asian students.  I understand from a previous presentation that there was a course, either run in Cork or Galway, which ended.  It was suggested that the Higher Education Authority had pulled the plug.  I made some inquiries but did not get any answers.  Maybe Mr. Murray could brief us, if he is familiar with whatever that course was.  It was to do with Asian matters.</p> <p>  It is a fact, as Mr. Murray states, that religious orders, such as Columban Fathers, have created an educational system in some of these Asian countries that is the envy of many countries in the world.  Having visited Korea, one of the few countries in that region I have visited, I am aware that the Columban Fathers are recognised there as having created the finest educational structures and institutions for the people of Korea.  That clearly indicates strong potential linkages not only between the religious but between those with a history of the involvement of the Columban Fathers and educational institutions in Ireland, which are the source of the Columban Fathers' work in Korea.  I fully accept the point that we must capitalise on these positive relationships.  </p> <p>  I am familiar with Brazil.  The Brazilian Government, for example, has sanctioned a provision by which Ireland will benefit from 1,000 higher education students under the Science without Borders programme.  Somebody has collectively negotiated with the Brazilians for 1,000 high-level students to come to Ireland under a programme.  I note other countries do it.  For example, Saudi Arabia's King Salman sends students abroad.  Where are we missing out in Asia?  My understanding is that there are great working relationships, for example, between Malaysian students and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on St. Stephen's Green.  There seem to be strong relations with some Asian countries.  I suspect many of these students, who are mainly women, come from Malaysia.  Mr. Murray might tell me whether that is another area we can develop in the health field.</p><p> Does Asia Matters carry out comparisons between the richest and poorest countries?   I am very attached to Laos.  I have never been there but I have been to Vietnam.  I understand that a programme was initiated between the Dublin Institute of Technology and Laos, which is a very poor country and needs this infrastructure.  The relationship concerned the hospitality industry, catering, the management of hotels and tourism.  This is an area in which we are supreme leaders.  Through the grapevine, I understand that, tragically, that deal is collapsing or the Laotian Government is not pushing it as well as it could.  Is there any truth in that?  Could it be saved?  Laos needs this relationship with Ireland.  It clearly cannot compete in tourism, etc., even though it has the potential to compete with neighbouring countries like Vietnam, which is progressing at a magnificent rate.  We entertained very high-ranking Vietnamese ministers who came to Ireland to study the free trade zone in Shannon and other areas of governance, so we have some relationships there.  </p><p> How does Asia Matters deal with the difficulties we experience because of the language issue?  Our educational institutions are not catering adequately in terms of educating students in the languages required.  Internships or relationships were mentioned.  I have had a very happy experience with Dublin City Council, which is twinned with Beijing.  The mayor's office in Beijing sent three people, two women and a man, to Dublin City Council for a six-month internship.  They worked in relevant areas.  I am not sure whether Dublin City Council reciprocated.  It was a very clear insight into the work that these three people from the mayor's office were able to do.  The point that we should extend these internship relationships to a vast range of other public bodies and governmental institutions is very well taken.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1726" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#F00200"><p>I congratulate the witnesses on a very good report and what seem like very practical recommendations, of which there are 12.  It is the first time I have heard them.  Deputy Crowe would have been here when the witnesses made a previous presentation.  As they are so practical, why has there been a delay in implementing them?  If one goes through each of the points, one sees that there is a logic behind each one.  In some ways, there is a value-for-money element outlined in the case made by the witnesses without putting a cost on them.  Is Asia Matters experiencing bureaucratic or political delay or is it just that sometimes on an international field, things move slowly?</p> <p>  I know of some students who have benefitted from educational exchanges.  I have met them here and abroad.  I know there is concern among some people who travel to Ireland given the bad reputation of foreign language schools.  In some ways, some of the countries are loath to make any new arrangements or agreements with universities until we sort out our own issues around the standardisation of such schools and some type of protection and insurance policy to protect those who are then left high and dry.  It is then that the type of counsellor service recommended by the witnesses is called on to deliver and sometimes send students who have paid a fortune to get here back home again.  That is one of the other questions I have.  One of the best recommendations not just in terms of the area the witnesses are concerned with but other areas as well is the experience people have when they come to Ireland.  If somebody has a good experience, they will go back to their home country and brag about it.  If they have a bad experience, it can do untold damage that sometimes takes years to correct.  How can we enhance the experience of students and business people from that region who arrive in Ireland because that is a challenge in itself?  </p> <p>  The fact that we do not have direct flights were was mentioned.  Since last week, or the week before, we no longer control Aer Lingus, but that is a different matter.  Quite a number of flights stop over.  A significant amount of Irish emigrants and tourists travel to Australia and New Zealand.  How do we get the people who are travelling that far to stop over in ASEAN countries rather than Abu Dhabi?  I think I stopped over in Kuala Lumpur many years ago and enjoyed the experience.  </p> <p>  A significant number of Filipinos live in Ireland and work in our health system.  They send money home because the Philippines is a very poor country.  How do we capitalise on that and how do they capitalise on it?  Do the witnesses see any increase or major progress we can achieve in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1727" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#F00300"><p>I apologise for my absence for a short period of time.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before us this morning and compliment them on their promotion of business with ASEAN countries.  One only has to glance at that publication to realise fully the huge potential that exists in terms of population.  India and China have a combined population of 2.5 billion - not million but billion.  They are increasing productivity and GDP and are increasing in global importance.  There are huge opportunities that have already been availed of but there are certainly many more opportunities.</p><p>The Irish trailblazers are an interesting example.  Japan has a large population of 125 million people.  Its GDP<i>per capita </i>is &euro;30,000, which is almost comparable to our standards.  Companies like Glen Dimplex which blazed a trail there when it was not fashionable to do so are examples to many more companies throughout this country because it shows what can be done if the application, willingness, dedication and perseverance is there.  Glen Dimplex has done that very successfully not only in Japan but all over the globe.  It has 10,000 employees worldwide.  I was at a presentation last week that may have been attended by the Chairman when the former chief executive was given an award.  If one could identify a promo that was more positive for a country than that presented by Glen Dimplex on that occasion, I have yet to see it.  It was the most impressive example I have ever seen in terms of promoting the country, product and business acumen of Irish entrepreneurs and emphasising the humble beginnings of a company that started in a garage in County Louth and reached international standards in a way that is hugely impressive.  I ask that every effort be made to build on the contacts that have already been made to ensure that every Irish company can gain a foothold in those markets.</p><p>That would be hugely beneficial to us as a nation in our quest to achieve full employment.  Full employment may have been a myth some years ago, but when we get our business structures properly organised and the economy growing sustainably over a period of time, it will follow, as will a dramatic increase in the population, all of which will be of huge economic benefit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#G00200"><p>I apologise for being late, but I have read the briefing.  I was struck by the disparity between a country like Laos and somewhere like Singapore.  I am trying to get my head around including all of that great variety within a single agreement.  The presentation referred to the three pillars of security, economics and socio-cultural matters.  I wonder where human rights comes into it.  Where are due diligence, labour rights and labour laws?  In some of the countries in question there are very severe human rights abuses, particularly of women and children.  I refer, in particular, to the Philippines and Myanmar.  We see great numbers of children working at ages when they should not be.  It is terrible abuse.  Where is the voice of Asia Matters on these issues?  I may have missed it in reading the briefing, but where is the reference to Taiwan?  Is it included somewhere?  My other issue concerns Sri Lanka, a country in which, again, there are significant human rights abuses.  Is it worth mentioning North Korea?  Is there even a slight engagement or any way that what is happening might lead to an opening up in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#G00300"><p>I apologise for being delayed at an earlier meeting, which is why my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, led off.  </p> <p>  I agree with the contributions made on the excellence of the presentation and its focus.  I refer to the education issue.  Asia Matters asks if the appointment of an Irish education attach&eacute; would be useful.  It is a useful concept.  During the years different embassies in different countries have had an agriculture or an industry attach&eacute;, as appropriate to the relevant country.  Given the huge potential for the provision of educational services and students coming to the country, it is an area that merits detailed consideration.</p> <p>  Senator Jim Walsh referred to the "brand Ireland" concept.  At times we can delude ourselves about the level of knowledge in some countries about our presence and particular strengths in manufacturing and exports.  In that context, I said during earlier presentations that we needed to sell the entire island of Ireland as a single entity.  It is farcical if there is competition between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.  People in these markets may know about Ireland, but they will certainly not know about the context of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  On that subject, the work of Asia Matters seems to be based on our own state as such, but that is far from being a criticism of the organisation.  I see that it has held events in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere in the South.  Is there a Northern Ireland or an all-Ireland dimension to the organisation?  If not, I would love to see Asia Matters push out the boundaries to change its architecture to embrace an all-Ireland context.  At times, non-governmental organisations are focused and based on the configuration of statutory agencies, but sometimes we need them to push out the boundaries.  They might achieve things more quickly than state-to-state or statutory agencies, which are very proprietorial.  I hope Asia Matters in its work focuses on an all-Ireland context.  I always tell the statutory agencies that come before the joint committee that the State will not lose if there is the utmost co-operation between Invest Northern Ireland and the Department of Investment, Trade and Enterprise in Northern Ireland, on the one hand, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and statutory agencies here, on the other.  If inward investment comes to Northern Ireland, it is beneficial to the South.  Similarly, foreign direct investment in the South is beneficial to all of Ireland.  If we can grow export markets that companies in Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland can access, it will be beneficial to the State.  When I say I hope Asia Matters in its work focuses on an all-Ireland context, it is not a criticism but a suggestion.</p></speech>

There is also a lot of information, but I hope Mr. Murray can answer the many questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#G00500"><p>I appreciate the input of members.  I will go through the questions systematically and as quickly as I can.  If I may, I will leave the "brand Ireland" concept to my colleague, Ms Stephanie FitzGerald-Smith, our director of marketing and communications, who has significant expertise in the matter.  </p> <p>  I thank Senator Jim Walsh for his positive comments.  He mentioned the clarity of the recommendations, which was our purpose.  We know committee members are busy, as is everyone else.</p> <p>  We mention Taiwan in our economic report, albeit in a small summary context on page 57.  Like everyone else, we are limited by resources and time, but we have nothing but goodwill towards Taiwan and its people.  We see it as a very good trading partner for Ireland.  As Asia Matters is non-political, we do not get involved in politics.  Certainly, we have had discussions with Taiwanese representatives here on how we can conduct business events together.  We are very open to this.  We have a very open mind and, as I say, our focus is on trade, not politics.</p> <p>  I was asked about F&Aacute;S and Farmleigh.  Over 30 years ago Ireland created an amazing programme in Japan which was called the "F&Aacute;S graduate programme" whereby young engineers from Ireland were funded by the State on placements for two years in the best global Japanese companies in the world, including Mitsubishi and Panasonic.  While there, they learned the language and about the culture and the Japanese way of doing business.  A very good example of the benefits, apart from the networks, access and market understanding, is Mr. Greg Timmons, a programme graduate and now CEO of Takeda Ireland, which has two plants here.  He went into the company, learned how it worked and developed good relationships.  He is a very smart, capable and professional person and they were so impressed by the calibre of Irish graduates that they asked him if he could open a company here.  He was so successful that they opened a second.  It is a great tribute to Ireland and the quality of our education, as well as personally to Mr. Timmons, that the second plant manufactures tablets and medical products for the Japanese market.  It is done not from within Japan but from with Ireland such is the trust in the calibre of the leadership and workforce here.  It is a very good example, but, unfortunately, the programme closed after big issues arose with F&Aacute;S.  The baby was thrown out with the bath water, which was a terrible mistake.  We had spent over 20 years developing relations with the big Japanese companies by sending Irish graduates.  When I lived in Japan, the programme was the envy of the USA and all other European countries.  They all wanted to know how we had done it, yet we closed it down.  It was very damaging to the relationship and resurrecting would take time and effort and regard for Japan's sensitivity.  There is a certain way to do it with the Japanese, but closing the programme in that way was a big mistake.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1734" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Murray" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015062400002#G00700"><p>About three or four years ago, when F&Aacute;S was terminated as an entity.  </p> <p>  I was also asked about Farmleigh.  It was a very good education programme within UCC which was followed up in Singapore.  As to why it finished, we hear different reasons, but the original concept was that Irish graduates would be trained in Ireland, learn language skills, go to Singapore and work in companies there.  In reality, they ended up working primarily with Irish companies in Singapore, although that had its own advantages.</p><p>The problem, if my understanding is correct, arose from the Singapore side not buying into scheme.  It was assumed large numbers of Singapore graduates would come here but, in reality, they wanted to go to Harvard or Oxford.  There were some structural issues in terms of how the programme was all put together.  Nevertheless, it has produced a number of talented Irish graduates in the region.</p><p> My colleague will deal with the questions on the brand Ireland concept.</p><p> It was noted that we are a small island and there needs to be a more joined-up approach.  I absolutely agree.  A key conclusion of the Dublin Castle discussions with the Irish heads of mission was the need for everybody to work together to create the critical momentum where we do things of significance.  Asia Business Week Ireland is an example of this, with a lot of things happening at the same time.  Senator Walsh pointed out that for many Asian people, there is a connection with music when it comes to their perception of Ireland.  That certainly is an avenue to explore.  It is another area with potential for co-operation.  This year, we are staging an Asia fashion event in Ireland to reciprocally show Ireland's creativity and expertise in this sphere.  The fashion world is very important.</p><p> Reference was made to the Riverdance theatrical production, which is made up of very talented people.  It is a highly successful commercial organisation with enormous goodwill towards Ireland.  I understand the Riverdance production team plans its programme a long time in advance.  Perhaps Tourism Ireland might work with the people involved to plan its own promotion programme to coincide with the staging of the show in different cities.  I recall coming out of the Riverdance production in Tokyo alongside thousands of happy Japanese people and thinking this would be the perfect time for somebody to be giving out brochures in Japanese telling them all about Ireland.  It is all about that type of joined-up thinking and working together.</p><p> I will ask Ms FitzGerald-Smith to respond to the questions about language barriers and so on.  She has fluency in Mandarin and I am fluent in Japanese.  She is probably better able to comment on language as an issue.</p><p> We have seen how the one-stop-shop or Ireland House idea works on the ground.  In Japan and Korea, for example, it has been very effective.  With the greatest respect, however, some Asian cities are so large and the traffic issues so difficult that the time taken simply to get from one place to another reduces the impact of having VIPs coming to meet the ambassador and bringing everybody together.</p><p> I, too, was surprised that the individual referred to in the Asian Development Bank was clearly not aware of Ireland's food and agritech expertise.  Perhaps it points to how busy we are between the inbox and work schedules and unless we make a focused effort of targeted promotion to key people, we will not get the recognition we are seeking.  In the case of this particular individual, I did not really ask anything about it for fear of causing that person embarrassment.  After all, we cannot expect him or her to know all about us.  Perhaps that person was newly appointed to the role and had only recently assumed responsibility in matters to do with agriculture.  Ireland's membership of the Asian Development Bank is essentially run through the Department of Finance, so I reported the matter to the key people, as well as to people in the food and agritech agencies.</p><p> I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for his comments.  To answer his question about conferences, we organise a lot of such events, including in Asia because they create a huge momentum.  Those conferences are effectively EU-Asia conferences.  When we have done them in Tokyo and Beijing, for instance, all the EU stakeholders are in the city, together with local government representatives and Asian colleagues from further afield.  It is an EU-Asia engagement but the event is being run by an Irish organisation, which very much puts Ireland on the radar.  We work closely with the ambassador and other members of team Ireland on those events.</p><p> I will ask my colleague to deal more comprehensively with the questions about education.  We are partnering with the Higher Education Authority during Asia Business Week Ireland to focus on how efforts might be co-ordinated.  I agree that the Columban Fathers are doing incredible work in the region.  I have stayed with them in Japan and they are amazing people, as are the Jesuits.  There is huge linkage potential there.  The HEA has done some work in this regard in Brazil and that model is there to be replicated in Asia.</p><p> Speaking generally, as well as the lack of joined-up thinking, another problem is that there is sometimes a focus on process over progress when, in fact, our focus needs be to on progress over process.  Of course, we have to do things in the right manner but the emphasis should always be on getting things done, making progress and achieving results rather than fixating on the process.</p><p> My understanding, on which I am open to correction, is that the number of Malaysian students coming to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is beginning to dip.  A factor in this regard may be that the college's fees are deemed expensive compared with those of some competitor institutions.  The RCSI is a fine institution and the prospects are good, particularly if the memorandum of understanding with Indonesia comes online.</p><p> Dublin Institute of Technology has a wonderful programme of collaboration with Irish Aid under which it is training people from Laos in tourism skills.  I met a lot of people from the education sector on our recent trip to meet with ASEAN member states, including among the staff at the Asian Development Bank.  Many of them made the interesting point that Asia no longer wants to be simply a marketing recruitment ground for students for Europe.  Instead, it wants European institutions to go into Asia and partner with them.  The DIT programme is a perfect example of that and is deserving of support.  I am not familiar with any changes in the programme.</p><p> Reference was made to internships and building relationships.  I will take a little credit in this area in that I was vice chairman of a Dublin-Beijing committee which had a useful engagement with our Chinese counterparts.  When they told us they had more than 45 twin town and sister city relationships - I understand the number is now up to 60 - I asked how many of those relationships are really strong.  I was told that only three fell into that category and when I asked why, they said those particular relationships were strong because they talk to each other all the time.  It was out of this engagement with Beijing that the idea of internships developed.  It has meant we have ambassadors for Dublin and Ireland who go back to Beijing.  Last year I spent three months there and it is clearly a win-win for everybody.  It would be great if we could extend that engagement to other locations.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked the reasons for some of the delays we have encountered.  To be fair, team Ireland is working well with us and we get fantastic support from all Departments and agencies.  Again, delays are generally due to a lack of joined-up thinking.  It is sometimes worrying to see different people spending minimal resources essentially doing the same thing.  Instead, there should be a parcelling out of responsibilities according to whether internal people or external people can do them more effectively.  Everyone is busy and it is a question of how to get Ireland on people's radar in a focused way.</p><p>In regard to the EFL sector, what happened was very tragic.  As a former chief executive officer of the Association of Compliance Officers in Ireland, I have some experience in this area.  As I am no longer in that role, I am in a position to make the general observation that in some cases, we may have too much regulation while in others we do not have enough.  To clarify, I am speaking on this point in a personal capacity.</p><p> There was a question about how we can enhance travellers' experience.  Sometimes less is more and the focus should be on quality.  What we find is that Ireland has become very good on the hard skills.  Indeed, we are now very American in our style, with an emphasis on getting bang for one's buck, value propositions and key performance indicators.  The danger in all of this is that it may be causing us to lose our strengths in the soft skills.  Asians are quite different from us in that they are focused on building relationships.  For an Asian business person, decisions on whether to go into partnership with another person are based on three considerations: the first is whether that person is credible, which is essentially about who the person is and by whom he or she was introduced; the second is whether one likes the other person, which is a human thing based on respect; and the third is whether one can trust the person.  If an Asian business person believes in the other person, likes him or her and trusts him or her, the two of them will definitely be doing business; the only question is what it makes sense to do.  In Ireland, it is the opposite way around - a type of clinical approach based on performance goals and so on.  We need to meet somewhere in the middle.</p><p> In regard to the Irish going to Australia, everybody is trying to get a look in there.  Beijing is trying to get them to go to Beijing.  Experts like Kevin Toland of the Dublin Airport Authority know what needs to be done.  Again, a Minister with overall co-ordinating responsibility could invite key experts to put this together.</p><p> It is very sad that we have almost 13,000 Filipinos working in Ireland, many of them contributing wonderfully to our health care and elder care services, but they have no embassy to represent them.  The Filipino embassy shut down shortly after we officially opened there, but I assure the committee there was no connection between the two events.  Essentially, the ambassador became ill and, as sometimes happens in bureaucracies, the role was subsumed into London, which does not allow the same the same level of engagement.</p></speech>

It is important to stress that the benefits of an engagement with Asia are not just for Dublin.  Like all Corkonians, I am a proud one and I see the relationship being of national and regional importance to Ireland.  I know of one Japanese company that opened in Kerry because it wanted to get highly educated local people as opposed to locating in a big city.  There are a lot of opportunities throughout Asia, with its huge populations, but we must be targeted in our approach.</p><p>Trailblazers include Glen Dimplex, a wonderful Irish indigenous company.  Equally, FEXCO is another great company.  These are the kind of people that could be included in an advisory group from the industry, working under a Minister and key stakeholders, including ourselves.</p><p> There are some countries that we do not include because of a lack of time or resources.  As the Deputy mentioned, there is much disparity between countries like rich Singapore and poor Laos.  We do not particularly focus on human rights with regard to Myanmar and Philippines, as that is under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which makes its views very well known.  We would sometimes informally brief the Irish Government on areas that we would deem of interest.  We once did a briefing on North Korea as a request but it was complicated.  It involved a Canadian non-governmental organisation and we were asked to do it off the record.  We invited some people from the government to get a current briefing.  It was unusual but the goodwill is there.  Of course, it is automatic that everything should be ethical and compliant in all engagement.  Any serious Irish companies going abroad take that as a given.</p><p> Deputy Smith mentioned Cavan and he will happy to hear that this year, during Asian business week, we will give an award to a Cavan-based ASEAN company from Thailand called Indorama Ventures, which essentially rescued the Wellman company in Cavan.  It employs almost 400 people and was lost for a few years under private equity.  In essence, those 400 jobs could have gone.  There are other big companies in ASEAN like that who can come in as IDA Ireland clients and locate anywhere; this can include white knight rescue scenarios.</p><p> I will leave "brand Ireland" to Ms FitzGerald-Smith.  The question was asked if we delude ourselves and the answer is "Yes".  One of the worries that I see in our engagement with Asia is that we very rarely talk about competition or what other countries are doing.  I know some members have mentioned the level of resources that other embassies have and we need to put that in context.  If we are selling anything from Ireland to anyone of significance in Asia, we would be following a long line of other people who may, in many ways, be selling the same thing.  We need to work out our unique selling point and how we can distinguish selling Ireland as one entity.  Members will be happy to hear that we went to Belfast in January to engage with city hall officials.  It has a China alliance and we were very impressed by the number of people who gave of their schedule to meet us.  Belfast gets a bit lost between London and Dublin so the people there were really happy to engage.  During Asian business week, two weeks from now, the Lord Mayor of Belfast will attend with some colleagues to see what we are doing.  We have already started a process.</p><p> The reason we have not done things in London or Belfast is because we work closely with peer organisations in the UK and we are cautious about stepping on their toes.  We are very comfortable about working in a joint fashion and we are considering doing an event in London and Brussels.  Nevertheless, we are cautious about moving into other geographical territories without clear partnerships.  The UK-Ireland joint trade mission to Singapore was a great example of the two countries working together.</p><p> Ms FitzGerald-Smith will speak to branding Ireland, given her expertise in social media, as well as the education issues.</p></speech>

I will speak later about education but I will first address "brand Ireland".  I was a resident of Shanghai for five years and I worked very closely with the embassy in Shanghai to promote "brand Ireland".  One cannot underestimate the power of the Irish diaspora abroad in promoting the brand.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator that music is very important in promoting Ireland.  We have a very talented culture and people recognise the Irish for that.  I am aware that music was used regularly during the State visit to China by President Higgins in December at galas and various events that took place to promote Ireland.  The St. Patrick's Day parades across Asia are very important elements in promoting team Ireland across Asia and music is a major part of that.  For example, the Shanghai parade has students as young as five who have learned Irish dancing in Shanghai from a mix of Irish ex-pats living in Shanghai and locals who learn Irish dancing.  There is one Irish dancing troupe which learned Riverdance from watching videos on YouTube.  It started 13 years ago and the troupe is just as good as Riverdance now.</p> <p>  The promotion of Ireland through music, dance and cultural workshops is very important, and sport is equally vital.  The Gaelic games community across Asia is very strong, for example.  The Asian Gaelic Games will take place in Shanghai this year, and they have previously taken place in Kuala Lumpur quite regularly.  I attended two years ago when there were 800 players from across Asia, and they were not comprised solely of Irish people.  The group included a multitude of Asian people who are very talented at Gaelic games.  In addition, the hurling all-stars toured Asia approximately two years ago, and Mr. Marty Morrissey came to Shanghai for that, travelling with them to present Irish hurling to the diaspora in Shanghai and across all of Asia.  People watched this in awe and it was a very memorable occasion because hurling is a very fast sport that requires much skill.</p> <p>  Placement in schools across Asia and teaching Asian students how to experience Irish culture is a great way of promoting the Irish brand.  New Zealand, for example, has invited celebrities to its island.  We could invite celebrities who have millions of followers on social media in Asia to Ireland, which has a lot to offer, such as the Giant's Causeway and, more recently, the Wild Atlantic Way.  These can be exhibited through social media to millions of people across Asia, which would be a great promotion.  These would be marketed in those people's own language.</p></speech>

There was mention of the institutions competing against each other, and that was mentioned to us previously by Asians in Asia and heads of universities.  They have said they are fed up of institutions selling the same thing.  More recently, institutions have come together in ways like the 3U partnership, which involves Maynooth, Dublin City University and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  They have come together to market their products and the partnership has opened an office in Beijing.  This is collectively trying to attract students to Ireland.  The RCSI Penang development centre is a great partnership and it has proved very successful.  That is a more targeted audience.  Having young professional placements going both ways is vital, such as Beijing interns coming to Ireland.  There should be placements coming from across Asia.</p></speech>

I am pleased to welcome Dr. Oonagh Breen here today.  She is a senior lecturer in law at UCD.  I also welcome Mr. Ivan Cooper, who is director of advocacy at The Wheel.  We know the witnesses' time is valuable and we really appreciate their giving it to help us in considering these issues.  I understand briefing documents on this matter have been circulated to members.  I will invite the witnesses to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes on the key points.  We will then have a question and answer session with members.</p><p>Before we begin, I have to draw the attention of our witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members should also be aware that under the same rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>Will those present please check to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or are in airplane mode so that they do not interfere with the sound recording system?  I now invite Dr. Breen to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I have already submitted some published work with which the committee may have had an opportunity to engage.  In the five minutes allotted to me, I hope to highlight the main issues, which can be delved into further during the question and answer session, as they are pertinent to the committee's work.  The Charities Act 2009 put forward a new statutory test for charitable status which comprises two elements.  An organisation must fall within the list of charitable purposes as set out in section 3 and it must also meet the public benefit test.  Half is not enough; it must tick both boxes.  The new list of charitable purposes, however, deliberately excluded the advancement or promotion of human rights.  It had appeared in the heads of Bill in 2006 but it disappeared by the time the Bill was published in 2007 and the Act was enacted in 2009.<br/><br/>I have argued for a long time that the rationale for its exclusion was legally misguided.  It emerged during the hearings relating to the enactment of the legislation that the exclusion was based on Revenue practice.  Revenue practice is often very hard to determine because Revenue matters are private.  There is not much published information in this area but there is a 2001 Revenue charities manual which cites the reason for the rejection of charitable tax exemption status for human rights organisations as lying in the case of McGovern<i>v.</i>Attorney General, which is an English case.  In its manual, Revenue states, about the case, that the promotion of human rights equates to the promotion of political activities and therefore is not charitable.  I am happy to deal separately, in response to questions, with the existing situation for human rights organisations in terms of tax relief as that sheds another light on the subject.  It is something to which we might revert under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, if that is of interest to the committee. <br/><br/>Turning to the McGovern decision, because it is important to us here today, it is important to be aware of what happened in the case.  Amnesty International had sought charitable status in England but it was rejected in 1981.  At the time, Revenue said what it was doing was primarily political as it was seeking relief for prisoners of conscience by having laws changed to ensure a higher standard of human rights for those prisoners.  When one looks at the judgment, the High Court does not say that it is uncharitable to promote human rights.  It does not say that the promotion of human rights is not a charitable purpose.  In fact, Mr. Justice Slade says the opposite.  He tells us that under the common law, the promotion of human rights and anything that gives relief of distress of one's fellow man falls within our notion of a good and compassionate purpose and that, therefore, can be a charitable purpose in its own right - there is nothing intrinsically uncharitable about it.<br/><br/>In the years after the McGovern case, the charity commission picked up on another head of charity, the mental and moral improvement of man, and said human rights is tied into that and that it was also a charitable purpose.  At this point there was no reason for Irish policy makers to exclude the promotion of human rights from the list of charitable purposes in the Act.</p><p>Having a charitable purpose does not give one charitable status.  To return to my original point, it is a two part test - one must have the charitable purpose but there must also be a public benefit.  The public benefit part of the test is where the McGovern case was lost.  They could not prove to the court's satisfaction that there was public benefit attached to what Amnesty International was trying to do in 1981.  Today, we would view that in a different light.  We have moved on very much in the past 30 years in terms of our treatment of human rights and how it is incorporated into both international and national legal norms.  For example, both the UK and Ireland have incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights, so we have moved on greatly in that regard.</p><p> My written submission breaks down the legal points that were involved in the public benefit issue.  If the committee wishes, I will go into that in detail.  However, I am conscious that the committee only wishes to have an overview at present, so I will step aside from those to give the committee a current contemporary perspective.  Where do we stand as against other countries in terms of our promotion of human rights?  We lag behind in this regard.  Many of our common law neighbours who have updated their charity legislation in recent years have expressly included the promotion of human rights or its advancement as a heading of charity in their Acts.  The 2005 and 2011 English and Welsh Acts, the 2005 Scottish Act and the 2008 Northern Irish Act have specific references in their lists of statutory charitable purposes to human rights.  We are the outlier in this regard by not including it in our legislation.</p><p> If we look further afield, the law in this area has also evolved.  We can look at our far flung neighbours in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.  All of them allow for human rights organisations to be involved in this type of work, to advocate on behalf of their constituents and beneficiaries, and it is not seen as political activity.  It is seen as either supporting existing law or advocating for a change in the law in a direction in which the law is changing for better in any case.  There are really good precedents in that.</p><p> I conclude by drawing the committee's attention to the reason that this is important in terms of charity legislation.  At present, because we exclude advancement of human rights from our statutory definition, we force human rights organisations into disguise of their objects.  They must either bury what they are doing in their memorandum and articles of association and not come out and say they are for the advancement of human rights, and bodies have come to me who have said, "Help us draft them so we can do what we want to do but it does not raise red flags for the regulators", or they must hive off their ostensibly non-charitable activity into a legal subsidiary, so one ends up with the subsidiary doing the controversial human rights advocacy work and the foundation that gets charitable tax exemption doing the safe research and publishing the reports.  It makes work for these organisations when they should be able to put it directly into the single entity.</p><p> Second, if we introduce promotion of human rights as a charitable purpose, it will bring us into line with good practice in all of our neighbouring countries which expressly recognise it in their statutes.</p><p> Third, we came under criticism from the-----</p></speech>

From a regulatory perspective, we cannot regulate the organisations if they are not allowed to register.  We set up a great charities registration system but they cannot be accountable and we cannot call them to account because they are not allowed to register under the system.</p> <p>  Finally, it makes sense to align policy.  If the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working really hard with the UN Human Rights Council and sponsoring motions that create and preserve civic space and at the same time at home we do not afford that same right to our domestic organisations, that is a contradiction in policy terms in which we really should not be engaged.  We should be singing from the same hymn sheet here.  If we are working very hard on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade side of things and in the UN Human Rights Council, we should at least be consistent on a policy basis at home with regard to domestic organisations.</p></speech>

It has been going since 1999 and now has over 1,100 organisational members.  We did a lot of work during the development of the Charities Act 2009 when met some of the members here, but one of the outcomes we could not secure was the inclusion of the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose in the Act.  That is the reason we are here.<br/><br/>As Dr. Oonagh Breen has already mentioned it, I will not review the charity test other than to point out that it has two components.  An organisation must exist for a charitable purpose and it must have a public benefit for it to be considered a charity.<br/><br/>In looking at human rights in the context of the Charities Act I have four questions which I propose to briefly explore in this introductory statement.  Why is the advancement of human rights not recognised as a charitable purpose in the Act?  What are the consequences of this?  Does it have to be this way?  What can be done about it?<br/><br/>On the reason the advancement of human rights is not included as a charitable purpose, in simple terms, the Charities Act, 2009 was drafted to include only the purposes recognised as charitable at the time by the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the official line on the matter.  The Revenue Commissioners do not recognise the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.  The  Minister for Justice and Equality at the time, Deputy Alan Shatter, noted in his speech on the Charities (Amendment) Bill 2014: </p><blockquote>The Government does not support the amendment to include the advancement of human rights in the list of purposes ... This is not due to any lack of recognition of the vital role of human rights organisations in our communities ... Rather it is in light of the importance of ensuring that the new system of regulation of charities is appropriately aligned with the system of charitable tax exemption that has long been operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</blockquote> <p>Dr. Breen has outlined the speculated reasons the Revenue Commissioners do not recognise it as a charitable purpose.  I will skip the points summarised in my submission and ask Dr. Breen to provide further detail.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, the Charities Act 2009 only excludes from the register of charities &quot;bodies that promote a political cause unless the promotion of that cause relates directly to the advancement of the charitable purposes of the body&quot;.  I mention this because there is a relation between the question on general lobbying and advocacy and the attitude of the charities regulator and the Revenue Commissioners and the issue of the advancement of human rights being excluded as a charitable purpose.  Both are considered to be related in some way to changing Government policy, which is viewed essentially as being political.  The win is that it is recognised that a charity can advocate in furtherance of a charitable purpose as long as the advocacy is related to the specific charitable purpose being advanced.  This welcome provision permits the inclusion of bodies in the register of charities that promote political causes related directly to the advancement of their charitable purpose.  What this is generally taken to mean is that advocacy activity engaged in by a charity is acceptable as long as it is solely in furtherance of its charitable purpose.  That is seen as a positive feature of the Act.<br/><br/>On the consequences of this, the Charities Act 2009 excludes organisations explicitly focused on the advancement or promotion of human rights from securing charitable status.  Because the advancement of human rights has been excluded as a charitable purpose and because the Act requires all of a charity's assets to be applied solely to a charitable purpose, no charitable organisation can explicitly claim to be solely concerned with advancing human rights through its work, unless it is already included in the special arrangements Revenue has made for organisations with the United Nations and the Council of Europe that Dr. Breen referenced.  Many charitable organisations understand they are involved in some way or another in meeting people's unmet needs and in vindicating their unfulfilled rights.  Not to be able to make such a public statement without fear for their charitable status prevents a charity from doing full justice to the scope and intent of its work.  It can also be reasonably argued that it has the effect of delegitimising the work of human rights promoting organisations, characterising their efforts as political and contestatory in nature, perhaps even not deserving of public financial support, reducing such organisations to the status of just another pressure group when such organisations are simply seeking to ensure the State implements policy to which it is committed in international human rights conventions and agreements.  It can further be reasonably argued that it does not do justice to the organisations working to protect human dignity.  It can be argued that it has the effect of constraining what existing charitable organisations feel free to advocate on, in particular human rights and rights generally.</p><p>In the context of the significantly increased regulation that charities now find themselves subject to - the charities regulator and the regulation of lobbying - which set interconnected and increasingly demanding requirements relating to advocacy by charities, the non-charitable status of human rights advocacy adds to the general sense that charities are only valued for responding to people&rsquo;s particular needs in the here-and-now, and are not valued for their work in developing and advising on necessary policy to address the causes and consequences of peoples&rsquo; needs in the future.<br/><br/>Does it have to be this way?  I do not think so if we have a will.  Dr. Oonagh Breen has already pointed out that the promotion or advancement of human rights is regarded as charitable in many other jurisdictions, in particular, in the common law jurisdictions with which we share a particular heritage.  What is it about our circumstance that prevents us from naming what has been recognised in our nearest common law jurisdictions as a charitable purpose?  Why are we so different?  What is it about their systems that court precedents do not seem to have restricted their ability to accommodate human rights?  What we can we do about this issue?  We are here today, which is a good start, and that reflects political interest and a will to understand and address the issue. <br/><br/>A solution will clearly require legislative action as court precedents and judicial understandings appear to be driving current practice, which in turn appear to be used to justify the <i>status quo</i>.  Is it simply a question of making the decision to include the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose when the five year review of the Charities Act 2009 takes place?  Or do the judicial and precedent issues identified above need to be addressed separately?  Are there unstated worries that recognising human rights might be abused in some way by what may be termed &ldquo;quasi party-political interests&rdquo;?  I do not know.<br/><br/>Is there something else going on?  Surely we can find a way forward that accommodates the advancing of human rights within the framework of charitable purposes, while at the same time respecting the distinction between electoral and party politics and the charitable realm which we understand is necessary.</p></speech>

It seems that a relatively straightforward amendment could be made.  I wish to make two points.</p> <p>  First, the current position does not exclude all those bodies who promote human rights.  Mr. Ivan Cooper referred to the proviso regarding the promotion of the clause relating directly to the advancement of charitable purposes.  Can either of the representatives give an example of the type of organisations that are able to avail of that exemption and, to assist us in making any submission, the type of bodies that cannot?  In other words, what are the bodies that are currently not gone to charitable purpose or that have to go through the hoops, which Dr. Oonagh Breen mentioned, in setting up the non-political foundation and so on?  Some concrete examples would be useful to us.</p> <p>  Second, I am not on top of this area.  The Charity Commission for England and Wales, as Dr. Oonagh Breen mentioned, has carried out a guidance and the space for charity involved in the political sphere.  This is soft law.  Clearly, it is not in legislation but these are guidelines.  Can she say a little more about how that operates alongside the statutory provision and is that a model we could usefully use here?</p></speech>

The issue is that an organisation cannot come out and say, &quot;What we are really about is promoting human rights but we had to play the system so we had to devise these memo and articles that make it look as though our purposes are not about promoting human rights&quot;.  It is difficult to identify concrete organisations that have found themselves in this circumstance where, effectively, what they have had to do is re-characterise themselves as being about addressing certain issues when in fact if the promotion of human rights was a charitable purpose they might have more properly characterised themselves as being first and foremost about promoting human rights.  The circumstance currently is that the promotion of human rights is not regarded as a charitable purpose in and of itself, so organisations cannot effectively claim that one of their purposes is about the promotion of human rights.  It is a kind of catch-22 situation.  Dr. Oonagh Breen has indicated one of the consequences of that.  This is where it ties in with the advocacy question.  I have referenced the advocacy and the lobbying question.<br/><br/>It is not a charitable purpose for an organisation to be a full-blown campaigning organisation that does no service delivery work or no information and advice and support work with a particular beneficiary group but only regards itself as being a purely advocacy organisation.  Revenue has historically raised issues in regard to that.  The current Charities Regulator is expected to continue that approach.  What it means is that purely lobbying activity or purely advocacy activity is not regarded as charitable.  Organisations that do that have to show that the advocacy activity they are doing is in furtherance of delivering the charitable purpose.  That ties back across to the idea of human rights which is regarded, as Dr. Breen has indicated, as being essentially political in nature because it is solely concerned with changing the rights or legislative <i>status quo</i>.  It is therefore deemed as being effectively a form of advocacy activity.  That, it seems to me, is the complicating factor.  There are organisations that have ended up structuring themselves in such a way, as Dr. Breen has indicated, whereby they have a charitable entity that conducts research and activity and another entity that is not directly related to them that does the advocacy work that does not have charitable status.  It is, arguably, unnecessary.</p></speech>

ICCL is a great organisation in the community advocating on a general basis but it does that through a different structure.  That is one clear concrete example of a body that has had to develop its legal status to allow it to accomplish all its aims.</p> <p>  In terms of the soft guidance, the Charity Commission for England and Wales, even prior to the enactment of their Charities Act 2006, which was the first Act that gave statutory recognition to the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose, had begun to engage with this issue.  From the McGovern case in 1981, through the 1980s, into the early 1990s, it had to engage with human rights organisations and provide some indication of what they could do, if human rights was a charitable purpose, that did not offend the public benefit part of the test that one could stay within the law.  It had issued guidance through the 1990s.  The best source to which I could refer the Senator is a document called CC9, which was revised in 2008.  It is aimed at all charities and explains what they can do in the political sphere without losing their charitable status.  The reason it is particularly relevant here is that it draws on examples from human rights organisations because they are aware that this is particularly relevant to such organisations.</p> <p>  They use two terms in this guidance.  They talk about campaigning.  They say that charities can engage in campaigning.  Campaigning is defined as awareness raising, public persuasion, all of which is related to ensuring enforcement of existing law, and advocating in a way to ensure that the law that currently exists is upheld and maintained.  Campaigning is distinguished from political activity.  The Charity Commission for England and Wales defines political activity as seeking a change either in the law or in the policy of a country.  In the past it would have said charities cannot do that at all, that is the prohibited piece of the jigsaw.  Interestingly, what it says in this guidance is that charities can engage in political activity for a particular period to bring about a certain end which is in line with their charitable purpose.  It allows them to put all of their resources towards it to achieve a goal but it cannot be their ongoing, permanent, sole, primary goal.  In the course of carrying out their bigger, charitable objective there can be times when a charity can do this.  That is very useful, practical guidance.  What is nice about this document is that it is written by someone who speaks plain English.</p><p> The examples are good, so I would commend it to the committee and would be happy to supply a copy afterwards if it would be of use.  It is just a starting point.  We do not always have to reinvent the wheel.  It is much better to enable organisations and allow them come in.  They say in the US that one does not want to exclude someone or a voice from the marketplace of ideas.  That is what we are talking about here.  We are talking about a human rights organisation being able to step forward and explain why we should change the law.  We are not saying the law is going to change.  They do not have that control.  They are just another voice contributing to the debate, which makes us a better society and community.  It is much better to have those voices in the forum and then let the majority and the people decide.  We should not exclude them.  We are cutting it off at the top.  As Mr. Cooper said, we are de-legitimising them by telling them they cannot come in and speak, that they lack that right.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

Their presentations and what they have said make perfect sense and I cannot understand why the issue has not been dealt with previously.  Organisations with charitable status have made presentations seeking to have laws changed, for example, organisations like Womens Aid and other different organisations.  These organisations need laws changed so as to be able to help women who are suffering.  They are involved in the protection of human rights of these women.  Therefore, there is an anomaly here.</p> <p>  It must be exhausting for organisations to try to separate what they can do under charitable status from what they can do without it so as not to cross over between the two areas.  That must be exhausting.  I had an idea about what needs to be done.  If we look at what has been done in the United Kingdom, in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland, it is clear they have managed to deal with this issue without the world collapsing.  It is high time we did the same.  This committee and its rapporteur will make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality and to Revenue in regard to how we can make progress on this.  The situation is a joke as it stands.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming in and explaining the situation to us in plain language.  </p></speech>

This provides an opportunity to build on the point just made by Dr. Breen in regard to the United Kingdom's Charity Commission guidance on advocacy.  The charities regulator will turn shortly to developing Irish guidance on advocacy activity in order to provide a similar sense of reassurance to organisations on how they should approach their advocacy activity.  The committee should be aware of the opportunity to contribute to that.  Then, in due course we will have the review of the Charities Act and the committee could make a recommendation and put forward a straightforward amendment for the inclusion of advocacy for human rights as a charitable purpose.</p> <p>  I would, however, make an observation.  On the face of it, the reason the promotion of human rights is not a charitable purpose is that when the Act was enacted, it was deemed to be an Act that effectively reflected current practice.  That was the idea and it was not about creating new charitable purposes that had not already been recognised.  Therefore, somewhere along the way, we will be required to engage on the question of whether to take the step to move consciously to include advocacy on human rights as a charitable purpose.  We must examine whether the reasons that have been articulated for that move are the reasons we need to be aware of, or whether there is some other reason the promotion of charitable purposes was not included.  No effort was spared by a number of organisations to make the recommendation to include it, but it was very difficult to get any answer as to why it was not included, other than the fact that it was never the intention of the Act to be anything other than an Act that reflected the then prevailing approach.  More work could be done in this regard.</p></speech>

This means the Charities Regulatory Authority can decide that an organisation can register as a charity and have charitable status, but Revenue can then make its own separate decision as to whether to give charitable tax exemption status to that organisation.  That can be either good or bad, because it means the two bodies must talk to each other to ensure some sort of understanding.  However, in terms of human rights, it means this section can no longer be a hold on ensuring human rights and their advancement in the Charities Act.  Revenue can continue to do as it has always done and decide it is not going to deal with human rights organisations under charitable tax exemption status and say that the only way it will give that exemption is if the organisation comes under the very small category of human rights organisations under section 209 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which have consultative status with the UN or the Council of Europe and are promoting internationally recognised rights as opposed to domestic rights.  Special status can be obtained under that heading.  However, there is nothing to stop a provision being included in the Charities Act and then letting Revenue go its own way in terms of tax recognition and then dealing with that problem at source.</p></speech>

In light of what Dr. Breen has said, am I correct in understanding that in order to ensure the full, positive impact of including human rights organisations as charitable bodies in terms of the law, it would also be useful to consider changing that section relating to the Revenue Commission?  Would she recommend that or is she making that implication?</p></speech>

It was at a time when we were in favour of human rights organisations.  The then Government came up with the great idea that it would reward human rights organisations in a tax way that had never been done previously.  Therefore, in 1973, the then Government extended tax reliefs on covenants to human rights organisations.  Before then, if someone made a covenant, it was to a private individual or a university and they got the tax back.  In 1973, for the first time ever, the Government extended the provision to human rights organisations and said it would give them the tax exemptions it gave to charities also.</p> <p> Therefore, in 1973 human rights organisations got a double bonus.  It was as if because they had not been looked after as well as they should have been in the past, the Government really wanted to promote the work of human rights organisations and would make a "gift" to them and they got both reliefs.  However, there were strings attached.  The strings were that they had to have consultative status, had to be promoting the UN or the Council of Europe declaration of human rights and had to have the non-profit qualification included.  If an organisation met those criteria, it could, in principle, benefit.  What happened thereafter was a sad and sorry story.  When I checked with Revenue in 2009, just one organisation was on this list.  Only one human rights organisation qualified for this special status.  Therefore, the provision instead of being a major advantage, became, in the mind of Revenue, a distinguishing factor.  It found human rights organisations different, not a charity and put them to the other side.  </p> <p>  As we became more generous with our tax reliefs for those with eligible charity status, so that every charity could claim back tax paid on donations if over a certain amount, we forgot the reason human rights organisations were in this other box.  It was because they were special and because in the 1970s we were trying to do something good to reward them, while at the same time being afraid to say which internal organisations were human rights organisations.  We handed over that right to a proxy and decided the Council of Europe or the UN would tell us rather than decide ourselves.  Perhaps that is understandable if we consider the 1970s were different times, with the Troubles.</p></speech>

Ideally a single test for charities would be administered rather than have different interpretations of what is charitable between that outlined in the Charities Act 2009 and as defined by the Revenue Commissioners.  One could find that while it may be a good strategy it has the consequence that an entity recognised as a charity by the charities regulator does not qualify for charitable tax exemptions unless whatever issue that prevents Revenue from recognising it is addressed.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  Would those issues would need to be addressed in the relevant tax legislation or could they be addressed by amending the Act?</p></speech>

However, it may have less to say now that section 7 of the Act, which separates the two issues, is already in force.  What one does on taxation matters does not control the definition of "charity".  When we were writing the Act, Revenue was instrumental in deciding what was included as a charitable purpose.  Anything it did not cover was not included.  This is why sports and human rights are not included in the Act.  It could not control the second part of the test, public benefit, because it did not have a list and it therefore stated that an organisation would not be bound by the CRA's future definition of "public benefit".  It could continue to act as it did previously under the heading of public benefit.  In terms of legislation, the Act already provides for regulators, such as the CRA and Revenue, to prepare memorandums of understanding.  That is the most important aspect to this.  We do not need new legislation, we simply need to ensure the existing provision is used so that the regulators engage with each in order to issue clear guidance to those who have to deal with both bodies.</p></speech>

If human rights are included as a charitable purpose, the organisations still have to make the case that they are acting for public benefit.  That is where the decision lies.  We do not have any guidance from the CRA as to how that will be interpreted.  Problems may arise in future but I imagine it would be preferable to address them by way of soft law, such as the guidance provided in the CC-9 document by the Charity Commission of England and Wales.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, this committee also covers the defence brief.  I speak for all of us in sending our congratulations and best wishes to, and in paying tribute to the life-saving work being carried out in the Mediterranean by, the Naval Service on board the <i>LE Eithne.</i>Perhaps it would be appropriate for the committee to write to the Minister and Chief of Staff expressing those sentiments.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>This engagement is timely as last Saturday, 20 June, was international refugee day.  The briefing material for our meeting has been circulated to committee members.  I welcome Ms Sophie Magennis, Mr. Enda O'Neill and Mr. Jody Clarke to this meeting.  I thank them for attending and for giving up their valuable time to engage with us on this important matter.  The format we will follow is that I will ask the witnesses to speak for approximately five minutes and we will follow that with a question and answer session.  This usually proves to be very interesting and informative.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the situation relating to privilege.  I advise them to note that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members should also be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We are aware that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade concerns itself with issues regarding events that occur overseas.  The issue we are discussing today concerns what happens to refugees who end up in this country, which is a separate issue from what happens overseas, except for issues relating to the Department of Defence, as mentioned already.  I ask all here to ensure their mobile phones and other devices are switched to airplane mode so that they do not interfere with the recording equipment. </p><p>I call on Ms Magennis to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  As the Chairman said, this is a timely meeting, with world refugee day happening last weekend, on 20 June, and with the series of important meetings taking place in Europe this week in regard to decisions to be taken by European leaders on resettlement and relocation.  While many of these matters lie in the foreign policy domain, it is important from a domestic viewpoint that decisions on resettlement and relocation taken at the European level may lead to greater numbers of refugees coming to Ireland.  This is an important domestic issue here in the context of how they are received.  Therefore, we are very grateful to have the opportunity to meet the committee today.</p> <p>  We have circulated a brief background note which contains some statistics and information on resettlement, on what it is, the global needs and on what Ireland has done since the 1950s and more recently in regard to resettlement.  The briefing note also contains information about the European context, which is important these days.  I may refer to that note as I go through my opening statement, which I will keep brief because the question and answer session is a more interactive way to exchange views. </p> <p>  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in 1950 and its role is to supervise the 1951 refugee convention.  The UNHCR was set up in the aftermath of the Second World War and the agency was originally set up with a mandate for five years, to solve the problem of refugees that existed at that time in Europe.  Unfortunately, given the scale of global displacement in the intervening decades, the UNHCR is still with us and now has over 9,000 staff working around the world to try to protect people who fall under its remit.</p> <p>  We work primarily to seek solutions for asylum seekers, refugees, internally displaced and stateless persons.  We identify three solutions open to refugees with which UNHCR can help.  First is voluntary repatriation, where refugees can return to their countries where it is safe to do so.  Second is local integration, so that refugees can integrate in the country in which they are recognised.  For example, refugees who come to Ireland as asylum seeks and are recognised can go on to integrate here.  Third is the option we are talking about today, resettlement.  This applies to people who fled their country of origin or habitual residence.  They are in a third country, cannot integrate locally and cannot go back.</p><p>This is where resettlement comes in.  <br/><br/>A UNHCR presence In Ireland was established in 1998 and we now have a staff of seven in the Dublin office.  In 1998, the Irish Government also established its first annual resettlement  programme by way of a Government decision which led to around 40 people a year being able to come in under a quota.  Since 1998, as I noted in my opening text, a strong co-operation has developed between the UNHCR, the Department of Justice and Equality, and in particular its office for the promotion of migrant integration.<br/><br/>Overall, since the 1950s, over 5,000 people have been resettled in Ireland.  If we take the marker of 1998, when the formal annual resettlement programme was established, then 2,301 refugees have been resettled in Ireland.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Irish authorities for the important supports and integration measures that have been put in place to welcome and assist resettled refugees when they come to Ireland.  Later this afternoon, President Higgins will host a garden party at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in for refugees in Ireland and over 400 people will attend.  We will be joined by resettled refugees who have come into Ireland since the 1950s, some Hungarians, plus people from Chile and Vietnam and also the most recent resettlement intake of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghanis.  We will also be joined by refugees recognised in Ireland, asylum seekers and stateless persons. <br/><br/>I want to briefly mention the UNHCR Global Trends report.  Every year we release a report that contains the core statistics for global displacement and we release it just before World Refugee Day.  The figures are staggering because at the end of 2014 nearly 60 million were displaced.  Those figures indicate that over 40,000 people every day were displaced in 2014.  That shows we are dealing with a crisis on an incredible and staggering scale.  <br/><br/>Since early 2011, the war in Syria has become a huge source country for displaced persons.  People from Syria now form the largest driver of the figures of displacement.  In 2012, High Commissioner Ant&oacute;nio Guterres addressed this committee and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  On that occasion he said, &quot;We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement, as well as the response required, is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before&quot;.<br/><br/>In light of these figures, the UNHCR is undertaking advocacy to see if states can step up their resettlement response.  In 2014, resettlement provided a durable solution to more than 73,000 refugees of which 8,579 went to 16 EU member states which represents approximately 12% of global departures.  The remainder of the people we settled in that year went to the United States, Australia, Canada and other countries.  In the same year around 89 people were resettled in Ireland.<br/><br/>Due to the scale of the needs in 2013 and 2014 we called for additional resettlement places to be made available, particularly for Syrians.  We have sought 130,000 places to be made available for Syrians.  Some European member states have responded to our call and have made 51,182 places available.  However, of that number Germany is taking 30,000 people, which is the largest portion. <br/><br/>Since 2014, Ireland's resettlement programme has focused primarily on the needs that have arisen in response to the conflict in Syria.  As I mentioned, 89 refugees that were displaced due to the Syrian conflict were admitted in 2014, with seven others admitted from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  For 2015 and 2016, the Irish authorities increased the quota to 100, to be introduced in 2015, and 120, to be introduced in 2016.  On 13 May, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced that an additional 300 persons would come in before 2016.  I will simplify the figures.  From the beginning of 2014 until the end of 2016, Ireland will admit 610 people who have been displaced due to the Syrian conflict which is welcome.<br/><br/>We also welcome the establishment by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, of the Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme, or SHAP.  Under SHAP 114 people have been granted permission to enter Ireland.  In short that means that 610 people, under resettlement, will come into Ireland between 2014 to 2016.  In addition, some 114 people have been granted permission to enter the State under the admission programme.<br/><br/>I shall now discuss the global picture.  We have published the global resettlement needs in our document for 2016.  We have estimated that 1,153,296 persons are in need of resettlement but there are only 80,000 places available.  The pledges have come from states to the UNHCR and, unfortunately, we do not have an adequate number of places to meet requirements.  Therefore, the UNHCR supports the proposal made by the European Commission for an EU-wide pilot project offering 20,000 resettlement places in the European Union, in 2015 and 2016, using a distribution criteria or key that takes into account the efforts already made, on a voluntary basis, by member states.  While 20,000 places is still small when we look at global need, none the less it is an interesting first step.  The pilot programme has sought to put in place a figure that states would be obliged to respond to.<br/><br/>On the same day the Commission's proposal was announced, the Minister for Justice and Equality indicated her intention to go beyond the figure of 272 people that was allocated, in principle, for Ireland.  On that day she indicated that Ireland would take 300 people and the proposal was endorsed by the Irish Cabinet in recent weeks.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Irish authorities for their support.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon visited here a month ago.  The UNHCR hosted, together with the Minister for Justice and Equality, an event at Farmleigh for resettled refugees.  The Secretary General, in his speech, welcomed Ireland's commitment to resettlement and the Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme.  He also said, at that time, that these commitments are not enough to meet the need.  The UNHCR is very grateful for the commitment and hope that more might be possible in order to respond to the huge need that exists.  <br/><br/>The Irish resettlement programme is an important contribution to providing legal alternatives for people to find a place of safety, rather than undertaking dangerous sea crossings that we have seen happen in recent years.  This year we have already reached the 100,000 mark of people who have travelled across the Mediterranean and over 200,000 people travelled last year.  We know that the <i>LE Eithne</i>, thanks to the contribution of the Irish State, has rescued over 1,500 people and brought them to a place of safety in Italy.  The following questions remain.  What happens to people in Europe?  Can we respond better and upscale our efforts in terms of relocation and resettlement?  <br/><br/>That concludes my opening comments.  We are happy to take any questions that the committee may have.  </p></speech>

I have looked forward to her attendance as she has always helped the committee a lot to reflect on these matters.  Her presentation and paper has conveyed good news about progress, particularly on the way Ireland has responded as well as what is going on in Europe.  As Ms Magennis said,  such developments are to be commended and marked.  Clearly there is a lot of bad news in what has been shared with us.  I have been struck by the scale and magnitude of the problem, plus the huge gap between need and the responses in terms of struggling towards solutions.  I wanted to mark that aspect.  Ms Magennis deals with those aspects in her  day-to-day work, as well the overall agency.  I have been struck by the scale of the gap.</p> <p>  I wish to ask some questions and would like them answered one by one.</p></speech>

I refer to the comments of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  I note what the paper states about UN resettlement departures in 2014, as we received 96 people in the programme, and what is indicated for 2015 and 2016 would be a major jump, although it is small when compared with the scales I spoke of earlier.</p> <p>  In light of those negotiations, is it anticipated that we would make some additional openings in terms of numbers for resettlement.  Earlier, there was some indication that the outcomes of the negotiation would impose on states an obligation to accept more refugees.  The debate was ongoing as to whether the process was an imposition or voluntary.  Will the witness comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#C00200"><p>With regard to Ireland's figures, there is a Government decision in place that was adopted in 2005 and that provided for a quota of 200 people coming to Ireland each year.  That quota was pretty much met in 2007 and 2008 but, with a possible link to the financial crisis, the numbers dropped after that.  Page 3 of the briefing document lists the numbers from 2010, which were relatively small but growing slowly.  We now have a commitment to take 100 people this year, 120 next year and an additional commitment to take 300 people; that is the new commitment on the table.<br/><br/>We welcome this and we hope all those places will be filled.  We already have progressed and Ireland undertakes selection missions to assist in the selection of people who are going to come.  We have already started the arrangements for that and we hope one of those missions will take place this year.  We hope refugees will be able to come in relatively quickly and we might be able to see if there can be additional capacity before the end of 2016 for more refugees.  We welcome the trend but we are always trying to see if we can get some additional places.<br/><br/>I should also mention that it is not just about numbers when it comes to Ireland.  The Irish authorities like to take in particularly vulnerable cases, so Ireland will typically take in approximately five medical cases every year, which would involve somebody with a very serious health issue.  The Irish authorities have also taken in female-headed households, where people might be particularly vulnerable to sexual and other forms of gender-based violence where they are.  The importance of the focus on vulnerability is also very important.<br/><br/>In term of potential at the EU level, the mandatory nature of the increase in the resettlement numbers was on the table in the European Commission paper.  On 13 May, the European Commission published the European agenda on migration and in that the Commission proposed that Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be used to oblige people to take refugees on resettlement and asylum seekers on relocation, using a mechanism in the treaty that can bind member states by qualified majority at the Council - not by consensus - to undertake certain measures.  That was a relatively new measure.  As I am sure we all know, Ireland is not obliged to take part in any measures under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European, TFEU, as Ireland, the UK and Denmark have a general opt-out on measures relating to asylum and immigration.  However, it would be open to the Irish State to decide to opt into that measure and thereby bind itself.<br/><br/>There has been much discussion on this measure by European member states, and some have come out firmly in favour of the use of Article 78 of the treaty binding members to take numbers.  Some have come out against it and others are, as yet, unpronounced.  The European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels today to discuss some of these issues.  We have fully supported the European Commission proposals and the principle is important.  A distribution key has been developed and is annexed to the document produced by the Commission.  It takes account of a range of factors, such as the proportion of asylum seekers and refugees <i>per capita</i>of a country and other measures taken by a state in a relocation or resettlement process and so on.  With regard to the distribution key, a figure of 272 was indicated to Ireland, and Ireland has already indicated that it will go beyond that and take 300.  The numbers have been accepted but the principle is really important.  It would send a massive signal if a state that is not obliged to do so would take the positive step of seeking to bind itself.  We will see what will be the outcome.</p></speech>

At the moment it is clear that Ireland, the UK and Denmark would not be obliged to follow these measures.  The UK and Denmark have indicated that they will not opt in and the Irish authorities have indicated they are still considering all the proposals in the round.  The possibility is still there that Ireland could seek to opt into this measure and thereby bind itself.</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear a little about some of the components of the resettlement programme, and it would benefit the committee.

Does that come from the justice or foreign affairs budget?</p></speech>

I would like to know about a couple of the features.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1805" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#C00800"><p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Jody Clarke, to speak a little about the reception arrangements in the local authorities, as he has been out to see some of the most recent intake and how they are getting on in local communities.  I will address the components of the programme.  There is a very comprehensive reception arrangements programme in place, so resettled refugees would well in advance of arriving have information about Ireland and meet Irish officials.  They would be provided with information about the society, rights and entitlements and the Department of Justice and Equality officials undertake much work at a local level with local authorities, GPs, schools and local religious institutions and sporting groups.  That is to try to prepare the ground for their integration.  Mr. Clarke will speak about how people are getting on in those different communities.</p> <p>  With regard to the cost question, resettled refugees generally receive mainstream supports.  The local authorities try to ensure that when refugees arrive in communities, they are linked to schools and have access to a medical card, local GP services and schools.  There would be a cost attached to it but it is difficult to quantify as it relates to mainstream support.  There is some funding provided by European institutions, including a new asylum, migration and integration fund, known as AMIF.  We understand the Irish authorities will bring forward a call for proposals, and I hope that will be in the coming months.</p><p>A certain amount of money is made available under that programme.  It is normally approximately &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000 per person brought in under the programme but that is a very small sum.  We appreciate that, because of the quality of the Irish programme, more is invested in people when they arrive.  We feel it is an important humanitarian contribution to make.  There is something important about the State investing in people resettled in Ireland in addition to providing overseas resettlement aid.  Our experience has been that resettled refugees make an important contribution to society.  Mr. Jody Clarke might say a word or two about how people are getting on in the local communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jody Clarke" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#D00200"><p>Typically people arrive in Dublin Airport and are met by officials from the Department of Justice and Equality.  They are then brought to a direct provision centre called Balseskin in Fingal in north Dublin.  They will typically stay there for a couple of weeks, although sometimes two or three months, while Department of Justice and Equality officials from the office for the promotion of migrant integration look for accommodation and a community in which to settle them.  In 2013, we had 31 Afghans who came from Syria.  Originally they fled Afghanistan in the 1980s, following the Soviet invasion, to Syria where they lived for the past 20 years or so.  Given what is happening in Syria, we wanted to resettle them here and they are resettled in Tullamore.</p> <p>  There is a policy of dispersal where, to avoid the fear of ghettoising people in cities, people are placed in different parts of the country.  There are south Sudanese in Kilkenny and Congolese in Monaghan, while the new intake of Syrians are in Portlaoise and in Thurles, Tipperary.  People get on quite well but, as one can imagine, it can be a shock to the system to go to a completely new place.  Communities take quite well to them.  An integration officer is hired who helps them settle into the community and access services and so on.  Department of Justice and Equality officials help people go through the sort of things we take for granted such as opening of a bank account.  We think this sort of thing easy but someone who has lived in a refugee camp for 20 years has no idea of how to do it.  Overall, that policy of distributing people around the country works very well.</p> <p>   The policy is probably no surprise.  It is approximately 100 years since 3,000 or so Belgian refugees came to Ireland.  They went to Monaghan, Cavan, Cork and Donegal.  We have the same thing again today.  We hear stories of Huguenot refugees in the 1600s.  They were in Portarlington, which was once called Frenchtown, and they were in Dublin.  Around the corner from here, we have the Huguenot cemetery.  D'Olier Street is a Huguenot name.  We had the Palatine fathers before that, who settled in Limerick.  The idea that refugees come here and settle into new communities is not a new thing.  Whether they are of a different religion or nationality or speak different languages, typically, after a short while, they integrate quite well.</p></speech>

Ireland is quite clearly playing its part in the international programme.  Unfortunately, it appears from Ms Magennis's submission that we are one of only 30 countries doing that.  Of the 11.5 million international refugees, Ms Magennis expressed concern that only 1% are resettled.  She acknowledges the work Ireland has done and continues to do.  Our navy, as she acknowledges, is at the moment in the Mediterranean and doing a fantastic job saving lives in the first instance.  There is a parallel with Ireland in the 18th or 19th century when refugees from our country went to other countries, particularly the United States, where the parallels are significant.  In Canada, thousands of Irish refugees died in Grosse &Icirc;le from different diseases.  It is a huge issue which crosses centuries, generations and countries and it is right and important that we play our full part.</p><p>There are also concerns.  If I were in Libya at the moment, the place I would love to come to is probably Ireland.  There are tens of thousands of people in Libya and other countries which have been destabilised by American and British foreign policy, local dictators and ethnic conflicts.  They all cannot come to Europe, notwithstanding what we do.  As Ms Magennis says, the number of them resettled at the moment is 1%.  It may not be the delegates' area and I accept that, but it seems to me that the countries which are responsible in many cases for the military interventions - America and the United Kingdom to name some of them - need to step up to the mark.  In what way are they stepping up?  If they remove one cut-throat dictator, what is their replacement?  It seems they replace the dictator with absolute chaos.  I believe the organisation called ISIS is a direct result of intervention by western forces in countries where they did not have a solution once they removed the disgraceful and appalling dictatorship.  We need a European and worldwide policy to bring stability and investment and infrastructure to these regions.  First, stability must be achieved.  Then there must be investment in those countries in terms of employment, job creation and so on because we cannot and will not be able to take everyone who wishes to come here.  Any actions we take as a nation should be to stabilise those countries and invest and support forces for investment and political education.</p><p>Concerns were expressed in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>about the 700 refugees we have had in the past month alone.  These are not United Nations refugees in the true sense.  Concerns have been expressed in Government that 700 people have come to Ireland in the past month who are placing a significant demand on our resources.  This might continue.  The constructive positive development of increasing resources to people in direct provision is attracting more people here than it appears we can cope with.  How do we resolve this issue?  Would it be fair to say that every country in the United Nations should be stepping up to the mark and not just 30 countries?  Should there be proportionality between the countries which have taken military intervention?  Should they not be made to step up to the mark on this as well?  What happened and is happening in Libya is the direct result of the dictator who was there and who thankfully is gone and the instability that is currently there.  The United Nations has a key role in bringing stability to these regions.  It has a power and an influence over all countries, which perhaps is not used enough in some respects to bring stability to these regions in order that people can live in the areas they are from.  It is a huge issue.</p></speech>

We need to raise awareness in Ireland about who these people are and try to allay any fear that some might have about any expectation that Ireland will take everyone who needs to come here.  We have put in place a few initiatives, the most recent being the special Mediterranean initiative, which sets out a number of principles.  Given what is happening in the Mediterranean, the most important principle is search and rescue.  Ireland is making a significant contribution to that.  Seeing Irish sailors saving women and small children who are in peril at sea is helping people at home to understand and feel connected to what is happening.  Ireland is responding to this first and most immediate principle.</p> <p>  There are interim and longer-term measures.  We are clear that, in the long term, there is no humanitarian solution to these crises.  There must be political solutions.  We are calling on all political actors to engage and try to resolve the conflicts that are at the source of this flow of persons.  I am referring to the old conflicts that are rumbling on without solution in Somalia, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more recent conflicts and the failed states issue.  The High Commissioner, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, has been forthright in his statement to the effect that the international community is not responding and there are problems in international global governance and at the highest level within the UN and member states as regards dealing with these situations.  He has stated that the UNHCR cannot cope and that the numbers are of such a scale, as Senator Zappone pointed out, that we are struggling.  We are calling on states to deal with the conflicts and, as an interim measure, to build capacity where possible in African states in order that people might at least be given some information about matters and anti-trafficking measures might be implemented.  A range of measures exist and it is important we get the message across that we are discussing resettling people who are in desperate need while also focusing on solving the reasons for their moving in the first place.</p> <p>  Turning to the point on the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland, we saw some figures on the front page of today's newspaper.  Our understanding is that the figure is approximately 200 people entering Ireland per month, on which basis it would likely be 2,000 this year.  It is difficult to predict based on these trends.  Although people are coming to Ireland, the number is still very small compared with the European picture of asylum seekers going to various states.</p> <p>  If I were to make one appeal to the committee, it would be about how Ireland still does not have a single procedure for determining claims from people in need of protection.  Any asylum seeker coming to Ireland will not get a final decision for years.  We have highlighted this problem.  The High Commissioner came to Ireland in 2012 and made a similar plea at this committee.  I understand that the committee will handle the Bill's pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  We made our submission at the end of March.  If that legislation progresses and the recommendations of the working group on the protection process, which will be presented to the Minister next week, are adequately resourced, there will be a mechanism to respond to what has been discussed.  If people are coming to the State but do not need protection, they can be quickly identified and offered assisted voluntary return.  If they fail to take up that offer, they can be removed.  The real concern the State should have is not necessarily the numbers coming in but the fact there is no legal framework in place to deal with them.</p></speech>

Does Deputy O'Dowd have a further question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1823" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#E00900"><p>No, but I welcome Ms Magennis's comments and clarity.  In particular, I welcome her final point.  I know people whose children were born in this country and are now in secondary school yet whose cases have still not been decided.  Clearly, they should be allowed to stay.  I agree with Ms Magennis.  It is a failure on our part not to deal with this situation with total clarity.  There is ambiguity.  If the UN has a legitimate, proper and transparent process, by signing up to it we would be providing clarity to public opinion on the question of, for example, refugees who may have been trafficked into Ireland and the major issues related to that.</p> <p>  The enrichment of society provided by the immigrant community in my area has been considerable.  That multiculturalism and so on make us a real international country rather than the monochrome one we were for many years, although I say that in the broadest sense.  We are a much richer country in every respect now.  Our schools, particularly primary schools, are sources of fantastic learning for everyone, as all cultures and religions are represented.  As Ms Magennis stated, we need clarity in policy, because this would lead to greater public acceptance of what is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1824" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#E01000"><p>Earlier this year, I read that Ireland was the only country in the world that had a population smaller today than it had in the early 1800s.  Ms Magennis will know this.  Another statistic is that, according to a book written by Mr. Raymond Crotty, entitled <i>Ireland in Crisis: A Study in Capitalist Colonial Undevelopment</i>, half of those who survived childhood during the 65-year period between the foundation of the State and 1987 emigrated.  Of all the states in Europe, it is shocking to think that we are the only country that does not allow the right to work for asylum seekers who have been in Ireland for more than nine months.  Denmark has not opted in because it has better and stronger legislation.  While Ms Magennis has reported that we will be taking in 300 refugees, we have an appalling record on this matter, considering our history.  It reflects public opinion.  Our committee has held debates.  Commenting on these issues as a public representative is extremely unpopular.  Consider sites like <i>thejournal.ie</i>.  Reading the comments is utterly depressing.  People are coming from places like Syria and the Horn of Africa in sheer desperation.  They are not like Ireland's economic migrants who had to leave to get work in Australia and Canada.  They must leave because they will be killed if they stay.  They have no future.  They are on boats drowning.  Despite this, if one opens <i>thejournal.ie </i>this evening and reads comments from Irish people, it is depressing, given our history.  I just wanted to get that off my chest.  I thank the Chairman for this time.  We must be honest - we in Ireland have a problem communicating these issues.  There is a complete ignorance of our history in our approach to these matters.</p><p>Ms Magennis referred to a single application process for asylum seekers.  Everyone in the Houses agrees with this idea.  I hope that the legislation will be debated later this year.  What are Ms Magennis's thoughts on the direct provision system?  The McMahon report is due next week.  If refugees are lined up outside Ireland, how do we better align this approach with Ms Magennis's?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#E01100"><p>I thank the Deputies.  As Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned, the largest factor in this issue will be the working group report, which will be published on 30 June.</p><p>There has been some reporting in the media but the report is not in the public domain yet so I will not go into detail on that.  The single protection procedure is the most important element in order to make all the expected recommendations come together and to prevent long stays in the direct provision system in the future.  It can be bad on two levels.  When somebody who comes into the State has a protection need that does not fit the refugee definition but does fit the subsidiary protection definition, it can take years to get there, so there is a gap during which the person's protection need has not been identified.  During that time the person cannot work or access third level education, and he or she is on &euro;19.10 per week and living in an institutionalised setting where there are difficulties with privacy and a lack of catering.  We are mindful also of the report of this committee, which was an important contribution to raising awareness of the issues.  The real challenge is to come up with a set of solutions to deal with the issues facing long-staying people in the centres and to ensure this does not happen again.  The report, which is due next week, will deal with the people in the centres at the moment.</p><p> I will now turn to the single protection procedure.  This will identify a person in need of protection at the earliest possible point.  It will also preserve the asylum space.  If a procedure for determining those in need of protection is not in place at national level, then it is difficult to be clear on messaging.  It becomes hard to counter the type of sentiment referenced by this committee, because there is a perception that anybody who comes to Ireland is going to be staying forever.  People who need protection become mixed up with those who may not need protection.  The UNCHR's appeal to all member states is to put measures in place that can quickly identify those in need of protection so that within a period of six months or less their need is identified.  People who are refugees or in need of subsidiary protection can get protection status and then move on with their lives.  Those who do not meet the criteria in terms of protection needs and who do not have any other humanitarian reason to stay would be assisted - in full dignity and respect for their human rights - in returning to their country of origin, where there is no harm.  When there is a system that functions like this, it becomes easier to get the message across.</p><p> Our appeal to this committee and to Irish parliamentarians is to advance this legislation as quickly as possible.  We are anxious about the fact that only the general scheme of the Bill has been published.  My colleague Enda O'Neill has worked on comments, and our views have been submitted to this committee.  There is concern that the legislation might not be enacted before another general election is called.  The biggest contribution this committee can make towards resolving the situation for the future and for current legacy cases is to expedite the pre-legislative scrutiny and to complete the drafting as quickly as possible in order for the Bill to be enacted.  We have confidence that there are solid recommendations from the working group on the protection process report, which we played a key role in.  We hope there is a time frame now for this committee to advance the legislation and for the current administration to implement it.</p></speech>

Speeding up the application process is part of it, but how do we communicate better with our own people? Ireland has had the highest contribution <i>per capita</i>in the world towards overseas development aid.  It is as though we are two people: we are the most generous, decent people in the world, but when people come here in small numbers and resettle there is alarm.  What can be done collectively to communicate the facts and not the myths?  This is not unique to Ireland - many political parties are elected on anti-immigration policies across Europe.  In what ways can these matters be better explained to our population?</p></speech>

The political space and discourse on these issues is very good at the moment in Ireland, but the Deputy raises an important point.  <i>The Irish Times</i>ran a poll recently which contained unfortunate wording. It said: &quot;Should Ireland offer to resettle migrants rescued in Mediterranean?&quot;  It was not clear that what was on the table was the resettlement of refugees even prior to their taking these journeys.  The general sentiment was clear in the question and just over half of those polled said &quot;No.&quot;  For those who said &quot;Yes,&quot; the number of migrants acceptable ranged from small to medium figures.  Our work is cut out for us and we could work more with parliamentarians, providing information, facts, graphics and materials which could help deliver the message.  Our external relations section could have something to add to this.<br/><br/>We find that personal stories of individuals in communities can get a message across very well.  We run events such as the annual football cup with Sports Against Racism Ireland (SARI).  Teams are from all over the country and are made up of asylum seekers who have lived in asylum centres for years, locals and refugees.  The aim is to raise the immigration profile through community stories and events.  The garden party with the President also makes refugees and asylum seekers feel very involved.  The initiatives on citizenship are important.  The high-profile citizenship ceremonies are handled very well; the State grants citizenship to tens of thousands of people who enjoy the event and it is communicated positively in media coverage.  Maybe there is more we can do to tell the personal stories of refugees and asylum seekers in a positive light, and that might help.</p></speech>

Reference was made to our own history, and ironically, the word "&Eacute;ireannach" comes from refugee scholars in the Irish College in Leuven who fled Ireland in the years following the Flight of the Earls.  We could look to Ireland's own history even before the 1800s.</p> <p>  For World Refugee Day we had 500 posters on Dublin buses with two profiles.  One was a Vietnamese man who came here in the 1970s and has a restaurant in Parnell Street.  The other profile was an Iraqi lady who lives in Cork.  Under each image there was as short quote from the person and three words.  The Iraqi lady's poster said that she was forced to flee but that Ireland had given her a home.  It then states the three words "Iraqi," "Mum," and "Bioscientist."  She works at University College Cork now.</p><p>In other countries, such as Hungary, the UNHCR has a similar poster campaign showing the contribution refugees have made there.  It had a similar campaign in the United Kingdom recently, showing the enormous contribution refugees have made there.</p><p> This is something those in the UNHCR have always done, as can be seen from any of our public information materials.  For example, T-shirts for sale on our website advertise that Einstein was a refugee.  We are interested in exploring new ways of providing information and any way this committee could assist in that would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

However, the system set up in that regard seems to be working well.</p> <p>  I have just a few questions.  How will the people who are to be resettled here be selected and where does that selection process happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-24a.1832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sophie Magennis" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015062400002#G00400"><p>The Irish authorities run two types of selection processes.  One is dossier based.  In that case we in the UNHCR prepare a file containing all of the information about a person and this is sent to the authorities to be reviewed here.  The other system is what is called a "selection mission" and Ireland is now doing this more often.  For the most recent selection mission for example, the Irish authorities went to Amman in August last year.  What the UNHCR does in that case is, it identifies people who might be in need of resettlement.  We look at the most vulnerable refugees, those who are struggling where they are and who do not have the financial resources to survive in Amman.  We send their files or dossiers to the Irish authorities in advance so that they can read through them and they then come to Amman and meet them.  To some extent, this is a two-way process, in that the authorities can explain to the refugees concerned what Ireland is like and can check if it will be an appropriate match for them.  The interview takes place and then the Irish authorities make a decision on the cases before them.  When they decide to accept those cases, those people are formally informed and within a couple of months they arrive.</p> <p>  The Irish authorities have some selection criteria.  These criteria tend to be around family units, because they find these are easier to integrate when they come to Ireland.  They look for family units, for a small number of medical cases, for particularly vulnerable groups and also try to bring a group into Ireland whose members will in some way support each other.  They try, therefore, to try to identify groups with families with a leader style that might have some coherence around them and will use those criteria to assist in selection.</p></speech>

In regard to the Dublin Convention and the Dublin regulations, does that process work at all?  The convention provides that where people land in a member state, that is where they should make their application and they should not move on to another member state.  Am I correct in saying that this regulation does not seem to be working at all?</p></speech>

What is being considered is a system of relocation, where people will be taken from some of the Mediterranean countries and dispersed more widely around Europe.  If this system runs at the same time as the Dublin system, where people are sent back to the country they initially entered, it is counter productive.  Therefore, we must wait to see what the Commission proposals lead to and whether they will be accepted.</p> <p>  In regard to how the Dublin system works currently in practice, the new regulations - referred to as Dublin Three - have been in effect since the beginning of this year.  These have introduced a stronger emphasis on issues such as reuniting family members and refocusing the implementation of the regulations on some of the more positive measures.  There is some flexibility built into the regulations and countries do not return people to Greece because of the systemic difficulties there.  The states also have discretion in regard to implementing the regulation to return refugees to other countries facing difficulties, such as Italy.  There is also the flexibility to reunite family members when they are present in other member states.</p> <p>  As they stand currently, the Dublin regulations have some flexibility built into them, but there may be cause to review those regulations when the Commission comes up with its proposals.  </p></speech>

Members will recall that, following the referendum in October 2013, a former member of the joint committee, now Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, raised concerns about the design and layout of the ballot paper used.  This followed feedback from constituents after the referendum when a number of people indicated that they had been very confused on how they should complete the ballot paper and what they were voting for.  International standards require that the question being put to voters must be clear.  Clear identification of each ballot paper is also essential where more than one referendum proposal is being put on the same day.</p><p>The secretariat engaged with the Department on the issue and, following consideration of the information received, it was agreed to invite departmental officials to appear before the committee on 16 April 2014.  Following this discussion the joint committee agreed and published a report with recommendations.  The report, launched in June 2014, included a provision that the committee seek a progress report on the Department's progress in implementing the recommendations listed.  The report was also chosen to be debated in the D&aacute;il on 7 November 2014.</p><p>We are very pleased to welcome Mr. Enda Falvey, Ms Mary Lane and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Ryan from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I thank them for forwarding their presentation which has been circulated to members.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.

The report had emanated from the committee's consideration of correspondence sent to it following the referendums held in October 2014 in which concerns had been raised about confusion among voters in respect of the design of and the text and language used in the ballot papers used in the referendum on abolition of the Seanad.  The Department sent a progress report to the committee on 19 March 2015.</p> <p>  Officials from the Department were invited to address the committee on 22 April 2015.</p><p>The committee later extended this to today, having regard to the ongoing work on the referendums on marriage equality and the age of eligibility for election to the Office of the President.  I thank the committee for its consideration in this regard.</p><p> This meeting is an opportunity to review the Department's progress report.  The committee will also be aware that its report of 12 June 2014 was debated in the D&aacute;il last November and that some of the issues raised in that debate continue to be relevant.  The committee's report outlined four main recommendations, namely, that the Minister should examine the legislation with a view to modernising it; that the Minister examine the legislation with a view to modernising how a question is put; that the Minister examine the possibility of proofing the wording formally by some means in advance of preparing the ballot paper; and that a permanent electoral commission be established with a mandate to conduct research.</p><p> I will take the recommendations on legislating to amend the format of the ballot paper and the possible proofing of the ballot paper wording in advance of referendums together.  Following the publication of the committee's report, the Department sought legal advice and consulted the National Adult Literacy Association to identify the steps that might be taken in regard to the format of the ballot paper.  Simplification and modernisation of the referendum ballot paper is not a straightforward matter.  Article 46 of the Constitution provides that every proposal for an amendment to the Constitution must be initiated by a Bill which is submitted for the decision of the people.  The Bill must therefore be the focus of the amendment.  A direct question must be put to the voter about the proposed amendment rather than any interpretation or summary of the amendment.  Making a question simpler or more obvious runs the danger that a gloss or spin interferes with the real textual question and potentially acts as a forum for referendum information.  Recent court cases have emphasised the importance of process in holding a referendum.  The Department felt the National Adult Literacy Association had valuable comments to make in regard to the wording of the referendum ballot paper.  The association informed the Department that one in six adults between the ages of 16 and 65 years has literacy difficulties.  For such individuals, the format of the ballot paper used in the October 2013 referendums may have presented difficulties.  Issues identified include the closeness of the Irish and English texts on the ballot paper and the excessive use of capital letters and bold text.  Subsequent consultations between the Department and the National Council for the Blind reflected some of the same concerns in respect of people with visual impairments.</p><p> Taking these points into consideration, the Minister felt that the focus in the shorter term, particularly with the prospect of two referendums then envisaged for last May, should be on measures that could be taken within the existing legislative framework to assist voters in becoming familiar with the questions on the ballot papers.  This does not mean the format of the ballot paper cannot be improved in the medium to long term.  A future electoral commission might usefully be given the task of making recommendations on a new form of referendum ballot paper.  Depending on the particular amendment of the Constitution being put to the people in a referendum, it may be possible to move to a formula which would continue to focus on the amendment Bill while also expanding the question so that it is more explanatory.  This sort of research would, perhaps, be in line with the research mandate for the commission recommended by the committee.</p><p> In our progress report of 19 March 2015, we outlined the measures being taken by the Department to improve the format of the ballot paper in the May 2015 referendums.  In summary, the format of the ballot paper was changed to make it easier for people with literacy and visual impairments.  The Department had a positive engagement with the National Adult Literacy Association and the National Council for the Blind in making these changes.  While not meeting all of their requirements, both organisations agreed that the new format of ballot papers used in the recent referendums was a big improvement on the previous format.  The changes included the use different and generally larger font sizes, together with better use of upper and lower case letter, bold lettering and shading.  A sample copy of a ballot paper was provided to the committee.</p><p> Statements for the information of voters prescribed by each House of the Oireachtas were provided in poster form to local returning officers for placement in polling compartments.  Approximately 25,000 posters were printed and distributed to assist voters at the point of marking their ballot papers.  Senator O'Keeffe made a suggestion along these lines during our discussion with the committee last year.  The Department wrote to the Referendum Commission in advance of the May referendums to ask it to consider including a mock up of the ballot papers in the information booklets sent to voters.  The commission did so, which meant that voters had sight of the ballot papers and had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the questions being put to them in advance of polling day.  The opportunity to see a mock up of the ballot papers in advance hopefully helped some of those who were confused by the ballot paper in the October 2013 referendums.</p><p> In regard to the committee's recommendation that a permanent electoral commission be established with a mandate to conduct research, progress has been made over the last several months.  As noted in the progress report of 19 March, the Minister published a consultation paper on 27 January 2015 to commence the pre-legislative process leading to the establishment of an electoral commission.  The consultation paper includes the recommendations of this committee.  The Minister invited the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to examine the consultation paper and to consider undertaking a public consultation process to inform the preparation of legislation to establish a commission.  The Minister met with that committee on 10 March 2015 and I understand the consultation process is well underway.  The closing date for written submissions was Monday, 15 June 2015, and public hearings commenced on 16 June and are to conclude before the end of July.  A report will be submitted to the Minister on the outcomes of the consultation as soon as possible thereafter.  In any future work on the matters raised in eh committee's report of 12 June 2014, it is important that we do not lose sight of the gravity of the decision voters are asked to make in a referendum and the need for precise language in legal matters.  Proposals to amend the Constitution can have far-reaching and profound consequences.  In a constitutional referendum, voters are not simply being asked their opinion on a particular issue; they are asked to decide on amendments to the Constitution set out in the relevant amendment Bill.</p><p> I hope my brief statement adequately sets out our response to the recommendations made in the committee's report on this matter.</p></speech>

It is good practice that we regularly revisit the petitions and issues raised with this committee and I welcome that some of our recommendations have been taken on board by the Department.  It makes us feel that we are doing something right.  If somebody is visually impaired or has a physically disability preventing him or her from marking the ballot paper, what is the procedure for assisting him or her?  We may have discussed the issue previously but I am still curious about it.</p></speech>

In the case of the presiding officer assisting the voter, it is suggested that the officer proceed to a quiet part of the room or, if necessary, clear the polling station for a brief period so that the person with the visual impairment can feel free to state his or her preferences out loud without the risk of interfering with the integrity and secrecy of his or her voting preference.</p></speech>

Obviously, no system is absolutely perfect.  Generally, the comments were very positive but a few people contacted the Department with suggestions.  One was to the effect that the Irish version could be put at the back of the ballot paper and that it was still confusing having the Irish and the English on the face of it.  Some people raised smaller points such as that "Sea" and "N&iacute; hea" might be more relevant than "T&aacute;" and "N&iacute;l".  Those are the ones that come to mind.  Generally, the complaints were of a minor nature in my view and most of the comments were positive.</p></speech>

The question of assisted voting has been dealt with and it was indicated that a companion person is available.  Many people have raised with me an issue I am sure they have raised with others which involves people who are working away from home, including outside the country as part of the diplomatic service, and so on.  Is there a very strict approach to the issue of people who are going away?  Holidays are the obvious issue.  May is a holiday month and people often question the holding of a referendum in May.  Are the conditions set down very clearly?  Is it always work related?  Is it the case that people going on holidays cannot vote?</p></speech>

It is set down quite clearly that the postal voting facility is available for a number of categories of people.  It includes people who will not be able to turn up at the polling station due to their work.  Those people can fill in an application form and get a postal vote.</p></speech>

Some of them found out too late in the day that they were not even on the register.  Did the Department receive many complaints in this regard?  These were people in their 20s and early 30s who had a vote at one stage but were taken off the register and found out far too late to get onto the supplementary register.  There seemed to be a great deal of confusion over that, particularly where people were taken off the list who believed they had a vote previously.</p></speech>

There is always some difficulty or confusion generated by the register.  The register system is quite simple if one is familiar with it, but if one is not familiar with it, it can pose a few problems.  Every November, the Department engages in awareness initiatives for people voting for the first time to encourage people to register to vote.  It may be that some of this does not hit home as an election is not in the offing.  Colloquially, the last referendum appeared very much to appeal to younger people because of the issues involved and some of them may have decided too late to interact with the register process.  There is an opportunity if one is an eligible voter to get on the supplement to the register up to 14 days before polling day, which is reasonably generous.  Most people no matter what their age were well aware coming up to the referendum that it was on 22 May and would have had a reasonable prospect of being able to get on the register.  I am not saying it is an easy system, but they would have had the opportunity to interact with it.</p> <p>  As for people being taken off the register, local authorities manage the register and we encourage them to manage in such a way that it reflects the actual electorate.  There is a process, God help us, whereby people who die are removed from the register, but there should be no reason for a willy-nilly removal.  The legislation provides a detailed system for taking people off the register.  One cannot just remove them, but must contact them to notify them and show good cause.</p></speech>

Those people swore black that they never received a letter from the local authority saying it would remove them from the register unless it was told otherwise.  That leads to an awful lot of frustration when one is coming up to polling day.</p></speech>

This is the biggest problem.  People who may have voted in five or six elections and referenda may suddenly find at the polling station that their name has been taken off the register.  These are people who answer any letters that are sent and it is unbelievable to think their names have been removed from the register.  To get on it is one thing, but some people have been removed when the tradition has been there of voting ten or 20 times.  When a person suddenly walks in to find he or she has been removed, is there any mechanism where a person who has voted before can be reinstated on the day?  It is terribly unfair where people have travelled miles and really want to vote having done so in the past at the same station.  The returning officer in the station is there for a lifetime and knows the people who come in and who have voted before.  The returning officer will have marked the person off the register five or even ten times, yet because the name has been removed for whatever reason, it does not seem logical that a list would vary on a subsequent occasion without people knowing.  There is no doubt in my mind that people have been removed from the register without being informed or notified.</p> <p>  On the previous referendum, I thought the Irish and English versions were on top of one another and it was very difficult to determine what was on the paper.  That led to a great deal of confusion.  There was a huge number of spoiled votes in the previous two referenda of approximately 15,000.  That is a great many where only a simple question is being asked.  The possibility of having Irish and English separated on front and back should be looked at.</p> <p>  The real issue is a person's right to vote, especially those who have done so already and have a voting history at a polling station.  Some mechanism must be put in place to allow them to vote again.  We had a big story about the Bible being in every polling station.  What is it there for if it is not going to be used to allow a person to vote whom the returning officer has seen vote in the past but whose name has been taken off the register?  If the person swears on the Bible and it is confirmed by the people in the station, what more honesty and integrity can we have to allow a person to use the right to vote?</p></speech>

The number of spoiled votes in that referendum was 14,355.  However, in the recent referendum on marriage equality the turnover was much higher at 60.52%.</p><p> The referendums on the Seanad and on marriage equality were the ones on which there was the most public attention.  When the referendum on the Seanad took place there was also a referendum on the Court of Appeal but that received far less public attention, so we are focused in terms of democracy on the spoiled votes in the Seanad referendum.  Similarly, in the case of the marriage equality referendum the referendum on age eligibility was given very little focus so we are focusing on the marriage equality referendum for comparison reasons.  In comparative terms the number of spoiled votes is down by over one-third.  That is very welcome as far as we are concerned.  Obviously there is always room for progress but in a referendum where the turnout was increased by over 700,000 the number of spoiled votes was less.  That is very encouraging.</p><p> Clearly, the dedicated Referendum Commission will examine and manage these matters on an ongoing basis, but it appears that considerable progress is being made and that is welcome.</p></speech>

Both members referred to the spoiled votes.  On this occasion the percentage of spoiled votes was well down on the number in the referendum on the abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In fact, when one looks at polls taken together on the same day, this is the lowest percentage of invalid votes ever.  That said, there is no clear relationship.  To be fair, if those figures were higher I would be saying there is no clear relationship.  It comes back to the original committee concern about confusion about the ballot paper.  We have made changes to the ballot paper and it is nice to see that the figures are moving in the right direction.  However, in the European Parliament elections there were higher figures altogether and there is no question of confusion there.  We do not know why people spoil votes.  Anecdotally, some people will be confused and some people will do it deliberately, but we do not know.  I am not taking credit for a direct relationship between the improvement in the ballot paper and the figures, but it is encouraging to note it.</p> <p>  Deputy Wall mentioned the Bible and asked why it must be there.  The Bible creates difficulties on a number of fronts.  There were many complaints on the day about the presence of a Bible because some people might take offence at its presence.  The Bible is there so that if a presiding officer feels that somebody should be asked to confirm their details, they can swear it on the Bible.  However, there is no difficulty if one has no religious beliefs or if one does not wish to swear on the Bible.  One can just make an affirmation to that effect.  In our guidance we ask that 25% of people, on average, be checked for identity and that might lead to the use of a Bible for one reason or another.  In a local community where many people know each other the need for the Bible in those cases should not arise because the personnel probably know many of the people who come before them.</p> <p>  One gets all sorts of opinions on the Irish and English issue.  I always refer to Article 8 of the Constitution, which talks about their equal status.  In fact, Irish is meant to have a greater status.  It is very difficult for me to conceive of downgrading the Irish on a ballot paper.  I am not saying I have a closed mind on it but that is my reasoning.  On the specifics, when one looks at the ballot paper we used in the May referendums and compare it to the one used in the Seanad referendum, the gaps between the Irish and English were increased.  We did so because the National Adult Literary Agency, NALA, and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, recommended to us that we make the gap as big as possible.  We had the dilemma of making it as large as possible without making the ballot paper big and unwieldy, but there was an increase in the gap between the English and Irish on this occasion.</p> <p>  I will make two comments on the issue of removal from the electoral register.  It is very frustrating and I can understanding how people would even feel embarrassed when they turn up at the polling station where they have voted for many years, and where they might even be well known to the presiding officer, but suddenly they are not on the list.  It should not happen.  People should not be removed from the list unless there is a good reason.  Local authorities are asked, and indeed try, to maintain the register as best they can.  At an operational level, it is far easier to keep somebody on the register than to remove them from it.  The stories of people being removed from the register are obviously true but difficult to comprehend if there is no good reason for doing it.  Unfortunately, when one turns up to vote, one is either on the list or not.  Nothing can be done for the person at that stage, even though one has a moral right to vote and nobody wishes to disenfranchise anybody.  The law states that one cannot the register at that point in the polling station.  They are the facts and that is the law.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that there is a report back on this.  It is good to hear that action is being taken along the lines we and many members of the public suggested.</p> <p>  There is a big problem with the register.  First, there is a cut-off date which is tied to the old days when everything was done with pen and paper.  I accept that processing must take place and that there must be a cut-off date at some point, but we must seriously consider a rolling register or a register where the cut-off date is within a week of the announcement of an election or referendum, or something to that effect.  Some council areas have used a supplementary register to facilitate that.  However, the huge number of people who went on the supplementary register in the last referendum, in particular, shows that there is something wrong with the system we currently have, because that number of people were not captured in the normal register.</p> <p>  In Dublin, there were 15 enumerators who travelled around Dublin every year and called to every house in the city.  If one was not at home the leaflet was dropped in the letter box and one sent it back.  One stayed on the register regardless but lately, if one did not send it back the names were being deleted.  The number of enumerators in the city is substantially reduced.  I was told by a former enumerator that, in Dublin city, it is possible that two-thirds of the houses in the city will not receive a visit this year.  That means two-thirds of the register is inaccurate inasmuch as the enumerators make it accurate.  That is scary.  I do not know whether it is due to the local authorities not complying fully with the work they are required to do.</p> <p>  I firmly believe we should return to the way the supplementary register was compiled.  In the past, one was able to go on the supplementary register up to a week or ten days before the vote.</p><p>If one wants to vote in an upcoming election, one could be asked by the returning officer to put one's name on the supplementary register and one would have to go through the rigmarole of going to a Garda station and getting a garda to sign the form.  When I was in Pearse Street Garda station a month ago, it took 20 minutes for a garda to come to the desk.  If one was waiting for a form to be filled, one might say, "Feck that."  That is especially the case for a group of people in society who do not want any engagement with the Garda.  I suggested to various Ministers that anybody be allowed to be included in the supplementary register but that those on the supplementary register and claiming a vote be asked in a polling station for photographic identification.  It should not be a case of &ldquo;may be&rdquo; but that one &ldquo;will be" asked to provide adequate identification.  That would deal with the problem identified in the first instance with the supplementary register when the change was introduced to prevent multiple or illegal voting.  The change has had the effect of discouraging 18 year olds and other potential voters, including those who have moved house.  I will not get into a discussion on the use of PPS numbers, but they could work if the current system was tweaked a little.  In other countries, they delete them.  In the North even, voters have to register every year.  There is a campaign by the political parties in that regard, but it is also promoted by the civil servants that people register once a year.  I consider this to be an onerous approach, but given the level of disquiet about people having their names taken off the register, the issue must be addressed.</p></speech>

The register has been in place for a long time and has both good points and bad.  Members have articulated quite well a lot of the bad points.  There is body of work that could be done to improve the register.  That issue is on the agenda all the time.  It is a case of having sufficient time and space to take on such a big project as would be entailed in the amendment of the register, but it is a project that would be worth doing.  Some work has been done at local authority level.  Reference was made to Dublin City Council.  The Dublin authorities have been working on an electoral register improvement project, about which members might have heard.  They are trying to move away from the current system.  The intention is to use the best of technology to modernise it.  They will trial run some of it in parallel with existing arrangements.  A business case is in mind to see whether it could be used in other local authorities also.  That work is ongoing underneath the surface and will bubble up eventually.  Projects on the register will be undertaken as resources and priorities are determined by the Government.</p></speech>

It is the case that if one cannot get a garda to sign the form, one can go to the local authority as an alternative, but that may also involve a 20 minute wait.  I do not suggest the system is perfect.  The Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion was not to abandon the current approach but to put an alternative system in place whereby one would be obliged to produce identification at a polling station.  Taking all of that on board, the background to the issue with the supplement was that owing to the short period of time involved, there was a need to make sure the system was robust and not subject to any malpractice in comparison to the ordinary registration process.</p></speech>
