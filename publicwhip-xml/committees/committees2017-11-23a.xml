Today he is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.  The first session today deals with the reopening of Garda stations.  The next item will be Chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which is on the management of ancillary services at the Garda training college.  We are dealing with these matters first and we will defer our normal consideration of correspondence, our work programme and accounts received until the afternoon, as the witnesses from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must attend a Policing Authority meeting later on today.  They have to be long gone from here before 1 p.m.  We will come back to our normal business in the afternoon.</p><p>As I mentioned, two matters are to be considered today.  However, we also requested and received a note last week from the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, on the recruitment process and a breakdown of costs associated with the Charleton tribunal.  This had been raised in previous correspondence with the acting Garda Commissioner.  We received a letter from him yesterday evening on this particular item.  I will read it into the public record.  It has not yet been circulated but it will be published now.  It is addressed to the committee and is dated yesterday.  It states:</p><blockquote>I refer to your email of 16th November 2017 and note the Committee's intention to set aside a small amount of time at the PAC to questions on the setting up of the Tribunal Co-Ordination Office.  <br /><br />Please note that this matter has been the subject of correspondence between ... An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Committee [since] August 2017.<br /><br />Beyond the delivery of the public funding information furnished in that correspondence, and having taken Counsel's advice on the matter, I am concerned that discussions in the Public Accounts Committee concerning the Tribunal Coordination Office might easily trespass on the work of the Tribunal.  The Coordination Office are fully cooperating with the Tribunal on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I wish to ensure that there is no potential for any trespass on it's [sic] important work.  <br /><br />In the circumstances, I would be grateful if the Committee could postpone discussions on this particular matter.</blockquote><p> We will confine this matter to the very tight issue of costs, and there will be no straying into discussions that are taking place in the Chamber every day and the matters before the tribunal.  I have not spoken to the acting Commissioner because I have just received this letter, but can we deal with that one small item without straying any further?  I am saying to both the witnesses and the members that they are not to stray any further.  It is not within the remit of this committee to discuss what it happening at the tribunal, but we can talk briefly on the costs issue in terms of that unit.  I am not sure if such a comment is in the acting Commissioner's opening statement.</p><p> I have been asked to read the normal welcome.  I skipped that.</p></speech>

We are thorough in following through on previous commitments.  At this stage we will allow a few minutes for this topic.  There is general agreement not to stray into the work of the Charleton tribunal or matters that are not within the remit of the committee.</p><p>I would like to welcome the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy, Assistant Commissioner John O&rsquo;Driscoll, chief administrative officer, Mr. Joe Nugent, Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, head of estate management and Assistant Commissioner Eugene Corcoran.  From the Department of Justice and Equality we are joined by Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, and Mr. John O&rsquo;Callaghan, assistant secretary.  Mr. George Trimble also joins us.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  That means putting them on to flight mode.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>So, in relation to the recruitment process and costs associated with the Charleton Tribunal, members are invited to make a quick comment on it.  If there are no questions we will move on straight away, but if there are questions they are to be limited, very tight and very short.</p></speech>

I am sure that the Chairman understands that.  </p> <p>  As with all tribunals of inquiry, it is vital that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ensures it provides all assistance it can to the tribunal so that the truth and facts can be established.  This requires extensive and considerable resources to be devoted to the task.  At all times our objective is to provide the tribunal with the information it requires as quickly as possible.  So far, tens of thousands of pages of material have been provided to the tribunal.  As per material provided to the committee, additional, dedicated staff with expertise and experience in this area were required to assist with this task to meet the timelines of the tribunal.  This approach received written sanction from the Department of Justice and Equality and we have provided you with the costs involved.  I also wrote to the committee yesterday evening.  </p> <p>  Apart from repeating what we have already provided in correspondence I am not in a position to answer any questions on this matter.</p></speech>

For the benefit of the Chair, I asked parliamentary questions on 20 June, 26 July and on 14 November on the process by which this unit came into place, how authority was given for it to be put in place, how it was funded and how its members were sourced.  I am completely dissatisfied with the answers I have been given.  I believe I have been fobbed off.  I believe that, given that this is taxpayers' money, we need full transparency about how it was created and how the decision was made to exercise public money on this.  Who is using it?  Are all garda&iacute; using it or only a few?</p> <p>  I have a question for the acting Commissioner, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, and the head of HR, Mr. Barrett.  When were the people in this unit approached to go into the unit?  When was sanction given to spend this money on this unit?  The witnesses might identify the timelines involved.  </p></speech>

She said that it was going to have a big impact on the force and the senior management team.  At the time the Garda was dealing with gangland crime and international terrorism.  She was concerned about the capacity of the Garda to ensure that the tribunal would be serviced quickly.  To me it was a compelling case.</p><p>On that basis, I indicated to her that I would support that if she should go ahead and do that.</p></speech>

The Department gave written sanction.</p> <p>  We are here today specifically to discuss the one issue of finances.  We are only dealing with the 2016 audited expenditure to date.  We have had an answer from the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have had an answer from the acting Garda Commissioner.  As Chairman, I can say that we have got answers from the two people who are accountable to this committee here today, and I have to rule on that.  </p></speech>

The Secretary General is aware of this because I have had to go back to him seeking answers to my questions.

With regard to the financial issue, I want to draw the attention of everybody here and everybody watching to the fact that we have the Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice and Equality here.  He is responsible to the Oireachtas for the Vote and he gave verbal sanction to this matter.  A letter subsequently arrived.  We also have the Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na here, who is satisfied that he got his sanction and did the job he was required to do.  We have information that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform subsequently gave written sanction but that the matter had proceeded on the basis of the original verbal sanction because the job needed to be done.  We have two sanctions from two Accounting Officers here in person and we have notification of a third sanction from somebody else.  We can come back to look at this when we come to examine 2017 expenditure as part of next year's audit.  In the meantime I am ruling that we have statements from two Accounting Officers here, who are satisfied with the process.  They are the people who are answerable to the committee so this topic is now closed.  We had agreed to only give this matter 15 minutes and we have done-----</p></speech>

When we are finished with the Stepaside issue, I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to introduce his chapter at 10.30 a.m., which is the main agenda item of today's meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017112300002#E01700"><p>Given the time provided, I will deal with each matter by giving a brief overview and my colleagues and I are then happy to go into more detail where possible.  On the commitment in the programme for Government for the reopening of six Garda stations on a pilot basis, the Commissioner was asked by the Department of Justice and Equality to identify six stations with specific criteria to include a mix of urban and rural with a minimum of one in Dublin and a good geographical spread.  Furthermore, the Department advised the stations to be considered for reopening must be in State ownership.  In total, 139 stations were closed.  Of these, 78 stations could potentially be reopened.  Based on the criteria provided, a scoping exercise was conducted by an assistant commissioner with views taken from each regional assistant commissioner following consultation with local stakeholders.  Census data was also examined, as was data on crime trends from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.</p> <p>  Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll provided an interim report in June with a recommendation that Stepaside Garda station be reopened.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll was awaiting final recommendations from all regions as well as recent census and crime data before completing his report.  His final report and its recommendations have been approved by me as acting Commissioner and the report was forwarded to the Department of Justice and Equality earlier this week.  The six stations recommended to be reopened are, in alphabetical order, Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  Those include a station closer to the Border, two in Dublin at either end of the county, one of them large and the other smaller, another in the most southerly part of west Cork, along with a spread across five of the six Garda regions, which reflects consideration given to the criteria provided to us.  Following this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will liaise with the Office of Public Works to determine what remedial works need to be done at each station and the length of time and the associated costs of the works.  Furthermore, an examination of the resources required will be undertaken which will examine the numbers of staff, equipment, vehicles and ICT infrastructure required to determine in what order these stations are opened and when they are opened.</p> <p>  I will move on to the interim audit report and financial procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College of February 2017.  The organisation is committed to implementing all 19 recommendations in full.  Recommendation 1 cannot be completed until all 18 other recommendations have been completed.  Recommendation 19 can only be completed when the head of internal audit has conducted his audit of the implementation of the recommendations which he has indicated will be completed by the end of December.  The Policing Authority is overseeing our implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report.  The Policing Authority has deemed that 11 of the 19 recommendations have been completed.  Of the remaining six recommendations, three are on target for completion by the end of December and significant progress will be demonstrated on the remaining three which relate to procurement of food for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College and the transfer of lands to State control.  This clearly demonstrates the organisation's continued commitment to ensuring that there are effective financial management and control systems in place to manage finances and all administrative functions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College.</p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can say it takes seriously its responsibility for ensuring public moneys are spent efficiently and effectively in the best interests of the community and State.</p></speech>

It makes very interesting reading.  I actually read it twice since it is quite a story.  Going back through the decision-making process on this, a decision was made by the Government to, on a temporary or <i>ad hoc</i>basis, look at opening six stations.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The two ran together in tandem.  It fell then to the Department.  There was also a commitment in the programme for Government for this to move within two months of Government being formed.  That was clear in Government policy.  It then fell to the Department to put in place measures and steps to implement that.</p></speech>

Once Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll had applied the criteria that were presented to the Commissioner of the day, he distilled what stations were available to the organisation to be reopened.  It is then that we would have applied similar criteria that would have been applied in the closing down of stations.  Footfall, for example, was an issue, as were crime rates and population when stations were closed.  These were also central to reopening.</p></speech>

Multiple witnesses said they were.  To quote Deputy MacSharry</p><blockquote>The same criteria were used to close Stepaside as to open Stepaside.  We have established that Stepaside was the only one of a potential six stations to be reopened; that the criteria were the same; and the decision was based on the interim report.  Is that the case?</blockquote><p>Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in replied: "That is correct."  I have picked only one of several examples.  If the Department, as opposed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, sets the criteria and the Garda stated the criteria used were the same criteria as were used to close Garda stations, are these the same criteria?</p></speech>

It was open to the Commissioner, very clearly, to decide that he - or she at the time - would use different criteria.  These were not mandatory on the Commissioner of the day to use.  It was entirely open to the Commissioner.  If the Government wanted to go another way, it could have used the powers in the Garda Act to direct the Commissioner to do something.  It did not go that way.</p></speech>

It would have been some time shortly after that I would have been given the task.  I know that in September I wrote to all the regional assistant commissioners requesting that they approach it in a particular manner and that they submit recommendations in terms of stations from their respective regions.  It was, therefore, some date in between.</p></speech>

I request that he write to the committee stating on what date he was asked to do the report and provide the correspondence that shows he was asked to do it.  He might also provide the documentation to which he just referred.</p> <p>  As part of the process, on numerous occasions witnesses described this as a bottom-up approach - I can quote these references if Mr. O'Driscoll wishes - and that basically the most important component of the process was that everybody from the rank and file, which was the term used in the relevant passages, all the way up was consulted on making the decisions on reopening Garda stations under the criteria defined by the Department and subsequently under the criteria defined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The only reason I am interrupting is that we are short of time.  I do not do so to be rude but purely because we are caught for time.  I do not believe Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll has appeared before the committee previously, at least not before me.

First of all, we had the criteria which I set out to the regional assistant commissioners.  It was not a question of asking them whether they agreed or not in terms of reopening stations.  It was a question of stating to them or informing them that it was in the plan for Government that six stations would be reopened.  I sought views from the regional assistant commissioners.  I also met the analysts and Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy in relation to the Office of Public Works aspect of it and the availability of stations.  The immediate and most confining aspect of deciding what stations might be reopened was the fact that a lot of the stations that had been closed were already sold and no longer available.  This reduced the number of stations that were available quite considerably.  When one comes to Assistant Commissioner Pat Leahy's region, albeit that he was not there at the time, there were only four stations left that could be reopened.  In other regions, there was also a small number of stations.</p></speech>

It came to all the chief superintendents in the region.  I was one of them at the time and had responsibility for the north inner city - DMR north central.  That correspondence requested a report by 8 October 2016, which was 12 days later.  On 28 September 2016, I replied with a nil return from Dublin's north inner city and I stipulated that Fitzgibbon Street Garda station had been closed under a separate programme and, therefore, did not qualify.  I am quite prepared to pursue that separately, if necessary.</p> <p>  On 29 September 2016, the chief superintendent of DMR south, Chief Superintendent McPartlin, reported a nil return.  On 6 October, the chief superintendent of DMR west, Lorraine Wheatley, recommended the opening of Cabra Garda station to 24 hours, that is, extended hours for the station.  On 24 October 2016, Chief Superintendent Gerry Russell from DMR east recommended the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on reduced opening hours, namely, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.  On 1 November 2016, Assistant Commissioner Jack Nolan took responsibility for the process, again for a short while.  On 15 November 2016, the chief superintendent of DMR south, Frank Clerkin, recommended a nil return for the south central division.  On 18 November 2016, the chief superintendent for DMR north, Barry O'Brien, recommended the reopening of Rush Garda station, indicating that Lusk Garda station should have been closed initially.</p> <p>  Based on the information that came back from the chief superintendents, three out of six divisions had a nil return.  One Garda station - Stepaside - was the only one requested for reopening in line with the criteria that were set out.  The reopening of Rush Garda station was recommended but on the basis that Lusk Garda station would close because the indication was it should have been closed in the first tranche of the process.  Cabra Garda station was recommended for extended hours.</p></speech>

I only have three or four minutes but I will get to the punchlines.  I apologise to all the witnesses for cutting in but, as they will have seen, the Chairman is being very diligent today.  We know the second interim report recommended the reopening of Stepaside Garda station.  Given Assistant Commissioner Leahy's role and his previous role and in light of the information he has provided to the committee, does he agree that Stepaside Garda station was the largest priority for reopening in the Dublin region?</p></speech>

On the recommendation I made, it was recommended that the following stations be reopened subject to considerations.</p><p>In respect of Stepaside Garda station, a consideration was the significant impact on personnel levels available for front-line policing duties.  I have articulated that it would have had a significant impact.  Furthermore, the additional resources required to reopen Stepaside Garda station could not be extracted from current divisional strength.  Simply, at that point we would not have had the resources required.  If we had had a turn-key arrangement, we would not have been able to open it.  In terms of my priorities across the region in personnel allocation, it would not have been my number one priority.  Currently, it would not be my number one priority.  At this point I have other priorities across the region in the allocation of personnel.</p></speech>

On the parameters set, it was the station to be selected.  There was no other station to be selected.  At the time it was closed, there were 34 personnel in the station.  If it was to be reopened on the same basis, that is the number that would be required.  However, in his recommendations made as part of the process, the chief superintendent recommended that it be staffed with two sergeants and 15 garda&iacute;.  That means that we would still be talking about the allocation of 17 personnel and probably some support staff if the station were to be reopened on the same basis.</p></speech>

When it comes to the reopening of this station, there is an obvious resources implication and the assistant commissioner has said as much.  As Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said the last day in respect of the criteria set, it was one issue about which local Garda management must have been happy.  If everything else is in place, all things being equal, the question of whether there are sufficient garda&iacute; available to staff the station is part of the criteria.  Was Mr. Barrett consulted in any way, shape or form about the resource implications in the reopening of Stepaside Garda station prior to the second interim report being sent to the Government?</p></speech>

That is a matter for the OPW to decide.  Once the position is clear, the question will be providing the resources to bring them up to a standard that they can be reopened.  We will then have to consider the personnel issue.  The position is improving in that many recruits are coming out of the Garda College Templemore on a continuous basis.  We expect to see a dividend throughout the country in a meaningful way in the next 12 months as we start to increase the net number with which we started.  In effect, we are recruiting far more than we are losing to retirements on an annual basis.</p></speech>

The process entailed a set of criteria given by the Minister to the Commissioner.  That criteria were then used to select the opening of six stations.  It is possible, in my view, that the whole process was set up to ensure that the outcome was to open Stepaside Garda station, but notwithstanding that, which is my personal view, it ended up that it was one of those stations that was recommended for reopening.</p> <p>  It was possible for the then Commissioner to change the criteria.  I am wondering why the then Commissioner would not have said that perhaps the view of Mr. Leahy should form part of the criteria, or that she would want to hear directly from the commanding officers on the ground, who know the demands on policing and that she should change the criteria to ensure those demands were met.  If this was not a political decision, but purely based on policing, then I would want to hear directly from the commanding officers on the ground.  What I am hearing from Mr. Leahy is that if he had to make that call in the here and now, independent of direction from superior officers, he would not make the decision to reopen Stepaside Garda station as there are other pressing priorities. </p></speech>

That does not prevent me, and indeed I cannot get away from the fact, that there were a number of stations closed in the Dublin metropolitan region east division, DMR East.  It was significantly hit in that respect and the view was taken that into the future the chief in DMR East would get the allocation of resources and if it was decided to put some resources into Stepaside Garda station, I would have no problem with that.  However, if I got a certain number of garda&iacute; today and probably into the foreseeable future, into the first half of 2018 at least, I have more pressing needs in terms of resource allocation.</p></speech>

That is the policy of Government so that was to be implemented.  Whatever the policy was, I would make sure that this was done.  I wrote to the then Assistant Commissioner Nolan.  The information gathering took place.  Many assistant commissioners have issues about the opening hours of Garda stations.  That is not something that was within my remit.  I recognise that these are issues around the country.  It was purely relating to which stations would reopen.  Assistant Commissioner Leahy eventually responded, being the then incumbent when the response was issued.  His recommendation was that Stepaside would be the first preference in terms of stations that would be reopened.  Rush Garda station was the second choice, and the proviso being, something he emphasised, probably on reflection, that perhaps that Lusk was the Garda station that should have been closed.</p> <p>  In fairness to all the assistant commissioners around the country, and I know they all have issues about opening hours of stations, that was not part of this remit.  That is an issue for day to day management and will be addressed as additional resources come on stream. </p></speech>

There is no dispute whatsoever that there was a Government decision to reopen six Garda stations.  That is a fact.  There is also no dispute that the Minister for Justice and Equality set up criteria that were then given to the former Commissioner.  That is a fact.  We also know that it was up to the former Commissioner to amend, change, disregard or even establish her own criteria, if that was her wish.  We heard from Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in that she did not do that, that she choose to accept the criteria.</p> <p>  I am taking from Mr. O'Driscoll's response, and I do not in any way want to misinterpret what he has said, that Mr. Leahy in his recommendation to Mr. O'Driscoll seems to have a different view from he has just told this committee today.  Is Mr. O'Driscoll telling me that Mr. Leahy said that his first preference would be to open Stepaside Garda station, and then he named a second station as well?  That is not what I am being told here today. </p></speech>

That is an area in which there already is a station, so that is a decision that can be made on a day to day basis.  In terms of the criteria, in my report I set out other criteria which I recommend and believe would be taken on board for the bigger project.  This is only a pilot project involving the opening of six stations.  The project given to the Policing Authority in which it is using the facility of the Garda Inspectorate is to undertake a complete examination of boundaries throughout the country and to consider the whole issue of whether there should be new stations where stations have not already been opened.  The closure of some stations that have been opened on a pilot basis and other such issues can be dealt with at that juncture.  I state clearly that I have grave reservations about using crime statistics, for example, as a criterion.</p></speech>

So perhaps Mr. Leahy can clarify for me what he said earlier.  My question for Mr. Leahy is that from an operational perspective, from a Garda resource perspective and from a Garda priority perspective, would his preference at this point in time be to reopen Stepaside Garda station?</p></speech>

This is what I wrote in my closing remarks:</p><blockquote>In summary it is recommended that the following stations be reopened subject to the above considerations, which I have previously read out, in order of priority - Stepaside Garda station No. 1; Rush Garda station No. 2.  It is further recommended that the following stations have their opening hours re-established, Dublin Airport Garda station, and Cabra Garda station.</blockquote> <p>These were the recommendations that were made based on the criteria that were set out.  The question I am being asked now is, in terms of resource allocation would my priority be Stepaside Garda station?  No, it would not.</p></speech>

I have competing priorities in terms of my resource allocation and Stepaside would not be a first priority.</p><p>That is not to say that the people of Stepaside are not entitled to proper policing, and the chief out there will get his or her resources as they come on stream in the normal course of business, but in terms of the allocation of additional resources, Stepaside would not be my number one priority.</p></speech>

I asked at the start of this process a number of months ago when we first started to ask questions about this that we would examine process.  In examining process, what we have found is that it is an entitlement of the Minister to set criteria for the Commissioner.  We have now learned that it is also the prerogative of the Commissioner - in this case, it was the former Commissioner - to change the criteria and that did not happen.  If the criteria had been changed, for example, to give heavy credence to the view of Mr. Leahy, it probably would have ended up with a different outcome.  That concerns me.  I  believe that Mr. Leahy's view of having operational command in Dublin should have been front and centre and I said this at the start.  The question is this.  Was a decision made for purely operational purposes and purely based on the best expenditure of Garda resources or was it a political decision?  That is the question we were asking.  From the answers that I have heard, I have my own view.</p></speech>

Essentially, Mr. Leahy has stated that he has a broad range of priorities, the reopening of the Garda stations is based on the criteria, and this was a pilot project.  If it had been his task to look at his broader range of responsibilities, this issue would not have been top of his list, but Stepaside met the criteria he was working to, notwithstanding the much broader issues he has to deal with.  I wanted to crystallise it because we did not get to that at the earlier meeting.</p></speech>

This is in terms of the timescale.  I am aware that the Cherrywood development has a 2030 finishing date.  It is likely that the reopening of Stepaside will satisfy the demand in the interim, but there is a possibility that the end result will be that Stepaside will service this increased demand until such time as, maybe, this new station is developed, if it is a feasible proposition.  It is something that I brought to the notice of the Commissioner, having discussed it with Assistant Commissioner Leahy.  We thought it advisable to include it and to make people aware that this is a possible solution to all the problems in that particular area.</p></speech>

I ask this of the acting Commissioner.  Are our priorities agile and flexible enough to adjust and adapt to the needs of assistant commissioners and front-line personnel or are we bound by decisions of predecessors or archaic advice which no longer concurs with the up-to-date front-line demands but, as a result, the acting Commissioner sticks to them?  The reality is the acting Commissioner has given an order and confirmed we are opening Stepaside, despite the fact that criteria set by someone who had nothing to do with it were followed and the serving assistant commissioner, cognisant of the most up-to-date position on the ground, is saying he has other priorities.</p><p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in not have plenipotentiary status to the extent he can engage in some leadership and state he is adjusting and changing this, that he is not opening Stepaside and that he is putting all of the resources into Cherrywood or wherever else?</p></speech>

I am well aware of that and the position I hold.  Crime rates go up, populations change and demands increase or decrease based on all of this.  We are constantly taking account of all of this in the way we deploy our resources.  I expect every assistant commissioner to keep a close eye on what their priorities are in his or her region.  Assistant Commissioner Leahy has pointed to his priorities today.  If he were to be given some recruits in the morning to assign, he would be assigning them to stations other than Stepaside because Stepaside is still not open.  It still has not been reopened.  It will take a considerable period of time to assess what needs to be done to the building.  In that time, I am confident, with the increasing level of resources made available to the organisation, with the recruitment campaign in place for the past two and a half years and which continues apace, that those resources will be coming onstream to allow all of the demands to be met.</p></speech>

I cannot get away from the fact, and the Commissioner is right when he said, there is a process that will be undergone from now until probably mid or late January, or in 2018, to determine what it will take to reopen these stations and whether or not, in the short, medium or long term, it will be feasible to put people into Stepaside.  I do not want the people of Stepaside to think they are not getting their due regard in terms of policing up there.  If it were a thing that Stepaside opened at some stage in 2018 or 2019, and I will not say when, and was being used as an outpost for community policing in advance of some other station being built or otherwise, then I would not see it as being a bad use of resources, but if I were given additional resources today and asked whether they would go to Stepaside, no they would not.</p></speech>

It was mentioned on the last occasion in the context of Stepaside.  Some 101 garda&iacute; walked out earlier this week in Sligo.  Mr. Michael Reilly, of the acting Commissioner's own good offices, condemned the station in October 2016.  No remedial works have been carried out since.  The debacle with the new Garda station continues.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, said to me last night: "I am the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It is not my responsibility to get a site for the station.  Talk to the local authority and the chamber of commerce."  This was despite the fact that his colleagues have announced sites.  That aside, do Garda management appreciate that Sligo Garda station, in line with the report produced, has been condemned?  It is not fit for use.  </p></speech>

It is commendable that this committee faces the challenge of making best use of public funds.  What is being done in Sligo now is that the remedial works on the station have been planned and committed.  Matters are out to tender, with tenders to be back on 6 December for considerable remedial works.  We had discussions with the Garda Representative Association, GRA, on Friday 17 November which were focused on ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number and making certain that the works in the station were focused on bringing the cells in the Sligo station back into functioning order.  The lockers and member facilities are to be improved dramatically.  Congestion in the station will be addressed and alleviated.  The focus is on ensuring that the scarce resources available are targeted to make the greatest impact.</p> <p>  The position of the assistant commissioner for the northern region has been that priority be given to works on the station, which is the very point the Deputy raised and which has caused some tension.  There is a proposal that he and the chief superintendent would decamp to an alternative station at a cost of &euro;750,000.  The cost of fixing the station is &euro;1.25 million, and he has quite properly, in my view, decided that a policy of the greatest good to the greatest number should apply and so the station is to be fixed.  My colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, has outlined with the OPW a programme of work which would see the entire ground floor of the Sligo station, including the refurbishment of the cells, back in use by 30 September 2018.  </p> <p>  I would like to commend the Deputy for his constant commitment to seeking an appropriate site.  I understand that there is potential, working with the local authority, of gaining a 14 acre site at the Summerhill College roundabout.  It is ideal, given the confluence of roads, from an access-egress perspective.  The matter has been close to the Deputy's heart.  There is a requirement to consider the needs of the region for an appropriate station.  There are people working in that station at the minute.  I believe this matter has been amplified to suit certain agendas.  Mr. Reilly's report is not the only one in existence.  There is also an OPW report, which Mr. Murphy will deal with in a moment.  There is a commitment to dealing with the remedial issues.  It is a very real and time-bound commitment.  It is costed and makes the best use of taxpayers' funds.  There is a longer-term requirement, independent of that, to ensure that Sligo has the station that it needs and that the region is serviced appropriately.  Work is continuing in parallel, with Assistant Commissioner Barry O'Brien leading on it.  There are many areas where there is an absolute commonality of approach between the Garda associations, the civilian trade unions and Garda management on this.  There is an issue, but I believe that there are a certain amount of other contaminants involved which lead to the unfortunate events of last Monday.  </p></speech>

That is not to say that remedial and upgrade works are not required in Sligo Garda station.  They are undoubtedly required, and we have tabled proposals with Garda managment.  We want to have an inclusive process with the associations and agree those proposals to remediate the station along the lines that Mr. Barrett has mentioned.</p></speech>

I remember reading Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll's report.  Page 11 jumped out at me.  It says that it would be much easier to look at the task of reopening six stations if the Garda were not confined to the criteria.  I am paraphrasing what was written.  Does the assistant commissioner recall that?</p></speech>

I now have the final version of the report here, but I believe I meant that it would be easier if I was not confined to the stations that were now available to reopen and if other Garda stations had not been sold.  Assistant commissioners around the country did recommend the reopening of stations initially, and I then discovered that they were among the stations that had been sold, so I had to go back to them to tell them that we could only look at the stations that remain in State ownership, unfortunately.  That is the case in west Cork, for example.  These are the stations that remained in State ownership.  It was the recommendation of the local chief superintendent and the assistant commissioner in the southern region that the particular station in west Cork be reopened.</p></speech>

There are resource implications once the building is open.  If one asks a question about resourcing one would be told quickly that the Minster has no function in that and that it is the function of the Garda Commissioner.  The criteria that was set here pretty much determined the resource allocation for the stations that were going to be opened.  Does the acting Commissioner believe that was an infringement on his role, and why would he not have objected to that criteria on the basis that the Minister and Government have no function in that area?</p></speech>

We are told that all the time.</p><p>It is a big problem.  In my area, which is also Deputy Cassells's area, there is the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population.  I call the policing plan that is published every year a work of fiction because although there is the idea that criteria change all time, it does not consider demographic shifts or crime rates.  Here we are considering not only the opening of stations but criteria that determine where resources will be allocated. </p></speech>

That will ensure a fair allocation across the country and that we continue to keep an eye on that.  It would be useful to have an up-to-date scientific basis for that.</p></speech>

That is the bigger project, involving substantial historical changes in our design and where boundaries are drawn.  The criteria given to the Policing Authority provide that this is to take into account, where it states, "[T]he changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas, the views of local communities; the allocation of Garda resources and their deployment at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports".  We do include in our report other criteria that we believe should be taken on board, including the mobility project, areas where there are gatherings of people other than where they reside, such as Dublin Port, Dublin Airport, colleges, holiday resorts and so on and mobile Garda stations.  These can all be taken on board in the bigger project.</p> <p>  This is only a pilot project involving six stations.  I know from listening to the debate on rural crime a couple of nights ago there were recommendations that maybe all the stations that were closed should be reopened.  This is only a pilot.  Maybe under an another programme for Government all the stations will be reopened.</p></speech>

On that occasion I was told that the acting Commissioner would not have recommended it unless they were but listening to the oral evidence now I understand that it is not a priority.  Would it be fair to say, objectively, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has resiled from the position that Stepaside Garda station is ready to be reopened?</p></speech>

However, for all the stations approved for the next stage, when the Office of Public Works, OPW, will come in and work on each of the buildings, that will dictate the pace that moves at.  From the day those six stations closed, the overall human resource requirement is under 50 garda&iacute;.  Some are very small rural stations which require only one or two, or one sergeant and four garda&iacute;.  They are spread across five of our six regions.  On that basis, it would be within the gift of the local assistant commissioner with the chief superintendents on the basis of an improving resource allocation-----</p></speech>

I will conclude this section.  When we get to deal with our normal work programme this afternoon, we can discuss these issues.</p> <p>  I have listened to today's debate as Chairman.  In the acting Commissioner's opening statement, he has hinged everything  on the phrase "based on the criteria provided".  He also spoke about a report and recommendations, saying he recommended the reopening of six stations.  In alphabetical order, they are Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts may wish to consider what I have to say as Chairman.  Our function as a committee is to ensure good value for money for the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Vote.  Our priority should be the same as that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring the force has the resources it requires, gets the best value for money and can deal with crime in urban and rural areas.  Crime rates may increase or decrease along with populations.  As far as the Committee of Public Accounts is concerned, policing priorities should take precedence in the achievement of those results.  The allocation of resources should be based on policing priorities.</p> <p>  It is the job of the Committee of Public Accounts to call out where we think political promises or commitments may not gel with what we would consider the best use of taxpayer resources in the management and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I want to get agreement from the committee today.  The Secretary General has stated this matter is for 2018 and the stations will not open before Christmas.  There will be a debate on the Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, and we are informed that will happen next Wednesday, 29 November.  I would like this committee to agree to write to the justice committee in the morning, highlighting that it is the view of the Committee of Public Accounts that when it discusses the Estimate, it should deal with policing priorities and best value for money.  That should be its role.  It will be our role to examine the spending afterwards.  Our view will be that policing priorities should take precedence over any political promise when it comes to dealing with crime in Ireland.</p> <p>  Our committee will be drafting a report on this matter and we will discuss it in due course.  Our role is to ensure best value for money for resources and this should be based on policing priorities.  We can come back to it.  Is it agreed that such a letter should go to the justice committee before its Estimates meeting next week?</p></speech>

This provides the committee with an opportunity to examine further matters which we already reported on in some detail in July in a report entitled Examination of matters in relation to Financial Procedures at Garda College, Templemore.  It will be important for us to get an update on progress to address the issues and to be updated on other related audits being conducted into matters at the college.  Joining us for this session is Mr. Niall Kelly, head of the Garda internal audit section; Ms Anne Barry and Mr. George Trimble from the Department of Justice and Equality; and Mr. Martin Bourke and Mr. Seamus O'Neill from the Office of Public Works.  We have already had an opening statement from the acting Garda Commissioner for the entire meeting, so I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017112300002#O00200"><p>My report on the management of ancillary services at the Garda College follows from the committee's examination and report earlier this year, which dealt comprehensively with concerns around the operation of internal audit, oversight and governance, internal structures and organisational culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report does not revisit those matters.  Instead it examines the operation, funding and accounting for ancillary services at the Garda College and the management of State-owned land acquired by the Office of Public Works for Garda College purposes.  In addition to the college's core training operations, a variety of ancillary services and social activities have operated within the college campus, mainly for the use and benefit of trainees.  These include the restaurant, bar and shop, and a number of college clubs and societies.</p> <p>  The operations and costs of the Garda College are administered in a similar manner to those of Garda districts.  Most expenditure, including pay, equipment and capital costs, is managed and controlled centrally.  Local management is responsible for expenditure incurred locally using funds advanced for that purpose.  In addition to the Department-sanctioned public bank accounts used for the operation of the college&rsquo;s core activities, members will recall that over 40 accounts with financial institutions had been operated, relating to the college's ancillary services.  As of August 2017, a total of nine accounts were operating, including three public bank accounts for funding of core activities; two accounts controlled by college management for ancillary services, that is, one each for the restaurant and shop; and four club or society accounts managed by the respective memberships.  A summary of the bank accounts is presented in figure 12.3 of the report.</p> <p>  The college's restaurant is the biggest element of the ancillary services, with a turnover of over &euro;1.1 million in 2016.  The restaurant was not formally established as a company but had its own accounting records and a separate tax number.  The independently audited accounts for the restaurant indicate that up to 2008, the restaurant generated annual surpluses, with around &euro;2 million in accumulated reserves at the end of 2008.  Garda recruitment activity was suspended in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  As a result, over the period from 2009 to 2016, the restaurant incurred trading losses totalling &euro;1.95 million, which all but eliminated the reserves.  The restaurant was primarily funded through retained living allowances, which were paid on a capitation basis to the restaurant for periods when recruits were attending the college.  The funding model for the restaurant was changed in May 2017.  It is now being run on a net cost basis, calculated from the cost of staff wages and restaurant supplies and taking account of till receipts.  A record of the number of recruits in attendance in the college during each payment period is also provided to the finance directorate for information and correlation purposes.  This is intended to avoid surpluses occurring in the account in the future.</p> <p>  For comparative purposes, we also examined the arrangements in place in a number of other public bodies that provide restaurant and canteen services on-site for staff and other users.  These include the Defence Forces, a number of Departments, third level colleges and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Different service models are in place, with some providing services directly and other providing services on an outsourced or contracted basis, procured under a competitive process.  The models used are summarised in figure 12.5 of the report.  We found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have a clear framework in place for management of the college restaurant operations.  Other bodies have formal arrangements in place that set out the governance structure and accountability arrangements, and how any surpluses generated may be used.  I have recommended that a formal framework be put in place for the management and control of ancillary services.  The Accounting Officer has agreed to that recommendation.</p> <p>  The other main issue dealt with in the report relates to the management of land at the college, all of which was acquired by the Office of Public Works and made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The report outlines the complex legal situation that has arisen regarding the 37-acre site adjacent to the college that is used to provide a golf course and the process for acquisition of a large property at Dromard, 6 km from the college, in 2006 which was intended for development of a Garda training centre of excellence that has not yet been provided.  In both cases, there are concerns that the approach taken may not have achieved good value for money.  In particular, we found no evidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved OPW in advising on the granting, in 2000, of a licence for access to the golf course lands to a local club, no evidence that use of the golf course land was considered for college development purposes when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department sought additional land to increase the training capacity of the college, no evidence that the purchase of the Dromard land and transfer of control over it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been underpinned by any formal agreement or clarification of responsibilities and no evidence that OPW followed up or monitored the extent to which the Dromard farm was used for the purposes for which it was acquired, or that its value was otherwise protected or optimised.  I have made a number of recommendations in respect of property management that the Accounting Officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works have accepted.</p></speech>

A document was sent to the previous Garda Commissioner on 24 July by Mr. Kenneth Ruane.  The then Garda Commissioner personally claimed privilege on this document.  The committee has sought and is still seeking this document.  That Garda Commissioner is no longer in place.  I ask the acting Garda Commissioner here and now to release that document.

We have looked at the recommendations and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is meeting most of them, or is trying its best to meet them.  I have a query on the training as it relates to telecommunications.  The previous Garda Commissioner asked the Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in when he was the assistant Garda commissioner to put in place a risk process for the management of telecommunications, especially in the use of mobile phones by senior personnel.  The witness put that risk process, or register, in place.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

I will highlight some of the improvements.  I am reporting directly to the Commissioner as opposed to through Mr. Nugent, as was the case earlier in the year.  A new HQ directive, 25/17, sets out a responsibility for members to bring items of concern directly to me.  The Commissioner and I are redrafting the charter regarding the responsibilities and duties of internal audit.  The executive board has approved that charter.  Some discussion is under way with the audit committee, which wants to make a number of recommendations on it.  The executive board has also agreed to meet me at least four times a year.  Any concern that it has or I have will be addressed at those meetings.</p></speech>

Two issues need to be examined, the first of which relates to the learnings and changes that need to be made following the various internal audit reports.  We have the latest audit report, which makes recommendations and sets out the priority actions that need to be taken.  It is important that we learn from mistakes.  The second and most crucial issue is the need for people to be held accountability for failures, mistakes or worse.</p> <p>  This committee has spent a lengthy time examining the issues surrounding the Garda training college.

I am referring to situations where mistakes may have been made.  Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in mentioned that people were operating under archaic practices and processes, but those processes were put in place by individuals.  That did not happen by accident, but by design.  It was clear from the evidence and our report that that was the case.

As I said, the second part of my question will concern learning.  I am not talking here about people who acted in good faith and worked through the existing processes, I am talking about the people who were the architects of the problems.  Those processes did not fall from them sky, they were put in place by people in the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in just used the word "flawed", thus admitting that flawed processes were constructed by people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  After all of the hearings and examinations that have been carried out, not one single person in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, based on what I am now hearing from the acting Commissioner, has been in any way held to account for this.

Is she aware that a 2014 report into the Department mentioned a closed, secretive culture?  She is.  It talked about significant leadership and management problem and stated that "the Review Group found the culture of the Department to be closed and unnecessarily secretive"; that it was "an inward-looking organisation with limited learning capacity and reduced openness to new ideas"; and that it had a lack of clear responsibility and accountability both within the Department and when dealing with external agencies.  It then lists those external agencies and among them is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report goes on to specifically state that the management of the relationship of the Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also needed to be examined and then finally says that this relationship is ineffective and an oversight of a confused, passive and disaggregated departmental relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is unfortunate that we do not have the Accounting Officer from the Department here today but Ms Barry can certainly speak for the Department.

The Deputy is asking about the status of the golf club.  It is important to say a number of things as there is much uncertainty on the matter.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's priority has been to remove Sportsfield from the picture at the earliest opportunity.  That started with the transfer of the other lands, the playing field lands as they are known, in Templemore.  That is in the process of conveyancing.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's narrative in the document is interesting.  There is mention of a centre of excellence because Garda numbers were going to increase.  The specification was 15 to 25 acres and Dromard farm is way above what was outlined at that stage.  There were expressions of interest and then there was a guide price when it first went on sale.  The Office of Public Works estimated a market value of &euro;3 million and there was permission to go to &euro;3.5 million.  It was to be sold for &euro;3.5 million, which was the upper end.  The Department intervened and indicated needs could be met more effectively than through the purchase of Dromard farm, identifying a 29 acre site.  For some reason, we are told that did not proceed.  Dromard farm was put up for sale later with a guide price of &euro;5.45 million and, essentially, it was purchased for &euro;4.3 million.  It was way above the specification of what was needed.  Does the witness believe the value on it today is the same as the purchase price, which is somewhere in the region of &euro;4.3 million?</p></speech>

I was asked the value that has been placed on it.  I understand the book value would not have been updated since it was purchased.  It would more than likely stand at the &euro;4.3 million.  I could ask for a current valuation of that land and I would reasonably expect it to be a different value from what it was back then.</p></speech>

It will look afresh at what exactly is needed and at the making of those specifications.  When that happens, we must consider the appropriate property solutions and match them to resources.  I cannot speculate at this stage as to whether Dromard farm will be part of the specification or solution.  It could transpire that there is sufficient area around the college or in the existing curtilage of the college to satisfy the needs of the Garda.  That would be pure speculation at this stage.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, there seemed to be some chopping and changing in the requirements.  I was not part of that.  We went down one road with Dromard farm and when that was withdrawn or sold privately, the Office of Public Works went in another hunt.  While that was ongoing, Dromard, which had already been seen as suitable, returned to the market.  One of the particular requirements, as I understand it-----</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts report from July 2017 contains a number of aspects quite critical of the OPW.  One of the conclusions we made was that the fact the Garda college was leasing land from the OPW highlights a very worrying weakness in the management of State assets.  It was indicated that Dromard farm may well have an impact on the Garda Vote.  Did it have such an impact?  The committee noted that funds to be paid to the OPW for the lease of Dromard farm would be taken from the Garda Vote, which may have an impact on Garda services.  Where will the money be taken from?  Has it been considered at this stage?  What would be the expected amount in question?</p></speech>

It confirmed that in its opinion, 11 of the 19 recommendations have now been completed.  The employees issue will be resolved before the end of the year, which will also allow us to close bank accounts, which is also a consideration.  We will be left with broader elements that in some ways were reliant on other entities.  These include the conclusion of the procurement of food, which will happen around the first quarter of next year; and the transfer of land, which will take an amount of time and will have an impact on the wind-up of the Garda College Sportsfield Company Limited.  It is most important to say that particularly with the closure of the bank accounts and regularisation of employee status, the general infrastructure and procedures around the college will have been moved to a very different place from where they were this time last year.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions, with the first arising from comments made in a line of questioning from a previous meeting.  It concerns the previously voted and audited budget of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department, going back to the transfer of moneys outside the control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Mr. Kelly identified these as "compromising" the accounts in terms of not being able to stand over them.  Ms Barry made a comment earlier that it simply was not possible to look back, or words to that effect.  I would have a different view.</p> <p>  My question is for Mr. McCarthy.  Does something like this not warrant a special investigation of the Vote of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na going back to where it appears money was being used for all sorts of different purposes outside the control of both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department?  This is where it is to be determined what the moneys were being used for and by whom.  This may include other agencies that are not present now.  Is it not appropriate that the Comptroller and Auditor General would take a considered view as to whether such an investigation should take place of a certain number of years, depending on the information coming from Mr. Kelly's audit?</p></speech>

Technically, it would not be possible for me to go back and re-audit periods that have already been closed.</p></speech>

I take the point.  There is the question of what the value of it would be to examine all this in detail, particularly as additional work is being done, as I understand it, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is the right place for that to be done.  I have done the audit of the appropriation account of previous years and based on the information available to me I presented and published the appropriation accounts.  I cannot republish an appropriation account for a prior year.  It is not available to me to do that.</p></speech>

We have touched on staffing levels and when I mentioned it before, Mr. Kelly answered some questions.  The unit has 11 people and is heading for 16.  I thought it had 11 people the last time I asked the question but Mr. Kelly has said the number was eight.  That is fine and I must have misunderstood him at the time.  The section has also had the assistance of external accountants and auditors, which I am sure is helpful.  How long will it be before the work is completed?</p></speech>

I have supplied my current work programme to the committee and it identifies four audit reports, two of which are complete and two that I hope to have completed by the end of this year.  That process might identify more work that needs to be done and I cannot definitively say that will be the end.  I hope this section of auditing will be completed by 2017.  Other matters will fall into next year's plan and I will co-ordinate with the senior auditor from the Comptroller and Auditor General to get its views as well to ensure I am not missing something.</p></speech>

In the context of issuing sanctions, where there were management or governance issues, they have all been approached and we have processes in place to ensure that our governance systems are for more robust and that people understand the financial management area in which they operate.

This morning we dealt with the reopening of Garda stations and Chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report dealing with the management of ancillary services at the Garda College in Templemore.  We also had a discussion about the unit established by the Garda to deal with the Charleton tribunal.</p> <p>  We will turn now to the other items on our agenda.  Are the minutes of the meeting on 9 November agreed?  Agreed.  We will have the minutes of the meeting on 16 November next week.  We will come to the matters arising in our work programme so I will proceed to correspondence.</p> <p>  I will be very brief on the first items of correspondence which were in respect of today's meeting.  It is a formality.  No. 939A is from the office of the Garda Commissioner and is an update from Mr. Niall Kelly on the audit of cash and general management of the Garda College restaurant and shop.  We will note and publish that, even though we discussed it today.  Nos. 939A and 940A were in connection with the discussion with the representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today.  We will publish those items now.</p> <p>  No. 941A is the opening statement for today's meeting from the acting Garda Commissioner.  We will publish that.</p> <p>  No. 943A is the opening statement for today's meeting from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We will publish that.</p> <p>  No. 944A is correspondence dated 22 November 2017 from the acting Garda Commissioner which we dealt with at this morning's meeting so we will publish that.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and other items for publication.  No. 890B, dated 8 November 2017, is from Mr. Fred McBride, chief executive of Tusla, providing follow-up information to our meeting on 19 October.  He has provided a comprehensive and extensive reply to many of the issues we raised.  We note and publish that.  Members are free to discuss and use the large amount of useful information in the document.</p> <p>  No. 914B-----</p></speech>

It is No. 890B and it was on last week's list.  There is a lot of good information in it.</p> <p>  No. 914B, dated 13 November 2017, is from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on the HEA review of Waterford Institute of Technology.  The correspondence states that the deadline for the review has been extended to 15 December 2017.  An interim review is also attached.  We will wait for the final report.</p></speech>

However, it appears that many people have come forward.  There have been 50 meetings and 20 companies are being examined so it is a quite extensive examination.  Bear in mind that the completed report is something we said we would use to conduct a wider examination of intellectual property across the sector.  When that report is published it should come to the committee for consideration.  Whether we will have to invite the author to a meeting to discuss it will depend on the content of the report.  However, we said we would use it as a guide to inform us as to whether there might be problems in this area across the sector.</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will have that report early in 2018.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 933B, dated 16 November 2017, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and provides information on the transfer of assets of dissolved companies to the State.  The correspondence sets out in detail the legal situation and complexities.  Members might wish to study this detailed response.  If they have not yet had an opportunity to do so we will hold the item over and put it back on the agenda for the next meeting.  There is a good deal of reading in it.  Members could spend a few minutes reading it privately before we discuss it in public.  In any case, it is held over to be on the list next week.</p> <p>  No. 934B, dated 17 November 2017, is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, CEO of SOLAS, and provides follow-up information requested by the committee at the meeting of 16 November.  It includes SOLAS salary costs, staff numbers and a summary of consultancy costs in 2016.  I should point out that these representatives appeared before the committee a week ago and this letter was sent to us the day after that meeting.  That is an example of how public bodies should be able to supply information in written format to the committee.  I contrast that with the Department of Education and Skills whose officials appeared before the committee and we are still waiting for extensive information from them.  There has not been a dicky bird from them yet.  We will watch and wait for that.  We have not even received clarification of basic items that were discussed that day.  SOLAS could teach the Department a lesson.</p></speech>

We will follow up closely on that to ensure we get answers to all our questions.</p><p>The next item is No. 935B from the Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing an information note on the working group established by the Minister to investigate the relationship between the voluntary and State sector.  A review group has been established.  Somebody asked for a briefing note on that and the information is available to whoever is interested in it.</p><p> The next item is No. 937B, correspondence dated 20 November 2017 from Dr. Graham Love, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, providing a response to matters raised by the committee in relation to a president's retirement event at Cork Institute of Technology.  The HEA is following up the matter.  It is currently seeking a full explanation.  That is a holding reply for the moment.  That was discussed at length at the previous meeting.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy MacSharry on raising the issue in the first place.  The reply says that no specific guidelines are in place.  Could we write advising that the HEA would seek to put guidelines in place?  The HEA said it shares the committee's concern about the appropriateness of signing off on the expenses.  Again, that goes back to what happened earlier today.  Obviously it is not a huge issue but at the same time when there is wrongdoing, what is the sanction?</p></speech>

I will ask him to consider that matter before he gives us a full response because there is a gap there.</p></speech>

At the moment it is noted and that is the end of the matter.  It devalues the constitutional status of this committee if we are discovering or highlighting issues and there is little more than a rap on the knuckles.</p></speech>

We will come back to it when we are drafting the report.  The PAC cannot implement sanctions against organisations but we can ensure they have proper arrangements in place.</p></speech>

I do not think we should, nor would I advocate that we should, but Accounting Officers should and if they cannot do it then it is indicative of a bigger problem.  I do not know what Department this would come under.  Is it possible for us to get some guidance on what processes are in place to allow Accounting Officers to sanction people?  Let us take the Templemore issue as an example.  If nobody is held to account then what is stopping the same thing happening again?  Absolutely nothing other than the Accounting Officer would come into the Committee of Public Accounts, spend a couple of weeks getting his or her knuckles rapped and he or she would go out the door and nobody is held to account.  That seems to be the case with almost every scandal or issue that comes before this committee.  I am not doing their job for them, nor would I want to, but there never seems to be anybody held to account on the back of any of this stuff.  Either that is because they do not want to do it or because they cannot do it.  If they cannot do it, that is a matter for the legislators.  If they can do it and it is not being done then that is our job to hold them to account.</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane is quite right.  As part of the process when we produce the next report, which we will come to shortly, we will ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to specifically address that question.  We will include that in our next report which we will discuss shortly as part of our work programme.  The point Deputy Cullinane raised is quite correct.</p><p>We now move to category C correspondence, which is from private individuals.  No. 884C was carried over<b></b>from the previous week.  It is from an individual in the Irish Prison Service who made a protected disclosure.  The person has previously written to the committee and he maintains that he continues to suffer in a number of ways including financially as a result of making the disclosure.  The committee has written to the Minister on the matter drawing attention to the issues.  We have yet to receive a full reply on the matter and the secretariat has followed up on the matter with the Minister's office.  We will tell the Department of Justice and Equality that we need the reply by next week.  Can we note the item?</p></speech>

We will follow that up.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 913C, correspondence dated 15 November 2017, from Deputy Josepha Madigan, Chair to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, regarding the Coffey report into corporation tax.  We will note that.  We have our job to do.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 915C dated 13 November 2017 from an individual following up on information received on the thoroughbred foal levy from the Department.  We got a reply from the Department which we sent to the gentleman concerned and he has written back with a further detailed reply.  We will note it.  Essentially, he calls for a change in the legislation to have the levy based on a percentage of sales.  We cannot change the legislation in the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will note the request.  I do not think we can take it any further.  We have exhausted the issue.  There was a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy Clare Daly in the D&aacute;il but it did not proceed.  I do not think the Bill got to Second Stage.</p></speech>

We got a good letter from the Department the previous day setting out the facts of the case.  The individual who wrote to us has a point in that the levy is based on the published band of charges as opposed to what is actually charged but the matter requires a change in the legislation.  We have exhausted the matter in the committee.</p></speech>

The main point is the levying of the fee.  We have discussed the issue at length and we have had detailed replies from Horse Racing Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and a Private Member's Bill was sponsored.  Reference is made in the correspondence to Deputy Clare Daly's Bill which sought that the levy would be 1% of the actual sale price.  I am not sure of the status of the Bill but I do not think it got to Second Stage.</p></speech>

I know it is to suit them but they do not get their fees until perhaps two years later.  They want the system to be changed so that a foal could only be registered when the levy was paid and that way they could get their money and the foal could be registered.</p></speech>

Item No. 916C is correspondence dated 10 November from an individual relating to the awarding of a contract to a body without a tender process by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The correspondence raises questions as to why this Department is developing the framework when it has been previously undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I propose we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a full note on this to address the questions contained in the correspondence.  When we get a reply we will follow it up at that stage.</p> <p>  No. 917C is correspondence dated 15 November 2017 from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in reply to a request for information on the PRSI classification of certain staff employed by Coillte.  The reply says that the Department is not involved in this case and suggests that we direct our enquiry to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose that we write to that Department, as suggested and also request information directly form Coillte.  </p> <p>  No. 920C, correspondence dated 16 November 2017 from an individual in regard to a number of issues including the Rugby World Cup, Government funding for the RDS and lobbying by an insurance company.  This is only a copy of letter that has been sent to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, Deputy John McGuinness.  I suggest that we note it.  The original has gone to the aforementioned committee and there is nothing in it for us to follow up on.  </p> <p>  No. 921C is correspondence dated 23 October 2017 from an individual regarding the Irish Prison Service and the individual&rsquo;s sentence management.  This matter is not within the remit of the committee and as the individual has also made contact with the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality office and the relevant sectoral committee, I propose we note the correspondence and communicate with the individual to that effect.</p><p>We are simply noting it.  The individual has already written to the other people directly on it.</p><p> No. 922C is correspondence dated 31 October from an individual in respect of proposed TV licence increases and freelance contracts at the national broadcaster.  As we are considering an engagement with RT&Eacute; early in the year, I propose we simply note it.  We might discuss the RT&Eacute; issue on the work programme presently and we will note the correspondence in the meantime.</p><p> No. 923C is correspondence dated 9 November 2017 from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in respect of an ongoing case with which members will be familiar.  The Minister has stated the need for the individual to make contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if he has information relating to the murder of a State employee and that matters relating to the individual's dismissal cannot be provided to the committee for data protection reasons.  I propose that we forward the response received from the Minister to the individual and advise that we will not be considering the matter any further.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

He maintains he was close to being hit and has been traumatised.  However, all of that aside, his case has gone through the chief medical officer and everywhere along the line.  The person has been officially and formally dismissed at the end of a long process.  Obviously, I can understand he is not satisfied with that but it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and not for the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  No. 924C is correspondence dated 16 November from John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Employment and Social Protection, regarding the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  Deputy Aylward raised this matter.  The letter advises that the chief executive of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service is an Accounting Officer for the body and not the Secretary General of the Department.  The letter indicates that the chief executive could be invited to attend and answer questions.  MABS is directly answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts because the Comptroller and Auditor General audits the MABS accounts.  We can consider that.</p></speech>

It is aligned to the board and under it.  I got a letter from MABS yesterday complaining that the board has gone ahead and regionalised the service.  Those operating the service are still not happy.

Are we bringing in representatives of MABS or CIB?</p></speech>

Maybe CIB was directed from on high to implement it, but the board is responsible for implementing it and we want to ask why.</p></speech>

We have noted it.  We are carrying on with our work.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on corporation tax.  It is our duty to follow that.</p> <p>  No. 927C is correspondence dated 17 November from Deputy McDonald.  I am told we are holding that over.  We will come back to it.  There is a related item.</p> <p>  No. 928C is correspondence dated 1 November from an individual questioning the public funds that are used in the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The body receives a significant amount of money from the Exchequer.  I propose that we write to the National Women's Council of Ireland for a note on the matter.  I am unsure what the particular query is but we will send the council an information note.</p></speech>

We will take it from there.</p> <p>  No. 930C is correspondence from an individual with further questions for NAMA in respect of the sale of a hotel in Cork.  I propose that we forward it to NAMA.  We have done that before.  We have got replies back.  We have sent them out.  They are back again.  We will send them on to NAMA.  On she goes.  We will forward the correspondence to NAMA for follow up.</p> <p>  No. 931C is correspondence from an individual in respect of Ireland's health service.  The correspondence seeks the best method of getting in touch with committee members.  We will ask the secretariat to liaise with the others &ndash; they have done that &ndash; and to clarify it.  It is an administrative query on dealing with the committee.  I note that the correspondence includes the letter I had issued to the individual some time ago.</p> <p>  No. 932C is correspondence dated 19 November regarding an alleged mock customs post set up in Dundalk earlier this year.  As the person is alleging impersonation of Revenue officials, which may be a criminal offence, I propose that we write to the individual and suggest that the matter be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if the person believes an offence has been committed.</p></speech>

It may be a criminal offence to set up a customs post if it is bogus.  I have no idea what is behind this.  If the person has something to say and believes an offence has been committed, the matter should be reported to the Garda rather than us.  On we go.  Deputy Deering is surprised at the correspondence that is coming our way.</p> <p>  No. 936C is correspondence dated 20 November from Marty Whelan of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, referring to documentation received by the committee from a private nursing home.  The nursing home has sent two appeal notices to HIQA and these appeals will be heard in February.  Enclosed is a copy of the letter from Phelim Quinn, chief executive of HIQA, to the nursing home.  HIQA has stated that as the matter is under appeal, the authority will not be commenting further on the individual circumstances of the case.  We have also received another item of correspondence submitted by the nursing home earlier.  It was forwarded to the committee by Deputy McDonald.  There are some legal concerns about the correspondence that was sent to us.  We need time to consider how we should proceed.  The secretariat is asking the parliamentary legal adviser to look at the correspondence before we discuss the matter in public.</p> <p>  No. 938C is correspondence dated 21 November 2017 from Dr. Richard Thorn relating to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  What is that letter?  I have not seen it.  It came in yesterday.  It relates to the University of Limerick review.  He thanks us and acknowledges the work on the University of Limerick review.  He understands that we asked for an executive summary.  We had the report but no summary.  He is happy to provide that and an explanation of why he did not have an executive summary.</p><p>I will quote from his email to the committee secretariat.</p><blockquote>In relation to the Kildare and Wicklow ETB investigation, I will provide an Executive Summary and/or a Summary of Findings and Recommendations in line with the Committee's wishes.<br /><br />Apropos the Committee's concerns about the unwillingness of members of Kildare Wicklow ETB to answer questions at a recent Committee hearing, I would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Committee to answer any queries they may have in relation to the conduct of the investigation once the report has been finalised and submitted to the Minister for Education and Skills, as per the legislative requirements of Section 40 of the ETB Act of 2013.  I anticipate this submission taking place by the end of January 2018.</blockquote></speech>

I took a phone call from a member of the Kildare and Wicklow ETB and she sent me an email expressing difficulties on how the board was operating and in connection with the evidence provided, principally by the chairman of the board to the committee when he appeared before us.  She raised health and safety issues in some of the schools and included some document that referred to a High Court dispute.

The Deloitte letter will be on the agenda for discussion at our next meeting.  We did not get a chance to circulate the letter in time for the meeting.</p> <p>  The next issue on the agenda is financial statements received since the last meeting  The United States Commission for Education Exchange has a clear audited opinion on &euro;1.2 million and it provides grants to Irish citizens to study, research and teach in the US and for US citizens to do the same in Ireland.  The Laois and Offaly Educational and Training Board 2016 accounts have been submitted and there is a clear audited opinion.</p> <p>  The next item is unusual, the National Asset Management Agency Investment Limited.  We have just received its  accounts for 2011 to 2016, inclusive .  All the accounts were certified within a reasonable period in the following year but for some reason they are now only being presented to the Oireachtas, even though the 2011 accounts were certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in July 2012.  We must write to NAMA and the Minister for Finance seeking an explanation as to why these accounts were not laid before the Oireachtas or published before now.  I want the people who are watching these proceeding to understand that the National Asset Management Agency Investment Limited is the holding company that owns NAMA.  A couple of weeks ago when I was following up on correspondence from NAMA, I saw a reference to this company and on 10 October I tabled parliamentary Question No. 28, reference number 42512/17, and received a reply.  It will be circulated as part of correspondence.  I asked the Minister for Finance the persons or organisations that are the 51% owners of the NAMA group.  I now suspect that because I tabled a parliamentary question, it probably prompted the publication of these accounts.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has audited these accounts every year since 2011 but they were never laid before the Oireachtas.  We are writing today to NAMA and to the Minister for Finance asking them to explain why they were not laid before the Oireachtas.  I will read one or two sentences from the Minister's reply.</p> <p>  The NAMA loans are not on the State balance sheet.  EUROSTAT ruled that special purpose vehicles which were majority owned by private companies would be regarded as being outside of the government sector if they met a number of conditions.  It was necessary under EUROSTAT rules to set up a special purpose vehicle, that is, a company to own NAMA, that would not be on the State balance sheet.  That can only happen if the majority shareholding is held in private ownership.  People may find this very strange.  This is a mechanism to take major debts off the State balance sheet.  The statistical office of the European Union, EUROSTAT, will only allow them to be taken off the State's balance sheet if the debts are majority owned, 51%, by private investors.</p> <p>  One newspaper picked up on the Minister's reply to my question on 10 October 2017.  I had asked in respect of the 51% owners of the NAMA group, the shareholding of each of these persons and organisations and the amount of dividend paid to each in each year to date since NAMA was established.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017112300002#OO03900"><p>No, and this may surprise the Deputy.  I asked the amount of funding each of these invested in the NAMA group and how much they will get when NAMA is being wound up, because NAMA will have a surplus.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, the Minister would have made a statement that Members asked about paying off the NAMA debts earlier because NAMA has plenty of money in its account and will have a surplus.  The Minister for Finance said that they could only return the money to the Exchequer when all its debts are paid off and the investors in the holding company have been paid.  I asked who were the investors in the holding company.  Let me read from the Minister's reply to my parliamentary Question No. 28.</p><p>The reply said there was a decision issued by EUROSTAT in 2009 that only special purpose vehicles, SPVs, that were majority owned by private companies would be regarded as being outside the Government sector, which means off the State balance sheet.  It said: </p><blockquote>Among the conditions were that the SPVs were of temporary duration and were established for the sole purpose of addressing the financial crisis.<br /><br />In order to avail of this accounting treatment, NAMA established an investment holding company &ndash; National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C. &ndash; which is majority-owned by private investors.  51% of its shares are collectively owned by private companies and the remaining 49% are owned by NAMA.  Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement between NAMA and the Private Investors, NAMA exercises a veto over decisions ...  EUROSTAT gave its approval to this structure in October 2009. </blockquote><p>Even though they own 51% and 49% have a veto, EUROSTAT accepts that once there is 51% private ownership, it is off the State balance sheet.  <br/><br/>The reply continued: &quot;The total issued share capital of National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C is &euro;100m of which &euro;51m ... was invested by the Private Investors, each receiving an equal share of the 51 million B ordinary shares.&quot;  It then gave a breakdown of the share capital invested by the original private investors in 2010.  I will not read it all.  To come up with the &euro;51 million, the 51% of the NAMA holding company, Irish Life Assurance Plc put in &euro;17 million, New Ireland Assurance Company Plc put in &euro;17 million and a company called Percy Nominees Limited put in &euro;17 million.  That &euro;51 million gave them 51% ownership of the holding company in NAMA and that took NAMA off the State balance sheet.  EUROSTAT is happy with that but 51% of it is owned by the private sector.  Some of those companies changed and now the final shareholding is still owned by a company called BNY Custodial Nominees, which owns &euro;17 million; New Ireland Assurance, which owns &euro;17 million; and the &euro;17 million owned by the other company is now being split between Arthur Michael Joseph Keeley; the Church of Ireland Clergy Pensions Fund, which owns 3%; the Representative Church Body, Church of Ireland investment fund, which owns another 2.5%; Geoffrey Ian Broomhead, who owns 1.3% of the shares and Simon Stuart Haworth, who owns 1.2% of the shares.  The arrangement is they get a dividend each year based on the interest available on the market at that time.  At the end of it they get a dividend.  Before the &euro;3 million surplus of NAMA can be handed back to the State, that &euro;51 million has to be bought back by the Government.  They have to get their dividend which they are getting each year.  The dividends paid to these companies was &euro;5 million in 2011.  It is on the record in a reply to a parliamentary question on 10 October.  They have been paid &euro;13.52 million in dividends to date.  They will get a dividend at the end of the process and &euro;13.552 million has been paid to them by way of a dividend for their investment in the NAMA holding company.  </p></speech>

I have the amounts paid out in each year.  The shareholding changed in each year because one of the organisations had a change in ownership.  It is probably a technical point.  Perhaps it was coincidental, but I think that parliamentary question, which I submitted around a month ago, prompted the financial statements of the NAMA investment agency investment limited, the holding company for all of NAMA.  Even though they had accounts every year since 2011 and they were audited every year by the C&amp;AG, they were never laid before the Oireachtas.  Now we have five year's sets of accounts being laid before the Oireachtas.  The question is why were they not acknowledged-----</p></speech>

"Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement, the maximum return which will be paid to the private investors by way of dividend is restricted to the 10 year Irish Government Bond Yield applying at the date of the declaration of the dividend."  So it can change.  The interest rate is based on the Government borrowing rates.  They are not getting an exorbitant interest rate.  It is based on the Government borrowing rate and then there can be another small amount of a dividend given on the winding up of the company.  When they get all their money back, the &euro;51 million plus the dividend and their final dividend and when that company is dissolved, the surplus of &euro;3.5 million in NAMA can then come to the State.  This has to happen first.  I say that by way of information.  The date that written parliamentary question was answered was 10 October.  We will write to the Minister and NAMA to ask why the accounts of the holding company for the past five years were published?  I found it interesting.  When it comes to social housing, I see no reason why on a temporary basis, to deal with the housing emergency as we did with the financial one, we cannot come to an accounting arrangement, as it is called in the reply by the Minister to the parliamentary question, that would allow a company to technically own 51%.  The State would have a veto on all operations and it would take all borrowings off the State's balance sheet.  The argument we cannot borrow because of EUROSTAT is right but if we go about it this way, we certainly can.  It is an eye-opener.  It sets a precedent.  When the Government wanted to get permission to borrow tens of billions off the State balance sheet, there was an accounting mechanism introduced to satisfy EUROSTAT and I think it could be used for other purposes.  It is up to members.  I think they get where I am coming from.</p></speech>

Our work programme is on the screen.  We are getting there.  Today we had the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in and there are a few comments I want to make.  Next Thursday, we have the Revenue Commissioners in on corporation tax receipts, chapter 20 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the question of dealing with corporation tax.  We decided two weeks ago, as part of assisting the committee in our understanding of how multinationals understand our taxation system, that we would invite Apple, Google, Citibank, JP Morgan, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer to appear before the committee.  The letters were issued this week inviting those six companies to send their most senior representatives to the committee early in 2018.  We cannot pencil in dates or anything like that.  We will talk about scheduling meetings over a couple of days if we can get them to come in on a particular date.  Those letters of invitation have gone out this week and we wait to hear from them in due course.</p> <p>  The following week we have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which will be straightforward.  It is a very big Department and there are lots of questions to ask.  The following Thursday, 14 December, we are starting into chapter 3 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the cost of banking stabilisation.  IBRC liquidation has been mentioned for special consideration as part of that meeting.</p> <p>  I am most keen that instead of having public sessions here and that being the end of it, the Committee of Public Accounts should draft a summary of our meetings and any conclusions and recommendations we make.  Since we came back at the end of September, we are being assisted by an additional staff member who is now carrying out drafting work on a report of every meeting we have had and the key topics covered.  I will summarise them now in a minute.  That has been done since we came back in September with a view to producing a report on our work every so often.  It is part of our duty when we find something, not to walk out the door but to put it in writing in a report, send it to the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get a formal response and follow through.  </p> <p>  On 28 September we had HIQA in.  On 5 October, we had the IDA in.  On 12 October, we had Transport Infrastructure Ireland in.  On 19 October, we had Tusla in.  On 27 October, we had the HSE to deal with section 38 and section 39.  We have dealt with the issue of Garda stations.  I think we have nearly concluded it today.   The secretariat is now working on the report and we will have it next month.  The reports will not be very extensive.  They will be a short chapter to summarise each of the meetings and recommendations.  We will have an update with a view to the following week having a look at a draft report with those six chapters in it.  We might then sign off on it a week or so later, probably with a view to launching it in early January.  We have enough on our plate between now and Christmas.  There is no point in launching a report Christmas week.  We could nearly get it put to bed.  I do not think the report will be too complicated.  Some people will be interested in some chapters and some people will be interested in others.</p><p>We might have a full briefing at next week's meeting, even if we have to do it in private session, with a view to having a preliminary draft ready as soon as possible.  I have seen the <i>modus operandi </i>of the secretariat and it is starting to put a nice, concise report together for us.  The plan then would be to have a report on the five or six meetings between mid November and Christmas one month later.  After every five or six meetings we need to do a short report so that people can see the outcome of those meetings.  That is where we are at and I do no think there is anything else to be discussed now.  The issue of RT&Eacute; has been mentioned and we will talk about it next week.  Deputy Cullinane brought it up-----</p></speech>

I will start with a short introduction to myself and my background.  I have a background in law and sociology.  I was professor of health law for more than 20 years in the University of Amsterdam in the faculties of law and medicine, in the academic medical centre where my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, also works.  I was a former editor-in-chief of a European journal of health law and of the Dutch journal of health law.  For more than 25 years I was a member of the Dutch health council advising the government on health and the ethical and legal aspects of health care, and, in relation to today's subject, I was responsible for the first evaluation of the abortion Act in the Netherlands which took place in 2005, 20 years after it was issued in 1985.  We conducted a nationwide study of how it was applied and functioned.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to inform it about abortion law and practice in the Netherlands.  We have already given the committee an overview of the Dutch situation in our joint paper.  In this opening statement we will briefly summarise this paper, focusing first on the law, which I will do, and then on the practice in the Netherlands, which my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, will do.   </p> <p>  I will say a few words first on the termination of pregnancy Act as it was enacted in 1984.</p><p>Terminating a pregnancy is a crime under Article 296 of the Dutch penal code.  The abortion Act is based on the criminal law and abortion is an exception to the basic prohibition in the criminal law.  According to the fifth paragraph of Article 296, abortion will not be punished if carried out by a doctor in a hospital or abortion clinic with a licence in accordance with the termination of pregnancy Act.  The Act is known in common or lay terms as the abortion Act and I will use this term in the rest of my contribution.  The Act was adopted in 1981 and, as I stated, it came into force in 1984 after a long history and more than ten years of public and political debate.  Several Bills were introduced in Parliament and only the last Bill was narrowly accepted with a voting margin of 38 in favour and 37 against.  The two conflicting values that had to be accommodated in the legislation were clearly expressed by the Government of the Netherlands during parliamentary proceedings.  The Government stated:</p><blockquote>The Bill is based on the view that women, who are in a situation of emergency due to an unwanted pregnancy, should receive help.  But we consider the termination of unborn human life as such a serious act, that it is only acceptable if unavoidable because of that emergency.  This means that the physician, the woman and others that may be involved before the decision to terminate, need to act with utmost care and in awareness of their responsibility towards unborn human life and of the consequences for the woman.</blockquote><p>At the moment, 93 hospitals and 15 clinics have a licence to terminate pregnancies within the limits set by the abortion Act.  Licences are granted by the Minister of health to establishments that satisfy statutory requirements relating to the quality of treatment in terms of medical competence and facilities as well as psychological care.  The directors of these establishments must submit periodic reports to the Health Care Inspectorate about the number of patients they have treated and some characteristics of these patients.  The figures are published in the inspectorate's annual report.  It is important to stress that abortion is not seen as a routine medical procedure but as one that may only be carried out at the request of the woman if her circumstances leave her no other alternative.<br/><br/>I will say a few words about the key provisions of the abortion Act, which relate to careful decision-making, because this is the substance of the Act.  Termination may only take place if a situation of emergency of the woman makes this inevitable.  An emergency refers to the psychological state of mind of the woman due to an unwanted pregnancy and does not require the risk of physical or mental injury.  The Act does not provide substantive, general criteria for assessing whether the situation of the woman amounts to an emergency.  The legislator has adopted this approach because the decision to terminate a pregnancy must be taken with due regard for the individual circumstances of each case.<br/><br/>Both the woman and the doctor are responsible for the process of reaching a decision, although the decision as such is ultimately made by the woman.  The physician shall assist the woman requesting an abortion in making up her mind.  For that purpose, the doctor must provide the woman with appropriate information about other solutions to her situation and see to it that her request is made and maintained freely and without undue pressure from other persons.  The doctor must also see to it that the woman insists on her request only after careful consideration.  To ensure sufficient reflection, the Act requires a reflection period of five days between the initial request of the woman and the eventual termination of her pregnancy.  An exception to this requirement is only possible when the health or life of the woman is at risk.<br/><br/>I will not elaborate much on other provisions of the abortion Act.  One important point, however, is that health professionals are never obliged and cannot be obliged, for instance, by employers or other persons, to perform an abortion and conscientious objections must always be respected.  Furthermore, physicians carrying out abortions must keep medical records on the reasons in each case they decided to terminate a pregnancy.  If requested, they must give the inspectorate access to these data.  Mention should also be made of the obligation to provide adequate care after the termination has been performed.  This includes not only a medical check and psycho-social assistance, if needed, but an obligation on the establishment where the abortion takes place to provide information and education concerning the prevention of undesired pregnancies.<br/><br/>I will now say a few words on what does not fall under the abortion Act.  I refer to three different interventions.  First, so-called morning after methods, such as the use of a morning after pill, are not considered to be a way to induce an abortion and are, therefore, not covered by the Act.  The reason is that these are methods to prevent conception, which means there will be no pregnancy.  The second circumstance that does not fall within the Act is when abortion takes place as an unavoidable side-effect of a necessary medical intervention or if continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother.  Although formally such an abortion still comes under the penal code, no prosecution will take place because the doctor is considered to have acted in a situation of <i>force majeure</i>and he or she can invoke the defence of necessity in legal terms, resulting from a conflict of duties.  Criminal proceedings will not be taken in such circumstances.<br/><br/>The third intervention is slightly more complicated and relates to inducing an abortion within 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period, that is, where menstruation is 16 days overdue.  This circumstance does not fall within the provisions of the abortion Act and is, if I may say so, a bit special.  It means that although the abortion must still be performed in a hospital or an abortion clinic with a licence, formally, the provisions of the abortion Act, including the statutory waiting and reflection period, do not apply.  This interpretation of the Act dates to the beginning of the 1980s when the abortion Act was adopted and came into force.  At that time, it was not yet possible to confirm the existence of an early pregnancy beyond doubt.  Although this is no longer the case - we now have far better medical methods, on which Professor Pajkrt will elaborate, if necessary - this restrictive interpretation of the scope of the Act has survived until today.  In practice, however, the requirements of the Act relating to careful decision-making are usually observed in such cases of early pregnancy.<br/><br/>While the abortion Act does not set a time limit for abortion, the penal code does.  According to Article 82a of the code, abortion amounts to a crime against human life if the unborn child has developed to the point where it is able to survive outside the womb.  This is known as foetal viability.  On the basis of current medical opinion, this is after 24 weeks of gestation.  In practice, however, a period of 22 weeks is used, if I am correct.  After this time limit, the doctor involved can only defend himself or herself by invoking a situation of necessity or a conflict of duties.<br/><br/>If I may, I will conclude by saying a few words on the evaluation of the abortion Act which took place in 2005.  Many health laws in the Netherlands are evaluated after four or five years.</p><p>The idea is that we should have a look at whether they work in practice, whether they are complied with, whether they achieve their goals, etc.  There was no such obligation within the abortion Act itself.  Perhaps that is because it was already enacted in the 1980s.  The way it operates in practice, however, is closely followed, in particular, by pro-life groups - of course, we have them in the Netherlands - and some of the political parties which are concerned that our legislation is applied too liberally.  To address these concerns, when a new coalition was formed in 2002, it was agreed that the application of the abortion Act would be the subject of a nationwide study.</p><p> In 2005, as I said, the evaluation report was published.  Its overall conclusion is that the compliance by clinics and hospitals with the Act was satisfactory and that health professionals did what the law required of them to ensure that decisions concerning abortion were taken in a careful way.  Furthermore, the report concludes that abortion services are available and accessible where needed and that, in general, they are of good quality.</p><p> One interesting point we found relates to the interviews we held with many women who had gone through this process of requesting an abortion and having one.  I picked this out of the 250-page report to put it forward here.  According to the women who were interviewed, the reasons for requesting an abortion are quite diverse.  They range from financial and housing constraints, to age, the fact that the family is already complete, a broken or fragile relationship, lack of possibilities to raise a child, and then, of course, sometimes medical reasons in the strict sense of the word.  Most often, there is more than one reason to request abortion.  This is also confirmed in a later study conducted in 2012 by the University of Utrecht and commissioned by the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands.  The outcome was that most women who were interviewed said that their final decision was the result of a number of reasons and should be seen against the background of their present situation in life.  All of them, according to the report, experienced the decision to terminate their pregnancies as a hard one, and some of them experienced it as the most difficult decision in their lives.</p><p> Finally, last year, a new evaluation of the abortion Act was planned.  It should have taken place this year but has been postponed because the Government fell.  It was replaced last month by a new Government and the Parliament decided to allow the latter to decide on how this new evaluation of the Act should proceed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Eva Pajkrt" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112300002#C00300"><p>My name is Eva Pajkrt.  I am a professor in obstetrics, in particular, prenatal diagnosis and obstetric ultrasound, at the academic medical centre of the University of Amsterdam.  I was trained as a gynaecologist at Medical Centre Alkmaar, which is a general hospital, and afterwards in the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, which is a tertiary referral centre.  I was trained as a general gynaecologist in all aspects of the specialty.  Before and during my residency, I did my PhD on prenatal screening for chromosome anomalies and I worked later and contributed to the national introduction of prenatal screening in the Netherlands.  Following my residency, I did a two-year clinical fellowship in foetal medicine at University College London Hospital.  Once I came back to the Netherlands in 2005, I started working again at the Academic Medical Centre as a consultant in foetal and maternal medicine.  I have been head of the foetal medicine unit since 2010 and was appointed professor in 2016.</p> <p>  I am involved in numerous committees of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  Since the introduction of the prenatal screening programme, I have been a member on several working parties concerned with the quality of care of the programme and I have been advising the Ministry of Health on several abortion issues.</p> <p>  My presence here has been requested to answer the committee's question about Dutch abortion care.  The abortion care is imbedded within the ethical framework of patient autonomy and is completely woman centred.  The objective of Dutch abortion care is to have a thorough and comprehensive process without creating any obstacles.</p> <p>  I will briefly take the committee through the statement it has already received.  I will not go through it extensively but I understand some of the people are following this online only and they do not have the statement.  I will skip certain parts and if the committee cannot follow me, that is why.</p> <p>  Since 2016, there has been a national co-operation agreement between the Dutch Association of Abortion Specialists, the Dutch psycho-social counselling service for questions of unintended pregnancy, adoption and abortion, the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives.  The Dutch College of General Practitioners, which is not listed, is also involved in this agreement.  Women with an unplanned or undesirable pregnancies and doubts about continuation of their pregnancies will generally go to their general practitioners - this is about which professionals are involved.</p> <p>  In 56% of cases, the general practitioner will be the first contact.  He or she may counsel the woman about her options and may refer her to an abortion clinic, a gynaecologist or for further psychological counselling.  General practitioners have their own national guidelines.  There is an English version which is available.  In 25% of cases, women go directly to the abortion clinic and it is the first contact.  The abortion clinic doctor may counsel the woman about her options.  They may perform the procedure or they may refer the woman for further counselling.  The other 25% either go to a midwife, a gynaecologist or some other professional.  If the pregnant woman goes to the midwife, the midwife never will be the referring physician.  The midwife is not legally a doctor and should refer the woman, and then the GP or gynaecologist has to refer the woman.  The first contact may be a gynaecologist or other doctors.  For example, the doctors of women with a cardiac problem in which it is unsafe to have a ongoing pregnancy may also refer them.</p> <p>  There are general considerations in cases of unplanned and undesirable pregnancy.  One of the first questions one asks is whether there was a pregnancy test performed and whether there should be a repeat test.  Then one should always ask if the pregnancy was planned or unplanned.  That seems contradictory but it is, of course, not always so.  A planned pregnancy may become undesirable and an unplanned pregnancy may become desirable.  Ask about the circumstances leading to the pregnancy and whether or not the woman was on contraceptives.  Mention there is always a choice and a dilemma in case of unplanned pregnancy.  Ask about a dating with a scan.  If there has not been one, please have one performed, preferably transvaginally.  If the woman is determined to have an abortion, she should mention that on her request to the person performing the scan.  Is the partner present at the consultation?  If so, explore whether the woman was not forced by the partner or the person sitting beside her and that it is a voluntary request.  Explore whether there has been any sexual abuse.  Be aware of cultural and religious factors.  Ask whether there would be a risk of genital tract infections, but in case of abortions on request as opposed to abortions due to prenatal diagnosis, we always test for sexually transmitted diseases in the Netherlands.  We always discuss contraceptives - what kind of contraceptives the woman will use after she has had the abortion.  Is the request consistent or does the woman seem to be in a state of panic and, as a result, would she potentially benefit from more time to make a decision?  If so, refer woman for further counselling.  When referring a woman for an abortion, always document the first date of the abortion request.  Of course, there are several websites and I have included the address of one.  Women can go online.  There is a help choice and they can go through it.</p> <p>  There are also some questions one should always ask, including, "Are you certain about your decision?"  It seems obvious but one has to ask.  The others are: "How did you reach this decision?"; "Is this your own choice?"; "Have you considered other options?"; "Would you like me to explain the options?"; and "Do you need help to make a proper decision?"</p><p>If the partner is present, the partner also should be asked.  In case of ambivalence, it is important that the woman understands that she is responsible for her own choice.  Ultimately, she has to make the decision.  Nobody is going to make that decision for her.  The woman should not be forced into making a decision; rather she should be helped to make a choice.  It is important not to blame the woman for being ambivalent and that the emergency situation of the woman is considered.  If the woman remains ambivalent, she should be referred for further counselling.  In the Netherlands women are also referred to FIOM, which is the Dutch agency that helps women who give consideration to or opt to have their child adopted.<br/><br/><i></i>Time is important in any case of unplanned pregnancy in view of the method of abortion.  Once a woman is referred, a quick appointment is mandatory, preferably within a week or, at least, within ten days.  From the moment the woman indicates she is considering an abortion and the actual treatment, a reflection time of at least five completed days is mandatory in the Netherlands.  This reflection time is not mandatory until a gestational age of six weeks plus two days, which is the 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period.  However, 65% of these women do have a reflection period of more than five days.<br/><br/>There are several ways to terminate a pregnancy.  A woman can have a surgical termination, a medical termination or a combined termination, which involves the use of medication followed by a surgical procedure.  Women may choose where to have an abortion and what type of abortion they would like, although their choice is, of course, dependent on gestational age.  Women over 16 years of age do not need parental consent.  Women between 12 and 16 years do require parental consent but we may withhold it if we believe it is a reasonable argument. <br/><br/>Approximately 90% of abortions in the Netherlands are carried out in abortion clinics.  The Dutch Health Care Inspectorate produces an annual report with statistical information on terminations performed in the Netherlands in the preceding year.  The last report was in 2015.  As the data in the report are aggregated data, it is not possible to correlate between the different components of the abortion registration.  In 2015, approximately 30,000 abortions were carried out in the Netherlands, almost 4,000, 13%, of which were on behalf of women from a foreign country.  Of these 30,000 abortions, 8,500, 28%, were carried out before 44 days and as such these terminations are not considered under the abortion Act.  Approximately 16,000, 50%, were performed before seven weeks gestation, while almost 9,000, 29%, were performed between seven and 12 weeks gestation.  Thus, 80%, of all the abortions were performed in the first trimester, before 13 weeks. <br/><br/>The majority of women undergoing an abortion were between 25 and 30 years of age.  Only 83 pregnancies were terminated in women under 15 years.  In 2015, the total number of pregnancy terminations in teenagers was 3,079.  This number has been decreasing slowly over the last couple of years.  This is reflected in the percentage of teenage pregnancies that go to term.  This is very low in comparison with other European countries. <br/><br/><i></i>Since 2007, all pregnant women in the Netherlands may undergo pre-natal screening.  They are offered a combined test for screening for Down's syndrome, Edward's syndrome and Patau syndrome.  As of 2017, non-invasive pre-natal testing, NIPT, has been added as a first trier test to screen for the above mentioned trisomies.  Moreover, every women is offered a 20 week scan.  Since 2011, it is possible to address whether an abortion is the result of pre-natal diagnosis.  In 2015, a little over 1,000 of all abortions were performed after pre-natal diagnosis, the majority of which were carried out in a hospital.  We know from the aggregated data that more than 30% of the abortions in hospitals are due to pre-natal diagnosis, compared with only 0.5% in abortion clinics.  However, we do not have any knowledge on diagnosis nor is it possible to correlate the date with gestational age.  It is likely that abortion due to pre-natal diagnosis will be carried out in the second trimester due to the time it takes to get a definite diagnosis.  Thus, we can assume that around 20% of the second trimester abortions is due to pre-natal diagnosis.<br/><br/>Of all women undergoing abortion, 75% leave the clinic or hospital with a prescription for contraceptives.  Since 2012, it is mandatory to provide sexual education to all schoolgoing children.  This starts in elementary school.  Up to 2011, contraceptives were reimbursed for every woman.  Since 2011, only women up to 21 years are reimbursed.  In the Netherlands, abortion is free for everyone who is legal and has a social security number.  It is subsidised care.  The costs are not reimbursed by the insurance companies but are subsidised by the ministry of health.  For foreigners or people living illegally in the Netherlands, the cost varies, between &euro;380 and &euro;940.  Particular centres, such as the Academic Medical Center, are subsidised separately by the ministry of health to take care of these women.  For women who are in a really difficult position and cannot afford an abortion our hospital will provide an abortion, for which the hospital receives a subsidy, although I am not sure about how reimbursement in this regard is regulated.  </p></speech>

We introduced our programme in 2007.  There are two elements to the programme.  Women are first asked if they want to receive information about prenatal screening.  If the answer is affirmative, we offer the information but women have a right not to know.  It is a strong belief that if women do not want all of the information, we should not give it to them.  If the woman says that she would like to have the information, she is counselled about the fact that there is a possibility of being screened for chromosomal anomalies.  That used to be done via the combined test.  We still have the combined test but since April 2017, we now offer the non-invasive prenatal test, known as the NIPT, a blood test which determines if it is likely that the baby has trisomy 21, 18 and 13.  The NIPT is more sensitive than the combined test in detecting foetal trisomies.  However, it lacks the ability to see other problems in the foetus at an early stage.  Every woman is counselled about the 20 week scan and is offered such a scan, which we actually try to perform at around 19 weeks.  We do this because we feel that if there is an anomaly, one needs time to do further investigations.  Such investigations take time and it is better if one has a little bit more time so that women do not have to rush into making decisions.</p> <p>  The uptake of screening in the Netherlands for the combined test has always been around 40%.  However, it is very regionally dependent.  In Amsterdam, where we work, it is quite high but in more rural areas, the uptake is lower.  It is also quite low in the north of Holland.  It depends a little on where one lives.  We thought that once we introduced NIPT in the Netherlands that women would just rush to have it but that has not happened.  The uptake has stayed more or less the same.  It may be a little bit higher but it is not something that everyone is rushing into.  One of the arguments put forward to explain this is that the combined test and the NIPT are not free in the Netherlands.  One must pay &euro;169 for the entire combined test or &euro;175 for NIPT.  The rest of the cost of NIPT, which is more expensive than that, is paid for by the Ministry of Health.  It is a study so it is under a study protocol and the licence runs to 1 April 2020.  It will be evaluated then to determine how well it is working.  Women have to pay for that.  However, the 20 week scan is free.  If one has health care in the Netherlands and one receives a treatment, one must pay the first &euro;385 but there are certain treatments not included in that.  The 20 week scan is one such treatment.  If that is the only treatment one receives in a year, the health insurance companies will pay for it.  The uptake of the 20 week scan is quite difficult to determine.  We have everyone in a database who has the scan but it is more difficult to figure out who is not in the database.  We estimate, however, that the uptake is around 95%.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses explain the system and how it operates in the context of the outcomes and the way women are looked after under that regime?  Also, will the witnesses identify any issues with the current law under the Dutch model?  Does it limit practice or how could it be improved?  What can we take from that?  I thank them for their presentation and I thank Dr. Pajkrt for explaining the work she does.  It is important that we place this in the context of her role and competence in terms of foetal medicine.  Perhaps our country should consider making that more visible and explain it in simpler terms to people so they can understand the competence and professionalism of people such as Professor Pajkrt.</p></speech>

He asked how the regulatory system operates and, if I understood him correctly, what position it places physicians in, if they can go along with it and what problems they may encounter with the current system.  At first sight, it might seem that our law could deter doctors because abortion is still a crime and perhaps one could expect that they would be afraid of performing an abortion.  However, the abortion law has been in place for more than 30 years and is broadly accepted.  It has been an accepted practice.  The provision in the criminal code is not a deterrent as long as one remains within the well defined limits of the abortion Act.  The further question was whether it is easy for doctors to operate and proceed within those limits.  Basically it is, because there is so much emphasis on the procedure of coming to a good decision.  We do not have a system with substantive criteria, for instance, whether in this case there is a medical problem, how serious it is and whether the life of the mother is in danger.  No, the system is open to a large extent but there must be a counselling process aimed at careful decision-making.  That allows doctors to take on board different reasons and motives for abortion and different individual situations.  That does not make the decision less serious and far-reaching, but basically it is an open system that does not confine doctors to certain pre-defined situations.</p></speech>

There has been a narrative in this country that while 3,000 to 3,500 Irish women go to Britain for abortions, we are often reminded that there are more going to the Netherlands and so forth.  I had not realised the number is so small and does not, to any significant degree, impact on Irish abortion rates abroad.</p> <p>  I will start by asking about the Dutch abortion figures.  The Netherlands is presented as a country that has very low abortion rates.  However, from what I can see, it is more accurate to say that Britain, France and other such countries are in the highest tier and that the abortion rates in the Netherlands more resemble those of Italy and Portugal, in that it is in a second tier of abortion rates.  The figures presented to the Citizens' Assembly, using the UN approach, put the Dutch rate at 9.7 per 1,000, which would be more than twice the Irish rate of 4.5 per 1,000.</p><p>However, the British Office for National Statistics calculates abortions as a percentage of total pregnancies.  Do the witnesses ever use that approach to avoid things that may change from country to country, such as fertility rates?  If one looks at the rate of abortions out of total pregnancies, taking out the 4,000 German and French abortions, it was at 27,000 in 2015 out of the total of 170,000 pregnancies, so the Netherlands seems to have a rate of 13% or 14% whereas in Ireland, we have one in 20, a rate of 5%.  Before we examine the Dutch figures, is the third category which is not included in them, the early abortions, included in the figures the witnesses are giving us?</p></speech>

We have two categories for late pregnancy termination.  The first category is for lethal cases where the infant, once born, will never survive.  The second category is where we feel that if the baby is born, no medical treatment would be warranted because it would be felt that it would be inhumane, unnecessary or however one frames it.  We had 18 cases of the first category in 2004, it has dropped to three in 2015 and the 2016 report, while it is not here, notes two cases.  The rate has dramatically decreased with the introduction of prenatal screening, mainly because many of the diagnoses were of trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 and are now picked up by prenatal screening.  The number in the second category has also dropped, but it is more likely to be one or two per year.</p></speech>

We have a tradition here in Ireland where children with Down's syndrome are perhaps more cherished than in many other countries.  We are very proud of our international Special Olympics.  Many people testify to the joy that Down's syndrome children bring into their lives and how the children change their lives in a positive way.  There has been much concern and debate about the fact that, in Britain, over 90% of children diagnosed with Down's syndrome in pregnancy are aborted.  Iceland has reached 100%.  The great and the good in Denmark plan to be Down's syndrome free by 2030 - that is the quasi-official position.  Has Professor Pajkrt figures for what percentage of children diagnosed with Down's syndrome <i>in utero</i>are aborted in the Netherlands?</p></speech>

It is a national screening programme and I am sorry about it but it is still not working properly, so we do not have all the outcomes.  As I said before, the uptake of prenatal screening in the Netherlands has been approximately 35%.  That is for screening in the first trimester for foetal trisomies.  We have done a study and, if the Senator wants, I can send him the paper, by Bakker et al., which I was involved in.  We asked women their reasons.  One reason was that many women in the Netherlands felt that Down's syndrome was not something we should screen for.  I think that reflects our way of counselling women and giving them their own choice.  Our health care is based on patient autonomy and what women want.  We do not force anything on them.  If a foetus is diagnosed with Down's syndrome, generally among women who want screening, the termination rate would be approximately 90%.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Pajkrt.  She refers, going through the guidelines of the general considerations, to asking if the pregnancy has been correctly dated with a scan and that, in case of doubt, a scan should be performed.  The guidelines state that when referring for a scan, it should be mentioned whether it is an undesirable pregnancy.  Many people in this country, not just people of faith, contrary to what Professor Pajkrt has heard, have a human rights vision that includes born and unborn and would regard the language of "undesirable pregnancy" as shockingly euphemistic with fairly chilling historic parallels.  That is my view.  I will not be the first to have said that to Professor Pajkrt.  Why, when referring for a scan, is it relevant to mention whether it is an undesirable pregnancy?</p></speech>

I say women since I am a gynaecologist and do not generally deal with men.  If one knows that a woman has become pregnant and is considering a termination, it is good medical practice to ask the woman whether or not she wants to see the scan.  If one knows as a general practitioner, GP, that the woman is maybe considering an abortion, it is good medical practice to inform the professional one is referring to with as many details as medically necessary about that woman.</p></speech>

I have been doing this work for a very long time and I have never come across a woman who makes the request lightly.  These women have many difficulties.  There are not cases of women saying they are going on a vacation and that the pregnancy does not suit them.  I seriously object to the statement that abortion on request is just something that people do, because there is always a bigger argument.  They have problems, whether financial, housing or whatever else.  The decision to have an abortion is not a light one.</p></speech>

Most people who speak about this issue, whether they see two lives to protect or just one, will acknowledge that this is a crisis.  The last speaker in before Professor Pajkrt, yesterday evening, was a person who opposes abortion and has a child with severe disability.  She spoke empathically about how every case is different and there are so many crises.  In the end, is it not the case that Professor Pajkrt only sees one life to be protected?  As long as the abortion is wanted, she really does not see herself as having any duty of care to the unborn child.</p></speech>

I found them absolutely full of facts and with a broad and detailed setting of the health framework relating to terminations in the Netherlands.</p> <p>  Before I ask my questions I wish to correct one aspect.  The previous speaker, Senator Mullen, has given the impression that we know the numbers of terminations from Ireland.  In fact we do not.  The reason we do not is because while we have a figure for the number of women who register in Britain - which is around 3,500 - that figure does not include the number of women who take abortion pills.  Estimates vary on this number but it seems to be some 1,500 women.  The total figure also gives no account of the women who do not give their true address.  A number of women do this and they have a good reason to do this; if they give a UK address they may be able to access treatments without having to pay.  To be frank, we do not know the abortion figures for Ireland.  We do know that thousands of women travel each year.  I just wanted to correct that point.</p> <p>  The first thing that struck me is that there is a very ethical framework in place in the Netherlands.  Will the witnesses explain to the committee how abortion health care is viewed by the Dutch population as a whole?  How are women considered in all of this?</p></speech>

When the abortion Act was enacted in the 1980s it was a very narrow, tight vote.  We were very happy that we achieved something in this field and that there was at least a minimum of consensus.  I think it is fair to say that nowadays a large part of the population, a majority, are satisfied with the system we have.  At the same time, it remains an issue of political debate and this is illustrated by the fact that the annual report of the health inspectorate, as we have previously mentioned, is debated in parliament every year.  The same questions always come up about how the system is operating, whether it is in accordance with the intention of the legislation and so on.  I have already spoken of the plans to have a second evaluation and a debate around what the main focus should be etc.  There is continual debate and concern about how it works and how it should work.

There is an argument from a strange minority that abortion is somehow overwhelmingly bad for women's health and has long-lasting consequences, such as on mental health for example.</p></speech>

There are different methods.  There are the pills and the surgical methods.  It has been found that in the surgical procedure we have to dilate the cervix a little bit.  Now, more and more, they prep the cervix first with medication and then they perform the surgical procedure.  All of these procedures are relatively safe.  Of course, if the woman has progressed a little bit later in gestation, there are complications.  This issue is addressed in the annual report.  This complication mainly has to do with the fact that if the gestation is further along, say at 20 weeks, there is a 20% chance that the placenta will be retained.  The woman would have to go to the emergency room to have the placenta removed.  It is not very clear to hospitals how to register that.  It registers as a complication when in fact it is just the procedure and how it is.  I believe that abortion is a relatively safe procedure.  To my knowledge I do not believe we have had any maternal deaths from the procedure.</p></speech>

We are familiar with the situation of women who are forced to go to Britain, and while the numbers of women who travel from Ireland to the Netherlands is smaller, do the witnesses have any data on them?</p></speech>

The problem is that it is all aggregated data.  I am trying to convince them to compile the numbers differently so we could actually correlate.  For instance, if an abortion was because of a prenatal diagnosis, we would like to know more around the abortion so that we would know a little bit more about what is going on.  The only thing we can do at the moment is make assumptions.  If there were around 35 women from Ireland out of some 30,000, I do not know where they are in those figures.</p></speech>

My last question is on a subject about which many people, I am sure, have thought.  We are struck by the low rate of abortion in the Netherlands.  The witnesses have related to us the very extensive programme of education and contraception.  Could Professor Pajkrt expand on this? Clearly, whatever is being done in the Netherlands is very successful and there are lessons for us in Ireland.</p><p>.  </p><p><b>Professor Eva Pajkrt:</b>To be honest I believe that maybe we could do even better if I could reflect on our own system and consider improvements.  I believe that prevention is better than having to treat an issue and I do not believe that anyone disagrees with this.  In that regard, contraceptives should be reimbursed or be free for everybody whether a person is 40 or 18.  Health and sexual education is very important because if we do not do it children will go online anyway.  Everybody has a smart phone now and sometimes what we see on social media is not how we want our kids to be educated about sex.  It is very good that we have a system in the Netherlands where sex education is mandatory - it is not discretionary.  In elementary school there is a programme.  We need to show it to people and we need to see what we are teaching kids.  Parents are involved.  I was asked by the school to give a sexual education course.  My kids told me that if I did it they would never go back to school again, so I did not dare to go in.  I did, however, volunteer to tell them a little bit.  You just explain it to them, and it helps.</p></speech>

Their presentations were frank and informative.  I especially welcome the statement from Professor Pajkrt that in the Netherlands the whole question of abortion is women-centred.  This is the way it should be.  It is the mindset that is starting to gain momentum in Ireland, although rather belatedly.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  One has to do with the legislative situation in the Netherlands, and Senator Mullen may have referred to it earlier.</p><p>There is a lot of very strong, even harsh language in the 1981 Act, which I understand has survived any reviews that have taken place, referring to abortion as being a crime punishable only as a last resort.  At the same time, there is quite clearly a very liberal abortion regime in the Netherlands.  I am trying to put those two things together.  Does this language reflect some sort of social divide on the question?  Has the 1981 Act ever been endorsed by the people of the Netherlands by way of a referendum?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1410" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sjef Gevers" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112300002#K00200"><p>There has not been a referendum on the abortion Act.  I think if there was one, as I have tried to say before, it would be widely endorsed.  The Senator says the language is harsh.  To some extent it is.  I think in several countries, maybe most countries of Europe, the criminal code is still the basis when we talk about abortion.  Abortion is only allowed within specific circumstances spelled out in national laws.  In the Netherlands, we have this concept of emergency, which was already mentioned.  An important issue in the parliamentary debates in the 1980s was how this concept should be applied.  The final agreement was that the law should not go into further detail when one could say that an emergency existed.  This was done deliberately to take account of the fact that the situations in which a woman might be in a situation of despair because of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy might be so diverse.  The Legislature refrained from going into substantive criteria because of this.  That explains why so many different situations can be taken into account, provided that the decision is made in due care and after good reflection and so on.  The procedural aspect of the law is more important than substantive reasons.  They are not to be found in the law except for the very general concept of emergency.</p></speech>

I suppose it is a matter for philosophy rather than anything else.  On the legislation, I think I am correct in saying that an abortion will not be allowed to a young person between the ages of 12 and 16 without parental consent.  However, should a reasonable argument be put forward by the woman in question, abortion would be allowed.  I am somewhat surprised that a 12 year old, pre-teen girl would be allowed to argue that kind of a case.  Does it happen often in practice and is Professor Gevers comfortable with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1412" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Sjef Gevers" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112300002#K00400"><p>Let me say something about the legal situation.  Professor Pajkrt may follow up and talk about practice.  In our law on patient rights, which is a more general law, we have a majority age for health care decisions of 16 years.  When one is 16, one is entitled to decide for one's self without parental consent.  Between 12 and 16, we have a dual system.  For an intervention, we must have the consent of the minor and his or her parents.</p> <p>  In the context of abortion, that law might say that abortion can only take place if the parents of the pregnant person are also in agreement with it.  However, we have an exception, not only for abortion but also for other medical procedures, in cases where a minor continues to insist that he or she wants to have it.  For instance, a couple of months ago we had a very controversial case about a young cancer patient who refused further treatment.  This exception came into the debate also.  The judge of the court that had to decide on the case agreed that in such a case, if a minor between 12 and 16 insists on having or not having a certain procedure, the voice of the minor prevails.  That applies also to abortion cases.</p> <p>  The problem, of course, is that even if parents do not have to consent, they usually will have to be informed.  I guess in practice the person who is requested to perform an abortion will have a discussion with the minor about why she does not want her parents to be informed and will suggest it might be better if they were informed.  If there is a strong argument not to inform them, and if this is strongly in the interests of the minor, the law makes it possible that the procedure remains confidential and the parents are not involved.  This will only take place after long discussion and careful decision.</p></speech>

I think it is set up that way as a protection for the minor.  It is not so much about the parents not consenting.  It is more a question of whether the minor wants her parents to know.  If we feel there is a situation that would basically endanger the life of the minor, we might consider doing an abortion without informing the parents.  It is all very speculative and we do not have any figures.</p></speech>

Obviously the Irish cohort is so small there have not been any studies of it.  There was a dip in 2013 and a very small number of Irish women travelling to the Netherlands in that year.  Do the witnesses have any idea why that happened?  Also, is there any after-care regime in place for foreign women generally or Irish women in particular who have abortions in the Netherlands?</p></speech>

There is one for Dutch women because they are referred back to the person who referred them to the abortion clinic in the first place.  I know that of the women who go to an abortion clinic, 25% will address the abortion clinic directly.  They will be referred back to their GP, who has to know that they have had an abortion.  Sometimes they are referred back to the GP to discuss contraceptives.  There is that kind of after-care but I am not sure about what is provided for foreign women.  Generally, the women just go back to the country they are from and do not attend our services any more.</p></speech>

One of the main concerns many people have regarding abortion is that we would end up like England and Wales, where 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome are being aborted.  The witness's paper talks about how prenatal screening is being offered to women from 2017 in order that there is a better chance of detecting Down's syndrome in the womb.  We know from countries like the UK that increases in screening usually mean that more babies with Down's syndrome are aborted.  A recent article on the <i>Huffington Post </i>news website discussed how more and more  babies with Down's syndrome are being aborted.  It mentioned Denmark, where 98% of babies with the condition are aborted, and Iceland, where that figure rises to 100%.  The same article describes how the Dutch Minister for health at the time was asked if she planned to take any steps in the Netherlands to ensure that the same situation does not happen there.  Her response was that if freedom of choice results in a situation that nearly no children with Down's syndrome are being born, society should accept that.  Do the witnesses agree with this statement?  Do they think that the idea of a choice is more important than the life of a baby with Down's syndrome?</p></speech>

She said there should be protection.  I also believe there should be protection for the unborn baby.  My concern is that when there is screening, such as in the UK, there are more and more incidences of abortion.  In Ireland approximately 120 babies are born with Down's syndrome annually.  They are loveable children.  I have spoken to parent after parent, and not one would give that child up.</p></speech>

It has not decreased at all with the introduction of screening.  Many people were scared that the number of Down's syndrome babies was going to fall but that has not been the case.  One reason is that although there has been an increase in uptake in prenatal screening, mothers have become older and older women may make different choices than younger women.  We do not know.  Younger women do not screen because they think that they are young and it will not happen to them.  We have about 250 born with Down's syndrome annually, and the rate is a flat line.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is the choice of the parents.  It is the choice of the mother and of the father.  We are speaking as though it is only the women who want these things, but fathers also have clear ideas about how they will live their lives and what fits into their lives.</p> <p>  When one says they believe in patient autonomy and they should be the ones who have the choice, it is not that I wish everyone should have an abortion.  We believe that people should be informed, know what their options are and should be counselled.  If someone has a child with a disability, whether it is Down's syndrome or otherwise, there should be provisions for them, and we should live in a society where there is enough medical care for disabled children, and not a situation such as the United States where having a child with a disability is a huge burden and can ruin someone financially.  A country has to look at itself and ask what kind of country it wishes to be.  I think the Netherlands is a country where we care for everybody but the parents have the choice, and it is not a case where because they have been unlucky to have a baby with one type of disability or another, they must deal with it because others feel that they should have to be the ones to deal with it.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that we do not seem to be interested in ways to save babies' lives while at the same time providing better supports to women.  Professor Pajkrt's paper referred to how women seeking abortions should be asked if they are aware of other options and have considered them.  She has spoken here of how abortion law has developed in the Netherlands since it was first introduced.  Will she now balance her contribution by explaining how the law has developed to provide and improve on alternatives to abortion such as adoption?</p></speech>

There seems to be a contradiction in what Professor Gevers is saying.  On the one hand, the law in the Netherlands states that abortion is a serious matter and is not seen as a routine medical procedure.  As such, there is something different about it.  On the other hand, the baby's life is still ended by abortion.  Does Professor Gevers think that an unborn baby has value?  Science shows that the baby is separate to the mother.  Should the baby, therefore, get separate protection?  Professor Gevers is probably aware that last Friday was World Prematurity Day, which is celebrated in Ireland and the Netherlands.  Does Professor Gevers agree that there is a real contradiction in that we are living in a world that ends a baby's life through abortion while, at the same time, we try to save other babies that are born prematurely?</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's question to be whether there is a contradiction in it.  He referred to what I was saying about it not being a routine medical procedure.  I think there is no contradiction because it is not considered, in law or in practice, as a normal medical procedure, as a routine, which is only a question of medical expertise, technique and norms.  In my discipline of health law, we say that not everything doctors do can be regulated only by their own norms.  Some things must be considered by society.  Abortion is an example in this regard because there is more at stake than only medical intervention to solve a medical problem.  In that sense, it is not routine or normal.  That is why we have kept and will keep the basic prohibition on abortion in our criminal law and it is why we have a time limit in our penal code to say that after 24 weeks of gestation, only in very exceptional circumstances, the numbers on which were set out half an hour or so ago, can abortion take place.  As such, there is protection of unborn life and respect for unborn life, but the choice of the woman remains in the centre.  Perhaps, our system will have more protection of unborn life than others which do not respect the choice of the women concerned.</p></speech>

In our law, there is increasing protection of unborn life as it grows in the womb of the mother, but it is only considered a person after birth.  Then, it has the full rights a person has.  Before that, there is some degree of protection, but not the same as after birth.</p></speech>

When I was reading it, it was very refreshing to see just how woman-centred the legislation is.  Yesterday, we had a presentation where a witness said our bodies are not only ours and asked, given that our hormones are all over the place during pregnancy, how we could make a decision.  It was, therefore, nice and refreshing to have this follow today to cancel out yesterday's nonsense.  While I can see how woman-centred the legislation is, I wonder if the five-day waiting period creates a conflict in the circumstances of some women.  If a woman from a certain socioeconomic background or who has experienced domestic violence has only one opportunity to get to the clinic at all, what happens?  Does the five-day waiting period have a negative impact on some women?  I can ask all three questions together.</p></speech>

In cases where the 44-day option is availed of, 65% of women reflect for more than five days.  Some 35% of women in such cases make an earlier decision because they want to have this simple procedure without waiting until the pregnancy is further advanced.  In cases where women are further on in their pregnancies, 3% have abortions.  There is an escape.  I will explain how this is done.  If one says that one has reflected for two or three days, one will be asked about one's reasons on the form one has to fill in, but those reasons are not included in the report.  I have no idea of the reasons in such cases.  I do not know what they are.  My assumption is that physicians will always listen to women.  If they see an emergency, they will help the woman.</p></speech>

My next question follows on from that.  An anomaly exists in the legislation in the cases of earlier abortions within the 44-day waiting period.  There are two cohorts of women involved.  Some women are required to have a waiting period and mandatory counselling, but other women are not.  I wonder whether any research has been done to gain an understanding of how this process is experienced by both cohorts of women.</p></speech>

We know, from the literature and personal experience, that abortion is always a very difficult decision.  If a woman has her arguments very straight before the event, it is easier for her to cope with it afterwards.  In that respect, the reflection time gives each woman an opportunity to get her act together and think about all the pros and cons.  This is especially true for a woman who is confronted with structural or chromosomal anomalies.  If she is considering termination, her first reaction is always "My baby has this and I want a termination now".  I always advise such a woman not to do it while she is going through loop after loop on a rollercoaster.  When the rollercoaster finally stops at the end of the day, if she has had a termination and has returned home, she will think about what has happened and it will really hit her.  The grieving process has to start before a woman rushes into an abortion.  I do not have data or psychological studies on that, but I have been counselling women for many years and not once has a woman come back to me to say it was inhuman of me to make her wait.  Women tend to tell me it was nice for them and their partners to have a great weekend together to do something nice, to think about it, to discuss it, to talk to their families and to make the decision.  Although they are very sad about their circumstances, they tend to think they have made the only right choice.</p></speech>

The 2005 evaluation of the abortion Act that I mentioned earlier specified that an anomaly exists in this regard.  It recommended that the law should be adapted to bring the 44-day period within the scope of the law now that we can be certain about whether there is a pregnancy.  The Dutch Government agreed with that recommendation, but it did not take many measures to implement it.  It was scared to make any change because it was worried about compromising the delicate law in this area.  In 2016, the health minister submitted a Bill to the Dutch Parliament that would allow GPs to offer abortion pills to women who request them.  We referred to this in our position paper.  There has been a lot of debate about the Bill.  It will not go further because the new Government does not like it.  The proposed Bill would legalise the current 44-day arrangement, so to speak, by bringing it under the scope of the abortion Act.  Maybe it will be advanced at some point in the future.</p></speech>

In their presentation, the witnesses mentioned mandatory sex education, which is something I support in theory.  In Ireland, the Catholic church unfortunately still has a monopoly over schools and, therefore, sex education.  I have to remove my ten year old daughter from participating in the lessons given by some organisations that come to her school.  Could the witnesses give us a small bit of insight into who provides mandatory sex education in Dutch schools?  What is the curriculum based on?</p></speech>

I refer to Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Islamic schools.  I have no idea whether they all do it the way they actually should.  I know this is one of the items to be ticked off when schools are visited by inspectors.  Schools are asked to state whether they have sexual programmes.</p></speech>

I would like to follow up on Senator Ruane's questions about better sex education and the importance of contraception awareness.  Do the witnesses believe that there have been reductions in the numbers of teenage pregnancies and teenage abortions in the Netherlands?  I note that the majority of those who seek abortions are older women.  Can the witnesses confirm that the numbers of teenage pregnancies and teenage abortions have decreased as a direct result of the improvements in sex education?  Do they believe such a correlation exists?</p></speech>

In recent years, talking about sex in the media has become a natural and normal thing.  On television, for example, a prominent sexologist has been constantly repeating that it is important for people to have sex education, not just to prevent abortion and unplanned pregnancy but also so that adults can experience a good, nice and healthy sexual life.  It is important in one's life to be happy and to have all these facilities.  One needs to know a little bit about it if one wants to appreciate it.  Once he was there, more and more sexologists started to come forward and advocate in a similar manner.</p><p>It is a very natural thing to discuss, whether in a classroom or at home, with family or friends.  It is not a taboo.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Pajkrt for her very comprehensive presentation today.  While I know the professor does not have data on the five-day waiting period, if an Irish woman travels to the Netherlands for an abortion, how would the five-day waiting period work for her if she had only one or two days?</p></speech>

If she is here and calls the clinic or sends an email to say she would really like to have an abortion, she will make up the five-day waiting period by the time she arrives in the Netherlands.  It is not the case that she has to be physically present to say she wants to have an abortion.  It starts on the day she requests an abortion.  The clinics know this and they say fine and they will book her in.  If the woman shows up on the day, she has apparently been thinking about it, and she is consistent in her request, the clinic will proceed with the abortion.</p></speech>

Following Deputy Naughton's question, I was interested in how the Netherlands demystified human reproduction and conversations around sex.  Have they any suggestions on how we might try to do that in this country?  I am not sure how familiar they are with our legacy of incarcerating females in this country and the trade in illegitimate children to homes in Ireland and abroad.  We have a damning history when it comes to women's rights.  I agree with Senator Ruane that it probably stems from the hold of the Catholic Church on our State and our ovaries and all things related to sex.  Have the witnesses any advice for us?  I think that if I went to the Minister for Health and said I wanted a team of sexologists, he would say he would not know how to deal with that.  The witnesses might be able to help us in that regard.</p> <p>  It seems to be very difficult for some people here to separate the moral from the medical, as the witnesses have surely seen from the questions put to them.  We constantly hear conversations about the rights of the unborn child and that somehow, by removing the eighth amendment, women will take a turn at 36 weeks and say they do not even want a child, that they have changed their minds.  Where did the moral pressure come from when the witnesses were doing this back in the day?  Have they any advice for us on that?</p></speech>

It always starts the way Ireland is starting.  There are always a couple of people who think they have a strong case, that they should fight for it and stand up to do something about it.  We had an abortion clinic and while the academic medical centre did not exist, it resulted from that movement.  There were very strong advocates for abortion.  They had been performing abortion before it was legalised.  This is Holland.  We go along with the flow until the issue becomes so big that everybody is talking about it and everybody is ready, then we get a law.  It starts with a couple of people who will go against what maybe they should be doing but who feel strongly that they should change things.  That is basically what Ireland is doing now.  There is such a strong feeling that things should change.  Ireland cannot come from where it is now to our system.  It will never work that way.  It will be a very slow and long process and the fighters will be needed.  They may be the politicians but they will also be medical people, maybe volunteers, or women who had an abortion, maybe women who never had an abortion but really feel strongly about it, or maybe men who think that way.  It will go.  I do not know how else to tell the Irish what to do.  I do not have the solution to hand.</p></speech>

I do not know why.  It distinguishes the gestational age at which there can be termination and when there is foetal viability, which is 24 weeks.  Abortion clinics, however, will terminate up to 22 weeks.  That stems from the days when we did not have any very accurate dating.  We now have far more accurate dating scans, they are scanned with the variation, but if they went beyond 22 weeks they might be terminating a foetus that was further progressed.  In the Netherlands the majority of the terminations are performed in abortion clinics, but at 23 weeks they are performed in hospitals.  There were only 127 cases last year and we assume they were because of foetal anomalies.</p></speech>

What happens if it is a broadly accepted practice and somehow a very conservative government comes to power?  How would that affect the practice if doctors behave in a way that is broadly accepted but is against the law?  Professor Gevers probably has not thought about that and I probably should not worry about Holland.</p></speech>

It is more difficult to change the constitution of course but we do not have anything in the Dutch constitution about abortion.  The law can be changed.  Theoretically, I agree the law could be much more restrictive than it is now.  It is unlikely that will happen because we have had many different coalition governments in the past 35 years and, for instance, the Christian Democratic Party led for part of that time and forms part of the present coalition.  Those parties have always respected the balance or the compromise that has been achieved in the abortion Act.  I do not expect this will change.  The majority of the Dutch public would be opposed to that.</p></speech>

I would like to attend any such meeting, as I expect all members would.</p><p>With regard to the five-day waiting period, is it the case that a woman is not required to visit a doctor beforehand and may express a wish to have an abortion by email and visit the doctor five days later?</p><p>With regard to issues of geography and the availability of services, an ever increasing number of Irish women are accessing abortion pills online via the <i>womenonweb.org </i>website.  In some cases, their reason for doing so is that they do not have the wherewithal to travel or they find out early that they are pregnant.  Do women in the Netherlands access the services of <i>womenonweb.org</i>or is this not necessary because there is sufficient provision in the State system?  In terms of geography, how do women access clinics?  Is it through their general practitioner?  Obviously, isolation can be an issue for women living outside cities and towns, even in countries where abortion care is readily available.  What has been the witnesses' experience in this regard?</p></speech>

All the abortion clinics in the Netherlands have a contract with a hospital.  If there is a complication, the individual will be able to refer to a hospital that can deal with the complication.  I do not believe there will be any boundaries for women who have access to pills via the Internet.  If they have a complication, they can freely walk into a hospital and we will manage the situation.</p></speech>

With regard to the directive that would be issued or the information that would be given when a woman may wish to date the pregnancy and to avail of a scan, a suggestion was made that the woman would not be able to look at the scan.  I presume women can ask to see the scan.  I am giving Professor Pajkrt an opportunity to correct what I believe was misinformation.  My understanding of Professor Pajkrt's words, which may have been misinterpreted by another member, is that the note to the person performing the scan sets out the reason the woman is having the scan and that she may not wish to look at the scan.  I presume if the woman wanted to see the scan, for whatever reason, it would be fine for her to make that choice.</p></speech>

It is very useful to hear different perspectives.  A statement was made that Irish people would be horrified by the use of the term "undesirable pregnancy".  We are used to the term "crisis pregnancy".  This is simply a language issue and I am not arrogant enough to presume to speak for the entire Irish nation.  Opinions polls certainly show a desire to change the highly restrictive abortion regime in place here, which permits abortion only on the basis of an equal right to life.  The current regime brings the legal profession into the treatment rooms.  I wonder why the choice was made to embed the Dutch legislation in criminal law as opposed to the whole health care area.</p></speech>

In that sense, it is part of health care.  When we had the evaluation of the abortion Act in 2005, some of the abortion specialists or physicians who came forward sent us a letter asking us to consider in our recommendations that they were already subject to so much other legislation.  They asked why they could not be removed from the criminal system and if we really needed to have this criminal code context.  We did not make such a recommendation in our study.  If we had done so, I am sure it would not have been accepted by politics and the Dutch Parliament and Government because, as I stated, under Dutch law, unborn life is considered to deserve some degree of protection.  It makes sense that this protection is also provided by means of criminal law.

The majority of abortions in the Netherlands take place in abortion clinics.  In hindsight, does this create problems?

Let us say the Deputy and I were to meet at a party where we discussed the fact that we were at this meeting.  I could easily say - if it was the case - that I had an abortion.

The witnesses' figures on Downs syndrome were quite good.  I ask Professor Pajkrt  to go over the statistics she gave again because there has also been an attempt to portray prenatal screening as an attempt to eliminate anyone with a disability.  My reading of the figures she gave, however, is that prenatal diagnosis has had no impact on the abortion rate but has had an impact on late abortions.

I think the Deputy reads it correctly.  That is why I would like the numbers to be better.  I would like to be able to correlate the numbers and say, this is the level of prenatal diagnosis and this was the result.  All we can do is say, as the graph shows, that we have seen an increase in late, second trimester abortions.  The only assumption that we can make is that it might be due to the 20 week scan because that is when the anomalies are picked up.  If it is a severe anomaly, parents will consider termination and we see that reflected in the numbers.</p></speech>

I was interested by Professor Pajkrt's submission on reasons for abortion.  Women make difficult decisions about whether to have abortions.  I was interested in the list of reasons the witness provided, such as financial considerations, housing, age, whether one's family is complete, broken or fragile relationships and the lack of possibilities regarding raising a child.  In the committee's discussions on the future of abortion rights in this country, we classified such reasons as being socioeconomic in nature.  I was very interested that Professor Pajkrt did not list some of the issues that have caused most discussion in this country, such as rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to the life or health of a woman or suicidal ideation.  As an obstetrician, does Professor Pajkrt consider the latter risks to almost automatically be grounds for an abortion?  Is it true to say that in the case of a woman who said she had been raped and wanted an abortion, a young girl who became pregnant as a result of incest in a family or a woman presenting with a fatal foetal abnormality, there would be no discussion of whether an abortion is warranted?  Can Professor Pajkrt say how one measures up against the other?  Having listened to all the experts who have come before the committee, some of whom have been fantastic, the evidence has been that women mainly choose to terminate a pregnancy for socioeconomic reasons and that reasons such as those relating to rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality are thankfully the exception.  That is also borne out in my experience.  Therefore, if a society is to liberalise the availability of abortion and give women choice in that regard, socioeconomic reasons for termination must be strongly considered.</p></speech>

The Deputy has made a couple of points.  In Holland, we call such terminations medical abortions but the use of the word "medical" is potentially confusing.  It is more accurate to call it an abortion for medical reasons.  Such abortions can arise if the foetus or the mother has a medical condition and it would be unsafe to carry on with the pregnancy.  If a woman has psychiatric difficulties or is suicidal, that could also be a reason.  There has been a long discussion about the latter reason in terms of when the mother's life is really in danger.  In the latest evaluation, that is now outside of the criminal law.  If it is mandatory to perform an abortion in order to save the woman's life, a doctor does not have to blink or wait but can just do it and there will be no repercussions whatsoever.</p> <p>  We call the other reasons for terminations social indications.  The Deputy may call them socioeconomic reasons; we call them social indications.  Reasons such as rape, incest, housing and so on all come under social indications.</p></speech>

I am sure Professor Pajkrt, as a lawyer, is aware of that constitutional ban.  If it is removed, legislation will then have to be considered.  I am trying to tease out the distinction between what we call socioeconomic reasons and what the witness refers to social reasons and those in the other horrible and hopefully very rare cases.  If abortion were only to be allowed in such horrible and, hopefully, very rare cases, there would still be an extremely prohibitive abortion regime.  Does Professor Pajkrt agree with that view?</p></speech>

For example, for a woman of 45 who suddenly discovers she is pregnant, having five children who are all in university could be a very good reason not to want to start over again.  Another example could be a woman experiencing extreme poverty who has two small children and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment.  This is what one comes across.  They are desperate stories.  One does not encounter people who have taken the decision lightly.  As I outlined in my opening statement, there is a difference between unplanned and unwanted.  Some women get pregnant and go to their doctor and tell him or her that the pregnancy is unplanned but very wanted.  People deal with unexpected situations; they do not all run across the road and have an abortion.</p></speech>

The majority of Irish people who currently go to the Netherlands for an abortion attend CASA clinics.  There are seven or eight such clinics and they are currently bankrupt.  They charge between &euro;350 and &euro;500 for an abortion.  Some people in Ireland say there is an abortion industry which is targeting vulnerable women.  Being targeted by the abortion industry has not been cited as a reason for an abortion in any of the material members have read or that has been set before the committee.  Women in Holland are entitled to free abortions as long as they are insured and legally in the country.  If there is an abortion industry in Holland, it is currently bankrupt and possibly carrying out many abortions for free.  Perhaps there is a lot of corruption there.</p></speech>

We do not know what happened and the matter is under investigation.  I have no more data than the Deputy or what has been printed in newspapers.</p><p>The only thing I know is that a couple of those clinics have to close and it is putting an enormous stress on all the other ones.  We are seeing that.  One could say it is an industry in that there is what is called up-billing.  The practitioner gets a certain amount of money for a certain procedure.  I have listed all the procedures.  This is what I think and it is an assumption; one procedure is a bit more expensive than the other one and they said they did A while they were doing B.  It has nothing to do with their professionalism or how they were doing it.  There is no malpractice there.</p></speech>

Early abortions are most common; 81% are performed at under 13 weeks, which is very good.  Is that largely due to increased use of the abortion pill, in the sense that the woman can take a pill early on and does not have to go through surgical abortion?  Would the professors distinguish between the two things in those statistics?</p> <p>  I do not suspect the witnesses will want to answer my next question but I want to ask it.  If they closed their eyes and just landed here, without knowing they had to come to speak to a parliamentary committee about our future in Ireland, what would they think about the state of abortion care for women in this country?  What would be their impressions as a professor in law and a professor in obstetrics?</p></speech>

What I can see is the legal context.  Compared with other countries in Europe, the provision in Ireland is very restrictive.  The European Convention on Human Rights and the court decisions that have been taken over the course of the years show that the European court has been very reluctant to go into the issue of whether the choice of the woman or the protection of the unborn life should prevail.  Even so, there is a growing consensus in Europe that there should be more openness and possibility for a woman to have an abortion in certain circumstances.  We also have discussion of socioeconomic reasons, which the Deputy mentioned.  Maybe Ireland will move towards a more moderate regime in the future.  I cannot say.</p></speech>

I think the Deputy probably knows what I feel about it.  I am a very strong believer, as I have said, in a woman's choice and in women's reproductive choices.  I really think that women are the only people ... I am not disrespecting the men in this whole thing but I do feel that it is a female thing.</p></speech>

It is a question I would have asked of previous witnesses.  It has to do with children in foster or residential care.  How are those issues addressed through the legal framework in the witnesses' country?  If a teenager or young adult finds herself pregnant and there is a care order for her, in this country, if she wishes to have an abortion there has to be a full court sitting.</p></speech>

That brings gestation times into it.  It was a question I raised a number of weeks ago.  I am spokesperson for children in my party.  We have 6,300 children in care in Ireland and somebody has to articulate these questions on their behalf.  How are we to address that legal side of it?  There are guardianships but there are also different court orders in place as to how their care can be administered.  Have the witnesses come across that in their country and how is it addressed?</p></speech>

I can see how it may be an issue.  We do not have special rules for this.  In our legislation in general, a request for abortion is looked upon as a highly personal decision.  The main issue would be whether the woman or girl in question would be competent.  If she is, and she is 12 years old or more, she is entitled to make a request.  If she has a guardian who does not agree, it depends very much on the circumstances.  If she insists on that request and the health professional feels that he can go along with her request, she will have this abortion.  It is the same provision as the one for minors for whom parental consent is not needed in special circumstances.</p></speech>

I think there is going to be a huge challenge around it.  It has to do with children in care.  The last day, when we had our own legal professionals before the committee, they clearly told me the process at present.  I do not know from a legislative point of view how we can address this anomaly in the system.  It is going to be a huge issue.</p> <p>  I found the witnesses' presentation very shocking.  Maybe it is the reality.  It is, because the witnesses are after telling me so.  Children at 12 or 14 years of age making decisions about abortion without having the support or telling their parents or anything like that - that they can make the choice without permission or without the engagement factor - I find that-----</p></speech>

If, as doctors, we see these young girls, we always try to address these things.  We had 83 teenagers under 15 last year.  It is below 100 and has been dropping.  If we think there is a problem, we will always seek assistance or will try to figure out what is going on and see if there is a way of helping the girl.  If the girl in question has actually been the victim of incest, for instance, and there is a threat to her life if she comes out with it or if she says she is pregnant - this is what we are talking about.  The majority of girls under 15 will probably come with their mum or dad or both.  There are scenarios, however.  I think the Deputy can imagine them as well as I can.  In such scenarios, the doctor really thinks that if he discloses the matter to the outside world it will endanger the life of the girl.  In such a scenario, that danger outweighs the possible benefit of seeking help, advice and support from the parents or guardians.</p></speech>

My final question is really just a comment.  Many witnesses have appeared before us.  They have talked about people being coerced or persuaded into seeking or avoiding terminations.  When women present at Professor Pajkrt's clinic, does it persuade them that going through with it is the right decision?  What is her clinic's involvement?</p></speech>

I always say something to parents when we offer counselling - it is not that we think they are crazy or need counselling, but it is important for them to balance all of the pros and cons in order to make an informed decision.  It is all about informed choice.  It does not matter what I think.  I am just the health care provider.  That is what we are doing.</p></speech>

We have those data.  Where a baby is diagnosed with Down's syndrome, a little more than 80% will be terminated, 10% will decease during pregnancy - even if people carry on, some of their babies will die before they are born - and 10% will be live born.  I was referring to a group of people who wanted screening.  There is a large group of people who, even if we say that a baby shows signs of Down's syndrome, will just say "Okay".  They do not want an intervention or a prenatal diagnosis.  They will just go along with it.  Our maternal age has been increasing, so maybe we have been terminating more Down's syndrome babies, but it is stable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017112300002#A00300"><p>I thank the select committee for giving me the opportunity to present for its consideration the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 &ndash; Army Pensions.</p><p>I will commence with a short statement setting out the background to this Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The 2017 Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;224.6 million for the Vote.  However, net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;235.3 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;10.7 million.</p><p> Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Vote.  It covers spending on all pension benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions spending, including gratuities.  It is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of &euro;220.1 million for subhead A2 will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  The shortfall in this subhead is estimated at &euro;10.8 million.</p><p> I will outline the main reasons for the shortfall in subhead A2.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the year, with some 12,350 military pensioners across all categories.  This is a net increase of about 1,350 since 2007.  It is expected that approximately 320 military personnel will retire with a pension and lump sum in 2017.  Overall, this level of turnover during the year was greater than what was provided for in the original Estimate.</p><p> In other areas of the public service, most people leave at a standard retirement age, meaning that their numbers and timing of departure can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the PDF is atypical.  The majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily, that is, before reaching maximum retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  As such, the details are not known in advance, which can contribute to greater than expected expenditure on military retirement benefits in any given year.  This situation is a product of the availability, for operational and human resources, HR, policy reasons, of the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age.</p><p> In any given year, forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure and the exact numbers of retirements is difficult.  During 2016, 75% of military personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily.  The picture is much the same for 2017.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased costs.</p><p> A shortfall arises in subhead A3, which covers the cost of military disability pensions, disablement lump sums and related dependants' pensions.  It accounts for some 4% of all military pensions expenditure.  The original provision of &euro;8.7 million for this subhead will not be enough to meet the full costs arising during the year.  A shortfall of &euro;430,000 is expected and is due to greater than expected expenditure in respect of new disability pension and disablement lump sum awards over the course of 2017.</p><p> The combined shortfall of &euro;11.3 million in subheads A2 and A3 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;260,000 in subheads A4, A5 and A6, combined with surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 in subhead B.</p><p> To sum up, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;10.83 million for subhead A2, seek additional funding of &euro;430,000 for subhead A3, reallocate savings of &euro;260,000 from subheads A4, A5 and A6 to subhead A2, and reallocate projected surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 from subhead B into subhead A2.  This leaves a net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;10.7 million.</p><p> As I previously indicated to the committee, it has been my intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations.  Arising from those negotiations, the gross allocation for Army pensions was increased by &euro;6 million for 2017.  I am pleased to inform the committee that, as recently announced in budget 2018, the Army pensions allocation will be further increased by &euro;9.5 million next year.  The military pensions funding envelope for 2019 will again be addressed next year as part of the process of ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials.</p><p> Although the costs of recruitment to the PDF are not met from the Army pensions Vote, I will take this opportunity to update members on the measures being taken to replace personnel who are leaving the PDF through retirements and discharges generally.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to reaching a full strength of 9,500 PDF personnel as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  In that regard, I assure the committee that there is sufficient funding within the budget for a full strength PDF.</p><p> In terms of defence spending, budget 2018 delivered an extra &euro;25 million for 2018 and an additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure out to 2021.  As I have acknowledged, however, the process of reaching and maintaining the 9,500 target strength level presents many challenges.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen for the Defence Forces in terms of the recruitment and retention of personnel with scarce and highly marketable skills.  This is always a factor where highly trained personnel are a desirable asset to any employer.  There is a particular challenge in retaining personnel with specialist and scarce skills but having spoken to my ministerial colleagues at European meetings, I note this is a challenge faced by military forces internationally.</p><p> I have welcomed the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, on the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am pleased to see that the Defence Forces are highlighted as a priority area requiring a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties.  The Department of Defence, in conjunction with the Defence Forces, has raised recruitment and retention issues as part of its submission to the commission.  We will be making a further submission to it when it commences this next phase of its work.</p><p> As stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence, continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces organisation.  It provides young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments.  As the committee is aware, there has been a concerted effort in recent years to ensure significant ongoing recruitment at enlisted and officer levels.  It is anticipated that 800 personnel will be inducted into the PDF during 2017.  This includes officer cadets, Air Corps apprentice aircraft technicians, direct entry officers for the Naval Service, medical doctors and, of course, general service recruits.</p><p> A new general service recruitment campaign was launched in September.  This builds upon the successes of previous campaigns and will provide for the induction of new personnel in 2018.  Aside from recruitment, there were also more than 1,400 promotions across all PDF ranks in the years 2014 to 2016.  Promotions within officer and non-commissioned officer, NCO, ranks are ongoing in order to fill vacancies and, to date in 2017, a further 190 personnel have been promoted.</p><p> A range of recruitment methods are being employed, including direct entry competitions for specialist positions, and the scope to expand direct entry further is being considered.  This includes actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge, skills and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap.</p><p> The Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by the Government at home and overseas.</p><p> I commend this Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote to the committee.  I will be happy to take whatever questions arise and will do all that I can to answer them openly and honestly.</p></speech>

I welcome that it is a Supplementary Estimate, not the reallocation of funding for the capital programme to fund the shortfall in pensions that has been a recurring feature of the past few years.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the loss of many highly qualified skilled people who had not reached retirement age.  Unfortunately, there are many well qualified, committed former members of the Permanent Defence Forces who I think should still be serving.  I know some of them very well and they left because they are not satisfied with the conditions and the morale within the Army.  Recruitment, which the Minister of State mentioned in his contribution, needs to be addressed but retention also needs to be addressed.   </p> <p>  I gather from some of the low-ranking members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, that the availability of the disability pension is not widely known with the Defence Forces.  It was suggested to me that it is very well known and availed of by higher ranking officers who had retired, but the lower ranking ones did not seem to be so well acquainted with their entitlements.  Could the Minister of State arrange for the Department to ensure that people are fully aware of their entitlements?</p> <p>  We need policies to be put in place and measures to be taken to retain members of the Permanent Defence Force because we all want to see enlistment at required levels. </p> <p>  Today, the subject is the Supplementary Estimate and as we have a time constraint, I will allow very little tolerance for veering away from the Supplementary Estimate.  However, a request has been sent to the Minister of State to engage with us on general Defence Forces matters in January.  He will be here next week for statements on the European defence policy but in January we hope to devote a full meeting to Defence Forces matters, where a dialogue will be very important.</p></speech>

I work with the pension side, and I know that there is a good mix of enlisted personnel and officers in receipt of such pensions.  I will take the Chairman's query away from this meeting and make sure this is highlighted in so far as possible throughout the organisation.  This is not hidden from anybody.  Perhaps the Chairman is referring to new members.</p></speech>

It is not a simple process.  This has to go to different branches.  It is not just one civil servant who reads a medical file and is able to determine if a person has lack of hearing, a disability or some form of injury.  It has to go through different branches.  The medical side takes some time and has to go through due process.  There is also the Army pensions board.  The processing time depends on the complexity, nature and range of medical conditions and injuries claimed.  To assist in its investigations, the board often seeks outside independent medical opinion from consultants in the relevant specialist fields and the process for deciding disability pension applications is very different from the one involving the award of military retirement benefits.  It takes some time to complete due to the need to fully verify the background details in individual cases for the medical investigation by the Army pensions board.</p></speech>

Since 1995, Defence Forces officers pay a pay related social insurance, PRSI, class A contribution and their pensions are fully eligible for the social welfare system.  Those officers fulfilling the agreed criteria are eligible for a supplementary pension provided for by an agreement in 2009.  The retirement age for the rank of commandant was increased from 56 to 58 years to facilitate that arrangement.  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 came into operation and I gather from the Department and from the Minister of State that it does not provide for pre-existing superannuation arrangements.  Therefore, the terms of the 2009 agreement no longer apply to entrants post-January 2013.  The implication of this is that a new entrant to the Defence Forces as an officer from 1 January 2013 who is mandatorily retired at 58 or 60 will have a final benefit pension less the value of the contributory State pension.  New entrants will be at the loss of the value of the contributory State pension, which is currently &euro;12,390 until they reach the age of retirement at which that becomes payable.</p><p>They are at a loss.  It is an anomaly.  From what I gather, that issue was not brought up during the negotiations in respect of the 2012 Act.  There was an expectation on behalf of the Defence Forces and their representative association that this superannuation arrangement would continue in place, which is no longer the case.  This will require funds to fix it, and the Minister of State will be obliged to speak to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to address this issue.  An officer who came in post 2013 and who knows that his or her pension will be severely reduced when he or she hits the mandatory retirement age will look to get out earlier.  These people will have to find employment at a younger age and start a new career.  In light of the retention difficulties we are facing, this is an area that can be addressed with minimal cost.  The Minister of State should consider this issue and come back to the committee - and to me personally as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on defence - to give an answer as to how that anomaly is to be addressed.  </p><p> I want to go through the Minister's statement and the issues raised within it.  The main reasons for the shortfall are referred to, and I accept the difficulty in calculating what the pensions are year on year because members can leave voluntarily and at different ages.  However, I find it strange that the list of main reasons did not include the issue of retention and the fact that we are losing people at an alarming rate.  That is one reason there is a shortfall in the pensions budget.  I do not see anything in the Minister of State's statement and still have not seen a physical document that outlines the Department's retention policy.  I acknowledge huge effort is being put into recruitment but we are losing people at such an alarming rate that we cannot catch up with ourselves.  </p><p> In his statement, the Minister of State indicated that the Government is committed to reaching a strength level of 9,500.  It is difficult to marry that with the current state of our Defence Forces.  They are currently in an extremely poor state.  We are losing middle and senior management, that is, experienced people with expertise and skills.  Those are the people we need to train the officers and NCOs coming through the recruitment process into which so much effort is being put.  Officers who are recruited, go through their cadet school training and come out the other end as second lieutenants still are not fully trained to take up some of the posts they are expected to take up.  They do not have the expertise and skills to lean on, in terms of senior personnel to help train them further, to get them to the required level to operate as unit commanders.  </p><p> On the last page of his statement the Minister of State observed that "continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces".  While I acknowledge this point is not directly related to Army pensions, I must mention the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  If the RDF continues to operate as it does currently, it will cease to exist.  It is almost dead and gone.  Recruitment continues to be a major issue.  While I acknowledge recruitment within the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, is ongoing, the issues concerning RDF recruitment, including getting people through the process of medicals and Garda clearance, have not been rectified.  The RDF's strength at the moment is down to just over 1,000 personnel.  It pains me to see the organisation struggling to survive as it is.  In the near future we will no longer have an RDF unless something is done.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State time and time again.  Towards the end of the Minister of State's statement, he noted he is "actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge ... and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap".  We have identified skills gaps.  The Air Corps is a clear example of that.  We do not have enough pilots or aircraft technicians.  We do not have enough members to run a properly functioning Air Corps.  The time for actively considering terms and conditions has long passed.  That ship has sailed.  We need proper, concrete action which will encourage members to stay within the Defence Forces in the Air Corps, Army and Naval Service.  We have not seen that to date.  </p><p> The Minister of State has mentioned that the Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces within the resources available.  We do not have capacity in the Defence Forces to deliver the service that is required.  That is gone and has been lost.  It will take years to build up the skills and expertise we have lost.  It is a devastating place for the Defence Forces to be.  Had this been addressed a number of years ago, we would not be in the position we are in today.  We are where we are, however, and still do not have a retention policy.  This was made clear to the Minister of State at both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO conference and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, conference that took place in recent months.  We need a retention policy, and it needs to be implemented immediately.  </p><p> In the context of the Defence Forces operating effectively, need I mention Rescue 116 and how top cover could not be provided?  We could not operate effectively within the Air Corps.  We have a new naval ship which we cannot man.  We have people in the Army who are double and triple-jobbing.</p></speech>

I presume the Deputy is referring to the University of Limerick, UL, document.  My Department, the Defence Forces and the associations have taken that report very seriously.  We have actioned quite a number of points and are working through the document.  The report was carried out at a time of tough economic circumstances within the State.  Were the UL study to be carried out again, there would be different results.  There have been pay increases across the board for members of the Defence Forces.  Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke about specialist skills.  People retire right across the board, from different ranks and with different skill sets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has prioritised the Defence Forces, along with the health sector, to investigate recruitment and retention issues around specialist skills.  We are preparing for negotiations with the Public Service Pay Commission.  Work is ongoing on that at present in association with the representative organisations.</p> <p>  The ongoing financial difficulties in respect of Vote 35 were discussed.  We have had increases over the past two years.  We are in continuous negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials to address this issue.  We cannot say for definite at the start of each budgetary year how many people are going to retire.  It depends on whether they retire in January or November as to how much of a chunk will be taken out of our budget. </p> <p>  Disability as it relates to members of the Defence Forces was brought up.  There is a range of disabilities, including hearing problems and physical injuries to limbs and backs.  Those people go through a process, which includes medical documentation, as I outlined to the Chair at the start of the meeting.  </p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned supplementary pensions for officers.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference for a supplementary pension here.</p><p>I addressed this at the recent Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference.  I stated I will be in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from the Department and RACO have been in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.  The Deputy said the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, addressed the matter during question time.  I have spoken to him about this, and I told RACO at its conference that I had spoken to the Minister.  There is ongoing consultation between that Department, my officials, the representative associations and me.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference at this meeting.  It is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> I do not agree with the Deputy regarding the numbers leaving.  When I was appointed in May 2016, one of my first priorities was the number of members of the Permanent Defence Force and trying to get back up to a strength level of 9,500.  We have a full budget for 9,500 members.  In 2016, 569 members left and 619 people were taken in.  It has been out there for quite some time that more people are joining then leaving.  Since my appointment in May 2016 we have taken in just over 800 members, between enlisted ranks, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and cadets.  There is ongoing recruitment.  I have recruiting meetings on a quarterly basis, with Deputy Chief of Staff support, with all of those involved in recruitment to keep the pressure on and see where they are being trained, and I am quite content.  It will take me some time.  I have stated from the time of my appointment this will be a huge challenge as we are competing with a very strong economy, but this is a priority for me.  We are taking in more than are leaving.  Our strength level at the end of October was 9,219 personnel across all services.</p><p> The Deputy said that after their training personnel are not fully trained.  This is absolutely not the truth.  I am not sure if that is what the Deputy meant.</p></speech>

What I meant is that when people come out after two years in the cadet school they really rely on senior officers to show them the ropes.  On coming out of cadet school they go into a posting.  The officer corps tells us it is very important to have that link with senior officers who have served and who will pass on their skills and knowledge.  It is how the organisation works.  We are losing this.</p></speech>

I have been assured by the Chief of Staff that all new commissioned officers are given every help and assistance to bring them right through the organisation.

I spoke about this in February or March and I stated I wanted this to be a priority.  The terms and conditions are being worked on regarding re-entry.  There are officers who have retired from the Defence Forces, such as pilots, explosive ordnance disposal personnel or engineers, who want to go back to the organisation.  I am not saying there will be hundreds of them, but there are a number of them and I want to give them the opportunity to come back into the organisation.  Terms and conditions are being worked on with the Defence Forces and the Department and they have to go back to the representative organisations.  Let me state very clearly I will be making a decision on this myself if it is held up by any of the representative organisations.  This is a priority.  It is the right thing to do.  Of course, people coming back in cannot come back in at the same level as their peers.  They will have to come back in at a different level.  I accept this has to be worked on, and it is being worked on as part of the terms and conditions being developed.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the Air Corps not properly functioning.  As recently as yesterday, I spoke to the general officer commanding the Air Corps about any issues he has.  I have to say that even though it has huge challenges it is properly functioning.  Huge capital investment has been made and extra investment is being planned.  There are two classes of apprentice military aircraft technicians and approximately ten began training this year.  Ten cadet pilots began their training in October.  Other cadet classes are in training.  Five cadet pilots received their wings in October.  Options on the provision of air traffic control services in the long term are being considered by a civil military working group to ensure their sustainability.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about top cover and Rescue 116.  I want to be very careful.  There is an agreement that on an available basis only we provide top cover to the Coast Guard.  Let me state this is totally on the basis of being available.  The loss of Rescue 116 was a shock for us all.  I send our deepest sympathies to all those involved.  Investigations are ongoing and I do not want to go into it.  The agreement we have with the Irish Coast Guard is on the basis of being available only, and that is the way it is.</p> <p>  I am not aware of any naval vessel that is not operational at present.  Huge capital investment has been made to the Naval Service over the past three or four years.  In the worst recession in the history of the State, we are awaiting the delivery of a fourth ship.  The flag officer commanding the Naval Service has not come to me, and neither has the Chief of Staff, to state they are unable to operate the full flotilla.  They are able to carry out all of their duties asked of them by the Government, such as sea fisheries.  Recently, we became fully fledged members of Operation Sofia.  All vessels are fully operational.  I am the first to state the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army have challenges, but I have not been told they are unable to carry out their full duties asked of them in the White Paper on Defence of 2015.</p></speech>

The Minister of State spoke a lot about capital investment in those in training, but I make the point this does not immediately address the capabilities of the Defence Forces, because capital is equipment and those in training are not fully trained and, therefore, operational.  The Minister has told me there are no difficulties in the Air Corps and that it is fully effective and fully operational.  I am just saying to him here today that is not the information I have.  I am also getting different information to the Minister on the Naval Service because I am being told it is extremely stretched in terms of personnel.  The focus on capital is one thing, but we need people to man the ships.</p><p>I am being told they are fairly stretched.  The same is true of the Air Corps.  It is widely documented.  It has been reported in every newspaper that there are huge staff issues in the Air Corps.  I am not making it up.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State address the issue of capital expenditure?  A total of &euro;98 million in capital expenditure was announced for 2018 to 2021.  Can the Minister of State give me a breakdown about where the funding will be spent?  We mentioned recruitment.  Over the past decade, the number entering the Defence Forces was only greater than the number of those leaving in it in 2013, 2014 and 2016.  I know other members have highlighted this.  What measures have been taken to ensure the rate of intake continues to be greater than the number leaving?  Can the Minister of State reassure us that the number of cadets entering the Defence Forces exceeds the number of officers leaving it?</p> <p>  Regarding industrial relations and pay, which were already mentioned, will the Minister of State ensure that the Department makes a submission to the Low Pay Commission outlining the challenges facing the Defence Forces because this is a major issue.  Many constituents in my area in Sligo are based in Bundoran, Ballyshannon and Finner.  Could the Minister of State update the committee about his intentions to renew the conciliation and arbitration scheme within the Defence Forces?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017112300002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to put forward the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We are seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million for the 2017 budget in order to fund the Christmas bonus, which is due to be paid to Vote 37 social assistance recipients next week.  Overall, the Christmas bonus is estimated to cost &euro;219 million.  As Deputies will be aware, we are providing for an 85% bonus this year, the same as last year.  The bonus will be paid to approximately 1.2 million customers over the course of next week.  It will provide a significant boost for people in the run-up to the festive season and for local economies throughout the country.</p> <p>  The overall cost is broken down into &euro;100 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;119 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund will fund, in its entirety, the cost of the bonus that is to be paid to people on contributory payments, such as the contributory State pension, invalidity pension and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on the Supplementary Estimate.  As Deputies may be aware, the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  Income from PRSI receipts during 2017 will result in Social Insurance Fund income estimated at &euro;9.86 billion.  It will be over &euro;262 million, or 2.7%, ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;653 million, or 7.1%, ahead of the position in 2016.  I imagine Deputies will agree that this is a positive development.  Thankfully, it is clear evidence of the significant improvements in employment levels in recent years.</p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is estimated to cost &euro;8.897 billion.  This is &euro;86 million, or 1%, ahead of profile.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is expected to be approximately &euro;1.4 billion at the end of 2017.  In so far as is possible, I intend to keep running surpluses in the coming years in light of the need to prepare, on foot of our ageing population, for the rising cost of pensions.</p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2017 is expected to be &euro;19.951 billion.  This will be &euro;96 million, or 0.5%, more than provided for in the original 2017 Revised Estimate.  The higher expenditure is due solely to the payment of the Christmas bonus.</p> <p>  The numbers on the live register are expected to average at approximately 260,300 for 2017.  This is a reduction of 43,800 on the average for 2016.  The estimated cost of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;23 million to jobseekers is being offset by underspending elsewhere in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  Consequently, there is no additional allocation required for jobseekers in the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  The briefing provided to Deputies in respect of the Supplementary Estimate lists the schemes for which additional sums are being sought as well as some information on underspending.  We can go through the position of individual schemes, if required, during the meeting.  In any event, Deputies should note that almost all the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  An estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of the annual Revised Estimates Volume.  The individual estimates are constructed on a scheme-by-scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors available for that portion of the year in which the Estimate is calculated.  Trends can and do change over the course of each year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than provided for in the original Estimate.  Actual expenditure on most schemes will never be precisely on target as a result of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.  Thus, for example, we expect an overspend on schemes such as disability allowance and other illness schemes this year.  This is primarily due to the continuing increase in the number of applications.  In the first half of this year, for example, the number of new applications for disability allowance increased by 8.2% compared with the same period last year.  We should assume that the spend in this area will increase.</p> <p>  I hope my opening statement has given Deputies a broad overview of the Department's expenditure in 2017 and the reason underlying the necessity to ask for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million.  I look forward to engaging with committee members presently.</p></speech>

This matter was only referred to the committee earlier in the week.  We will in no way frustrate the payment of the Christmas bonus.  Does Deputy Brady wish to start?  I will take all committee members first.  I will then ask the Minister to respond to any specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1639" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017112300002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate.  Like the Cathaoirleach, I have no wish to frustrate the payment of the Christmas bonus.  Many people rely on the payment desperately at this time of year, especially old age pensioners.  They view and use this payment as a way to get out of many financial difficulties.</p> <p>  I did a rough calculation some years ago when the payment was completely stopped.  My calculation was based on one town, Bray.  Predominately, the payment goes directly to the local economy.  It is not for going off on shopping trips to New York or anywhere else.  It goes directly into the local community.  The loss of the payment to Bray amount to between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million.  That is the impact of it.</p> <p>  The bonus must be welcomed, although it would be better if it were a 100% payment.  Given the fact that there are savings within the Department in respect of various schemes and that there is surplus in the Social Insurance Fund, is it possible at this point to give out a 100% payment?  Let us consider some of the savings across the Department.  There is a saving in the fuel allowance.  A whole range of savings can be made.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I reckon increasing the payment to 100% would cost in the region of &euro;32 million.  Would it be possible to increase it to 100%?</p> <p>  It is positive that we are ahead of the position that obtained in respect of the Social Insurance Fund in 2016.  I appreciate what the Minister has said in terms of the need to continue building the fund.  My question is on the issue of bogus self-employment.  Has the Department carried out analysis of how much we are missing out on through bogus self-employment and employer PRSI contributions?  The fact is that the fund is ahead of profile but it could be far healthier.</p> <p>  The Minister says that the figure for disability payments and disability allowance is up 8.2% compared with 2016.  Of all the payments, this is the largest increase.  There has to be a reason.  I understand this may be because JobPath has now come on the scene and many people are having their payments changed.  I am unsure whether there is a reason for that other than an increase in applications.</p><p>There has to be another reason for it so perhaps the Minister could provide a breakdown of the position.  I might have a few more questions but I will let other Deputies ask theirs now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017112300002#C00200"><p>I will be brief because Deputy Brady has raised most of the issues.  Many people feel that they have been living under the umbrella of austerity since 2008.  The fact that only 85% is being given in the Christmas bonus reflects that.  Why is the Government not giving 100% back, particularly as the social insurance payments are higher?</p> <p>  Why is there an increase of 8.2% in disability applications?  Where does that figure come from or why would people be applying for that now?</p> <p>  The other issue is the yield relating to employer PRSI.  The Government is always saying it cannot afford certain things.  We are discussing the pension anomaly whereby people find themselves at a loss to the tune of &euro;1,500 per year.  The 1% increase in the 8.5% and 10.75% rates of employer PRSI would bring in &euro;707.1 million.  That would be a significant amount of money in terms of re-examining the position and giving something back to people.  I have tabled an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill which seeks that a report be submitted within three months because I am aware that the Department is examining the figures and assessing how it could be paid back, probably in next year's budget.</p></speech>

I will also be brief.  I welcome this measure.  It is something I sought and there is general agreement across the parties that we should pay a Christmas bonus.  I also agree that we should make an effort to restore it to 100%.  If it cannot be done this year, it certainly should be done in 2018.  Based on the current figures, the 100% would amount to &euro;1.7 million more.</p> <p>  I also welcome the continued reduction in the numbers on the live register.  A further 43,800 people are off the live register, which is a huge number in one year.  The challenge is to continue that progress and keep driving down the figure.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for attending.</p></speech>

The proposal is to get an extra &euro;10 million to ensure that the Christmas bonus is paid at a rate of 85%.  Naturally, we support that.  I also intended to ask about the huge increase in the figures relating to disability allowance.  What is the reason for that?</p> <p>  As I understand it, the Social Insurance Fund is &euro;262 million ahead of what it was expected to be this year.  Is that correct?  That is, in turn, &euro;653 million ahead of the position for 2016.  The Minister and her officials have indicated that this is correct.  In last year's Social Welfare Act and budget, the Minister provided for the extension of invalidity pensions to the self-employed.  A number of people have been in contact with me at constituency level about that and I made inquiries with the Department as recently as last week.  I was told that the rules, forms and arrangements are not yet in place.  I understood that this was supposed to start on 1 December, which is only a week away.  I rang the Department directly but I cannot get any information on what the arrangements or rules will be for a self-employed person who wants to apply for the invalidity pension.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position.</p></speech>

The figure for disability allowance is striking.  Two questions must be asked because it is significant.  Is the Department carrying out a review to understand what is happening?  Second, the Minister referred to an increase of 8.2%.  How many of the applicants for disability allowance will be transferring from other social welfare payments?  The answer to that question might give us an indication of from where they are coming.</p> <p>  Subhead A36 relates to the mortgage interest supplement.  How many people were in receipt of that at the start of the year and how many are currently receiving it?  Is it still the intention that it will finish at the end of this year and will not be paid next year?</p> <p>  Finally, I had not intended to raise this matter but Deputy Joan Collins mentioned it.  In her opening statement, the Minister referred to the Social Insurance Fund being ahead of target.  It is the issue of the changes that were made in 2012 to the State contributory pension.  When the Minister was before us a couple of weeks ago, she indicated - she did so in the D&aacute;il as well - that she did not want to bring forward something half-baked and that she was nearly finished.  We had expected that she would have had an announcement regarding what she was working on, or we were led to believe that she almost had something ready.  That was in the interim to the roll-out of the proposals for the total contribution system.  Will the Minister provide a further update on the position since she was before us two weeks ago?</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will address those questions.  If Deputies have supplementary questions, we will take them when she has replied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-23a.1645" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017112300002#C00600"><p>I thank Deputies for their questions.  Almost all of them raised the same matters so instead of answering them individually, I will speak in general terms.</p> <p>  Of course, one would love to be able to give a bonus of 100% given where people have come from in recent years.  To be fair, however, Deputies must accept that the reason I am here today is that I am looking for more money.  If I were to provide a 100% bonus, I would be seeking a hell of a lot more money.  Some Deputies suggested that because there are underspends under certain subheads we could use the money involved.  While there are underspends under certain subheads, there are overspends under others.  The reason I am here is that I am short &euro;10 million to pay the 85% bonus.  As the economy improves one would hope to be able to return to a situation where one can give people what they used to receive in previous years.  I agree with Deputy Brady that they spend it.  It does not go into a box somewhere or to the Bahamas.  They spend it so it is of value and contributes to the local economy.  Hopefully, as the country recovers, the Department might be in a position to consider that next year.  Some Deputies referred to the fact that the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus and suggested that perhaps it should have been used to pay a 100% bonus.  The way the system works is that the Christmas bonus from the Social Insurance Fund can only be paid to those in receipt of contributory benefits.  The deficit does not relate to that fund, it relates to the people who are receiving allowances.</p> <p>  Another question was in respect of the Social Insurance Fund and bogus self-employment.  The Deputy can bet his bottom dollar that if I had that extra &euro;750 million or so, I would be well able to spend it.  I am not sure the figure is anywhere close to that.  However, I am sure there are some people - perhaps not in the large numbers that one might expect - who are in precarious situations whereby they are being made to declare themselves as being self-employed when they truly are not.  A report is being considered by the Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to pursue that element of the Social Insurance Fund contributions, which probably does not exist in reality today.  While we are working closely with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I only have the joy of spending the money in the Social Insurance Fund.  I do not have responsibility for collecting that money.  It is only by working with different Departments that we can influence how that position is reached.  However, given that I am in charge of employment rights and employment affairs, we are anxious to extend those same rights to people who are not necessarily self-employed in a self-employed world, if the Deputy understands what I am trying to say.  I hope to be in a position to issue the report on bogus self-employment and our views on it before Christmas.  If not, it will be issued very early in the new year.  I will revert to the Deputy and have a fuller conversation in that regard if possible.</p> <p>  The next question was about the 8.2% increase in the number of disability applications.  The main reason for it is that there has been a change in our demographics.  In fact, that is the only reason.  However, I believe there probably are some people on the live register who should not be on it.  We might conduct an analysis of that next year.</p><p>If there is a view that maybe there is a draw from one scheme to the other just because of this, it definitely is not just because of this.  There is a change in our demographics.</p><p> I assure the members that there are strict medical conditions to qualify for receipt of a disability allowance payment.  One cannot just arrive and say whatever one wants to say.  There are strict medical conditions that have to be adhered to and supporting documentation.  Those who apply and are successful and who are in receipt of disability payments genuinely have a disability that proves that they cannot work in the profession in which they would have been able to work and enjoy employment heretofore.  We will obviously keep an eye on that.  We do not look at rises in schemes and merely say it is well and good.  We conduct deep analysis and investigations.  However, we are quite satisfied that those in receipt of disability payments are adhering to the strict criteria that were set out beforehand.</p><p> At the start of this year 2,000 families were receiving mortgage interest relief.  At the end of this year, there are 1,400.  We will continue to pay those 1,400, but as the economy improves, I anticipate that number will continue to go down.  As long as people satisfy the conditions to receive that payment, they will receive it.  We are here to provide income supports for people when they need them.  If they need them, they will continue to get them.  As I said, I hope and envisage that as the economy recovers and people's personal finances recover, they might not need them.</p></speech>

The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus to the tune of &euro;600 million but, as everybody has seen from the actuarial review, it quickly will not be in surplus.  If we do nothing else except carry on, knowing the increase in demographics in that particular category over the next few years, within a short few years this fund will be in deficit and in the medium term it will be in serious deficit.  That is why, as the committee will be aware, we are moving to a new pension reform system and going to a public consultation, it is hoped either before or immediately after Christmas, with a view to moving to a new system by 1 January 2020.  That has been well documented and mapped out.  We will determine within the public consultation the exact parameters of that new system but we are all hoping to move to a total contributions model.  We will discuss the wherewithal during the public consultation and I look forward to the committee's input on it.</p> <p>  With regard to the 42,000 men and women who are suffering a pension anomaly arising from the changes in 2012, the report is just completed.  We are considering it in my Department with a view to bringing it to Cabinet.  We have made a decision to bring it to a sub-Cabinet committee meeting as opposed to a main Cabinet committee because there are significant resources required to address the issue.  I expect that will happen in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

As I stated, there are 42,000, the records of half of whom are electronic.  Half of the records are paper records.  The report that I would expect to be able to publish is a synopsis of the overall problem in the area, the cost of the problem and the positions that I would suggest and set out to fix the problem.  Once I get an agreement at Cabinet on that solution, it certainly will become public knowledge and I will be seeking the committee's report.</p></speech>

However, it absolutely is.  The criteria are the same.  The total contributions that are required are the same for an employed person.  It is exactly the same.

If the Deputy has concerns, I ask him to let me know what they are and I will address them.  I am sorry, I did not mean to ignore that.</p></speech>

On the bogus self-employed, the Minister stated a report is being compiled and she expects that before or just after Christmas.  Will that be published?  Will that lay out clearly what needs to be done?  Who carried out that report?  Was it the Department itself or was it an outside consultancy agency?</p> <p>  The Minister disputed the figure of &euro;750 million that the Department is missing out in employer PRSI contributions.  Has a proper analysis been carried out by the Department, even on the definition self-employed?  I might get an answer on that.</p> <p>  On the 42,000 who are receiving reduced payments, the Minister stated that report is due to be published.  She said that a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister stated two or three weeks ago it was due to be submitted to Cabinet the following Tuesday, which clearly has not happened.  Now the Minister is saying it will be published and given to a sub-Cabinet committee.  Is she sure about that?  Can we have an exact timeframe?  That report, that the Minister stated will be published, will lay out clearly what needs to be done to rectify the changes and that it will not be put on the long figure until 2020.  Can we get a rock-solid guarantee on that?</p></speech>

Many in industry are waiting for us to analyse it.</p> <p>  As soon as I walk out of here, I will get loads of phone calls from constituents asking if the Minister said that they would get the shortfall due to the 2012 anomaly returned to them.  To be clear, the Minister has the report and reckons she will be able to go to a sub-Cabinet committee before or after Christmas.  At that meeting, will the Minister be looking for the funds to pay it?  Will she have to wait until next year's budget or is she looking to resolve the issue between now and next year?</p></speech>

The Minister disputed the figure of &euro;750 million.  I can tell her, anecdotally, from my own experience and what I have seen in my own area over recent years, that &euro;750 million is, if anything, probably an understatement.  There are workers on building sites, such as ordinary labourers, carpenters and blocklayers, all designated as self-employed.  I have come across persons working in shops who are supposed to be self-employed.  It is ludicrous.  The sooner we get to grips with this the better.</p> <p>  In relation to the 2012 changes, I repeat the question of Deputy Joan Collins.  When does the Minister envisage she will be able to rectify this anomaly?  It is a glaring anomaly.  It is an injustice that continues every day while the present regime is in existence.</p></speech>

The report was compiled by a senior officials group across the three Departments - Revenue, my Department and the Department of Finance.  The reason it has not been published is because I am only considering it.  It is being worked on.  As soon as I have worked through the report, it will be published.  I am exceptionally clear in this area.  I look forward to the day that I have the money to spend that we can recoup from those who are not genuinely self-employed.  As soon as I can do that, it will be done.</p> <p>  The difficulty, in response to Deputy Joan Collins, is that there are 360,000 designated as self-employed.  Without speaking to each individual, one does not know who is and who is not self-employed.</p><p>What we have is anecdotal.  I know there are certain industries in which it is much more prevalent but there are industries that we do not even recognise in which it is a significant issue.  I am not trying to downplay whether it is &euro;750 million.  If it was twice or three times that, I am sure we would all enjoy being able to spend it, but I do not want to set expectations for people and then have us end up with an extra &euro;50 million a year in reality.  We will go after whatever the amount is and will enjoy divvying it out to people who deserve it most under income supports and schemes in the Department.</p></speech>

If we get money, we will spend it.  Whether we get it from the recovering economy or from this pot, we will spend it.  We will spend whatever money we get.  The driver for me is that there are people in precarious positions who could be let go this Friday through no fault of their own.  They do not get paid sick leave or paid holidays.  It will be dealt with.  That is all I can say to the Deputy and it is a categorical commitment.  To be clear, the paper compiled by my Department on the anomalies and the working suggestions to resolve it will be sent to the next Cabinet sub-committee.  That will happen before Christmas or immediately after Christmas.  So as the Deputy does not think I am misleading him, there is a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.  The paper is not quite ready to be put on the agenda today, but if there is another one next week or next month, it will be on that agenda and what the paper is and what the options are will be made public to the Deputy.  I would value Deputy O'Dea's support in dealing with that.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Collins, the reason it is going to a Cabinet sub-committee is because I do not have the money to fix the anomaly right now.  If I did have the money, we would most likely not have to ask for money.  We in the Department do not have the money to fix it within the finances allocated to us for next year.  It has to go through the normal methods of seeking the cross-departmental commitment that it is agreeable that this is how we fix it and to determine how best to find the money to fix it.  Deputy Collins is not the only person who will get calls afterwards.  That money does not currently exist in anybody's Department which is why it has to go to the Cabinet sub-committee to try to determine if the options we are going to provide are agreeable to other Departments, and then to determine how quickly we can fix it based on the resources we have.  That is the commitment and roadmap.  That paper and the options in it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting, and once that committee has considered it, I assume it will then allow us to bring it to a full Cabinet meeting and it will be made public as soon as I can do so.</p></speech>

Mixed messages have come from the Government over the past week or so.  I think the Minister said she wants to address this next year.  I think it should be addressed and sorted out now, but leaving that aside, the Taoiseach gave a different message.  He said it will be addressed when we move to the total contributions system in 2020.  Completely different messages have come from the Taoiseach and Minister.  Has the Minister had any discussions with the Taoiseach on this issue?  Is he committed to making the changes that are so badly needed for 42,000 people who are being discriminated against?  There are mixed messages, with the Minister saying she wants to address it and a different message from the Taoiseach.  Have there been any preliminary discussions with the Taoiseach or the rest of the Cabinet?  Is the issue of this being sorted retrospectively up for discussion?  Is it being looked at in this report?  Is it an issue that is not on the table at all?  There would a big push to have this payment made retrospectively to those 42,000 people who have been discriminated against.</p></speech>

I will rule that out clearly and emphatically for anybody listening.  There is no possibility or way for us to introduce something retrospectively.  I will take responsibility for the mixed messages that the Deputy may be getting.  The last day I was here, I answered a question from Deputy O'Dea and had hoped to be in a position to be able to bring the paper to Cabinet the following week or the week after.  Probably because of my naivety, I did not realise that I cannot bring something to Cabinet unless I have the resources to fix it because to go to Cabinet is to ask somebody for a decision to fix something.  Therefore I have to bring it to the Cabinet sub-committee.  We made a commitment to recognise the anomaly, and we recognise it.  The commitment to fix the anomaly is entirely in place.  There might have been a loss in translation following something reported here of what I said and it was then suggested to the Taoiseach that we would fix it within a couple of weeks.  He knows the reality, that this requires new money which is not currently there so he would have tempered his response accordingly.</p> <p>  When the paper is ready, it will be sent to the next Cabinet sub-committee.  If that can happen before Christmas, it will be before Christmas, and if not, it will be immediately after Christmas.  Arising from the discussions of that committee, based on the options to resolve this issue, it will be published and go to Cabinet thereafter.  This anomaly will be fixed as soon as the money is available, depending on the options chosen in the paper to resolve the issue.  The commitment has not changed.  I stand with the Chair and say that this is an entirely separate issue from our pension reforms which will come into place in 2020.  It is entirely dependent on the resources required to fix this and we all have to acknowledge that new resources are required to fix this but the intent is to recognise it as a stand-alone issue and to fix it as soon as we can.</p></speech>

It is unhelpful to the 42,000 people who are expecting something for the head of Government, the Taoiseach, to come out and remove any potential hopes they had.  Some &euro;5 million is being spent on a spin unit.  Maybe that should be put to some use to get a solid message that Government is singing from the same hymn sheet on this because, ultimately, 42,000 people are being discriminated against and being made fools of.</p></speech>

The following Friday morning in Cork, a local regional newspaper announced that we would not only pay people, but that we would be giving them back-pay which they would get within the next number of weeks.  I had no hand, act or part in the report of that newspaper.  I did not even speak to that journalist and do not, most of the time.  He took the transcripts of our meeting here that day, took something that I said at 11 a.m., mashed it together with something I said at 10.10 a.m., rolled it up into a ball and made a front page story that was not true and which set expectations for women and men that they would get money retrospectively and that they would get nearly it all by Christmas.  I will not take responsibility for that.  That was what the Taoiseach then replied to the following Tuesday.</p><p>The expectations that were set were not mine and certainly were not his.  Let me be emphatically clear to the journalist if he happens to be listening.  We will issue a paper on how to resolve this issue and will put it to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will decide whether to accept our proposals or better them.  If and when we find the money to fix this anomaly it will be done.  I am talking about new money and I am here today asking for money because we do not have it at present.</p><p> I acknowledge and accept what the Chair and the committee have said to the effect that this is a separate issue from the ambitious pension reforms on which we are embarking next year, and which will come into play on 1 January 2020.  We hope to resolve this issue long before that date.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the progress the Minister has made and wish her well, along with her Cabinet colleagues, in the coming weeks as it has to be addressed.  I thank her for work and the clarity she has brought to the matter today.  I also thank her officials, namely, Mr. McKeon, Mr. Crean and Mr. Lawler, for their attendance.  I remind members that the joint committee will meet at 10.45 a.m.</p></speech>
