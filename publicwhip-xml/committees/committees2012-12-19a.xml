    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900003#D00200"><p>We will commence our scrutiny of COM (2012) 617, a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the fund for European aid for the most deprived.  The joint committee has previously discussed this issue with its EU policy clerk.  I welcome from the Department of Social Protection Ms Orlaigh Quinn, assistant secretary, and Mr. T. J. Fleming who will advise us on the proposal and the Minister's position in the negotiations.  I also welcome Mr. Cormac Clancy, principal officer at Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Before we commence, I advise that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also advise Dr. Quinn that her opening statement will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.  I now invite her to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaigh Quinn" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900003#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving me the opportunity to make this introductory statement on the matters it has requested to be addressed.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is leading in the negotiations on this proposal at EU level, given its role in the specialised field of social policy at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will have primary responsibility for implementation of the measures contained in the regulation if and when it is approved.</p><p>  The European Commission's recently published proposal for a regulation on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived was published on 24 October and presented to the European Council's social questions working group by the Commission on 23 November.  The proposal is based on the previous EU experience of this type of programme.  It has a tradition dating back to 1987 of releasing intervention stocks of food to the poorest people in member states.  This was, for the most part, distributed by agriculture Departments using networks of NGOs and organisations involved in the relief of the poor.  With changes in how the Common Agricultural Policy operates, the levels of intervention food stocks have become unpredictable or non-existent.  However, the Commission is very keen to continue its support for people at the margins of society and thus, this proposal has emerged.  The key objective of the regulation is to contribute to the Europe 2020 poverty target of having 20 million fewer people in poverty.  The proposal calls for a fund of &euro;2.5 billion over seven years for the 28 member states to help to address this difficult social problem.  The proposal is being made under Article 175.3 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union relating to promoting social cohesion.  The specific objective is to alleviate the worst forms of poverty by providing non-financial assistance in the form of food and other goods.</p><p>  As the regulation is drafted, there is scope allowing member states to provide a number of forms of support and the Commission has indicated that it would like a flexible approach to be adopted to enable member states to implement their own arrangements to deliver the funding.  It is leaving it up to member states to decide whether to target directly or indirectly and how to define the target group.  The fund will be implemented by shared management and the regulation tries to keep implementation as simple and as flexible as possible.  It is envisaged that most member states will rely on existing channels for such support and use a combination of public and voluntary bodies to distribute the aid.  </p><p>  In terms of financing, the overall budget is not significant in EU or national terms.  However, depending on how the fund is eventually distributed and how narrowly focused the measures in an operational programme might be, the impact could be significant.  Member states will also be required to co-finance the operational programme up to a possible 15%, with special criteria applying to programme countries.  As for the likely sum of money Ireland may receive, I have no information on that matter yet.  However, we believe the amount will be small, but it could make a significant contribution if used narrowly.  The Commission proposes using allocation criteria based on two indicators, namely, the number of people in severe material deprivation and the number in households with low work intensity and how this has changed in past three years.<br /><b></b>I again thank the committee for giving me this opportunity to outline the proposal which is at an early stage of development.  I ask the committee to note that in our role as President we will not be in a position to take a national position; instead we will be taking a neutral stance on the merits of the proposal but with the objective of ensuring successful negotiations deliver an outcome at the earliest opportunity.  While we are aware some member states do have reservations about certain aspects, this is not unusual at this point.  </p><p>  On the issue of subsidiarity, the Department has formed a view that such matters do not arise in that the proposed regulation will replace existing arrangements with similar objectives, albeit with different methods of implementation.  The proposal is consistent with existing policies of the European Union, particularly cohesion policy and the aims of the European Social Fund.  Member states are not under an obligation to implement the actions called for under the proposal.  However, the funding cannot be used for other purposes if not drawn down.  The amount of funding is small in terms of the overall funding available under the European Social Fund.  We are only at the preliminary stage of discussion of this proposal, on which we are working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  </p><p>  I thank members for their attention and will be pleased to answer whatever questions they may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900003#D00400"><p>I thank Ms Quinn for her presentation.  Why has this proposal been placed before us at such short notice?  For example, if we were to avail of the option of seeking a reasoned opinion, we would have to deal with the matter tomorrow in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, which would place a strain on us.  Even though, in terms of the scale of the problem of poverty throughout Europe, only a small pot of money is involved, it is important that we fully consider what is being proposed.</p><p>  I recall the intervention stocks and butter vouchers provided in the 1980s.  I recall also the mantra of the European Union at the time that one should not interfere with the market.  However, the reason there were intervention stocks was there had been interference in the market.  In this case, the position is different.  In some ways, the European Social Fund is laudable.  As we all pay into it, we would only be getting back a little of what we put in.  I do not know whether what Ireland would receive would equate to what it has contributed to the fund in recent years.   </p><p>  This proposal is from the European Commission, the same body which is part of the troika which is demanding that we do the devil and all to cut social welfare rates and ensure people do in fact live in poverty.  The budgets for this year and last year were the consequence of some of its diktats.  Also, the European Central Bank is charging us high interest  rates.  According to EUROSTAT figures, there are 120 million people in Europe at risk of poverty.  If during the seven years of the programme the calculation was made <i>pro rata</i>, Ireland would only receive &euro;2 million per annum, which is buttons in comparison to what we are paying in interest charges to the European Central Bank.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900004#E00200"><p>I see where Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is coming from.  I agree to disagree with him but I hope we will get rid of the troika in 2013.  A great deal of pain has been put on the public but in Spain, which is experiencing significant difficulties, one only gets social welfare for two years.  After that a person is cut off completely, there is no social welfare.  Some 1.5 million people in Spain have no welfare payment from the state.  In Croatia one gets a social welfare payment for six months if one is lucky.  I think this should be pushed on and implemented as soon as possible.  Those in need in Spain are relying on-ex pats, British people who have opened soup kitchens to feed the people.  It is a good incentive.  The figure is &euro;2.5 billion and I think we should look at the bigger picture.  I know that Ireland is suffering but other countries are suffering as much.  We are lucky in certain cases to have a social welfare system in place because many countries would like to have our system but cannot afford it.  The situation in Spain is very serious.  They thought they could fill the vacuum by stimulating growth and they put &euro;22 billion into the economy which has gone into a black hole.  Spain might need a bailout but they are introducing austerity measures in Spain because they have no option.  They are starting to do what we have been doing for the past three years.  They have seen what Ireland has done and are starting to do something similar but unfortunately they are three years behind us.</p><p>  This was the subject of a recent BBC 2 documentary.  I would like the Opposition to look at what is happening in the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900004#E00400"><p>With the permission of the Chair, I would like to hear the responses to the previous questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaigh Quinn" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900004#E00500"><p>I apologise for the lateness of the proposal coming to this committee.  I acknowledge that it leaves the members little time to consider it.  The explanation is that this proposal was with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as it was a CAP programme and there was various discussions at official level as to the most appropriate place to operate this type of funding.  The ongoing work for the Irish Presidency has been top heavy in terms of the work programmes for Departments.  I again apologise for the delay in bringing this to the attention of the joint committee.</p><p>  It is not possible to say at this time how much will be available in overall funding.  I think it will be less than the &euro;2 million to which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred.  The total of &euro;2.5 billion is part of the multifinancial framework that is currently being negotiated and will be paid over a seven-year period.  In the overarching negotiations for the EU, this programme could be smaller, depending on what happens.  It is a small amount of money, but given the way it could be used in a targeted way to focus on the homeless or people who are very detached from the labour market, it could be beneficial if it was targeted at a small number of people.</p><p>  I take the point made by the Deputy on our ability to influence the proposals.  Having said that, it is very important for Ireland that in our role as President we take a neutral stance.  This covers every single item of EU business for the next six months, Ireland will not be taking a national position.</p></speech>

When we go to a meeting we are very much in Presidency mode because from Ireland's perspective if we are seen to take a very strong stance on something it will not help us from 1 January, as we will be seen as having a particular stance that will not help a member state that may be opposed to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900004#E00800"><p>Has a member state ever taken a strong stance?</p></speech>

The country hosting the Presidency tends to stop putting forward national positions somewhere between a month or two before the Presidency.</p><p>  Let me assure the committee that it is not that our view would not be taken on board.  Typically we would depend on countries with similar views to present them at ministerial and Council meetings.  It is not that our views would not be known, but we would not be out there making them public because it would diminish our ability to get successful negotiations through if we are seen as having strong views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012121900005#F00200"><p>Under the previous arrangement with the CAP intervention stocks, how much would that have been worth per annum to the country?  In respect of the overall value for the period of the previous funding, what was the total value within the European Union?  As it has been stated that the value of the fund will be &euro;2.5 billion for the next funding period 2014 to 2020, what was the value of the intervention stocks previously?</p></speech>

Our allocation at EU level was 0.1% of the CAP allocation.  I understand we would have received in the region of &euro;500,000 per annum.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I had a vote in the Seanad and, therefore, I did not hear what the witnesses had to say and I am not familiar with the questions members have asked.  Out of a sum of &euro;2.5 billion across all member states for seven years, what amount is Ireland likely to receive?  The key goal of 20 million fewer people in poverty is laudable.  I am conscious of the reference to food and other goods.  I presume breakfast in schools would qualify.  Breakfast is available in some schools in Ireland.  There is significant evidence to support breakfast in schools on the basis that learning increases once nutrition is provided for brain development especially in the morning because it breaks the fast of the night before.  Indeed, the World Bank has supported this in other countries.  I am getting feedback to suggest that where breakfast is provided in schools many children are not eating the food.  There is disadvantage in many settings that are not classified as disadvantaged.  I would like to see this provided to all schools given the squeezed middle class, the squeezed coping classes and the fact that MABS could tell me the other day that more than one third of its clients are waged and self-employed and many are in pre-arrears.  We need to look at a definition of "poverty" and a definition of who is disadvantaged.  What other types of projects are likely to qualify?  As this is a large amount of money, it is likely that this money would have been given to CAP previously.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses and the Minister have concerns about what is proposed?  What input has Ireland had into the proposal?  If we were to seek a reasoned opinion, what is the problem?  We were given powers under the Lisbon treaty.  If there is a problem, why would countries not use that power?  On the issue of subsidiarity, it is stated that the proposal replaces existing arrangements with similar objectives but with different methods of implementation.  However, subsidiarity was not protected at that stage.  The subsidiarity principles came late to the European Union dynamic and because something went through previously does not mean it should not be questioned now.  I attended a European Union event.  It is clear from the European Commission and the directors that they want to dictate how member states might use money but, on the other hand, Ireland's record is quite good when money is flexible.  In regard to the use of European Social Fund in education, it is clear that Ireland uses that funding well.  Largely, it funded the regional technical colleges at the time and it funded courses but also much infrastructure.  There is much to be said for more flexibility than what is provided for in this programme.  Basically, it provides for non-financial assistance whereas it should be possible to use it as one wishes up to a point.  In that way one could have ideas and be innovative.  There is a question mark over how flexible it is.</p></speech>

He mentioned that soup kitchens and food kitchens are popping up in Spain.  Perhaps he should look at what is happening in his constituency and in the State because we have our own soup kitchens and food kitchens.  Some of his rationale for wanting to proceed with it as soon as possible was that Spain needs it.  That may be the case but we are here to consider the best interests of citizens in this State.  Obviously, the upcoming Irish Presidency puts us at a disadvantage in the sense that we will have to adopt a neutral position during the negotiations.  It is not clear to what extent Ireland will have to co-finance it, all of which will have to be worked out.  I agree with Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh that we should not rush into the negotiations and we need to look at the consequences.  If that means discussing it in more detail, I would favour that rather than rush into it today and make a decision.</p></speech>

It would be a great story if we had &euro;2.5 billion to distribute to the poor in Ireland and it would have an effect.  However, a sum of &euro;2 million or less each year will not change substantially the lot of those in extreme crisis in Ireland.  While the figures vary, there are 60,000 people at risk of poverty in Ireland and the number has probably increased since the budget.  Those are the latest figures.  If we were to take only those who are homeless and those who are totally dependent on social welfare, &euro;2 million or less would not go a long way.  It would only be the cost of a packet of EasiSingles, &euro;2.90, based on that figure.  The reason I concentrate on the negotiations is that if we want to get a greater share of the &euro;2.5 billion pot, we need to be in the strongest possible position.</p></speech>

At the end of June if we get an agreed proposal, we will start to draw up what we intend to do with the funding allocated to us.

When the proposal is further advanced, we could certainly brief the committee then.</p><p>  To put it in context, it is small money.  For example, we spend &euro;35 million on school meals and it is due to go up to &euro;37 million this year.  That funds meals for 189,000 children.  This is a very small, narrow, targeted fund and, as such, when it comes to developing our own proposals, it would have to be seen in that light.  It will not do the broader-----</p></speech>

That is a matter for the Chairman and the committee to decide.  This proposal builds on what was already there and there are not significant differences in it.  As such, it will be on that basis that we would have given our opinion in terms of subsidiarity.  We view it as something that has already existed and which member states do not have to take up if they do not wish to, although that would not be seen to be helpful.</p><p>  On the point of Ireland not being represented, if there are particular proposals, which appear to be emerging, that programme countries would get a reduced matching funding, Ireland would benefit from that approach.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss with Mr. Stack the approach he will take in his new role, as well as his views on the challenges facing the council.  Members will be aware of the Government decision of May 2011 which puts new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate in public to hear his views.  We trust that this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Stack.  Officials are accompanying him, although they are not formal witnesses.  They are Mr. Jim Mulkerrins, principal officer, Department of Education and Skills, and Ms Teresa Griffin, CEO of the National Council for Special Education.  I draw to the attention of Mr. Stack that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are only covered by qualified privilege.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Members are asked to remember the long-standing practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  After the meeting, Mr. Stack's opening statement will be published on the committee's website.  I invite Mr. Stack to make his remarks.</p></speech>

I am pleased with this opportunity to address the committee in my capacity as chairperson designate of the National Council for Special Education.  As I only became aware of this appointment about a week ago, I have only begun to put together some initial thoughts on how I will give leadership and manage this role.  Now that I am retired, I am very willing to put some of my time and expertise into some active role in Irish education at a national level.  As members of the committee will be aware, this is a non-remunerated post.</p><p>  I will briefly cover three main points, as follows: my experience in education, my vision for the NCSE in the years ahead, and my role as chairperson of the council.  As regards my experience in education, I was the chief inspector in the Department of Education and Science - now known as the Department of Education and Skills - from 1997 to 2009, having joined the inspectorate there in 1992.  Prior to my time in the Department of Education and Skills, I was the founding principal of a large co-educational post-primary school in Limerick, from 1978 to 1992.  Enrolment in that school increased from 90 students in its first year to more than 1,000 students within ten years.</p></speech>

I would like to bring to the attention of members that the new chairman designate will not be remunerated for this role apart from receiving incidental travel expenses.  The authority is new and we cannot expect him to comment on its operations to date.  As a division has been called in the Seanad, I will allow Senator Fidelma Healy Eames to put the first question.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegation and, in particular, Mr. Stack.  I compliment him on taking up this role in a voluntary capacity.  As a good and faithful public servant, it is good to see him continue and it is clear that he is eminently well qualified for the role.</p></speech>

It is great to have someone of his calibre in an unpaid post.  He is giving very generously of his time to take on what is not an easy task.  I wish him well.  He is a man of integrity and very smart and diplomatic and will be very good at bringing people together on the board to deal with sensitive issues.  Hopefully, a great deal of progress will be made for children with special needs over the next few years.  He has been able to drive change in the inspectorate and other areas, often in the face of considerable opposition.  On another occasion, we can grill him on policy issues but for now I wish him luck.</p></speech>

It is very generous to undertake a role for nothing and it is obviously done from passion and love of public service.  Nobody can underestimate the challenges which lie ahead, in particular at a time when resources are few and far between.  It makes things even more difficult.  There are a number of areas which must nevertheless be addressed.  I note in Mr. Stack's contribution his reference to the need for closer inter-agency partnership, in particular in the areas of health and education.  I agree.  As he reads into the role over the next couple of weeks, Mr. Stack will come across some of the difficulties in health and education regarding special educational needs.  The current HSE proposals on the reconfiguration of therapy services and their impact on children with special educational needs, particularly in specialist schools, have created fears among families that current services will be diminished by the move to more geographically based provision.  It is happening already in Cork and there were issues with implementation in Limerick.  Implementation in Meath seems to have been more successful than it was in Limerick.  I do not know why.  Consultation with the HSE will be very important to address the impact of the reconfiguration of services on special needs education.</p></speech>

His track record in education speaks for itself.  He was involved in 2000 in the production of the report on a national support service for special education for students with disabilities.  On retirement, it is apt that he is taking on the role of chairman of the National Council for Special Education.  If his record as a civil servant is an indication, his contribution as chairman will be something to which to look forward.  I commend Mr. Stack on his public service ethic in taking on the role and providing the benefit to the State and its education system of his experience and knowledge.  I wish him the very best.  It is a challenging time.  There has been immense progress in special education in the last ten years, particularly since the establishment of the council.  Ms Griffin and her team do a very valuable job.  I welcome Mr. Mulkerrin also.  I have no doubt Mr. Stack will develop a good working relationship with all parties and provide strong leadership.  The joint committee looks forward to engaging with him further when he is up and running in the role.</p></speech>

He is very well qualified and experienced.  He chaired the planning group within the Department which produced the report on a national support service for special education for students with disabilities in 2000 which led,<i> inter alia</i>, to the establishment of the council.  While I do not expect Mr. Stack to have an answer right now, as a public representative a number of school boards of management, teachers and parents have raised with me the perception that there may not be a consistent allocation of resources among schools.  Whether that is correct or not is another issue, but I flag it with Mr. Stack.</p></speech>

The appreciation which was expressed is very encouraging and makes it worthwhile to remain at the wheel in the public service on a voluntary basis.  I have done nothing in the job yet so the praise remains to be earned in the months ahead.  I intend to do so.  Members have made observations which have been very informative.  The first job of a leader of any group is to use one's two ears before one uses one's mouth.  One must listen to hear what people are saying to avoid making decisions before discovering information one should have had in advance.  Deputy Tuffy's remarks on the perception regarding consistent allocation of resources are very useful.  It means I know I must keep an eye out for that.  As I speak to people I can learn about it and establish the position.  Senator Healy Eames's question about other models is worthy of further reflection and research to establish if there are better, more efficient ways to do things.  The focus of improvements must always be to further the educational interests of children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray MacSharry" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012121900003#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators.  Both of us will make short introductory remarks and then we will answer any questions the Deputies, Senators and the Chairman may have.</p><p>  In December 2008, I acceded to a request from the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to put my name on a panel from which he directed that certain Irish financial institutions would each select two individuals to become non-executive directors.  Each of the relevant institutions was participating in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme and the appointments were made under section 32 of the 2008 Act.  In my case, I became a director of what was then called Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings PLC and which today is Permanent TSB Group Holdings PLC, the holding company for Permanent TSB bank.</p><p>  At the time of these appointments it was very clear that the banking and financial infrastructure of this country was in grave crisis and there was a complete absence of trust in the management and leadership of the various banking institutions in the State.  In that context I viewed my responsibilities on my appointment as being twofold: first, to represent, in so far as I could, the wider public interest in the deliberations of the board during this crisis; and, second, to help challenge the culture which had so clearly taken over the boardrooms of our financial institutions.  At the same time I and my colleagues in similar positions with other institutions acknowledge that while the circumstances of our appointments may have been unusual, we share the same legal and fiduciary responsibilities as the other directors of those institutions.  Ultimately, we can only seek to influence, as opposed to dictate, the policy of the boards on which we sit.</p><p>  In the case of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings PLC, the focus between the end of 2008 and the spring of 2011 was on trying to advise on and help shape the response of the company to the crisis.  There were many reasons that this was desirable, including the fact that we were conscious of the already difficult challenges facing the Exchequer at the time.  In March 2011 it became clear that it was not going to be possible to secure this.  At the end of month new requirements for capital for all banks, including Permanent TSB, were set down by the Central Bank and these meant that the bank would be required to take &euro;4 billion in additional capital from the Exchequer, becoming effectively nationalised in the process, as there was no possibility of raising the money from other sources.</p><p>  Following that the bank was the subject of a number of direction orders from the Minister which directed the institution, among other things, to facilitate the sale of the life and pensions business of Irish Life by the group to the Minister for Finance for &euro;1.3 billion as part of that recapitalisation exercise.  The Minister intends to sell that business on to the private sector and I believe he will recoup that amount in full at that time.</p><p>  In the year to date our objective has been to try to secure the return of Permanent TSB bank to financial stability and strength.  This has been and continues to be a very difficult challenge.  Unfortunately, like many other banks in Ireland and elsewhere, Permanent TSB made a series of unwise decisions late in the last decade.  Together those decisions brought the bank to the brink of collapse and it will require enormous effort, sacrifice and pain to restore it to health.  However, I believe we are making progress in this regard.  In March the bank secured the support of the troika for a restructuring plan to be submitted to the European authorities and that plan has now been submitted.  While we await the formal response of the authorities to that plan, the bank is already making substantial progress on its implementation.  In recent months in particular, the bank has addressed the problem of its outlier status in respect of the standard variable rate which it charges its residential mortgage customers and that rate has now been brought into line with the market.  The bank has invested in a state-of-the-art arrears management service which is already enabling us to work much more constructively with customers to help them manage their mortgage repayments.  </p><p>  Significantly, and correctly I should say, there has been a fundamental overhaul of the group board over the last number of years to the extent that no<i></i>current director of the group was a director at the time of the introduction of the bank guarantee in 2008.  In the same vein, there has been a fundamental overhaul of the senior management team at the bank.  Key posts have now been filled with candidates who never worked in the Irish banking sector before, including the new chief executive officer, the new financial officer, the new chief operations officer and the new head of strategy and planning.  I do not believe there is any financial institution in the country where there has been such significant change and renewal at senior management and board level after the crisis hit.</p><p>  The bank has also seen a very significant reduction in the numbers employed - down to 1,800 from some 2,400 a few years ago - as it adjusts its cost base to reflect its smaller scale.  It has undertaken a series of liability management exercises in which it bought back debt in the market at a very significant discount, benefiting the position of the bank and ultimately the Irish taxpayer by approximately &euro;1.2 billion to date.  We are about to oversee the return of Permanent TSB to the lending market in the new year when we will unveil significant lending targets for the bank in each of its key product lines for 2013.   </p><p>  I believe we are now demonstrating that there is real benefit for this economy in preserving Permanent TSB bank as a competitive force, that doing so presents the best way of managing the investment which the Exchequer has made in the bank and that the bank is capable of restoring itself to stability and resuming its place in the country's financial infrastructure. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Hayes" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012121900004#C00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I hope we can be of help to the committee in answering questions.  Like Mr. MacSharry, I joined the board of what was then Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent Group Holdings plc in December 2008 following a request by the Minster for Finance to join the panel to which Mr. MacSharry referred.  Mr. MacSharry has already outlined the circumstances surrounding our respective nominations and the expectation of the role we would play.</p><p>  As is also clear from his opening address, the company has undergone significant structural change in the period since then.  Today, the company has changed its name and is called Permanent TSB Group Holdings plc - the holding company for Permanent TSB.  The changes that have taken place within the company have undoubtedly been extensive in nature and were directed and driven by the board in response to the ongoing changes in the circumstances in which the company found itself and which it had to address.  In addition to those changing circumstances, Mr. MacSharry has spoken about the sense of crisis and the loss of confidence in the banking sector that was pervasive in 2008.  However, simply making that statement does not do justice to just how extraordinary the crisis was and how real was the threat to the country's financial system.  I have no doubt that at that time we were at a point where the very fabric of our banking infrastructure was in peril, and not just the continued survival of Permanent TSB itself.</p><p>  In the period since our appointment we have focused on trying, first, to ensure the survival and future viability of the bank in the face of unprecedented stress both in funding markets, and in the speed and extent of credit deterioration and the pressures that put on capital held by the bank.  We have tried to avoid having to take capital from external sources into the company.  We are now trying to support the stabilisation of Permanent TSB and its restoration to a position of significance in the banking world and the economy.  Mr. MacSharry and I are both satisfied that the bank has, since 2009, succeeded in building up a management team with the skill set and capability to meet the challenges facing the bank in the future, and the ability to realise the full potential of the bank as a real competitive force in the Irish retail bank market.</p><p>  A root and branch analysis of policy and strategy has been completed and the resulting restructuring plan, after presentation to the Government and the troika, has been submitted to the EU.  In the interim, work has already started on implementation of the plan with the full and enthusiastic commitment of all bank staff.  We have also worked with our fellow directors to try to ensure that the bank understands the wider context in which it operates and the responsibilities it now has to act in the interests of the wider community.  That is particularly relevant when it comes to issues such as interest rates, arrears management and assisting individuals and households to achieve their financial plans.  Those are the kinds of areas where the wider community has a keen interest in the policies adopted by individual banks.</p><p>  In that regard, I believe Permanent TSB has made significant progress in recent months not least, as Mr. MacSharry has said, by reducing unilaterally its standard variable rate, SVR, for mortgages and by establishing a professional arrears management unit to support its work with customers in arrears.  The next step is to complete the work, now well advanced, on delivering attractive new banking products to the Irish consumer, which meet his or her requirements and also help deliver some much needed stimulus to the economy.  The challenge for all on the board, and in management, is how to strike the correct balance between, on the one hand, protecting the money the taxpayer has invested in the bank and, on the other, acting appropriately in respect of its customers, and particularly its customers in arrears.  That is a very difficult balance to strike, but I can assure the committee that throughout my time on the board, no issue has generated more discussion and reflection than this and I expect this will continue to be the case for as long as the State remains a significant investor in the bank.  I too thank committee members for their attention and time.</p></speech>

That means that public interest directors have a specific role.  When the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, appointed you, he was quoted in one newspaper as saying that he was appointing some "thick-skinned" people.  The public perception would have been that you were in there battling for the public.  Since 2008, we have learnt a lot more about the banks and how badly they were constructed.  One of the terms of reference in that legislation is to facilitate the availability of credit in the economy of the State.  What have both Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes been doing to facilitate that legislative requirement?  More specifically, what have both public interest directors been doing to prepare the bank with regard to the forthcoming personal insolvency legislation and ensure that the bank is engaging progressively with customers and people who are significantly in debt and in very distressed situations?</p></speech>

The Chairman is talking about facilitating customers with loans.  One does that to the best of one's ability and to the availability of funds.  That has been a serious problem in the banking system.  That is why one cannot just borrow money on the markets.  Some 40% of our business is served through the deposits, 25% through the ECB and 25% through long-term lending.  That money is there and it is being loaned out on a regular basis.  I am not an executive of the company; I am a non-executive.  We ensure that money is looked after responsibly and appropriately.</p></speech>

How many business loans were taken out or applied for by Permanent TSB last year?  How many were granted and how many refused?  How many mortgages does the bank have on its loan book?  What percentage of those have been distressed for a period of more than three months?</p></speech>

The bank currently has around 174,000 mortgages.  At the moment, around 20% of what we would call the residential book is in some form of arrears.  Over one third of the other big chunk of mortgages, which is residential investment properties, is also in some form of arrears.</p></speech>

Is there anything at all that differentiates what the public interest directors do compared to the other directors of the company?

There have been many occasions, however, when we would do our utmost to reflect the public interest.  There is no doubt that other directors, generally speaking, would do the same.  As Ms Hayes has said, there are occasions where we put our point very strongly.  We cannot dictate and we have to end up having a consensus view in relation to any policy matter.  Generally speaking, non-executive company directors are there to formulate policy, have it implemented and control it as it is being implemented.  That is our role.  It does not differ from other non-executive directors on the board.</p></speech>

Citizens would expect, however, that such directors would be more visible and be seen to be openly defending the public interest.  Mr. MacSharry hit the core point in his opening remarks - that he has the same legal and fiduciary responsibilities as the other directors.  That is the position under company law.  While it was a good idea to have people appointed under the umbrella of being in the public interest, it is a flaw that a proper structure was not put on that.  Some channel should have been put in place so that public interest directors could express their views, thus distinguishing themselves from the other directors.  That is the key issue.</p></speech>

The 2010 Act probably saw little of that.  For all directors now under this Act, the public interest overrides everything else in company law.  That is a good thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012121900006#E00300"><p>After having been on the board for four years, does Mr. MacSharry have any suggestions on how the role of a public interest director can be uniquely defined or improved?  There must be some action that could set a public interest director's position apart from that of the other directors.  The State has put billions of euro into Permanent TSB and the other banks.  Accordingly, people expect the public interest directors to protect the interests of consumers and citizens.  While the directors have legal responsibilities to the company under company law, there must be a distinction between what the public interest director does from what the other directors do.  People do not see that.  Accordingly, the public interest directors have been called before the committee to explain what is different between the two roles.  I am still not clear on the difference.</p></speech>

The system is there and company law governs that system.  If the law were to be changed to enable public interest directors to carry out certain functions, we would be glad to do whatever we would be asked to do under the law.  I understand and appreciate fully what the Deputy said about the public not being in a position to know what any of the directors are doing other than when the chairman takes that responsibility at the annual general meeting or when communications with the Minister or the shareholders are done by the chairman and the chief executive officer over the Central Bank, the European Central Bank or the troika.</p></speech>

Junior bondholders who suffered losses because of such an exercise in IBRC, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, have taken a successful case in the UK.  It has been appealed by IBRC and will be taken in the new year.  Is there any threat coming down the tracks to Permanent TSB by bondholders who have suffered similar losses?</p></speech>

A restructuring is in place and there is the core business of providing mortgage lending.  It is important that this business would be retained and developed, as well as providing more competition in the banking sector.  Obviously, the bank is downsizing, has lost many staff and the directors are dealing with past mistakes.  How does Mr. MacSharry see the bank developing in the future?</p></speech>

We believe great progress has been made since we concentrated on this asset management unit.  There is no doubt that there is also an improvement in relationships with customers.  The good bank can then survive and become a competitive force.  We only have two banks.  Things will improve again.  It is important to put on the record that while there are many arrears and that it is a worrying and challenging time for banks and institutions to survive as well as for the customers in arrears, the fact of the matter is that up to 80% of residential mortgage holders are paying their mortgages.  In these cases there are no arrears and they are performing loans.  This must be remembered.  We speak about differential treatment between one borrower and another.  It must be remembered up to 80% are paying their loans, honouring their commitments, paying their debts.</p></speech>

How regularly does the board deal with this issue?  What reports does it receive as to how the bank is dealing with mortgage arrears?  Permanent TSB's arrears rate is higher than the average which is a concern as this is a core element of the bank's business.  There is a frustration among borrowers that the situation is not being dealt with.  The personal insolvency regime will be up and running in the next several months.  Hopefully, this will incentivise the banks to deal with cases that have to be clearly dealt with.  What level of involvement do the public interest directors have at board level in dealing with mortgage arrears?</p></speech>

Mr. Jeremy Masding became chief executive officer in February and, since he took up office, his main priority from the board is to work out a strategy for dealing with our arrears issues.  Using the MARS, the mortgage arrears resolution strategy, process which was developed for the whole banking sector by the Central Bank, we are developing several processes in the bank to improve management information, frequency of management, segmentation of the loan book as well as the whole menu of treatments which have come out of the MARS which in our case will number 14.</p><p>  Since February, we have ratcheted up the degree of reportage.  Accordingly, at this point we are getting quite detailed reports at board level every single month not just a progress on the flow of arrears, but on what is happening to stop arrears.  We are now beginning to roll out individual treatments across the full back and front loan books.</p></speech>

It is to be welcomed that the standard variable rate being charged has come down.  The bank was once a significant outlier in this regard and was charging customers way in excess of what the other banks were charging.  I feel very sorry for customers on a variable rate paying 4% to 4.5% when someone on a tracker is only paying 1.5% or 1.75%.  That makes an enormous difference to the monthly repayment.  Where is it going for variable rate customers over the next 12 months?  The link between European Central Bank rates and variable rates has long since been broken.  The bank is obviously making decisions based on the cost of funding.  Mr. MacSharry outlined the blended funding structure the bank has in place.  Where will that go for those mortgage holders who are being charged well in excess of 4% for a variable mortgage?</p></speech>

He mentioned not just the blended cost, but operational expenditure, contributions to impairments and meeting the cost of impairments.  We are working assiduously on the operation expenditure side.  Any reductions in this area will ultimately go towards giving the bank greater scope around interest rate reductions.</p></speech>

I am confident about operational expenditure and we may also make inroads on impairments and improving the position with regard to arrears.  Those are the areas over which we have most control.  Sourcing broader funding and the cost thereof is something we will have to manage.</p></speech>

The core issues have been raised by the Chairman and Deputy Michael McGrath and answered by Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes, who I welcome to the joint committee and thank for their outline submissions.  All directors are equally bound by company law and corporate governance requirements.  Both witnesses explained themselves as non-executive directors as opposed to public interest directors.  They explained that they rule by consensus and it could be said their loyalty is to the board.  They have been captured by the prevailing culture of the institution.  There is no difference between one director and another.  There is no distinguishing requirement.  Perhaps there is a flaw.  Everyone has asserted they are new appointments since the downfall.  I do not mean this disrespectfully but a large segment of the public sees the public interest directors as being about as useful as paps on a bull.  That is the situation, being honest.  I hand over to Deputy O'Donnell.</p></speech>

The public is looking at the public interest directors and noting that &euro;2 million has been spent on them to date in the covered institutions.  Nearly &euro;400,000 has been spent on their fees.  The public is asking if it is getting value for money.  They are not aware of what exactly the public interest directors do and they want to know.  I looked through the legislation.  The 2008 Act provided for the appointment of public interest directors and persons to observe all meetings.  Mr. MacSharry is correct that the 2010 Act provides for the public interest in section 48.  Section 48(3) provides that the Minister may make and publish guidelines on the duty imposed on a public interest director and a director may rely on any such guideline to demonstrate his or her compliance with such duty.  Mr. MacSharry is a former Minister for Finance and EU Commissioner.  Ms Hayes is very familiar to us as a former Secretary General.  They are experienced.  Were they surprised that guidelines were not issued to public interest directors following the enactment of the 2010 Act?</p></speech>

Remember, we are non-executive directors.</p></speech>

They have a specific purpose which is to protect the public interest.  The other non-executive directors have a different role.  At the time of their appointment in 2008, Permanent TSB had yet to receive any taxpayers' money directly although it was covered by the State guarantee.  The circumstances were different.  The public interest directors have been in place for four years.  How can I tell taxpayers that they are getting value for money from the appointment of public interest directors in general and more specifically from the &euro;390,000 in salaries which has been paid to the directors?</p></speech>

There is no difference between them and all directors are subject to the requirements of company law.  When and if the Oireachtas changes company law, the directors will be guided by whatever it then provides.  Currently, all the requirements of company law must be observed by all directors, including public interest directors.  I repeat all directors get the same salary.</p></speech>

We all know there has been a great deal of reporting on the amount of money that has been injected into this institution - &euro;4 billion since 2009 - but there has been widespread reporting of the financial cliff the bank faces early next year in respect of &euro;2.7 billion worth of bonds that are due to mature.  Can the witnesses say whether these bonds are guaranteed and whether they are secured?  We know the institution is trying to dispose of assets, which it is doing at a loss because it is a fire sale to recoup money to ensure that these bonds will be paid out.  I believe the second payment of this tranche of &euro;2.7 billion is due in April.  If the bank is not successful, will there be a need for an additional capital investment from the Irish taxpayer through the Minister for Finance?  What is being done to ensure the burden does not fall on the taxpayer again?</p></speech>

If I had been asked that question six months ago, I would have said we were not doing enough.  We have set up the asset management unit this year.  It is up and running.  Hundreds of people are dealing with thousands of calls every day and are in contact many times with different shareholders.  We have resolved the contacts and connections.  We still have problems with the bank.  We have set up procedures whereby in any discussion with a shareholder who is in arrears or is going into arrears, management will offer the shareholder different options.</p></speech>

They want the banks to write off the debts of people who simply will not at this point in time or at any time in the future be able to repay their mortgages in full.  Has the bank done so thus far and does it have plans in place to write off parts of mortgages for mortgage holders?</p></speech>

Mr. MacSharry is obviously aware of fact that, following the stress test, money was allocated by Irish taxpayers to the institutions to meet mortgage losses on their books.

We have put in place a detailed mortgage resolution process which involves engagement with customers, taking them through a menu of options to see what is the most suitable in terms of allowing them to remain in their homes.  We accept that at the end of the day, it probably will not be possible for everybody to remain in his or her home, while some may not want to remain in their homes.  As explained by Mr. Masding, there will come a point at which a call will have to be made, using the insolvency legislation and his own judgment, as to what is in the best interest of the bank and the customer.  At the end of that process there will inevitably be write-down in cases in which the customer is clearly unable to pay.</p></speech>

I am going to move on because my time is limited.  There has been much discussion in this committee about the role of public interest directors, the appointment of which Sinn F&eacute;in believes was a token gesture and a farce.  The idea was that there would be people on the boards of directors of the banks who would not be allowed to act in the public interest but would be public interest directors.  Mr. MacSharry and everyone else here know that under the stabilisation Act every director must act in the public interest and must protect the taxpayer.  The late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, said he would consult with the Opposition parties on the possible candidates for appointment as public interest directors.  He did not consult with Sinn F&eacute;in on this matter.  Those appointed include three former assistant secretaries of Departments and four former Ministers, including two former T&aacute;naist&iacute; from across the political divide.</p><p>  I want to put the following on record.  During the past five years, Ms Hayes and Mr. MacSharry received &euro;271,000 and &euro;239,000, respectively, by way of remuneration as public interest directors.  During that same period Mr. MacSharry, as a former Minister, received &euro;445,000.  He is also a former EU Commissioner and Governor of the Central Bank.  I do not know what salaries he may have received in that regard.  Ms Hayes also serves as chairperson and as a member of other public boards.  Perhaps they would spell out for the committee the total remuneration package they have received from the public purse.</p><p>  Mr. MacSharry said that his task is to help challenge the culture which has so clearly taken over the boardrooms of our financial institutions.  Was Mr. MacSharry ever a non-executive member of the Bank of Ireland?</p></speech>

He was part of the culture which he has told this committee he is trying to wipe out.  Mr. MacSharry was a non-executive member of the board of Bank of Ireland for 12 years.  While the crash happened in 2007, the damage was done at the time Mr. MacSharry was a non-executive member.  Does Mr. MacSharry believe he is fit to serve as a public interest director for a bank into which the State has put another &euro;4 billion and in respect of which we pay him fees of &euro;239,000, given his previous involvement at that bank and the damage it and others have caused Irish society and the economy?</p></speech>

I was a non-executive director of Bank of Ireland until February 2005.  If the Deputy looks back at what happened he will find that the greatest difficulties occurred after 2005.  There is no question about that.  The Deputy can check the figures.  I am satisfied to act in the public interest as I have been doing on the board of Irish Life and Permanent for the past four years and in Permanent TSB for the past number of months.  We do act in the public interest.  Headlines about fees received by former Ministers or directors general of Departments aside, the fact is that we are getting no more and no less than any other director on any of the covered banks.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

I quote:<blockquote><br />Public Interest Directors bring in addition to other experiences, a civic mindedness and a sense of what is in the public interest and this experience will inform their sense of what is in the covered institutions' interests.  To a great extent the public interest and the covered institutions' interests are likely to coincide.  A solvent, liquid, low-risk, prudentially run, profitable company which is a going-concern and which has the confidence of its stakeholders is as much in the public interest as it is in the interests of the institutions.</blockquote>I can honestly say that Mr. MacSharry and I have pursued those objectives since our appointment to the board.</p></speech>

The other directors are human beings and have common interests.  We are governed by company law and take into account the institution when reaching decisions in the difficult and perilous situation in which banks have found themselves in recent times.  Challenging times still exist and will for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

I come as an individual with 26 years experience in the public sector, working full time in the service of the public.  That has certainly informed the perspective I bring to things.  Let me emphasise that section 48 effectively makes every director on the board of Permanent TSB a public interest director.  They are obliged to have regard - in fact, the overriding concern in all decisions - is the public interest and has been since the enactment of that legislation.  It is extremely difficult for us to distinguish what would have been different if we had not been there because we are all working collectively towards the one objective.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses think the public would find that a bit troubling in terms of the witnesses' role, how they perceive that role, how they view the public interest and their interest in the wider economy?  However, when they attend board meeting, there is a level of consensus between what the witnesses think and what other bank directors think in terms of decision making.</p></speech>

Mr. MacSharry states that 80% of mortgages are performing loans.  However, most ordinary members of the public who are looking to him to battle on their behalf would look at that statistic and wonder that the 80% contains mortgages in serious negative equity which can be repaid, but could hardly be described as performing.  I can only imagine the difficulties that the remaining 20% of borrowers are in.</p></speech>

People who are meeting their commitments may find that in time due to reasons such as unemployment, increased taxes or cuts in wages they fall into arrears but now the management have set up the structures to ensure that there will be full consideration given to their position and the best deal that can be worked out for them so that they can continue to stay in their home.  The last thing we want to see is anybody being faced with repossession.  When the chief executive appeared before the committee he stated there were 300 repossessions, 200 of which were voluntary.  We do not want voluntary repossession, we want to see whether we can work on behalf of the company and the individual borrower.  That is our intention.  It must be in the public interest.</p></speech>

If I owe the Deputy &euro;100 and I can only pay him &euro;80, I will have to write off &euro;20.  We are not going to do that.  On the other hand, if I owe the Deputy &euro;100 and I can give him &euro;80 and in six months or a year, or two year, I give him &euro;10 more and in 20 years I cannot give him the last &euro;10, then that might be written off, but not until then.  That is the way the system works.  It is the only fair way in the context of treating all borrowers equally.</p></speech>

There is legislation which specifically addresses the differences in terms of the role of public interest directors and which critically gives them the authority to over-ride their other responsibilities in the public interest.

He stated in the House some time ago that, to assist in addressing the scope for action and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of all directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where institutions were in receipt of huge financial support from the State, section 48 of the 2010 Act provided legal clarity not just for the role of the public interest director but for that of the entire board of such institutions.  It provides unequivocally that the over-riding duty of all directors of the covered institutions, irrespective of the circumstances of appointment, relates to the public interest as set out in that Act.  Therefore, in truth - if the Deputy wishes to use the phrase - all directors are public interest directors.</p></speech>

Details of individual public interest directors, including remuneration, are published in the annual reports.  The general rule is that directors, including non-executive directors, owe their duties to the company."  Therefore, we operate by company law.  The Minister further said: "The interests of the company are paramount.  Public interest directors bring, in addition to other experiences...," and so on, as stated by Ms Hayes.</p></speech>

I will stay with the issue because this is very important.  I accept what Mr. MacSharry has read which goes on to state, "To address the scope for actual and perceived conflict..."  Let us think carefully about what the Minister said.  He said one's responsibility was to the institution.  However, for public interest directors, there is the potential for actual conflict.  In such a case one's over-riding duty is to the public interest.  That is very clear, but that is not what has been represented.  The delegates are not bound solely and exclusively by company law.  One can over-ride company law, as laid out in the legislation and as stated in the narrative provided in the Minister's answer, in the public interest.  It is important we understand the scope the delegates have.</p></speech>

This is important because it is a nice gateway to the next issue I wish to raise.  I wish to continue on an issue raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  As the delegates will see on the screen, the Personal Insolvency Bill is making its way through its Final Stages and we will vote on it this evening.  I regret that I will vote against it, having supported the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, the whole way through.  One of the reasons I have decided to vote against it - I made the decision today - is that Mr. Richie Boucher said yesterday that within the context of the personal insolvency legislation there would be no debt forgiveness.  Mr. MacSharry has also said there will be no debt forgiveness.  We will not be writing off any debt.  I appreciate the semantics between writing off debt and debt forgiveness and know no insult was intended.  As I find the phrase "debt forgiveness" insulting, I would like to use the phrase "debt surrender".  </p><p>  Let us take an example, which I find it is usually the best way to clarify these issues.</p></speech>

As a non-executive director of the board and not an executive of it, I am not fully sure of what policies might or might not be developed by an executive that may or may not come to the board for approval at some stage.  These things happen all the time with executive teams.  We are talking about the position as of now.  I know legislation is going through the Oireachtas at the moment and I know it is to help those unfortunates who are in great difficulty with their mortgages, whether they be in negative equity or whatever.  The fact of the matter is that in so far as Permanent TSB is concerned, it will deal with that legislation  It will be the law and it will deal with it accordingly.  In so far as individual cases are concerned, as of now without that legislation being in place, our team is dealing with customers in arrears and difficulties on an hourly basis every day.</p></speech>

As a public interest director. he might answer, as might Ms Hayes, in respect of that example an individual who borrowed &euro;400,000, can service a mortgage of &euro;250,000 and her personal insolvency professional recommends that it be &euro;250,000 and recommends that Permanent TSB brings down or surrenders &euro;150,000 of the debt, and all legal hold on that, for her.  Is that Mr. MacSharry understanding in this respect and is that what he, as a public interest director, would represent Permanent TSB should do in this case?</p></speech>

In consulting, in which I spent several years, there is a phrase used and whenever we sent a team to a client we were always afraid that they would go native and by that I mean that they would forget what their job was and would become part of the client they had gone into see.  I say this with the greatest respect for both of witnesses' long careers of public service, but in my opinion, based on what I have heard, essentially in response to Deputy Doherty's questioning, it seems both witnesses have gone native.  I say that with the greatest respect for their many years of public service.  The language I heard, particularly from Mr. MacSharry and particularly with regard to the Personal Insolvency Bill, is not in the public interest; it is in the interests of the banks, and I say that regrettably and with respect.  That is certainly my conviction.</p></speech>

There is nobody around more than I who would love to see the kind of questions the Deputy is asking being answered in the positive but somebody somewhere, the taxpayer probably, is going to have to put up money - in addition to what already has been put in - if that has to be done.  I would love to be in a position to say to the Deputy that is going to happen but first of all I am not an executive of the company, I am a non-executive director with the role of approving of not approving policies  brought forward by the executive with my vote, if it is required, or my consensus.  I will continue to play that role but in the public interest I personally would love to see everybody who is in arrears tonight find a windfall before Christmas and have their arrears wiped out but that is not the real world.  We have to live in the real world under company law.</p></speech>

I had an enormous sense of unreality about this for the first hour of this conversation.  If the witnesses saw the film "Truman", it was like that, a weightless unreality.  The language of the opening remarks was so similar that I had a sense that the same author wrote both papers in that they were in committee language.  I wish this conversation could have kicked off in ordinary English, as we would use with our families around the dinner table.  They should get robust.  The witnesses are directors appointed in the public interest.  I am not going to go into the semantics of it but I am glad Deputies Doherty and Donnelly asked the questions that they did.</p><p>  When the witnesses came on board at the end of 2008, the board of the group had a chairperson who had come from a totally different sector than either insurance or banking.  There were other directors who were part of the establishment director club, as David McWilliams or somebody else might call it.  There was complacency and stale air around the boards of banks and financial institutions.  The bank did not even know how the crash had occurred.  It had the highest loans to deposit ratio in the euro area, it was extraordinary, and it did not know how it got there.  The excuse was that it was a mixture of an insurer and a bank and to that extent one could not apply prudential architecture tests to the balance sheet of the bank.  Of course, one could.  The question that arises at the top of one's fingertips is what is size of the balance sheet?  What is it currently?</p></speech>

It is in the public interest both in terms of the economy and for them as members of the public, that they get relief which should require debt write-down.  The moral hazard for most of the public is that the banks who caused the crisis are the ones who get bailed out across the board.  All the banks get bailed out but the mortgage holders, who are the innocent victims, do not.</p></speech>

If we identify the bubble period - and it is not hard to identify it, between about 2002 and 2008 - that group of people, whether or not they are in mortgage distress now, or whether they are in negative equity - which is also a form of distress, although not as bad as being in arrears - are unique.  They are in trouble through no fault of their own.  We could quantify how much would be required to write-down their debts to sustainable levels, so they can start to pay and be treated as normal customers from that point.

In their earlier contributions, Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes made much play of the fact that on a number of occasions since their original appointment as public interest directors, they have been re-elected.  At such annual general meetings over 90% of the voting rights are controlled by the State.  In terms of their re-election on each of those occasions, what level of support did they command from the 8% of voting rights not controlled by the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that for four of those elections the State was not a 99.2% owner.  It is only the last time when the Minister asked us.  In fact, our term was up last year and we expected to be leaving after three years.  Yet we were asked to stay on and were elected, including by the vote of the shareholder - i.e. the State and the Minister.  Prior to that on the other three occasions we did not have the Minister as a shareholder.</p></speech>

I have listened to a number of the other contributions and there is a view that the public interest is reflected by those who are in mortgage difficulty or by those who see the institution as an investment by the taxpayer who wants a return.  Do Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes feel that the failure to define "public interest" has put them in a very invidious position?  In effect, the title of public interest director means they are window dressing.  Under company law - and they have to operate in that context primarily - they are no different to any other directors.  Do they believe that they have been put in a most invidious position, trying to serve multiple masters, while in effect having to operate under company law?  The latter makes their loyalty primarily to the company.</p><p>  I was interested when the witness read out the late Brian Lenihan's definition of public interest directors.  He mentioned a profitable company, among other things.  If the loyalty of the public interest directors is to creating a profitable company, one could argue that that could only be done at the expense of many of those who are clients of the company and are now in mortgage arrears.  Those who hold non-tracker mortgages are being asked to subsidise the bank's loss-making tracker book.  Do the witnesses not believe that the failure to define "public interest" has left them in a very difficult position?</p></speech>

In the context of what the Deputy has said, a solvent, liquid, low-risk, prudentially run, profitable company, which is a going concern and has the confidence of its stakeholders, is as much in the public interest as it is in the interests of the institution.  That was the Minister's response to a question.</p></speech>

Mr. MacSharry has articulated his obligations under company law.  It is only fair to say that given what happened in the financial institutions and the consequences for the public, the public has a view to have its interests protected against those of the banks.  Mr. MacSharry should be aware that his sense of partnership with the company is not shared by the general public.</p></speech>

It may not be easy to do so in the banks in which it has a minority shareholding such as the Bank of Ireland.  However, in the other two institutions it can have tremendous influence.</p></speech>

Can he explain that there is a fundamental issue of justice for the victims of that gouging as well as an important economic argument to the effect that the crisis in the economy could be addressed if mortgages were written down to reflect current property values, thereby releasing the significant funds tied up in monthly repayments by ordinary households to stimulate domestic demand?  That is the logic of why we seek this calculation.  I put it to the witnesses that as a nationalised institution, Permanent TSB should have an ethos which is entirely different from a capitalist institution in the financial markets.  Has any dynamic thinking of the kind I have outlined been considered for the real public good in the boardroom of Permanent TSB?</p></speech>

It should not be a case of waiting on the never never.  It should be realistic and get an idea of the new capital requirement and he should ask that the Minister would put the case to the euro system that we need further capital for that bank to do the very things that Deputy Higgins mentioned, to get the indigenous economy going again with money in households and businesses.  There are plenty of businesses with legacy debts that are smothering their otherwise viable activities.  There is a mountain of debt write-down needed at euro system level in two forms, namely, IBRC and the promissory notes should be torn up and the ELA should be cancelled.  A total approaching &euro;30 billion is needed for the survivor banks.</p></speech>

I have an idea of the problems in the arena and of the problems that have occurred in arrears in mortgages and in the financial world in the past five years.  There are many suggestions as to how they might be resolved.  This recession is going on longer.  Things would have been much better if after three years we could see the bottom and a bit of a lift.  It is not coming anywhere which makes it more difficult for everybody, governments, banks and the community at large.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Mathews's comment about a write-off in Europe it is the same as debt forgiveness here.  If they will not do that in Europe maybe we should ask another question, let us have a particular bond for &euro;40 billion or &euro;50 billion over the next 50 or 60 years and an interest that is viable for us.  That is the best way to help this economy for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

In bringing this afternoon's module to a conclusion I suggest to committee members and others that the committee reserve its final views on the situation and make its recommendations after we have dealt with the individual banks and their public interest directors.</p><p>  It has, however, become emphatically clear that despite the legislation stating that the duty of the public interest directors is owed to the Minister on behalf of the State, the role does take priority over the other duty of the directors and that there was an intention under the initial legislation that some sort of guidelines or terms of reference would be issued but never were.  We have confirmed that this afternoon.  Mr. MacSharry has proposed that the committee should make a recommendation on whether the public interest directors should continue into the future.  It is his position that they be rotated or rolled over from time to time.</p></speech>

The aim of the committee's examination is to prepare and publish a report on the strategy of and response by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the economic crisis, the Department's new responsibility for trade promotion and the role of trade promotion in economic recovery as outlined in the programme for Government.  The committee will examine the performance of the Department in these respects.  It commenced the process earlier this year with the formal adoption of a scoping document.  We have discussed the issues involved with senior officials of the Department.  We have also held meetings with the main State agencies involved in trade and investment.  A committee delegation held 30 trade-related meetings in three cities in the United States during June.  The committee also heard the views of the private sector from IBEC and the Irish Exporters Association.  It also intends to examine the way in which the visa system supports or inhibits trade promotion and meet organisations on the promotion of agricultural exports.  It intends to have meetings with other trade organisations and chambers of commerce during 2013.</p><p>  The purpose of this meeting is to examine the issue of trade with the Arab world.  A number of Arab countries have embassies in Ireland, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  Last year I visited Qatar where I met Irish business people operating there.  I was struck by their level of optimism about the possible benefits for Ireland from trade and inward investment from the Gulf region.  We met many engineers involved in the construction sector there and noted the existence of a Qatari-Irish business forum.  There may be similar fora in other Gulf states.  There are opportunities in the United Arab Emirates.  Etihad Airways operates 17 weekly flights from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  There has been a significant change in the relationship between Ireland and the Arab world and in our view there are significant opportunities for Ireland to improve its trade with these countries.</p><p>  We are joined by Mr. Louis Maguire whom I met earlier this year at the Joint Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce function in Dublin.  I was very impressed by this organisation.  Mr. Maguire is also the honorary consul of Tunisia.  I have no doubt that with his knowledge and experience of the Arab world he will offer a very interesting perspective on how Ireland can make the most of the opportunities in the region.  </p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he or she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Maguire.  I think members will be very interested in his presentation on the strong relationships between the Arab world and Ireland on which it is hoped to build.</p></speech>

I heard somebody boast recently that the value of our exports to the Middle East was &euro;3 billion last year.  I regard that as scratching the surface.  There are approximately 400 million Arabs in various countries in the Middle East.  The first point I will make is that every Irish company, regardless of what it has to offer, is welcome in the Middle East.  As I said at the function to which the Chairman referred, the Irish are more welcome in the Middle East than they are in any other part of the world.  In terms of trade promotion, we concentrate on Europe, which is an important market, but I recall that when I went to the Middle East in the early days there was no trade between Ireland and that region because there was an incorrect perception in some countries that Ireland was part of Britain, which stemmed from the occupation of the Six Counties.  I had to first clear the air by reassuring people that this was not the case and that we had our own Republic.  Once they heard that they all wanted to deal with Ireland.  I have been going to the Arab world on a regular basis a few times a year for the past 40 years; I first went there in 1972.</p><p>  There are many things that are right and many that are wrong in our country.  One issue about which I bitterly complain is that of access to visas.  For Arabs, whether they be dignitaries or people who want to work here or come here on holiday, obtaining a visa is an awful problem.  For example, if one was living in Tunisia and wanted to travel to Ireland, one would have to get a visa from our ambassador in Madrid.  Nobody in Tunisia is aware of that, and they must be advised of it.  We now have a consul in Tunisia, but that visa process is ridiculous.  Such an individual could possibly get a visa on arrival in Britain.  Addressing the processing of visas is one area to be examined if we are interested in expanding tourism.  </p><p>  A delegation from the Saudi Arabia tourist organisation visited here in 2010.  Many people might not think there is such an organisation in Saudi Arabia but there is.  That delegation was here for three days.  The members of it approached me on arrival and I met them.  They wanted to meet people in authority.  I will not pull any punches in saying that I contacted the Minister's office, but the Minister was not available to see them.  The Minister's secretary suggested I contact Tourism Ireland, which I did.  I asked whether these people could meet somebody in the organisation but there was nobody available to meet them for the two or three days they were here.  I then asked if Tourism Ireland could at least put a package together and send it to the Shelbourne Hotel where the delegation was saying, which it did.  I received a telephone call about a fortnight later from somebody in Abu Dhabi advising that he or she was looking after Tourism Ireland for Saudi Arabia.  If the committee members want to confuse me, tell me something like that - how somebody in Abu Dhabi could be looking after tourism for Ireland is beyond me.  I do not want to concentrate totally on tourism but I know the importance of the industry to every country.  It was very important to us in the past and we have lost a bit of it.  We as a nation are noted for going on holidays abroad and while our people travel all over the world, they mostly go to Spain and France and such countries.  There are beautiful tourist resorts throughout the Middle East.  One could have a lovely holiday in Morocco, Tunisia or Dubai at a much more reasonable price than one might imagine and there is no excuse for people not to travel there now that there are 17 flights a week, although they are mostly to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  It is time we opened up flights to countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, where there are great tourism opportunities, and I believe they would reciprocate by sending their people here.</p></speech>

It is up to us to make sure our airline runs flights there.</p><p>  Trade with the Middle East has been very important to the Irish economy.  We have three ambassadors in the Middle East.  Some are accredited to other countries, but that arrangement does not really work.  There are simple solutions to all of this.  Ambassadors are extremely important for business.  When I first went to the Middle East I went to Libya, Lebanon and Iraq.  I remember that the Iraqi ambassador in London at that time wanted me to go to Iraq and said he would set up appointments for me.  Not only did he set up appointments; he made appointments for me to meet every minister in the cabinet at different times.  I saw every one of them, and that was the start of Iraqi trade with Ireland.  If somebody as humble as me could help start trade, what could the Government achieve if Deputies and Senators were to go there?  In 1973, at the request of the Iraqi authorities, I brought a delegation of parliamentarians from the three major parties to Iraq and it was a very successful trip.  It was so successful that the following year Libya hitched onto the trade mission and I brought a delegation of parliamentarians to that country also.  The success of those missions was evident in those days.  I do not want to bore anyone with statistics but we are missing the boat in terms of trade and tourism and unless matters are rectified, things will not improve.</p><p>  If members have any questions I will do my best to answer them.</p></speech>

I know from reading material over the years that he has been active in promoting this country in areas in which there has been potential for increased trade.  The Chairman referred to the Moroccan ambassador, whom I have got to know during the past few years.  He has been very active in this country.  I had some interaction with him during the term of the previous Government regarding the equestrian area.  We met groups that were over here at the time.  Mr. Maguire referred to tourism and the fact that a delegation from Saudi Arabia was not met by either officials from the Department or those from Tourism Ireland.  That is not acceptable in any day and age.  Irrespective of whether we are in good times or in the midst of a recession, people deserve to be met.  Irrespective of whatever can arise from such meetings, it is important that such people are met.</p><p>  Mr. Maguire mentioned that we have three ambassadors covering the Middle East region.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that our diplomatic network has done us proud as a country over the years.  Our diplomats, ambassadors and support staff punch above the weight of the country in providing public representatives and officials on trade missions with access to decision makers in those countries.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and his Department would love to have a greater network of embassies and consulates, but that is not easy in the current circumstances.</p></speech>

For example, during a recent meeting with the Algerian ambassador in London, he suggested that Ireland should open a trade office in Algeria and he would reciprocate by opening a trade office in Dublin.  He told me that while he was aware things were not 100% in Ireland, one person could run such an office and there would at least be someone on the ground who could keep people here advised.  Morocco is another place with which our trade is improving and there is vast potential there, as is the case in Tunisia as well.  Libya is coming back.  While we had great trade with Libya up to last year, it died off for a while, but I am glad to state it is back again.  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that Ireland cannot afford to have embassies in every country, but surely we can afford to have a one-person trade office.  If we cannot afford that, we may as well pull down the curtains.</p></speech>

The worst thing that could happen would be for the embassy from which one sought a visa to be located in a country of which one's own country was a former colony.  I can envisage all sorts of difficulties arising, depending on where one was obliged to apply for a visa.  For example, in the case of Madrid, the Spanish state formerly had colonies in parts of the Arab world, which would send the wrong signal as one would almost be going down the same path.  On foot of the budget, the amount of money available for this area is being cut back by approximately 2%.  This does not simply pertain to the Arab world, as one could make the same comparison regarding difficulties in the United States.  For instance, with regard to Silicon Valley, 40% of trade between the United States and Ireland comes from one particular region and the argument would be that one must increase the number of staff located there.  During the aforementioned Question Time exchanges with the T&aacute;naiste, we noted that in the course of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Government intends to recall a large number of staff at a time when it would be desirable for exports to be increasing, not decreasing, given the problems with the local economy.  While attempts are being made to save money by bringing back staff, in the long term we probably are losing out.  If running the six-month Presidency results in a drop-off of trade with these countries, it will be a major difficulty.  While this is probably a policy decision that must be made, I seek Mr. Maguire's views in this regard.</p><p>  Mr. Maguire made reference to the barriers posed by visas, but what other barriers exist in respect of trade?  Are there difficulties with Irish entrepreneurs travelling to that part of the world, in which there clearly are problems?  For example, Mr. Maguire mentioned Libya, where it appears that major difficulties persist on the ground.  There also are difficulties with regard to Bahrain, which members of this joint committee have raised, as well as having discussions on the sectarian nature of that state, in which one religion has clearly been the subject of discrimination.  Do these issues also create problems by constituting barriers to trade?  Moreover, do they form moral barriers to trading with some countries which clearly have bad human rights records?  Mr. Maguire mentioned travelling to Iraq, presumably during the period of Saddam Hussein's rule.  Do regimes, such as that headed by Gaddafi and some of the other dictators in the region, also pose problems?  I note there were problems in the past regarding insurance for products and so on.  For example, there were problems with regard to the transportation of beef.  Do these problems persist today?  What are the main products being exported to the region?  In the main, are they related to food and agribusiness?  Overall, I note the biggest export sector appears to be chemicals and related products.  Is the position similar for this region?  Given the region's instability, could Ireland get favourable status in respect of access to oil and so on?  Has consideration ever been given to putting in place a bartering system with some countries involving food for oil or whatever?</p></speech>

The press tends to blow things out of all proportion.  I have been in the Middle East at times when there have been reports in Ireland of bombings, shootings and so on.  However, it does not always happen.  It happens in certain regions, just as one need not go too far to find shootings taking place in certain regions of one's own country.  However, there are no barriers to Irish goods.  The Deputy mentioned some of the products that Ireland is exporting.  During the 1970s and 1980s, Ireland's main export was beef.  At the time, we sold all our beef to Britain, but when it suddenly received a cheap offer from Argentina it decided to stop buying Irish beef overnight.  This was a serious problem for all farmers throughout the country, and I attended a meeting for which farmers sent their representatives to Dublin.  To give members an idea of how easy it is to overcome a problem, I got on a plane and went to Libya.</p></speech>

Is the Joint Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce propping up those regimes by getting involved in trade with them, or are they being opened up to the idea or prospect of greater democracy, including human rights, in the region by continuing that trade?  That is one of the difficulties involved in trading with some of those countries.  For instance, the Iranian ambassador, when he attended this committee, spoke about the ban being lifted there.  There does not seem to be any credible reason Irish beef should not be exported around the world, but are they live exports?  I know there have been difficulties in the past with that aspect, including how the animals are killed.  Much of the beef in Iran is currently coming from South American countries, but Irish middle-men are bringing it in.  Is there a problem with the financial embargo on trade with Iran?  We all accept there is huge potential but we need to find out what to do as a country in that regard.  Mr. Maguire mentioned ambassadors, but is there more involved than that?  What simple steps could be taken to try to open up that region?</p></speech>

We go there for trade.  I have regularly visited 14 Arab countries over the last 40 years.  As regards human rights, I have never come across anything.  There may be things I do not see - I admit that - but generally speaking the Arab people are peaceful.  They have their own rules, laws and religions, which we must respect.  One does not get involved in that when one is exporting or trying to trade with them.  The Deputy need have no worries on that score.</p></speech>

I concur with the concept of what Mr. Maguire is saying.  We frequently table parliamentary questions to all Departments concerning trade and interaction with African and Middle Eastern countries.  There is great scope for extending business there, particularly as countries develop.  As they progress the scope is much greater.  My colleagues and I have asked various Ministers to try to maximise their contacts with all foreign countries with a view to expanding our business with them and increasing our exports.  In addition, we should encourage their people to come here as tourists, as well as travelling abroad as tourists ourselves.  With no disrespect to my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith, if we all stayed at home there would be no tourism.  We cannot have that either.  We need to avail of every possible opportunity and identify the products that are most likely to gain a marketing foothold in the Middle East.  Mr. Maguire has already pointed out quite a number of those products.  Suffice it to say that we would all concur with that concept.</p><p>  We must have regard to human rights issues also.  It is part and parcel of Government policy to try to ensure that the countries with which we have direct dealings recognise that we would like them to come into line and realise that human rights abuses are no longer acceptable.  We must make progress in that area as well.</p></speech>

I do not know that trade and human rights always go together because human rights can sometimes be ignored when it comes to doing business.  If we said we would trade only with countries that have a perfect human rights record, however, I do not think we would be left trading with anybody.  I would have grave reservations about trading with America, for example, when one sees some of the human rights abuses there.  None the less, we can lead by example.  I hope Irish businessmen are ethical in their approach when signing trade agreements.  There are quite a number of organisations, which I support, that want country-by-country auditing so that taxes are paid in the countries in which they should be paid.  In that way we can try to eliminate tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p><p>  As Mr. Maguire said, there is a potential there, but it is disappointing that it is not being addressed meaningfully.  We should examine a more strategic use of our ambassadors overall. </p><p>  The issues of visas and bureaucracy were raised, but is Mr. Maguire not talking to the people who can advance what he is trying to do?  He said that Irish companies are more welcome in the Arab world than anywhere else, but I wonder why.  Are there particular reasons for that?  I would be interested to hear Mr. Maguire's point of view.</p></speech>

They think they have a lot in common with us.  If one goes back in history, 800 years ago some of the pirates from north Africa and the Arab world sailed up the Bay of Biscay to loot in England and Ireland.  When they got to Ireland they were so impressed that they got rid of their boats and settled down in the west of Ireland.</p></speech>

His contribution during the years has been more than welcomed and, I hope, applauded.</p><p>  I have some difficulty with the concepts articulated.  Mr. Maguire keeps referring to the Arab world.  I still do not have an understanding of what constitutes the Arab world.  There are 20 countries listed.  They might very well be Arab countries, but they are certainly diverse in their own right.  At least eight, if not ten, are in Africa, in respect of which the Government has a strategy.  Is Mr. Maguire familiar with this strategy?  If he has negative comments to make, we would like to hear them.</p><p>  Mr. Maguire hit all of the key issues of concern to the committee.  He raised the visa issue.  We are blue in the face trying to address it.  He also mentioned the lack of embassies in the Arab world and Africa.  Tragically, as he can appreciate, we are closing our embassies.  Three closed recently.  The fact that we have only three ambassadors in the Arab world shows we are under-represented.  We cannot compete with the Norwegians who have three, four or five times that number.</p></speech>

I note that he specialises in the area of commercial, industrial, tourism and financial relations between Arab countries.  I have a couple of questions in that regard.  This is based on ignorance more than on anything else.  What is it about the Arab world and banking?  Is there a particular banking system used in the Arab world that is not quite the same as the western capitalist one and does it prove to be a problem?</p><p>  Of the countries listed, we do remarkably well in Oman, for example.  We are developing great relationships with many of these Arab countries in terms of the provision of educational facilities.  Students from these countries come to Ireland to undertake their educational training.  In fact, I understand the Omanis will have a marching band in the next St. Patrick's Day parade, which is a sign of how well we are bonding.  There are many Saudi Arabian students here whom I meet on a regular basis.  There have also been unsurpassed developments in such a short period of time in the case of the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>  Mr Maguire has pointed out that we are doing a lot of good with the Arab world, with which we have an interesting bond.  We bond well with the Arabs.  It probably has to do with our history.  I personally thank Mr. Maguire for his life-long involvement in developing relationships because in days past matters would have been different.  I wish him the best of luck in his ongoing work and congratulate the 12 Arab members of the board.</p></speech>

For instance, the Maghreb - Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria - is in north Africa, but these are Arab countries.  The Deputy is correct in one way, but the people of these countries prefer to be called Arabs.</p><p>  As regards banking, from our point of view there is no problem in getting paid, if that is what the Deputy is worried about.  For exporters, the banking system is first class.  As a matter of fact, in parts of the Arab world the banking system was set up by a group which had offices on the north side on the city, the name of which I forget.  It did very well and made a fortune in providing a banking system in the Middle East where I used meet its representatives at the time.  </p><p>  Are there other points the Deputy wishes to cover?</p></speech>

My colleague is correct in that we had a restrictive regime in place.  For a while I was involved in trying to open up the visa regime between Ireland and China and Asia generally.  The Government has made it much easier, for instance, for Chinese people to get visas.  That happened largely as a result of a concentrated and targeted campaign conducted by interests in Ireland, including, for instance, the language schools which operate a big business, particularly involving students from China, and also tour operators which are trying to bring groups into Ireland but which are finding it almost impossible to get visa.  One had to travel thousands of miles in order to a get visa, which was nonsense.  In this regard, I think Mr. Maguire is speaking primarily about the north African Arab countries-----</p></speech>

It seems there must be a critical mass, both from a trade and tourism perspective, to secure air connections.  Airlines will operate wherever there is a demand for their services.  Tourism traffic alone will not sustain an airline.  One must also have a demand from the business community.  What about businesses here?  If Mr. Maguire can demonstrate to the Department that there is a loss of business and export opportunities as a result of a regime that makes it difficult to get visas, it would be open to considering the matter.  What is the situation in reverse?  If Irish people want to travel to any of the Arab countries, what is required of them in terms of having a visa?  Are there difficulties in that regard?</p></speech>

Unfortunately I did not hear his initial presentation as I was speaking and voting in the Seanad, and I will have to return to the Chamber to do the same again in a few minutes.  I was here when he made a remark to the effect that we need not concern ourselves about human rights and that he has never seen abuses.  However, they are widespread and they are widely known.  I say this as somebody who voted against the beef deals, including perhaps some that Mr. Maguire helped to negotiate, with Saddam Hussein's Iraq several years ago.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan pointed out, we have to live in a practical and realistic world, but I share her concern about the possible rebalancing of this committee to give greater prominence to trade and downgrade human rights.</p><p>  As one of the only Members to vote against the beef deal, the case of Iraq was instructive to me.  While it was admitted on the Government benches that what I did may have been the moral response, I was asked rhetorically whether Ireland could afford it.  As I am sure Mr. Maguire knows only too well, what actually happened was that war broke out and Saddam Hussein's Government welshed on the payments.  The Irish taxpayer was forced to pick up the bill under the export credit guarantee scheme.  We did the immoral thing and we paid through the nose for it.  I think the amount paid out was approximately &euro;79 million.</p><p>  In respect of Libya, it has emerged in the past week that the British Government has been forced to pay &pound;2.2 million to Mr. Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped by the Americans with the collusion of British intelligence services, taken to Libya and severely tortured.  His family, including his pregnant wife, were also kidnapped and brought to Libya.  They were deeply shocked by this.  To show these defilements of human rights are not uniquely an Arab phenomenon, the head of MI6, who is also a tub-thumping Christian, congratulated the then head of intelligence in Libya on the delivery of the "cargo" and wrote that while "I know I did not pay for the air cargo", British intelligence had ensured a safe arrival.  That is an appalling sentiment to express in regard to human beings who were illegally kidnapped - the Americans used the euphemism of "extraordinary rendition".</p><p>  I am making no differentiation between the Arab world and the Western world because both have been complicit in the violation of human rights.  My function as a member of this committee is to raise these issues.  I have raised violations of human rights by Arab regimes and the Israelis.  I am not interested in Jewish rights, gay rights, women's rights or Palestinian rights; I am interested in human rights.  I understand that people in the business world feel they have to make these contacts and it is difficult to raise ethical issues when this country is in such a parlous state.  This afternoon the Seanad will be discussing the Social Welfare Bill 2012, which makes savage cuts to carers' benefits and other areas.  I hope the Seanad will oppose the Bill and return it to the Government for further consideration.  I understand the difficulty in raising these issues when people are bleeding in our country but if the business is advantageous to others they will be unlikely to reject it if concerns are raised in a polite way and if our ethical position is presented, if we believe in it.  The Islamic countries are usually lacking in diffidence when presenting their views of morality.  We should not be completely tongue-tied.  My concern is for human rights generally and is not directed at Arabs specifically.  I would equally criticise the United States of America for the dehumanising effect of drone attacks, which are horrible.  We would be less than human if we shed this aspect of the committee's work, which I regard as equally important.  If this was only a committee on foreign trade I would not bother to attend its meetings.  I hope I have registered my concerns in a way that is not offensive.</p></speech>

When I went to Iraq in 1973 there was no trade with Ireland.  I met the various ministers who had power to give orders in those days and started trade in 1973.  We traded very well from 1973 until the war broke out in 1988.  Our sales to Iraq increased from nil in 1973 to &pound;800 million in 1988.  We could have lost that on a point of principle, or whatever else one might call it, because of what certain leaders did, but nations cannot be held responsible for that.</p></speech>

I am looking at the business end and he is looking at human rights.  I know where he coming from but I hope he also understands my position.  I am seeking to salvage something for this country.

I am sure he and Senator Norris will agree to differ.  We regard human rights as extremely important, but trade is also extremely important.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan noted, if we took account of human rights all the time we would never trade with anybody.  This committee will continue to monitor human rights and highlight problems where they arise, but it is also important that we sell ourselves to the outside world and particularly the Arab world.  The chamber is doing a good job in this regard and the Arab world is an interesting place with which to trade.  There are clear opportunities in the region.  Several ministerial visits have been made to the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and other countries in the region, and these trade missions will continue.  I understand the Taoiseach has also received several invitations to travel to the Arab world.  I wish Mr. Maguire and his colleagues a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

I thank those attending today for giving of their valuable time and expertise, which is very much appreciated, and for the submissions they supplied to the committee.  I will invite each organisation to make brief opening remarks followed by a question and answer session with members.  This is a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and it has five members.</p><p>  I welcome, from the Cornmarket Project in Wexford, Mr. Paul Delaney and Mr. Paul O'Brien; from Focus Ireland, Ms Joyce Loughnan, chief executive, and Ms Catherine Maher, national director of services; and from Care after Prison, Ms Bernie Grogan, liaison officer.  Members have received submissions and any opening statements received have also been circulated.  We will begin with the Cornmarket Project, after which we will hear from Focus Ireland and then from Care after Prison.</p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this sub-committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Paul Delaney to begin.</p></speech>

The Cornmarket Project was established in 1999 as a multi-agency response to criminality and substance misuse issues in County Wexford.  Each year, the project deals with approximately 250 individual clients with criminality and substance misuse issues, 170 of whom on average are direct referrals from the Probation Service.  The Cornmarket Project receives core funding from the Department of Justice and Equality through the Probation Service, and is under the umbrella of Wexford Local Development, the local development company in County Wexford mandated to deliver rural development, social inclusion and community development programmes on behalf of the Government.</p><p>  The project has an outcome-focused, community-facing and client-centred approach.  The Cornmarket Project's primary goal is to work in collaboration with the Probation Service and other partners to ensure positive behavioural change in medium to high-risk offenders with a concurrent reduction in recidivism.  To this end, the Cornmarket Project adds value to the work of the Probation Service by addressing issues of motivation, problem solving and skill building in offenders to diminish criminal behaviour and enhance resistance to substance misuse.  The methodologies used by the project are underpinned by evidence-based behavioural interventions delivered by trained staff concentrating on enhancing client motivation for successful participation in the rehabilitation and reintegration programmes delivered by the project and for moving offenders towards other suitable external progression routes.</p><p>  Enhancing offender motivation to make positive behavioural change lies at the heart of the work of the Cornmarket Project.  I hope that at the conclusion of this session the committee will be better informed about our change outcome and impact measurement, COAIM, system, which is based on evidence-based intervention techniques for offender programmes which have shown demonstrable effects in other jurisdictions.  The COAIM system uses unique evidence-based algorithms and metrics and was primarily developed to measure, and ultimately enhance, the determination to change in offenders who can very often be low in motivation when first referred.  Research on effective offender rehabilitation interventions suggests many existing programmes target offenders who are already motivated to make positive change.  However, a significant cohort of offenders needs a very structured motivational enhancement programme to enable them to get to this stage.</p><p>  In this regard we know from previous submissions to the committee by the Irish Prison Service that young short-term prisoners have the highest rate of re-offending, and this has also been our experience over the past 14 years.  In accepting this we can also point to a sub-category among this cohort of offenders with little or no motivation to change.  We also suspect that this category of recidivist offender places a significant burden on the State in terms of costs associated with Garda, court, probation and prison services.</p><p>  Tremendous work is being done by organisations working with offenders who are already motivated to make progress but if we do not also concentrate our efforts on those offenders who are harder to work with as they initially lack the motivation to make positive change we are likely to have a mismatch of resources in this area.  This can lead to missed opportunities, particularly with regard to enhancing and maintaining motivation for positive change with this significant cohort of offenders with low motivation to do so.</p><p>  As the committee is aware, an important new Irish research study undertaken jointly by the Probation Service and the CSO was published recently, and was the subject of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday by Mr. Vivian Geiran, the director of the Probation Service.  In this article, Mr. Geiran stated:<blockquote>Clearly, custodial sentences are warranted for those who commit very serious crimes and who represent an ongoing danger to the public.  However, it is extremely difficult to rehabilitate offenders through imprisonment alone.  While prisoners deserve rehabilitative opportunities as well, offender rehabilitation programmes are most effective in reducing risk of reoffending when they are delivered in the community and target key risk factors.</blockquote></p></speech>

Focus Ireland has been working very closely with Seamus Sisk on the implementation of the integrated services management system.  Through that engagement, we were able to form partnerships with the Prison Service, the Probation Service, the HSE and other NGOs with which we work closely.  Initially from 2007 we worked in the Dublin prisons and then had the opportunity to expand to Limerick in 2009 and Cork in 2010.  We are in the process of negotiating starting in the D&oacute;chas Centre prison in 2013.  In the Waterford area we have commenced a project around community service.</p><p>  We are engaging within the prison and outside the prison, which has been a key aspect of our learning and success.  We develop those relationships, develop the trust and continue working with people when they are discharged to help settle them back to have a place they can call home, living independently in the community.  We are dealing with people with high levels of mental health problems and many of them have addiction issues.  There is a cohort of young people who have been in care and have come through the prison system.  Other aspects of our work manifest themselves in what we see in the prison area.  We have worked with several hundred people during the years we have been operating and have learned a great deal.</p><p>  I would like the committee to focus on four things.  The first is the assessment of housing need of people who are admitted into the prison system.  The earlier that assessment can be done the more opportunity it will give us to help preserve any home situation somebody may have so that he or she does not lose that home, especially in the case of those who are in the prison system for a very short period of time.  Focus Ireland is trying to shift much of its emphasis to preventing people from becoming homeless.  Our work in the prisons is very much geared around that and all the outcomes we measure focus on how we prevent people from becoming homeless.</p><p>  In doing that assessment an holistic care plan is prepared by our project worker engaging all the relevant services needed to ensure success upon discharge.  We need more tightening of the planned discharge so that we can manage the release of people back into the community.  It would be very beneficial for us to have more units of supported temporary accommodation.  We have been able to provide some of Focus Ireland's stock of housing in the Dublin and Limerick areas.  Unfortunately we have not yet been able to secure any accommodation in Cork.  We would certainly need more units of supported temporary accommodation where we can manage the release of people from prison so that they do not fall into the homeless system and do not fall back into their old ways.  We can actually start them on a better life for the future.</p><p>  The final thing on which the committee should focus is how these services get funded.  We have been very fortunate to receive some contribution from Pobal's dormant accounts fund over the years.  However, that has all dried up and the ongoing continuation of our work is purely funded by public donations to our organisation.  Having said that, when we measure the outcomes for the people with whom we have worked the number who have remained settled in the community and not re-engaged in the prison system is extremely positive.  Many people, including the prison governors and those in the probation services, have said that the people with whom we are working are of the highest level of need and yet we have had a great success rate in reducing the levels of recidivism.  While what we are doing is not the whole story, it is a contribution to reducing recidivism.  We would be happy to take questions at the appropriate time.</p></speech>

We have had an interesting and informative set of hearings over the past year in which the sub-committee has been in place.  This is our last public hearing before we produce a report at the end of January.  As rapporteur, I am taking careful notes as we go along.  A range of different groups have been before us.  Our terms of reference consider the backdoor strategies to see what is best practice, nationally and internationally, to ensure higher use of non-custodial alternatives to try to reduce recidivism.  We are grateful to the witnesses.</p><p>  My first question is for the Cornmarket group.  The reliance on empirical studies and outcome measurement is impressive.  The group has been in place for a long time.  I am very familiar with Ms Grogan and Care After Prison, which has been very impressive in a short space of time.  The two groups present two different experiences.  In respect of the Cornmarket group, organisations such as this work in specific areas and carry out important and useful work that has tangible outcomes.  Is there any intention to expand the programme beyond Wexford?  Is there a system in place to roll out the best practice that is occurring in pockets throughout the country?  Has an attempt been made to do so at a national level?</p></speech>

They are interested in replicating the system on a pilot basis.  We are in discussions with the group at the moment and we hope to be able to support it to develop a pilot project in the new year.  Our system has been piloted in a project in Ballyfermot.  It is much smaller than the Cornmarket Project but has the same type of clients as its primary group.  These include medium to high risk offenders who are also, in the main, substance misusers.  We have spent the past few years refining the system, developing it, testing it and making sure it delivers in respect of the outcomes.  We are at the stage where we would like to be of assistance in rolling it out further.</p></speech>

Focus Ireland emphasised housing as a key issue, which is also emphasised in the research and by the other groups that have appeared.  The difficulty in accessing accommodation is a key factor in increasing the risk of recidivism on release.  What is the best way to try to roll out a system to ensure a national strategy on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Maher" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU12012121900006#F00200"><p>It is important there is a structure in place to enable people to avoid prison while serving their sentences in managed way.  We are currently finishing an evaluation of our three services and we will have good recommendations stemming from those in line with identifying other avenues for alternatives to prison sentences.  The reason for focusing on that is the overcrowding that is happening in the prisons.  We must address that because overcrowding is the cause of unplanned early release.  If we can address that we can have a way to manage the situation.</p><p>  Currently we operate two programmes, one in Dublin and one in Waterford, in partnership with the Probation Services.  These are community service projects, where people finish off their probation, serve time in the community and are linked in with supervisors from the Probation Services.  It operates on a three to five day programme, where they come in two or three days a week and serve a number of hours, doing work such as gardening and painting and decorating.  That is all managed and supervised by a maintenance team in cooperation with the Probation Service and it is working well.  It has been so successful in Waterford that we have been asked to extend it into another project we have in Ferrybank.  We have a report on that coming out soon and we will pass that to the committee so it can see how successful it has been.</p></speech>

It is very important that a project worker can work in the prison, because it takes time to build up trust with those who are most marginalised and who have had all relationships with family, friends and community break down.  It is very difficult to get them accommodation on discharge because of their past histories.  The more trust we can build while they are in prison, the better.  They can then start preparing for their discharge in a managed way, so there is a full care plan where we can link in all the appropriate services in the community.  It is not just about having a house but having the support that allows someone to then live independently in the community where they know we will continue to provide the service for as long as they need it, most intensively upon discharge, but it could go on for years as they address the issues they have in their lives.</p></speech>

If there could be a system where as soon as someone entered the prison system, they could make contact with us, through prison officers or teachers, so we can start the support and the planning for release from the very first day.  No one would be released then with nowhere to go and unaware of the services available.  In some cases, we work with someone with a release date but something might happen and that person is released a couple of weeks early.  The preparations are in place but the person was released early and the release that was being anticipated does not happen.  It is best if the relationship starts as early as possible in the sentence.</p><p>  We have been invited to meetings where the teachers have a festival of services, with people attending from the colleges and community services, so prisoners can meet them before release.  The prison officers could also be informed of the services available so in their daily interactions with prisoners, they can pass on leaflets or put up posters around the telephones so they are not going out and not knowing where to go.  That is where the highest risk exists, during the first couple of weeks after release, particularly if addiction is an issue.</p></speech>

How could they be targeted?</p></speech>

The best way to do it is on a case by case basis, where the needs and wants of each person for her life are identified and that is followed through with an implementation plan that will bring the woman to where she wants to be so she does not fall into homeless services without thinking about what is happening next.  There would be a plan for each individual but it must be done on a case by case basis that must recognise that not everyone will take the same route.  The big issue is having the right accommodation, if that is a requirement, or if that support is available to the family and the individual.  We must look at how we can prevent this churning of people coming into prison and then coming into homeless services, offending and re-entering prison.</p></speech>

We have done the pre-prison support and then offered outreach key working with them and family support.  At present our work concentrates on supporting the family.  That can be as simple as talking to them about what will happen during a visit.  Like everything, things are less daunting when a person is informed and knows what to expect.  One person we are working with is doing well in his sentence and has looked into educational opportunities.  Straight away he was linked with the ISM and he knew the group would come to see him.  The initial upset about entering prison was helped by providing information.  We are still offering support to his mother.</p></speech>

They are based on best international practice.  The concept is that if we do not address the ten key risk factor areas with offenders, the chances of reducing recidivism are appreciably lower.  One of the target areas we address is attitudes and cognitive style.  We work with offenders who have serious issues about how they interpret their impact on society.  Many are at the stage in which they do not look at the long-term impact of their behaviours.  We use a model called motivational interviewing, which is again highly respected as an intervention methodology in other jurisdictions.  We bring about a shift in negative attitudes and cognitive style as a precursor to working with people towards making positive change.  Another target area is offending behaviour.  The majority of people we work with, some 82%, have already been before the courts.  We work in a targeted way to enhance motivation to change what we call "created discrepancy" to build self-efficacy, not self-esteem, which is another dimension.  Many of the young offenders with whom we deal would not regard themselves of being capable of changing their behaviour.  That might sound strange but that is the reality.  We work to address that.  We also have them engage in pro-social activities.  Many of the clients we work with only become involved with other pro-social groups when they come into the project.  Many have been living and operating in a very narrow band of people who are also offenders.  </p><p>  Anger and emotion management is another area that is addressed.  Anger and emotion dysfunction can stem from a variety of complex issues but if it is not addressed it tends to pollute the progress that can be made in other areas.  Drug and alcohol misuse is another target area.  We work very intensively with people who have both drug and alcohol issues.  A key hallmark of our project is that we work with people with where they are on a continuum of services so we do not demand that they be drug or alcohol free in order for us to engage with them.  We have a continuum of services that are suitable for people on the dysfunctional end of the continuum and those who want to become completely drug and alcohol free.  Lifestyle and associates are tied in with the idea of pro-social activities and we link people in with other groups.  We link people into non-offending activities.  Another factor is training and employability.  We have a very good track record in moving people on, but only when they are ready.  This is at the heart of our programme.  At our team meetings we would be very careful not to set somebody up for failure.  If we feel somebody is not yet ready to take a work placement or a particular training course, we do not push them into it just because it is there.  If one does that, relapse rates increase.  We take a much more pragmatic look at it.  We also target accommodation, to which my colleagues from the other two services have just referred.</p><p>  The interesting fact about the COAIM system is that it gave us the statistics we needed to sit down with the housing authority in Wexford and set out the facts.  We used to have anecdotal evidence but we now have very clear evidence that accommodation is a serious issue for offenders.  That has changed the dynamic completely.  We have been able to have a businesslike conversation with the council and the borough council.</p><p>  Another key area is financial issues and debts.  I do not think I have come across a drug user who does not have substantial debts as a consequence of his or her drug use either for general services such as the ESB, gas, rent and so on or owing money to other detailers.  We constantly link in people with the MABS, which is a fantastic resource to us in Wexford.  </p><p>  As my colleague from Care After Prison said, relationships and family issues are a significant part of the dynamic.  We have built into our system a family support group, where we support the family members.  These are the ten criminogenic target areas.  It is not to say that other activities such as sport activities, adventure sports, art and so are not of good in and of themselves.  We run a number of other vocational skills programmes.  We do it as well as and not instead of the COAIM system.  We do it alongside it, so that every single client who comes into the project gets a change plan base.  They work up their change plan with our staff based on these ten criminogenic areas.</p></speech>

We have been invited to prisons.  We were brought on a tour of Mountjoy and talked through the ISM project.  We have been in St. Patrick's Institution.

I, too, am not a member of the sub-committee.  As a Deputy from the Portlaoise area, I am familiar with the prisons in the town.  The issue of care after prison is my main concern and I apologise if the witnesses have addressed the issue.  Many prisoners receive early release, while others will complete a full sentence.  Do prisoners receive a discharge letter when they complete their sentence?  I have encountered cases where persons who are discharged on completion of their sentences have been told by the local community welfare officer or an official in the local social welfare office that their application for jobseeker's payments will not be processed without a discharge letter.  It may be a new development that the Department of Social Protection is specifically advising that persons who are on temporary release are not eligible for jobseeker's allowance because they are not available for work.  Community welfare officers are taking a similar approach and are requiring a letter of discharge.  These letters have become an issue recently.</p><p>   On the linkage into State agencies, some local authorities take a sympathetic approach to people who have completed a prison sentence, while others are unduly unsympathetic towards them.  The latter do not want to know about the circumstances of former prisoners and will try to move them elsewhere.  What are the witnesses' views on the different approaches taken by local authorities to former prisoners?  It can boil down to the attitude of an individual director of service.</p></speech>

The types of offences for which a person has been convicted may limit his or her options for social housing, particularly if the conviction is for anti-social behaviour or sexual offences.  While I do not have full information on discharge letters, I am aware that persons on temporary release are registered in the system as being on temporary release and should liaise with the prison in question.  Again, however, the circumstances vary.  Some prisoners may be released during the day and return to prison at night, as in the case of the training unit in Mountjoy Prison, while others are released from Monday to Friday and return to prison at weekends.  The time a person on release will be available to work depends on the circumstances of his or her release.</p><p>  We work closely with Beatrix Sheehan, the community welfare officer in the homeless persons unit.  She is an amazing lady who is overworked and under-resourced.  Long queues form when she visits Mountjoy Prison to meet prisoners prior to their release.  Her work includes sorting out social welfare entitlements for prisoners by ensuring they do not leave prison without information, identification or letters.  This allows community welfare officers to deal with their cases immediately.</p><p>  The unfortunate reality is that a former prisoner's experience with local authorities will depend on the person he or she meets on the day.  We try to provide non-judgmental support.  We fill in forms with prisoners, direct them to the appropriate agencies and so forth.  Sometimes this involves making a telephone call in their presence to ensure they know where they should go and avoid scenarios where they knock on doors and are turned away.  This is a horrible but common experience.  When a person is motivated to make changes it can be difficult when doors are repeatedly closed in his or her face and obstacles are continually placed in his or her way. </p></speech>

Discharges are both planned and unplanned.  Where a discharge is planned, the former prisoner will have a better chance of having discharge letters and so forth arranged and it is more likely the community welfare officer will be on board.  Where a discharge is unplanned, the position is much more chaotic as it requires a crisis response from us as we try to make arrangements with the community welfare officer.  In our experience, our relationships with community welfare officers who know we work with prisoners and services becomes a factor.  They will work with us by recognising we are supporting somebody.  This is the reason we are able to advocate successfully on behalf of people and enable them to obtain rent supplement.</p><p>  In the majority of cases, the former prisoners in question will seek to access private rented accommodation or accommodation provided by housing associations such as Focus Ireland because local authorities do not have one bedroom properties for single males.  </p><p>  Where appropriate supports are made available, individuals may be able to reintegrate in their families.  Again, this depends to a great extent on whether the prisoner's release is planned or unplanned.  In the case of the former, we can engage with the family and support reintegration, whereas in the latter case, the position can be more chaotic and emergency accommodation must be found on a short-term basis to address the issue. </p></speech>

The issue is whether they will accept an application for rent supplement.  In most areas, people must be on the housing list to receive rent supplement.  The issue is not one of councils providing accommodation but one of councils making life difficult for former prisoners by refusing to process an application form.  The prison system is a structured environment where prisoners know at what time they will get up, go to bed and have breakfast, dinner and tea.  On their release, they are at sea when they visit Government offices.</p><p>  A person who has spent more than 183 days in an institution can be certified as homeless.  Does this apply to prisoners?  What is the position regarding former prisoners against whom barring orders have been granted?  Many of those in prison are in this position, which makes it even more difficult to secure accommodation when they leave prison.</p></speech>

I came in when Paul Delaney was speaking.  It is important not to set someone up for a course that he is not able for.  A person may be unable to concentrate for so many hours in a day or perhaps it is not in his nature and that is probably part of the reason he ended up in trouble in the first place.  I am unsure who is best qualified to answer the question.  How do the delegations find dealing with F&Aacute;S?  The Probation Service is fine, the community welfare officers can be sympathetic and the Department of Social Protection will try to set a person up with a payment.  Perhaps a community welfare officer will tide him over for a while until all that gets done.  However, F&Aacute;S has an important role.  I do not believe the sympathy element comes in at a F&Aacute;S counter.  When organisations are trying to get someone onto a course it is important that F&Aacute;S is very much a part of the service to get people in during their first week out.  A person can go off the rails after one week if three or four doors have not opened for him.  What is the position with F&Aacute;S and the National Learning Network, which used to be called Rehab?  Both these organisations can help ex-offenders or ex-prisoners.  Is F&Aacute;S in the network for dealing with these projects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-19a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Delaney" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU12012121900009#J00300"><p>Deputy Fleming has raised an interesting issue that is even broader than the issue of F&Aacute;S.  It relates to having an integrated plan for offenders.  We approach this with a case management plan.  In other words, we try to avoid exactly what Deputy Fleming has just referred to, that is, where a person is all at sea or bounced around.  The change outcome and indicator mapping, COAIM, system we use ensures that if we identify training as a need for a particular offender, then we are able to do the advocacy for them and we are able to take F&Aacute;S on board.  In fairness, it has worked rather well.  A representative from F&Aacute;S sits on our steering committee and F&Aacute;S is used to working with offenders.  However, we must approach this in a case management way.  I agree entirely with Deputy Fleming.  To ask offenders, especially homeless dysfunctional offenders, to do such work themselves invariably leads to failure.  Our COAIM system is predicated on having a plan.  We refer to it as a change plan rather than a care plan; there is a slightly different emphasis.  However, if one has a plan then the people who sit on our steering committee are committed to doing their part.  We need not reinvent the wheel.  If an organisation is responsible for housing, then that is what it does.  If an organisation is responsible for finance issues, such as MABS, that is the role it plays.  If an organisation is responsible for training and employment, then that is the role it plays as well.  We act as the bridge between these groups.  The case management approach is something that should be rolled out nationally because otherwise people will be left at sea and we have seen where that leads.</p></speech>

We find that what works well at the Cornmarket Project is to take the mystery out of what we do.  This is why the case management approach works well because sometimes people looking from the outside in wonder where they could fit into a role in the Cornmarket Project.  The steering committee of the Cornmarket Project adds to this as well.  People can sit around and discuss the issues.  They do not discuss individual clients per se but our COAIM system is able to bring up factual statements rather than anecdotal statements.  Mr. Delaney referred to this earlier.  We have been able to sit down with the housing officers and make the case that in our open access drop-in area accommodation has come up to the high 70% region.  We were able to put the case factually.  It helps when we work on a factual basis rather than on an anecdotal basis.</p></speech>

It is not simply a case of people who come to you.  You have a relationship with the Probation Service and you identify people who are especially difficult to work with and who have a low motivation.  This is even more challenging.  As you have noted, these people can often slip through the system and be back and forth from prison.  That is a real challenge.</p></speech>

We have an automated system on the technological side.  If a client is with the Cornmarket Project and we do not see him for three weeks an e-mail is automatically sent to our outreach worker.  The outreach worker knows at that point to check in with the client.  We are always seeking to reduce the gaps that a client can fall through and using technology is another way of doing that.</p></speech>

It is important for us to keep on top of this.  We have spend a good deal of time tweaking and fine-tuning the COAIM system.  We will spend a good deal more time on this as new information becomes available and as new statistics become available and also as we feed back into our system.  We are always keen to go back and examine and see whether this is the best way of doing things today.  It may have been the best way six months ago but we must determine whether it remains the case today.</p></speech>

There is a principle called the responsivity principle, a principle on which there is great emphasis in other criminal justice jurisdictions.  Basically it means matching the offender to the type of staff member and programme that will work for him.  That is very important in terms of the training.  We concentrate on ensuring that the staff we have delivering our services deliver them in accordance with the same evidence-based model.  This means no one is doing his own thing.  Many of our clients have literacy issues and we have staff members who are specifically trained in this regard.  Many of our clients have anger management issues and these are all issues which staff must be trained in.  Otherwise people simply do not come back; offenders vote with their feet and will not come back to our project.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Siobhan O'Donoghue and Ms Edel McGinley.  I thank them for their attendance and for the submissions they gave us.  The format is that they will make a brief opening remark for five minutes and then there will be a question and answer session.</p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms McGinley to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is a national organisation working to promote justice and empowerment for migrant workers in Ireland.  We have been taking a stand with migrant workers for more than ten years through service provision, advocacy and policy change.</p><p>  We have been working with undocumented migrants since 2001.  We have seen the cumulative and detrimental effects being undocumented has had on people in the State.  The issue is a serious one and is at a critical stage in this country.  We estimate that 25,000 to 30,000 undocumented people live in this country, including families and children.  Next year, 2013, as committee members are probably aware, is the year of immigration reform in this country and in the US.  This issue must be dealt with separately from the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill in order that we can clean up the system comprehensively.</p><p>  Data on undocumented migrants is limited but we have carried out a number of different studies with people who come through our doors.  A total of 75 different nationalities are represented.  People come from outside the EU and from all over the world.  The majority are more than 30 years of age and they have been here for at least four years, and many of them are undocumented for up to 15 years.  Approximately half of them have families and children living in the State.  That is a large number of connections to the State.</p><p>  In terms of a contribution, undocumented migrants spend &euro;180 million annually, which is a big contribution to the economy.  Many people have been engaged in employment for many years and have been with the same employer for more than four years.  They have been working and paying tax and PRSI contributions.  Many children are integrated into schools and their families are part of our communities.</p><p>  I will not go into the proposal we sent in detail but it relates to earned regularisation.  I will outline the benefits of an earned regularisation scheme.  It would generate in the region of &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million annually through fees, fines and additional revenue from undocumented workers and their employers.  It would bring the largest amount of undocumented people into the immigration system and enhance governance.  Residence would be earned over a five-year period.  There would not be an automatic right to residency.  It is not an amnesty; it is something that is earned over a period and mirrors the long-term residency system that is already in place.</p><p>  There are built-in safeguards to the scheme, which also works to root out unscrupulous employers in tandem with NERA and other agencies that are engaged in compliance.  It will improve overall public security and compliance and add credibility to our efforts in the US to regularise undocumented Irish people there.  The House has been active in advocating for the rights of the undocumented in the US.  It also provides a humanitarian response.  Failure to act is not an option.  The cost of deporting this group of people would be in the region of &euro;90 million.  It is untenable for the State to even begin to consider that.</p><p>  To date, we have received much support for earned regularisation.  We have received political support from Deputies and Senators across political parties.  The Labour Party has passed a motion.  We have also received support from Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council and other councils across the country.  It has also been endorsed by a number of organisations that are listed in the submission given to committee members.  They include trade unions, business and religious organisations and voluntary and community organisations.</p><p>  We urge the committee to raise the issue with the Minister and to ask him to respond to the proposal on earned regularisation.  We seek an agreement as a matter of urgency that earned regularisation will be introduced in the State to give hope to people who are undocumented.</p></speech>

It has not been an issue concerning the undocumented, but is more about being exploited.  A lot of people who are selling newspapers in such situations are actually European citizens and have the right of free mobility and residence in Ireland.  There is an exploitation issue, however.</p><p>  The committee might be interested in a particular case I dealt with a number of years ago.  It concerned a young woman who was undocumented and was involved in cleaning D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann every day.  It brought home the fact that undocumented people are integrated into our lives, families, communities and workplaces.  They are not separate but are integrated.  This proposal is about recognising that reality.  The only home the children of such people have ever known is Ireland.</p><p>  I have a statement from Champika, who is in the Visitors Gallery today, on her experiences of being undocumented in Ireland.  She talks about her 18-year-old daughter who has spent the last ten years in the Irish education system and is completely integrated.  She is among the top 5% of talented young people in the country.  We have just heard that she has got a Gaisce presidential award.  </p><p>  We are dealing with young people and older people also.  One undocumented person we are dealing with is fluent in Irish.  There are issues concerning exploitation but it is more likely that such people are getting on with their lives, working, paying tax and PRSI, and making a contribution although they are not formally recognised in the system.</p></speech>

It can be introduced as a scheme under ministerial discretion, which is in place in the 1999 Act.  Therefore it does not require legislation to introduce something like this.  It does not have to be on a statutory footing in that way.  In some respects that would speed up how this would be implemented.  We believe a scheme can easily be introduced and does not require complicated or comprehensive legislation.  That can be done now with relative ease.</p></speech>

We realise we are in a recession and that it is a difficult time, but this is pragmatic and has been earned over a five-year period.  There are not a lot of people coming into the system at one time because it is slow.  People are paying taxes and their contribution is recognised.  It is a measured approach to dealing with this situation.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I would like to welcome: Mr. Ludwig Forrest, chairperson of the European Foundation Centre; Mr. Colin McCrea, a member of Philanthropy Ireland; and Ms Hanna Surmatz, legal counsel with the European Foundation Centre.  I thank them for attending the committee today, as well as for the submissions they have supplied to the committee.</p><p>  The format of today's meeting is that they will be asked to make some brief opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.

Witnesses should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of any evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

It is a pleasure and an honour, but also a huge responsibility, for us to be here today.  We would like to thank the committee for the precious time it is giving us for this presentation on the importance of the european foundation statute, EFS.</p><p>  The European Foundation Centre, the foundation sector in general and several philanthropists hope that Ireland will, during its EU Presidency, support this legislative proposal and make real progress to secure its adoption.  The Joint Committee could help in an effective way by bringing this issue to the attention of the relevant Ministers: the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter; the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan; and the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  </p><p>  It is our responsibility to convince the committee that this would be a good idea by demonstrating the status of the sector and why it is relevant and important.  On 8 February 2012, the European Commission issued a legislative proposal for a european foundation statute.  The proposal must now be endorsed by the co-legislators that is, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  Once adopted, this new European statute will not replace national laws but will act as an additional legal tool.</p><p>  The statute is a legal instrument that will allow philanthropists, individuals, families, corporations and foundations to set up a European foundation.  Once registered in a member state it will be recognised in all the other member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area.</p><p>  What is the importance of the foundation sector in Europe?  Approximately 110,000 foundations currently exist across Europe.</p></speech>

We are philanthropic people in Ireland in both the cultural and charitable spheres.  We donate substantially per capita to various organisations.  What would be the advantage to these organisation of engaging with this process?  A philanthropy scheme has been introduced for the arts in this country.  If somebody engaged with the scheme, how would the statute benefit them?  How would it benefit a charitable organisation focused on social good in practical terms?</p></speech>

Members of the public in Ireland are generous in their giving and we all know that.  There are 30 grant making foundations in the country.  If we were to match the UK, we would increase that number to 500 and, therefore, we are way behind in the number of foundations we have.  Mr. Forrest brought up the difficulties of operating across borders and setting up a foundation is difficult in itself.  However, one of the problems we face is that small countries suffer disproportionately in terms of cross-border philanthropy.  Few British foundations operate in the Republic of Ireland.  The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust is a notable exception but a great number of them operate in Northern Ireland.  They do not come south and one of the reasons is it is difficult to do so.  One of the jobs I had until last month was with Atlantic Philanthropies.  We set up different organisations in every country we operate in.</p></speech>

While the Irish are not as familiar, as Mr. McCrea outlined, with the European notion of foundations and philanthropy, as Deputy Corcoran Kennedy stated, the Irish are well known for their generosity.  How many people work in the sector in Ireland?  If a standard set of legal principles were adopted across the EU, would that lead to foundations in other countries setting up operations in Ireland?  Mr. McCrea mentioned one British foundation that is active here.  What does he feel the nature of the legal framework should be?  I presume it will not be prescriptive, given each member state has different regulations and rules regarding charitable status and so on.  What practical measures would such a statute result in?  What shape would it take?</p></speech>

The company is also present in Ireland serving breakfast.  The company asked me where it should start to create a European programme.  Hopefully, in some months or years it will be possible to start with a European foundation.  Currently, where a decision has been made to go to Europe, implementation involves dealing with 27 different legislative regimes.  It is not easy to act.  It is a question of allowing people to start quickly.  I was contacted recently by the Irish in Europe Association, which is based in Brussels to promote Irish culture across Europe.  It has activities, grants and donors across the EU.  They asked me how they could commence a particular activity to which a European foundation statute would have been an answer.

The report for 2011 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 March 2012 and the following motion has been placed on the Order Paper of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the Report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2011, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 March in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</blockquote>In commending the motion I will outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the United Nations in recent years.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security, represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in such operations since 1958, a service that has comprised more than 61,000 individual tours of duty.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the United Nations and the European Union.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations.  This has included supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system.</p><p>  Notwithstanding our current economic difficulties, Ireland willingly continues to play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world, providing professional peacekeepers for a range of missions throughout the world.  During 2011 the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on 12 missions throughout the world in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p></speech>

We are immensely proud of the contribution our Defence Forces have made in UN peacekeeping operations over the years.  The fit of the Finnish defence forces with our own is particularly welcome.  Finland has the same policy of neutrality as Ireland, as the Chairman mentioned during a recent visit by this committee to Finland.  That fit is a good model for Ireland to proceed with.</p><p>  The Minister knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has concerns.  Although this meeting concerns the UN, I wish to raise the issue of the EU battlegroups and the sense that our proud policy of neutrality, which puts us in a position to be peacekeepers under the UN banner and play a role in conflict resolution as a neutral state that was colonised, has endured hardships and can understand the experiences of peoples we might be trying to assist, could be undermined by our being seen to be more closely allied with NATO.  Obviously, the use of Shannon Airport from 2003 was also very disappointing.  We have had this discussion before.  I understand that for practical purposes the Minister is not going to walk into a meeting as Minister for justice, equality and defence but rather as Minister for Defence.  He has to reiterate that and have it branded on his head in every discussion he has.  Our armed forces are something of which Irish people are proud and put us in a position of strength to play a constructive role.  What the Minister outlined today in this report is something of which the Irish people are rightfully proud.  These operations and partnerships with countries that share our values give us more moral weight to play a stronger role in human rights defence and conflict resolution.  I hope we do not drift into any kind of increased relationship with NATO, which we know has been responsible for operations that were not endorsed by the UN and which caused great devastation.  I am, of course, referring to the war in Iraq.  Overall, it is a positive report of which we are all very proud, but I have those concerns.</p></speech>

They are held in high regard and I welcome the Minister's indication that he will visit them again this year.  It is important that they realise we do not forget about them and that, as a society, we value what they do.  Can the Minister set out the types of humanitarian and community project in which members of the Defence Forces are engaged?  There is a paragraph on the matter in the report.  Such projects are key in areas of strife to assist communities to adjust to fragile and more sustained peace.  To change a society from war-torn to peaceful is very challenging and I am curious about the types of project involved.</p></speech>

I know from family members who have served in the Defence Forces that it is at times very risky.  It is appropriate that all Members of the Oireachtas thank and commend the 438 members of the Defence Forces who will be abroad this Christmas.  The Minister mentioned southern Lebanon, which he said was rather calm at the moment.  Is it the view of the Minister and the Defence Forces that the area has stabilised over the last three to four months, particularly along the border with Israel?  Are there any UN troops in the Gaza area who could become involved in peacekeeping and peace-making?  If we want to bring peace to the area, we will need the support of UN troops on the ground to prevent violence.  I would like to know the Minister's views.  On the political side, does the Minister support the UN's two-state solution?  It is important that we know the Government's views.</p><p>  I am concerned about the 150 soldiers on stand-by for the German-Czech-Austrian battlegroup.  I am one of those people who do not like the use of the word "battlegroup" in conjunction with the Defence Forces.  What types of conflict will the Defence Forces be involved in as part of a battlegroup?  The themes in the Minister's speech today involved local communities and humanitarian projects.  I hope that is our political agenda.  It is the agenda of the UN.  Ireland is recognised as an impartial, neutral country which has contributed a great deal to international peace.  Our soldiers are respected by all sides in any conflict and I would not like to see that change through an unnecessary involvement in battlegroups.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me as to what they will be involved in.</p></speech>

They are part of the European Common Security and Defence Policy and are in place to provide assistance in emergency peacekeeping, peace enforcement and humanitarian relief.  It is important within the context of the EU, where we have common values and beliefs, that the Defence Forces will be equipped to respond appropriately to deal with humanitarian disasters and peacekeeping and peace enforcement issues.  Battlegroups provide an opportunity for member state forces to work together in various compositions.  There are 21 EU member states in NATO; the battlegroup concept provides for a degree of interaction and creates possibilities for interoperability and sharing and pooling of equipment.  Co-operation needs to be developed and deepened to ensure that at a time of financial difficulty there is not an unnecessary duplication of resources in Europe in the defence area.  The battlegroup concept is important and has nothing to do with our neutrality.  It is about continuing to engage in Europe and to be seen to be available to assist when there are emergencies which require humanitarian interventions or where a European peacekeeping engagement emerges in some shape or form.  I despair when this matter is constantly dug up as if our virgin neutrality is about to be violated.  It is false nonsense and it gets tedious.</p></speech>

There is ample information available on the purpose of the battlegroups.  They have not been engaged but they are there as a stand-by.  I agree with Deputy McGrath that I could think of something better to call them than battlegroups, but that is the term we have inherited.  They are not about to declare war on anybody or invade any country; nor are we.  Waving the flag of neutrality is artificial in the context of the purpose of battlegroups.</p><p>  I revert to the matter before the committee, which is UN peacekeeping missions.  I thank the committee for its support for the engagement of the Defence Forces overseas, which is very important and provides an outlet for the substantial training members receive.  It facilitates career ambition and ensures that members of the Defence Forces get the opportunity to use the skills they acquire in training in a positive way in troubled parts of the world to protect lives.  Deputy Moynihan is right to mention the families of members of the Defence Forces, particularly at Christmas.  It is hard on wives, children and parents whose loved ones are abroad not to see them at Christmas time.  It is part and parcel of service in the Defence Forces, whose members look forward to serving their country and the United Nations abroad and making a positive contribution.</p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about the types of project the Defence Forces carries out on humanitarian assistance missions overseas.  Our Defence Forces are particularly effective at forming good relationships with local communities.  Southern Lebanon is an example.  Defence Forces members do a great deal more than some other peacekeeping forces internationally in this context, particularly in those towns adjacent to headquarters.  It contributes to good relationships, keeps tensions down and ensures they are welcome in the areas in which they are deployed, as opposed to being seen as a hostile foreign force.  In Lebanon our long track record means the local community is very supportive of Irish troops.</p></speech>

We are in agreement on his report but the Minister is a bit of an <i>agent provocateur</i> about the issue of EU battlegroups and neutrality.  In case he thinks that Deputy Finian McGrath and I have joined some conspiracy theory organisation, I will read a quote from the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap De Hoop Scheffer: &quot;EU Battle Groups could be used to go to war.  Why did the EU create the Battle Group?  It is not just to help rebuild a country.  The Battle Groups are not for building schools.  We should not think the EU is for soft power and NATO for tough power.&quot;  We are not entirely among the conspiracy theorists.</p></speech>

There is an old legal phrase, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, which means &quot;the thing speaks for itself&quot;.  That is the perception of the Secretary General of NATO.  It is not the perception of the European Union, nor is it the objective or purpose for which the battlegroups were formed.  I suppose the Secretary General of NATO can have his personal view but that is not the foundation, base, purpose or objective of the groups, nor is it our objective.</p></speech>

I thank the select committee for the work done on defence and justice issues during the course of the year.  I am very conscious that we have published a lot of legislation and reports in the past 12 months and that the committee has been put under enormous pressure as a consequence.  I thank committee members and the Chairman, in particular, for the extraordinarily efficient way in which the committee has conducted its business, the constructive and helpful reports published and the contribution made to the legislation we have developed.  Until the Government was created, the heads of important Bills were not regularly furnished to the committees in order that they could hold hearings and contribute to the legislative process.  I hope committee members consider the new approach we have adopted is a positive one.  I assure them observations made on legislation have been impacting on the final form of Bills published.  It is no harm to record, even though we are dealing with defence issues at this meeting, that this is an historic day because two Bills for which the committee received the heads are completing their passage through the D&aacute;il.  Just before the lunch the passage was completed of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill, which will provide greater protection for children and vulnerable adults by ensuring those working with them will be properly vetted through the use not only of hard but also soft information.  Effectively, it will create a criminal offence with bodies and organisations being required to ensure individuals are properly vetted prior to being employed.  By 10.30 p.m. the passage of the Personal Insolvency Bill will have been completed.  These are two major Bills to which the committee made a very positive and valuable contribution, for which it is appropriate that I thank members.</p></speech>

That is the recommendation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The second petition is P00035/12 from Ms Helena Corcoran in respect of electro-magnetic radiation.  The recommendation is that as a preliminary step, the committee request an update from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue, as the expert group report dates back to 2007.  In referring the petition the committee could also ask the Department to confirm that a national research programme was set up, as suggested in the statement of March 2007.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The third petition is P00045/12 in respect of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the petition made by Mr. Donohoe.  We have agreed that we write to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence to ask whether there are plans to amend the relevant legislation to allow petitioners or specific cases to be heard.  We will also refer the specific case to the ombudsman.  During 2013 when the appropriate ombudsman comes before the committee to present an annual report or is due to visit, we recommend that we write to the ombudsman in advance to ask that the ombudsman address the specific case in reply.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The fourth petition is P00049/12 in respect of road traffic accidents.  The recommendation is fivefold.  It is recommended that as a preliminary step, the petition be forwarded to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence asking that he address and report back to the committee on the following issues: first, his view on assigning responsibility for recording road traffic accidents to qualified statisticians; second, how the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assess requests for information under the Data Protection and Freedom of Information Acts; third, whether there is any intention to start recording road traffic accidents in the same manner here as in the North of Ireland; fourth, if there are plans to change or improve the layout of the website of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and, fifth, if it is feasible for those responsible for publishing data to provide information on the website on the actual road or roads where accidents occurred.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

It might better inform our letter and the way that we advocate our recommendations.</p></speech>

In that way, when we write to the Minister, we could articulate and take into account what was said.  Otherwise we would be wasting the Minister's time.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That is the sixth recommendation made in respect of the petition.  </p><p>  I now propose that the committee adjourn until 4 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 January 2013 when it will meet the Minister for Health and Children, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children and representatives of the HSE.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
