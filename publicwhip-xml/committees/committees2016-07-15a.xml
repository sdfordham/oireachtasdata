Today's meeting is focused on two specific areas relating to the HSE Financial Statement 2015: (i) Internal financial control and the governance of grants to outside agencies under section 39 agreements; and (ii) an update on the payment of specified remuneration and allowances to senior managers, known as top-up payments, in the section 38 agencies and the requirement to comply with Government pay policy.  </p> <p>  This meeting is being held principally because of the litany of revelations across the media in recent weeks.  We should all allow time for the appropriate public bodies carrying out legal investigations to take place with regard to that organisation, Console.  However, the HSE as a body is responsible for distributing more than &euro;3 billion of public taxpayers' money to approximately 2,600 organisations and this is very much of concern to the committee.  The committee wants to ascertain what protections are in place to ensure the moneys distributed to these organisations is well spent and provides good value for money for the taxpayer.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  He is accompanied by  Ms Anne O'Connor, national director, mental health division; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director, human resources; Dr. Geraldine Smith, assistant national director, internal audit operations; Mr. Gerry Raleigh, director, National Office for Suicide Prevention; Mr. Brian Purcell, head of compliance unit; and Ms Martina Queally, chief officer community health care organisation, area six.</p><p>We are also joined by Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Mahony, who is a deputy secretary general in the Department of Health; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O&rsquo;Halloran, who is the chief nursing officer in the internal financial control division; Mr. Greg Dempsey, who is an assistant secretary in the internal financial control division; and Ms Teresa Cody, who is an assistant secretary in the pay policy division.  We are also joined by Ms Annette Murray and Mr. Paddy Howard of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are also assisted today by the permanent witness to the committee, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is the Comptroller and Auditor General; and by Ms Ruth Foley, who is the director of audit in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to ensure all mobile phones are switched off.<br/><br/>I remind witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  As always, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement on the matters for discussion at today's meeting as they pertain to his audit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I would like to begin by giving a little outline of our approach to the audit of the HSE's funding of section 38 and 39 bodies.  The HSE's expenditure for 2015 amounted to almost &euro;14 billion.  Grants to section 38 and 39 agencies accounted for &euro;3.6 billion, or just over a quarter of the HSE's spend.  The HSE's annual financial statements include a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control.  This includes disclosures in relation to the HSE's regime of monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies.  Further details on this can be found on pages 120 to 124 of the HSE's financial statements for 2015.  Our audit of grant expenditure in the HSE includes an examination of the operation of the HSE's monitoring and oversight arrangements for grants advanced to a small sample of section 38 and 39 agencies.  This includes visits to the selected agencies.  Such visits are undertaken by agreement.  As this work is conducted as part of the HSE audit, any audit issues identified are communicated to the HSE by way of management letter.</p> <p>  In our consideration of grantee oversight, we use a general model that focuses on the key functions that are indicated on the screen that can be seen by members.  I will go through that briefly.  The first issue that arises is the assessment of grantees when they are being considered for funding.  The allocation of funding is another area of interest and concern.  When decisions are being made on how much funding is to be provided to an agency, particular attention must be paid to the balance between the level of funding and the service that is expected to be delivered.  When a service agreement is put in place, it should formally explain the amount of funding that is being provided, the service that is expected in return for that funding and any conditions that attach to the granting of that funding.  The monitoring and reporting mechanism that needs to be in place usually focuses on three areas: financial reporting, governance issues and performance issues.  The HSE should have a facility for the audit or investigation of grant-funded agencies, as required.  This would be equally true of any organisation that has a significant grant funding structure in place.  It is important that mechanisms are in place to evaluate the outcomes so that the Oireachtas can be assured that where moneys have been provided, the services for which they were provided have actually been delivered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#B00400"><p>I would like to begin by congratulating the Chairman on his appointment.  I congratulate all the other members of the committee as well.  They will have received a copy of the HSE internal audit report on Console, together with other information relating to the topics for examination this morning.</p> <p>  The HSE funds over 1,700 voluntary agencies, which operate over 2,600 separate funding arrangements to a value of approximately &euro;3.3 billion.  Some 39 of these agencies, accounting for &euro;2.6 billion, are funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  The remaining agencies are funded under section 39 of the Act.  In 2009, the HSE developed a formal national governance framework with national standard governance documentation, service arrangements and grant aid agreements to manage the funding provided to these agencies.  This came into operation throughout the HSE in 2010.  Four standard documents are in use.  First, section 38 service arrangements cover the 16 voluntary hospitals and a group of 23 major non-acute voluntary community agencies.  St. John Of God Community Services is one of the 39 agencies covered by these arrangements.  Second, section 39 service arrangements cover all voluntary and community agencies, other than the above, that receive funding of more than &euro;250,000.  Some 304 agencies, which include - perhaps I should say "included" - Console, are currently covered by these arrangements.  Third, section 39 grant aid agreements cover all agencies in receipt of funding under &euro;250,000.  The vast majority of agencies fall into this category.  Some 1,362 agencies are currently funded under these agreements.  Fourth, for-profit service arrangements cover all agencies in the commercial for-profit sector regardless of funding level.  Some 218 agencies currently fall into this category.</p> <p>  The HSE has sought to enhance governance arrangements with section 38 and 39 agencies in recent years.  In particular, it has established a compliance unit to support the development of a strong and consistent compliance culture across all agencies funded by the HSE.  The service arrangements underpin the HSE&rsquo;s relationship with the funded agencies.  The HSE has introduced an annual compliance statement process, whereby the chair and another director of the board of each section 38 agency sign and confirm that the agency is compliant across a range of requirements on behalf of the board.  In early 2015, as part of the ongoing development of the compliance process, it was decided that a review of governance by external consultants would be carried out in these agencies to provide external assurances to the HSE.  These reviews commenced in March 2016 and are ongoing.  The HSE has a number of processes in place to assure itself that the services it purchases from HSE-funded agencies are of a high quality and provide value for money.  I will describe some of the processes that have been in place since 2013 as I provide an overview of two agencies: the charity Console, which is a section 39 agency, and St. John of God, which is a section 38 agency.  As the service arrangements underpin the relationship between the HSE and these funded agencies, it is important to note that the HSE's powers in this regard are confined to the funding it provides and the services provided in return for that funding, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the service arangements.  In this context, and given the limited number of HSE internal audit and compliance unit staff, careful consideration needs to be given to the section 38 and 39 agencies that are subject to audit and review.</p> <p>  There has been much media coverage in relation to Console and the findings of the recently completed HSE internal audit.  I thought it would be helpful to outline briefly the sequence of events that led to this audit.  Console is a section 39 agency that receives approximately 40% of its funding from the HSE.  Funding to Console remained relatively static between 2006 and 2013, when it increased to &euro;599,000 from &euro;252,000 the previous year.  HSE funding increased at this time to prevent the collapse of a national suicide helpline that was previously funded by another organisation.  The increase in funding to Console at that time was predicated on the charity agreeing to a greater level of scrutiny and enhanced governance by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP.  The increased level of scrutiny by NOSP gave rise to a number of concerns, including Console&rsquo;s continued failure to respond to requests for information, its delivery on its commitments to commission independent reviews of its service and its failure to attend significant meetings, particularly relating to the helpline and its annual accounts.  Arising from these concerns, in late 2014 NOSP approached HSE's internal audit division and requested that Console be included in its audit work plan for 2015.  In April 2015, the internal audit division wrote to Console to advise that the audit would commence on 27 April 2015.  Following a request from Console, the audit start was deferred and commenced on 19 May 2015.</p><p>This audit should have taken approximately 12 weeks to complete.  However, the audit was particularly complex and challenging and the auditors met considerable resistance from the then chief executive officer.  The audit was completed in April 2016 and at all times the auditors were careful to follow fair procedures and due process.  The audit report, copied to members, sets out the sequence of events that followed.</p><p> With regard to St. John of God, I advise the committee that on 1 July, the St. John of God Order informed the HSE that a number of payments had been made to 14 senior staff in 2013.  It is important to point out that in September 2013 the HSE sought written confirmation from all section 38 agencies, including St. John of God, that all remuneration paid to employees was in accordance with Department of Health consolidated payscales and non-Exchequer sources of funding were not being used to supplement employee remuneration to give rise to rates of individual remuneration exceeding the Department's consolidated payscales.  If unsanctioned payments were previously paid, the HSE sought confirmation that all such payments had ceased and the recoupment of any overpayments would be pursued as expeditiously as possible.</p><p> An important element of the declaration sought at that time was full disclosure on these items.  St. John of God has declared itself as non-compliant with public sector pay policy.  This declaration and other recent revelations regarding the payments to the 14 staff members are a very grave concern for me and the HSE.  Consequently, I have asked the HSE's internal audit division to conduct a review of these matters as a matter of urgency.  In this regard, St. John of God was written to by the HSE's internal audit unit on 8 July and asked to provide information and points of clarity by 20 July.  The HSE received a solicitor's letter in response to the audit process.  The HSE intends to pursue its internal audit process notwithstanding that correspondence.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

As Chairman, I will set the context of today's meeting.  As the witness mentioned, we have received an extensive internal audit report, running to 229 pages, conducted by the HSE.  The HSE's internal audit function is the largest of any State organisation because of the size of the HSE, which has 100,000 employees.  How many people are in it?</p></speech>

The division would have been bigger before the moratorium and various events that took place during the financial crisis.</p></speech>

When did the HSE national audit committee receive this report, which was completed on 14 April, and discuss it?  What was its views on the report?</p></speech>

The process by which the audit committee receives and reviews internal audits is following their completion and consideration by the relevant national directors, so they are in a position to assess the effectiveness of the response to internal audit report.  That is their standard practice.</p></speech>

I find it unacceptable but I will not take up the time before the lead speakers come in.  It is extraordinary that this is the governance structure, probably decided by the Department of Health.  What lessons have the HSE learned as a result of the recent episode?  I did not hear any of that in the opening statement and all the documentation we received.</p></speech>

We have received approximately 500 pages of documentation, including service level agreements, internal audit reports and opening statements but I have seen nothing about lessons learned.  I will let other people ask those questions but I am just pointing out that we have not received anything about the lessons learned.  What work went into the internal audit report?  It is highly detailed and complex and it seems much extraordinary work went into it.  How many days or weeks of work did it take?</p></speech>

We returned on 25 May and pulled out on 28 May, again because of inadequate co-operation and lack of documentation.  The team recommenced the audit on 8 June until 18 June.  During that time they gathered documentation.  After that they returned to the office and carried out significant analysis, cross-checking and pursuit of further queries and documentation from the chief executive officer of Console.  There was a significant amount of analysis.  What is in the report was not handed to us by Console.</p></speech>

I find it extraordinary that there are 229 pages of very detailed information in the report, none of which I intend to go through today because we are more concerned about the HSE's control over the issue, rather than the specifics of the report.  We have been told the biggest State organisation, with the largest internal audit section, the most staff and resources, spent months in an organisation carrying out this detailed report.  There were remarks yesterday in the High Court by Mr. Justice Gilligan to the effect that he was satisfied that Console appeared to be &quot;hopelessly insolvent&quot;.  The HSE was in there for months carrying out detailed investigations into an organisation that everybody, including the High Court, accepted was hopelessly insolvent when the investigation was ongoing.  Mr. Hall indicated it was insolvent for a considerable period.  What was the HSE doing running around checking how much was spent on bunches of flowers when the organisation was insolvent?  Will Mr. O'Brien respond to that comment?  It is bizarre that all this work was ongoing.  That is my last point.  I am just asking for a quick remark but that is the substance of what was going on.  We have the report about Console and it does not deal with anything I would like to see in an audit report about Console and its solvency status.  It is not mentioned in the 229 pages.</p><p>This is like the financial equivalent of the HSE moving around the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i>when it was already sinking.  It was not dealing with the substance of the issue in Console, which was its insolvency.  That should have been the sum of the work.  I thank Deputy Madigan for her patience.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  It struck me last night when the French tragedy unfolded that we are coming here yet again to discuss something that is completely unnecessary.  There is enough tragedy and destruction in the world and what we are discussing today was absolutely preventable.  It should not have happened.</p><p>I am very conscious of the fact that I am speaking on behalf of the general public here.  I would like the HSE, if anything comes out of today, to re-examine how it does business with these particular charities because it cannot happen again.  I have not been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts before.  However, I am aware that this it not the first time a matter like this has been dealt with by the committee.  It is not good enough, quite frankly.  Many people contribute, donate and volunteer their services to charities and there are wonderful staff in these charities including in Console.  These people do not have a voice and we, in this committee, are their voice.  Therefore, we have a responsibility to ask the HSE questions and ask that its representatives be as honest as possible because the people concerned want answers.  Last night's events in Nice were horrific but here we are dealing with something like this that was completely preventable.</p><p> I am aware that I am limited in terms of the questions that I can ask and that litigation is ongoing.  Therefore, I shall not go outside my remit.  I hope that the HSE will help me enlighten the public about the matter.  This is not about point scoring between me and the HSE.  I simply want to find out the truth and a way forward in order to ensure that something like this never happens again.</p><p> The formal national governance framework came into operation in 2010.

We were not Console's regulator.  We were not its primary funder.  We were purchasing a certain range of services from Console which were being received, which continued until yesterday and which will now continue in another organisation.  We have no powers over their fundraising activities or those other extraneous matters.</p></speech>

The HSE gave a significant amount of money to the charity.  It does not matter whether Console was partially funded or not because the same principles and oversight still apply and should apply.  Mr. O'Brien's response is not good enough.</p> <p>  In May 2016, Mr. O'Brien signed the HSE's statement on internal financial control that came into effect, I think, in 2015.  Why was it not signed earlier?  It is a gold standard governance framework.  There seems to be a difficulty between theoretical academic frameworks, written down with the HSE, but they are not implemented.  There is no point having a framework unless it is utilised.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to explain that to me.     </p></speech>

Under the governance requirements the executive reserves the right to withdraw or reduce the grant in the event of any material changes to the nature, activities or management of the organisation.  It is not acceptable to say that nothing was done.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement that the internal audit started on 19 May 2015 and finished on 14 April 2016.  I would like to move on to that and ask the auditor, Dr. Smith, if she raised concerns with Mr. O'Brien at any stage during that audit, which should have taken 12 weeks, as Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement, but took significantly longer than that.  Were concerns raised?  Did the HSE get legal advice on stopping the funding at that stage?  Even with a rudimentary knowledge of arithmetic it would be fairly evident that there was something wrong with the accounts.  What was done at that stage?</p></speech>

With the benefit of hindsight, maybe the decision could have been made earlier, maybe not.</p></speech>

I have never come in here and tried to do that and I am sure the Deputy did not imply or wish to imply that I have done that.  Clearly at any point in time we could have done things sooner.  It is true.  Whenever one conducts an internal audit, one of the questions one asks is, "Should we have done it sooner?", particularly when one finds a can of worms such as this.</p> <p>  However, I have to concern myself with whether the decisions the individual officers made at the time appeared reasonable in the circumstances.  I believe it was reasonable in the circumstances for this audit to be triggered when it was.  Yes, it might have been better if it had been triggered sooner, but all of the wrongdoing that this internal audit uncovers was not done by HSE officials; it was done by others.  This was not a public body.  It was a body in the public domain, raising funds from members of the public.</p> <p>  One of the questions I have asked myself was whether we should have potentially compromised the internal audit process by doing things sooner, which would have made it impossible to complete the internal audit, but might have had an impact on people who have, in good faith, been raising funds for Console in the last period.  Our objectives were simple in this: to get this internal audit; not to allow the process to be jeopardised; and to safeguard the services.  We have done those things.  We could have done other things, but had we done those other things, it would probably have compromised our primary objectives.</p> <p>  We are not the regulator of charities.  We are not the regulator of a whole range of organisations that we have some relationship with.  I do not believe it is right to suggest that all of the wrongdoing that is uncovered by this report, can be attached-----</p></speech>

I will allow him to answer the questions.  I understand, as the previous speaker did, the difference between section 38 and section 39 funding.  Hopefully, we will not need to repeat that as we want to get the best use of the time we have.</p> <p>  I find Mr. O'Brien's opening statement extraordinary.  The answers to the questions put so far are also extraordinary.  I refer to answers on the sequence of events that led to the internal audit in the first place, including the value-for-money issue relating to money spent by the HSE - Mr. O'Brien is the Accounting Officer for the HSE in respect of Console - and also the checks and balances, and controls and potential failings within the HSE.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien has said that he does not accept there were failings within the HSE and that as far as he is concerned, the failings were all on Console's side.  We know there were failings in respect of Console.  We have an internal audit report with 60 findings.  Page 34 of that report ranks the findings as high, medium or low.  Is Mr. O'Brien familiar with that?</p></speech>

All of the findings were ranked as high.  It continues to define systemic as where particular audit findings of a serious nature may, in the opinion of the auditors, be replicated elsewhere in the HSE.  It continues to state that all the findings in the audit have a high rating and many have national implications for the HSE.</p> <p>  The internal audit commissioned by the HSE found that systemic failures potentially could be replicated in the HSE.  It is acknowledging there were systemic failings.  It states that it has national implications for the HSE although Mr. O'Brien says something else and does not accept that.  For many people this could be seen as the tip of the iceberg in respect of a lack of controls.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien cannot sit there with all seriousness when dealing with a report that has 60 findings into an organisation that is partly funded by the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien signs the cheques as the Accounting Officer.  There are clear failings both ways.  All those failings are of a high ranking.  All show systemic problems and failures within the organisation, and the relationship of that organisation with the HSE, for which Mr. O'Brien is responsible, yet he says there were no failings on the part of his organisation.</p><p>In terms of page 34, the rankings and what it says in terms of the internal audit, can Mr. O'Brien first comment on that?</p></speech>

The aim of internal audit, obviously, is to provide remedial recommendations and also to identify what lessons might be generalisable and what can be gained from this internal audit process that could influence our practice more generally.  Therefore, there are some recommendations there which are specific and are fed now into the annual compliance programme which is undertaken by our compliance office.  In every audit, whatever it might, however large or however small, there are always findings which lead to the question, "Do we need to look to see what in our systems can be improved in light of the knowledge that we now have?", and that is what is called systemic or systematic.</p></speech>

Its findings are extraordinary.  In Mr. O'Brien's experience, has he seen an internal audit before that had 60 findings all categorised as high, and also a report from his own auditors which states that many of them have national implications for the HSE?  I am sure Mr. O'Brien is aware that auditors are very careful about the language that they use and they do not use words lightly.  When they say that this has national implications for Mr. O'Brien's organisation, it is serious.  They have not put that in there lightly.  It would seem Mr. O'Brien does not grasp that reality.</p> <p>  One cannot just say that all of the failings were on the side of Console.  We acknowledge them and we will possibly at some point deal with those as well but our job here is to ensure that there are proper controls, safeguards and checks and balances in place in respect of taxpayers' money and funding coming from Mr. O'Brien's organisation to Console.  The report and the findings of the audit are littered with failures but it seems Mr. O'Brien is not prepared to accept even the internal audit's view, not mine, that this report has national implications for his organisation.</p></speech>

There is a difference between whether things were done incorrectly in the past and whether they can be done better in the future.  The focus of internal audit reports is to discern what lessons might be generalisable, as in systemic, and, as I mentioned earlier, these will be, and have been, fed into the work of our national compliance office to ensure that we further strengthen our relationship with entities.</p> <p>  With respect, it is a different thing.  We are talking about learnings, as the Chairman asked us earlier about learnings.  Learnings are not necessarily the result of failings; they are learnings.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien is putting a more positive slant on what they meant by national implications.  As I stated, with all seriousness, when one considers the gravity of the report, one must accept that this is highly unusual in its findings, in terms of every single finding being ranked as high, and the extraordinary failures.  That does not come across in respect of Mr. O'Brien's report.</p> <p>  I will get to a number of other issues, if I can.  I will start with the sequence of events because it seems that the clock starts in 2013 in respect of Mr. O'Brien's view as to what the trigger was for the internal audit, and maybe even 2014 because Mr. O'Brien talks about the concerns the National Office for Suicide Prevention had in relation to the helpline funding and that led to the internal audit report.  However, in terms of the clock starting, one must go back further than that because concerns were raised, as was said earlier, in 2006.  There was an exchange between Mr. O'Brien and the previous speaker on that, and we have heard what Mr. O'Brien had to say.  We also had an RTE report, which states that in 2009, an official in the National Office for Suicide Prevention wrote a memo highlighting deficiencies in Console's governance and accounting saying that the 2004 expenditure did not add up, the 2006 accounts had wrong membership of the Console board, the 2007 were not signed-off on by the chairperson and questions needed to be asked of the &euro;145,000 spent on professional fees charged over years.  In 2011, further concerns were raised with the then Department of Health and Children.  We also know that concerns were raised by a former parliamentary assistant to the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, and subsequently, to an official in the HSE or the Department as well.  The clock, with respect, goes back much further than the 2013 start which Mr. O'Brien would have us believe is when concerns were first brought to the HSE's attention in respect of this.  The reality is that there were many flags raised and the flags were missed, and there was nine-year gap between when the flags were first raised and when the internal audit report commenced.  Would it be fair to say that?</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Anne O'Connor, who is the national director of mental health, can provide that information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#G00700"><p>In terms of 2006 concerns, the letter is in.  The concerns related particularly to clinical issues within the organisation.  One could argue more governance related matters was the concern raised in 2009, which was internal to the national office where a staff member there raised concerns.  At that time, Console were met by the then director of the national office - as Mr. Gerry Raleigh has previously said, everybody has changed in the national office since that time.  However, they were met then.  They were brought in.  They were then signed up to a formal performance management process.  At that time, the funding to Console was in the region of &euro;250,000.  It increased slightly in 2008-2009 because they were developing standards but the funding was substantially the same.  They were advised that they could not get additional funding from the HSE.  They were brought in for regular meetings.  The concerns were addressed at that time to the satisfaction of the national office.  The requests that they made for additional funding between 2009 and 2013 were refused.</p> <p>  It is also important to say that the funding that had been provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, pre-2013 really had them in the space of being a grant-aid agreement rather than a service arrangement.  The arrangement differs once you get past a certain threshold of funding and it is a difference type of governance process.  It is a different structure.  Their funding in the overall scheme of things was relatively low compared to many other organisations so it did not trigger a significant audit.  It did not trigger significant scrutiny because the funding was very low.</p> <p>  The critical point here was 2013 when their funding increased, as we have discussed earlier, on the basis of the helpline.  That then moved the organisation into a different category, if you like.  It moved it into a service arrangement where there was a different governance.  At the time of the increased funding, the organisation were advised that they would be signed up to intensive scrutiny on the basis of their funding, and that happened.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that in 2009, they were met on a regular basis and I suppose a limit was put on their funding.  Their funding was not increased and they were advised but the concerns were addressed at that time by the organisation, again, as the director general has said, in terms of the decisions that were made at that time.</p></speech>

I want to move on to another set of issues that relate to this issue as well and direct them to Mr. O'Brien.  I thank Ms O'Connor for the response.</p> <p>  If it was just the red flags that were raised by individuals in 2006, 2009 and 2011, then that would be one issue.  The problem is that when one then looks at other failings within the organisation that should have triggered alarm bells, it adds to the intrigue as to why the HSE took so long to respond.  We now know that there were different sets of accounts, that is, the annual financial statement, that Console had depending on the organisation that was looking for them and different arms of the State were given different sets of annual financial statements for the same year.  We also know that there were unsigned service level agreements.  There were clear failings in relation to documentation.  That also should have added to the concern within the organisation.  It was not only that there were flags raised by individuals.  There were also issues in relation to documentation that Mr. O'Brien is responsible for overseeing.  There are also issues in relation to who were and were not directors, and to salaries.  There were all sorts of issues that should have raised red flags for the HSE as well and it would seem that they all were missed.</p><p>Before he comments on that, I have a specific question on service level agreements.  How many agreements were in place with different arms of the HSE?  There were different agreements depending on the arm of the HSE.  Can we have copies of them?</p><p> What audited documentation was Console obliged to furnish to the HSE?  I refer not only to external audit reports but also to secondary documentation such as management letters.  Were external audit reports furnished to the HSE for each of the years that they should have been?  Was the accompanying management letter, which was also a requirement, furnished?  Mr. O'Brien is the Accounting Officer and, therefore, he will know that.</p></speech>

There was no unsigned service arrangement with Console until 2015.  That issue arose during the internal audit process as opposed to being one of the triggers.  The Deputy referenced the differentiated accounts, which were, in fact, one of the major triggers for the internal audit, and the National Office for Suicide Prevention identified that.</p> <p>  With regard to the receipt of AFSs and management letters, I will ask Mr. Raleigh to answer the question.</p></speech>

It would be where in the course of audit the external auditor identifies any weaknesses in controls that are supposed to be in place in the organisation.

First, I do not doubt that Console provides quality services and we are all conscious that people working for the organisation provided a top class service to clients and I do not want to take away from that.  However, I would like to focus on the call centres.  Finding No. 52 states:</p><blockquote>Console reduce the number of its helplines from six to two between 2012 and 2014.  Console confirmed to internal audit that the cost of running its two helplines in 2014 was &euro;346,652 of which the HSE provided &euro;294,000.  During the audit, internal audit was not provided with documentation to support these costings.</blockquote> <p>Mr. O'Brien is the Accounting Officer who signed the cheque book giving an organisation &euro;294,000 and we cannot find documentation to support the costings.  We do not know, and Mr. O'Brien does not know, therefore, whether that money was used for the purpose for which it was intended.  If that is the case, he cannot say he got value for money.  Console responded to this in the report stating: &quot;With regard to internal audit's comment that information was not provided to support cost allocations for the Console 24-7 helpline, Console confirms that all support information was included in the general accounts framework provided to the internal audit for the years 2012, 2013, 2014.  No other information was requested by internal audit for the helpline&quot;.  It goes on to say, &quot;No HSE request has ever been made to Console management to allocate a specific helpline code in Console's general ledger.&quot;  The auditors responded by saying, &quot;The issue is not about allocating a specific helpline code in Console's general ledger.  The issue is that Console did not provide any supporting documentation during or after the audit to show how it determined these costs as being allocated to helpline costs&quot;.  On that basis, I cannot see how Mr. O'Brien can again say with accuracy that he got value for money.  He can, of course, say that the service itself was a quality service but he cannot say he got value for money if he does not have documentation to support the costs.  He is the Accounting Officer.  The internal report we are discussing states there are national implications for the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien does not grasp these implications at all and there is an element of downplaying this.  Earlier, I pointed to the finding that states, &quot;Systemic means that this could be replicated elsewhere in the HSE&quot;.  Nobody can say with certainty that it is not replicated elsewhere in the HSE.  People will not be comforted by anything that has been said because of what is in the report.  They will be concerned that the reality of the situation has not been grasped by the chief executive officer of the organisation.  That is extraordinary.  Will he respond to my questions on the helpline?  Given there is no documentation to support the costs, how can he say he got value for money?</p></speech>

Benchmarked against other activities, it was good value for money in the sense that we were getting a service, which we now know from information provided to us by the interim chief executive officer was costing Console more to provide than we were paying and, indeed, it will cost us more to provide the alternative service than we were paying to Console.  That is a reasonable basis on which to say that we got value for money.  As the Deputy said, there has never been a question mark around the quality of that service in recent times.  In 2006, there were questions raised about the quality of the counselling supervision for that type of headline, which the organisation at that time addressed by bringing in a separate person as its chief executive officer, who remained there for two years.  That is one of the reasons those issues were dealt with satisfactorily at that time.</p> <p>  This is a slightly different matter, though, from the broader issues within Console that have been uncovered by the internal audit, which go far beyond the resources provided by the HSE, but because of the relatively chaotic nature of the way matters were handled in that organisation, which led to its inability even to demonstrate to us at the time that it was spending more money providing services to us than we were giving it, it was impossible for the internal audit to audit everything in the organisation, which is what has given rise to all the information in the internal audit report.</p></speech>

My understanding is that somebody in quasi-secondment applied for a job in Console, got it, was CEO for a period and is now back with the HSE.  It would be useful for us to know the period in which that person was in Console.  Could those dates be made known to us, if available?  It would be useful to have them.  Did those concerned with the internal audit consult the person in any way as to their knowledge during their time as CEO in Console, now that they are back in the HSE?  Obviously, it would have been at the end of a phone involving the team present.</p></speech>

I do not even know the name of the person but was aware that a person existed in respect of whom what I have described might have been the case.  I suggest that the HSE consult this person on their time in Console.  Perhaps the individual could let the Committee of Public Accounts know their view of the circumstances at the time.  The person would inevitably have knowledge as to the governance or lack of it within the organisation that would supersede the best efforts of the best qualified internal audit time on the planet, particularly at a time when one is being sent to the Navan Road looking for documents, and then Lucan.  Then it had to be postponed and then the HSE had to come back.  Even with that, much of the information was not in the response.  Did it not occur to anybody at all in the HSE that we have an inside track that we are not using?</p></speech>

The principal officer in question subsequently tried to ascertain the facts but, as the hospital had closed, this became difficult.  In that instance, the principal officer invited Mr. Kelly to the Department to discus the matter.  The single item discussed at that meeting was the impersonation as a doctor; there was no reference to any financial or governance matters.  It was ascertained at that meeting that Mr. Kelly had impersonated a doctor in a Dublin hospital in the late 1980s.  The probation Act had been served at that point in time.  Mr. Kelly gave the explanation of his activity having been a prank in this student days.  The matter was in the public domain.  At that point, it was 30 years old.

That is a concern for the committee.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy set out at the beginning of the meeting the standard of good governance, accounting, reporting and auditing that should obtain in any organisation.  I am not sure that the HSE meets that standard.  I did not get that sense from the presentation.  I wish to ask Mr. O'Brien about the strengths and weaknesses of the HSE's oversight arrangements.  In his opening statement, he made an extraordinary comment when referring to oversight.  He stated: "In this context, and given the limited number of HSE internal audit and compliance unit staff, careful consideration needs to be given to the section 38 and 39 agencies that are subject to audit and review."  Mr. O'Brien has told us that one quarter of the HSE's large budget goes to sections 38 and 39 organisations.  That &euro;3.6 billion is the equivalent of many Departments or even groups of Departments.  It is a considerable amount of money.  Why is it that, with a spend of &euro;3.6 billion, Mr. O'Brien is telling us that there is a limited number of internal audit and compliance unit staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#K02200"><p>It is a good question.  There are three distinct reasons.  Prior to 2014, there was no compliance unit.  I will deal with that separately, if I may.  Prior to the implementation of the public sector recruitment moratorium, the internal audit function was somewhat larger at approximately 55 staff.  As the Deputy will recall, there were a number of targeted exit programmes that sought to reduce the number of staff employed in the public service generally, but also in the HSE in what is known as the management and administration category.  Large numbers of people were able to raise their hands and leave the organisation.  The internal audit function shrank to approximately 40 staff during that period.  Although I have had to do so by reprioritising, I have increased that figure to 50 in recent years in response to some of the issues that have emerged.  In addition, I have established the compliance unit specifically to examine how effective we are in monitoring our service arrangements and service agreements.  Mr. Brian Purcell heads that unit.  He has 11 whole-time-equivalents, WTEs, but I am seeking to prioritise three more in order to strengthen that area further.</p> <p>  In all respects, there are limitations on our ability to recruit management and administration staff.  There is a bit of a fatwa in that regard, as colleagues will be aware.  Management and administration grades are not properly valued in general, but without such staff, one cannot have an internal audit function.  Nonetheless, and given the scale of the organisation, although it is the largest internal audit function in the public sector, it is probably significantly undersized.  In a previous question, we were asked about why we relied on external auditors' annual financial statements and certificates.  Essentially, it is because we have to.  We could not replicate that through some other mechanism.  It is worth noting that, between 2007 and 2015, Console received a clean audit certificate every year from its auditors.</p></speech>

That is not an acceptable response to provide to us, given that Mr. O'Brien is the accountable person for that considerable spend.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien, as the accountable person to this committee, is admitting that the HSE's arrangements for oversight and audit are "probably significantly" under-resourced.  How can we, as the Committee of Public Accounts representing the taxpayer, have confidence that public money is being spent properly?</p></speech>

The overall public health sector is currently over its employment control limit and is required to reduce that slightly.  For every extra resource that I put into internal audit or compliance, that is one less resource in health care.  These are the choices with which I am faced.  Against that, I have increased the internal audit function by 25% in the past two and a half years and I have established a compliance unit that was not there beforehand.  I would not want the Deputy to get the impression that I have not significantly prioritised this, but it is not where it needs to be.</p></speech>

Either Mr. O'Brien is acting under instructions or the constraints of the public service embargo or he is doing his job by ensuring adequate accountability.  If he has concerns about the level of resources available for that, presumably it should be highlighted at the highest level in Government.</p><p>I wonder has that serious concern been escalated at ministerial level and to the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

It is my obligation in terms of the totality of my responsibilities as director general.  One of the things we have decided this week is mentioned in the statement of internal financial control.  It is an external review by an external firm of compliance within the section 38 bodies over a three-year programme.  As a result of the St. John of God issue, I have directed that the programme be accelerated and be completed within 18 months and not three years.  I am able to supplement resources in some ways.</p> <p>  We also have a number of internal audit exercises, some of which are well known.  I will not mention them here but they relate to organisations well known and discussed here before.  They are being pursued via external counting firms or auditors.  Many of the issues we are currently discussing arose in a period when the internal audit function was particularly light on resources, and that is why I have added to that resource.  In addition, many of the area operations responsible for monitoring the arrangements they have with particular local providers suffered a significant exodus of management and administration grades during that period.  Consequently, much knowledge was lost.</p></speech>

In light of the new procedures introduced where the committee correctly expects us to be able to provide answers on the day, by and large, the Console issue relates to one part of the organisation and the St. John of God issue relates to another part.  I have simply brought the people who can provide first-hand information as opposed to hearsay evidence to the committee.  That is in an effort to be helpful.

Mr. O'Brien stated there are 1,700 different bodies and I gather from some of the documents provided that 13 of those were audited last year.  Will Mr. O'Brien and Mr. McCarthy provide a view on that as a percentage of the overall numbers that the HSE is responsible for?  It seems a very small and random audit figure.</p></speech>

On a benchmarked basis, given our size, the figure I have in mind for the size of our internal audit function would be 75, as opposed to 50 people.

There is no individual percentage of total spend that would be appropriate to dedicate to internal audit or oversight.  That is why when I made my opening remarks I presented a sort of overall framework in which audit and investigation is just one part.  It is very important to recognise that internal audit is only a part of an overall system of financial control.  Looking at the HSE's financial statements, the statement on the system of internal financial control is very extensive and covers very many other risks that exist within the organisation.</p> <p>  There must be controls around the taking on of grant-assisted bodies.  There must be awareness throughout the organisation that is dealing with grant-funded entities; information must be shared within the oversight organisation.  If anything untoward comes to light, it should be brought together and assessed as a whole.  It is certainly important to have an adequate internal audit function but it must be set in a context that there are other controls relied upon.</p> <p>  References were made earlier to reliance on the sets of audited financial statements.  If the public sector is not able to rely on the audited financial statements of grant-funded bodies, we will grind to a halt.  We must rely on them.  Bodies like the HSE and the Arts Council, among other entities, rely on those kinds of financial statements.  There is an assumption that there is a regime existing meaning the quality of the audit will be sufficient and it can be relied upon.  That does not mean it will not fail from time to time.  I am not judging what has happened in this case but it is certainly a key control.</p> <p>  The other question was around the adequacy of carrying out 13 audits from a total of a couple of thousand funded bodies.  It is a point we have made on a number of occasions.  One certainly needs the capacity to respond and carry out investigations where suspicions are raised.</p><p>It is also probably very important that there be a regime of random audits conducted for no particular reason other than that it is time to look at a selection of bodies.  It may alert them to weaknesses in their own control systems.  Even looking at 13, there will be lessons to be learned.  The important thing is to harvest those lessons and feed them back into the rest of the control system.  Stating there will be a process of random selection may have a deterrent effect, which is probably one of the most important aspects of that type of internal audit function.  A body may be selected for no particular reason, it may not have done anything wrong.  Sometimes there is a criticism that resources are put into the wrong area by auditing entities about which there is no suspicion, and that it may be a waste of time when auditing should be trying to detect irregularities, but the random selection and testing of a reasonable number should tell things that perhaps need to be addressed.  It also has that deterrent effect that anybody can expect an audit at any particular time.</p></speech>

I had to read it and get legal advice.  That was the first thing I had to do.  I started engagement with Mr. Kelly on 26 April on foot of that advice.  Then there was a series of correspondence between me and Mr. Kelly, so I wrote on 26 April and he replied on 10 May.  There were letters over and back throughout the end of April, May and into June.  The concern for us at that time was that at any point, this process could have been injuncted.  The report could have been injuncted up until this week.  Legally, we had to be careful.  We had to put a lot of work into this and in terms of the responses being received from Mr. Kelly, we were being threatened with legal action.  That process continued until the most recent letter I received from Mr. Kelly was on 22 June and the programme aired on 23 June.  There was a series of engagements with Mr. Kelly from the time I received the report, basically advising him that I was very concerned that there appeared to be a breach of the arrangement we had with Console and ultimately stating the HSE had the right, therefore, to cease funding and, if necessary, to seek repayment of funds used for purposes not agreed by the HSE.  That was the tenor of the conversation.  The responses from Mr. Kelly were not satisfactory at any point during that process.</p></speech>

We are reliant on RTE and the programme that exposed this because when I read this - and I will make the same comment as my colleague made in his contribution - I wrote down a question, which was whether the HSE has grasped the nature of the problem.  That is my comment on the 89 recommendations, with only four directed to the HSE and the other 85 directed to the person and the body the HSE had been working with for over a year that led it on a merry dance, in a sense, by going to this office and that office.

As is normal in an audit report, we actually addressed the recommendations to the particular issue.  Console is certainly a unique case, as we see.  At the time of preparing the report, we did not know what the outcome was with Console.  These recommendations, as the director general has identified, will actually feed into the learning process for the HSE in terms of its annual compliance process with the various agencies.  While they are addressed to the CEO of Console, and Console is no longer, these recommendations do not die.  They will be taken on by our national compliance office in terms of informing its learning and interaction with various agencies.  Some of those issues have already been taken on board by the national compliance office.  There is a lot of learning from this report.</p></speech>

I have the greatest respect for the HSE and the services it is trying to provide but there was an abject failure to grasp what was going on.  My question at this point is that I believe the HSE made a decision that it could not do without Console and that the helpline and services it provided were necessary and it turned a blind eye.</p></speech>

I take it back if I am insulting Mr. O'Brien in any way.  However, it seems to me that a decision was made on value for money, to use Mr. O'Brien's own words.  Value for money was being provided and the rest was something the HSE could work on in the future.  The HSE was fully intending to work with this body.  I see heads shaking but 84 recommendations were addressed to this body to help it improve.  Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I can see, the HSE had no intention of stopping this process until RTE acted and other events happened that capitulated the whole situation.  For practical value for money reasons, the HSE was going to allow this body to continue.</p></speech>

First, the matters that arose and were identified by internal audit were brought to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation in February 2016.  Second, while we are satisfied that while the agreement continued we had been obtaining value for money, we were concerned to ensure by one means or another - and we now know what that other means is - these services would continue to be available to clients, which must be a primary concern of ours.  The only reason we had to go through the sequential steps is because that is the appropriate process for bringing an internal audit to conclusion.  I give an example of how the Comptroller and Auditor General or any auditor conducts his or her work.  They reach preliminary findings and give the person against whom the findings are made an opportunity to comment and that is the normal process.  When this came to the national director of mental health, her concern was to ensure that this audit report and her ability to act on it were not in any way compromised.  She had to follow appropriate procedure and give the organisation, with all that we know about it, an opportunity to make submissions to her before she reached her final decision.  That final decision, undoubtedly, would have been to withdraw funding from this organisation and to move services elsewhere.  That is something that was already well under consideration long before "Prime Time".  Just to be clear, without the internal audit, there would have been no "Prime Time" programme.  So, there is absolutely no foundation for suggesting that we were sitting back and saying "Oh, we are getting great value for money; we will let Console continue".  There is not one single shred of evidence to support that contention.</p></speech>

It is important to understand that that is absolutely standard practice.  Those are matters that could only be remedied by the organisation and any internal report that one finds into any organisation, whether it is a funded organisation or not, will have the bulk of its recommendations typically addressed to the people who run it.  Internal audit does not have a role in deciding whether we continue to fund Console.  It does not have an opinion on it.  It does its work and if it believes there are recommendations that should be made to the board of an organisation, continuing or not, it will make them.  There is nothing about that which relates to any thought process about whether Console would continue or not.</p></speech>

As I have mentioned, those recommendations will feed into the process our national compliance office engages in with the various agencies.  Essentially, we are saying that this is what we have found in Console and here is what we are recommending.  The national implications are that HSE needs to look at this because it is not solely about Console, so what can we learn from this process.  They are the potential national implications.</p></speech>

My colleague has just passed me the 2013 grant aid agreement, paragraph 7(5) of which provides that the organisation will permit the executive reasonable access to the organisation's premises and so on and shall permit the executive to carry out inspections of same.  I highlight that because the power was there.  Mr. Raleigh says it has not been used.  The HSE then went through a process of an internal audit and, to put it mildly, co-operation was not forthcoming.  Is that correct?  The HSE is saying that.  I am not talking about Console.  The witnesses are saying that co-operation was not forthcoming.</p></speech>

The internal audit invoked that power, in effect, by going in and doing a full examination.  It was at the request of NOSP that internal audit went in and sought access to records.</p></speech>

There were many concerns prior to this and some of them have been highlighted.  The witnesses have, not dismissed, but dealt with the woman who wrote the letter, which was nothing to do with governance but had to do with counselling.  Then we move forward to the PA and the Department of Health has clarified that it did not pass the information on to the HSE.  Therefore, that is the second alert.  Following Deputy MacSharry, the HSE clarified that someone went into Console in 2009.  So, at that stage the HSE had serious concerns.</p></speech>

The person was not sent in by the HSE.</p></speech>

I want to say at the outset that my thoughts today are with the staff of Console and, more important, with the 6,000 people who use the service each year.  Some two dozen calls will come through to those lines today, responsibility for which has now been taken over by Pieta House.  I wish everyone associated with those services the very best.</p> <p>  Reflecting on the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments on the audit system some moments ago, it is stated in the report that funded organisations have a duty of candour to their funders, in this case the HSE, and that the audit identified that there were three different versions of each year's accounts, one version given to the HSE, one given to the National Office of Suicide Prevention, NOSP, and two versions given to the CRO.  Considering that these audited financial statements are there to tell the full financial story of the business, does Mr. O'Brien feel duped by the versions that were issued to him?</p></speech>

It is not, however, clear from the internal audit report, and there is no basis for me to draw the conclusion, that what we might generally call the misuse of funds related to the funding provided by the HSE, or that the HSE was at a loss in terms of the services that it was paying for, which continued to be provided during the period.  That in no way, however, diminishes the appalling vista that one sees when one reads the report, which is about the totality of that organisation and all of the things that went on there.</p></speech>

I have a letter from the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC, from 26 January of this year to Mr. O'Brien in respect of a community development association, which is in conflict with the HSE, and the PAC wrote to Mr. O'Brien supporting the association's demand for funding, and that has also been referred to the Taoiseach.  That association is uppermost in my mind today when I read this report and the small amount of money in respect of which it is in conflict with the HSE.</p> <p>  Focusing on the helpline funding, it  increased from &euro;250,000 to nearly &euro;600,000 in 2013 to prevent the collapse of the national helpline, as set out in finding No. 52.  The number of helplines reduced from six to two during that period at a cost of &euro;346,000, of which the HSE provided nearly &euro;300,000.  In an earlier response to Deputy Cullinane, Mr. O'Brien said that he was happy with the service, but the issue of the helpline is highlighted.  His statement indicates that particularly relating to the helpline, that sparked the internal audit based on concerns of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I listened to his statement and also his response to the Deputy and it that not a contradiction in that Mr. O'Brien said that he was happy with the service yet the context that sparked the internal audit was the helpline, which he highlighted in his statement, where it says particularly relating to the helpline.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Brien explore that in order that I can better understand it?</p></speech>

Part of the conditionality of that extra funding was that the organisation would open itself to enhanced scrutiny because the funding had increased.  Again, as I mentioned, prior to that it was relatively low in the overall scheme of things, but once the helpline funding was added to it, a more comprehensive engagement took place in respect of performance management.  It was that more robust process that identified or highlighted the difficulties with the organisation.  The engagements that took place on foot of the allocation of that additional funding became very difficult.  The organisation did not supply the information that was being sought.  In a way the additional funding came with an enhanced level of governance and the organisation could not respond to that and that is really where the red flag started to go up.  More questions were being asked and more information was being sought but that was not being made available to the HSE and it was on that basis that the real concern about the organisation started to emerge.  It was not the operation of the helpline, <i>per se</i>.  It was the fact that the funding increased as a result of the helpline and then the governance changed between the organisations.  That is really where the difficulties started to come about.</p></speech>

The work that has been done by the interim CEO since he has gone in has highlighted that again in terms of the service that is provided.  It was the relationship that changed on foot of the additional funding that was able to highlight the concerns, their lack of response and their refusal.  As they had previously committed to engage in an external review themselves, we had asked for that.  We had offered to fund that.  We were told that it was happening.  It did not happen.  There were all those things that came with the extra funding that really highlighted the difficulties.</p></speech>

I cannot square that opening gambit.  Does Mr. O'Brien believe that there were no funds from the HSE that were used in an inappropriate manner?  That goes to core of this.  We could read all the reports all day long, but the core of this discussion and the core of what people listening to and viewing these proceedings today are seeking from us is if Mr. O'Brien believes the HSE got value for money when it purchased these services, does he also believe none of the public funding allocated to Console was misappropriated in any way?</p><p>If Mr. O'Brien believes the HSE got value for money when it purchased these services, does he also believe none of the public funding allocated to Console was misappropriated in any way?</p></speech>

First, we know that the cost to Console of providing this service exceeded the amount we paid for it.  Given what we now know, one almost wonders why no attempt was made to get us to increase the funding.  It seems that no such attempt was made.  It will not be possible to discern whether any of the funds we provided for Console were ultimately misappropriated along the line until we see the full liquidation report.  In other words, we will have to see whether there are remaining debts, etc., that would not remain if the HSE funding had been applied for the intended purposes.  We know that in the overall course of events, the helpline was provided and highly valued by those who used it.  As members have said, we know that it was of a good quality.  We also know that it cost Console more to provide it than we paid for it.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien can say the service cost X and that the HSE provided Y, but that does not address the core of my question.  In the light of the level of detail into which the internal audit has gone - I am not going to refer to specific individual expenditure items - does Mr. O'Brien not have any sense whatsoever that there is a correlation between the public funds allocated to Console and the obvious items of expenditure that did not relate to the provision of the services for which Console was given funding?</p></speech>

That is the first fact.  The second is that the service provided objectively represents good value for money.  I do not mention this as a defence but as a factual statement.  We need to see the net balance in the organisation to reach a conclusion on the final question that arises in this context, which is whether any of the money transmitted to Console was diverted for other purposes.  These details will flow on foot of yesterday's appointment of a High Court liquidator.  One of the challenges identified by the internal audit division was the absolute confluence of the funding.  As members will be aware, Console raised a great deal of money from many sources.  While we were not in a position to unpick all of it, we were able to identify that there was lots of very strange expenditure.  We believe this expenditure was most likely funded from fund-raised money.</p></speech>

If the HSE's belief is that the services were provided and that there is no need to delve any further, how can we get to the actual meat of the issue, which is whether public funds were misappropriated?</p></speech>

That matter is ongoing.  The internal audit division made the report for the obvious reason that it was concerned that a Garda investigation was necessary.  It is of significance that the report in question was made to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  I am not trying to be evasive in any way.  We need to see the net funding position.  If there are bills left over at the end of this exercise which should have been paid from the funding we provided, a certain conclusion can be reached.  The formal referral to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation was made on 25 April, but there had been contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before that.</p></speech>

The real accountability, and what we need to get to, is the issue of the nominated people who had a specific role in respect of these agreements with Console.  Since Mr. Raleigh is one of those persons and he is here, I would like him to answer to this committee how he discharged his role as an authorised signatory and as one of those who had a direct responsibility for the arrangements with Console.  From what I have heard so far, it seems to have been a <i>laissez-faire</i>policy and very hands off, which troubles me.</p></speech>

I am going to put it to Mr. Raleigh that there is.  I think, Chairman, albeit that Mr. Day is retired, it is my understanding that he had a very clear analysis of how serious things were in respect of Console.  I accept entirely that Mr. Raleigh cannot answer for a situation when he was not in position, but if we are to get to the bottom of what happened here and why, I suggest, Chairman, that we need to have Mr. Day come and give some account to the committee.</p> <p>  What I cannot figure out, as other members have said, is that so many flags were raised at so many junctures at very senior levels, and yet the system sat back.</p><p>Let us be honest about this.  I am glad Mr. O'Brien clarified with regard to RTE.  I understand RTE had been working on this story over a number of years, from as early as 2012.  I suspect that was a factor, which was good work on its part, in encouraging the audit and uncovering what was uncovered.  However, if we are to get to the bottom of this, we must know the dynamics at that time, what was done, what letters were sent, what meetings were held, what was not done and why it was not done.  We must establish that there was no inner sanctum or circle or just pure sloppiness on the part of people who were charged with protecting public money.  Can Mr. O'Brien see the point of view of the public, after everything we went through in the last term, that this looks as if the HSE has not only not learned anything but perhaps that it is not in the business of learning anything?  Does it not scream sloppy?</p></speech>

In terms of learning, which was the Deputy's specific question, and particularly in regard to discussions we had with the committee about our audit of pay compliance which led to issues that were heard before this committee relating to the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, and another organisation, the facts that we have carried out this audit, that we have established a compliance unit and that we have strengthened our internal audit functions are evidence of learning.  I cannot speak to the Deputy's suspicions or theories about that period of time because I have no direct, or even indirect, knowledge of that period of time or what was in the minds of those officials at the time.</p></speech>

I am looking at a memorandum to Geoff Day, director, National Office for Suicide Prevention from a Declan Behan, SEO in the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  It is dated 1 February 2009 and it sets out a review of documentation going back to 2004 and raises very serious concerns in terms of the accounts, governance and identifying risks.  My problem, in the limited time available to me today, is that there is a paper trail and that trail shows explicitly that there is a problem here.  It is said not once, but repeatedly, yet the system looked the other way.  That is the nub of the problem.</p></speech>

I am raising this not to bamboozle the committee but to illustrate that the HSE had plenty of internal correspondence to identify, without a shadow of doubt, that it was dealing with a deeply problematic situation.  It might be helpful if the committee asked the HSE to provide all of the correspondence between the HSE and Console, including the internal e-mails, memoranda and so forth.  Much of this has been made available in respect of a previous freedom of information request.  It is only when committee members see the full paper trail alongside the audit, on which we are limited in our commentary, that we can start to make a judgment as to whether people were on their game and doing their jobs, to put it bluntly.</p></speech>

We absolutely agree with that.  We have already agreed to give the committee a dossier, going back to 2005, of the financial and other dealings with Console and any correspondence related to that can be included.  However, Mr. Raleigh, in response to a question from another Deputy earlier, talked about the response to the issues that were raised in 2009, which I understand related to whether Console was a going concern.  I will not go into it in great detail because we will provide the paperwork to the committee, but at that time there was an examination as to whether Console was a going concern.</p></speech>

The HSE writes to St. John of God in 2013.  The organisation writes back saying everything is kosher.  What happens next?  Does the HSE write back thanking those involved and saying it is good to hear St. John of God is in compliance?  Can the HSE officials help us and bring us through that chain or sequence?</p></speech>

There is considerable context and background relating to this issue, as the committee will beware from previous interactions.  At a previous committee hearing, information was furnished to members in respect of the internal audit and the outstanding recommendations.  Two recommendations were not fully implemented at the time, May 2015.  One of these related to the sizing and payments for staff in the section 38 agencies.  A second issue related to 85 business cases.  These would previously have been brought to the attention of committee members.  HSE staff were engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of a process around red-circling these business cases and ceasing these business cases, etc.</p> <p>  There was significant interaction between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from September last year.  On 14 September, the Department of Health furnished us with the relevant circular.  We can establish this as we go on but it might be more helpful to committee members if we give the committee all this correspondence in one go because we may need to reference it.  I have all the correspondence that I will be referring to before me.  On 14 September, we received clarification from the Department of Health relating to the salary rates for chief executive appointments at section 38 agencies.  On 3 September, we received interesting correspondence from the Department on how we would deal with unapproved allowances and remuneration levels in section 38 agencies.  This gave us a mechanism to deal with the 85 business cases that had gone to the Department of Health which I have referenced.  Using the criteria set out in this circular from the Department, we were able to analyse each of the 85 business cases and make determinations on them.  We have done that.  I have each of the decisions set out on a decision template.  This is complex.</p></speech>

The relevant documentation is for circulation with the committee.</p> <p>  The business cases relating to St. John of God were managed internally in the pre-Department interaction.  We got the correspondence dated 13 September.  We went through the 85 business cases and forensically analysed them against the criteria.  Then, we were in a position to make determinations.  This resulted in 41 salaries being approved, while a total of 49 allowances were approved.  This related to allowances and salaries that were not compliant with public pay policy.  That is the mechanism by which we have arrived at the figure.  That information will be fully available to the committee.</p> <p>  It came to our attention during this forensic analysis that St. John of God had not responded in respect of two correspondences that I had issued on 5 May and 20 May of this year.

What I am hearing thus far is that HSE officials knew there was breaking of the rules, they knew there were anomalies that had be resolved and then business cases had to be submitted.  Then, St. John of God did not go through the September framework to make a claim for the business case because those involved were telling the HSE they were in compliance as things stood.</p></speech>

The correspondence stated that all remuneration, including perks paid to employees, was in accordance with Department of Health consolidated pay scales, with the exception of the chief executive salary, which had been identified by the chairperson of the board of St. John of God Community Service in the annual compliance statement 2015 as being non-compliant.  That is correct; one case had been identified as being non-compliant.  The correspondence further stated that non-Exchequer sources of funding were not used to supplement employee remuneration to give rise to rates of individual remuneration, including perks, that exceeded Department of Health consolidated pay scales.  It continued by stating that if unsanctioned payments were paid previously, then all such payments had now ceased.  Finally, the correspondence stated that where appropriate all overpayments had been or were in the process of being recouped as expeditiously as possible.<br/><br/>Again, I have the correspondence and I can share it with committee members.  We were notified on 1 July by St. John of God.  The correspondence goes through the full chronology in a detailed letter.  St. John of God notified us that significant payments had been made to 14 senior managers.  One paragraph of particular interest in the letter states:</p><blockquote>It is acknowledged that details of the above regularisation arrangements and the external financial advice received at this time was not shared with the HSE. The order... understood and took it that arrangements entered into on the basis of salary advice received was regularised in salary arrangements in compliance with consolidated pay scales.</blockquote><p>It is very important to note that 1 July was the first time that the HSE was made aware of these payments to the 14 managers.  The names and payments are listed.  </p></speech>

The director general, who is head of the Health Service Executive, is spending one quarter of his budget on agencies which are not subject to clear oversight.</p> <p>  I do not want to focus on Console but on the macro-issues in terms of how the HSE is spending money on sections 38 and 39 organisations and what protocols are in place.  On the internal audit, would it be unusual for an audit to take more than a year to report back from the date on which it was initiated?</p></speech>

If a limitation of scope is presented to an individual, appropriate action should be taken to ensure funds and taxpayers are protected.  Is Mr. O'Brien satisfied that the HSE reacted to that limitation of scope if it had been found that it was not getting the answers it desired and management within the agencies in question were not co-operating?  Does Mr. O'Brien believe the HSE took appropriate and timely action?</p></speech>

Internal audit did not back off in any way in its pursuit of the issues and it had certainly been made clear by internal audit that it was finding things which, of necessity, it needed to continue to pursue, even though these things did not have a direct bearing on the service relationship that was at the heart of our dealings with Console.</p></speech>

However, it is astounding that where the HSE is not getting basic co-operation from the management of an agency it is funding, it does not take immediate action to protect its interests and those of the taxpayer and to ensure it gets value for money.  I find that amazing.</p></speech>

We obviously have to take decisions in real time across a balance of issues.  There were alternative possible explanations for the behaviour which would not have led to what we now know.  Had we taken precipitative action without having the full facts available to us, we would be aware of the impact on the service.  We would also be aware of the impact on the organisation and the charity sector more broadly, particularly in light of our previous experience dealing with things like the Central Remedial Clinic.  We would, therefore, wish to be certain of our facts.  Bear in mind that at the time in question, as I said earlier, we were satisfied that the service that we were paying for was continuing to be provided.  If we had any view that the funds we were providing were not resulting in the service that we were buying, that obviously would have changed matters but that never arose as a view.</p></speech>

While I do not want to go into the internal audit report, having seen the list of recommendations, failings and shortcomings, I do not accept that the HSE did not receive all that information because it is very clear, based on a broad analysis and without getting into detail, that there was huge evidence that this money was not being spent appropriately and that the HSE should have taken action in that regard.</p></speech>

I hope the Deputy will acknowledge that the audit of Console was absolutely unique.  I do not believe we will ever come across another situation like Console.  In fairness to the agencies we audit, they are usually very co-operative and provide the information we seek.  They have a duty of candour and are quite truthful and open with us.  Console was not like that; it was absolutely an aberration.</p></speech>

Are there protocols in place and can Mr. O'Brien guarantee that they are operating in these agencies?</p></speech>

Without checking whether we are in discussion with anybody about a failure to provide any of that at this moment, I will not give the Deputy a 100% guarantee.  Interestingly, however, I can tell him that on the Revenue website today, Console is listed as a charity.  I can also tell him that we are in receipt of an up-to-date tax clearance for Console and the management letter that was discussed earlier for Console for the period 2014, and that it was a clean management letter.</p></speech>

The letter was sent on 12 November 2014 to all sections 38 and 39 agencies.  It advises them that there has been no current service agreement in place since December 2013.  This means it was sent 11 months after the service level agreements had expired.  According to the letter, all the agencies on which &euro;3.5 billion of taxpayers' money is spent were operating for this period without a service level agreement.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

What the letter goes on to say is that in accordance with the provisions of the previous service agreement, that agreement had been extended.  The reason for that was that this again coincides with the period of time when lots of things were being uncovered about pay in the Central Remedial Clinic and so on and we took a decision to strengthen the service arrangements.  In order to not renew, in terms of issuing new documentation until we changed it, we exercised a valid option simply to extend the validity period of the previous agreement.</p></speech>

I know agreements were in place.  What protocols did HSE put in place on foot of a request for more funding?  Value for money is one of the key things that is listed on the documentation.  What protocols were in place to ensure that the money was being spent appropriately when there was a huge concern about the spending of public money?</p></speech>

So where there is a signed arrangement - in this case, in 2013, the additional funding was provided for the helpline, as we have previously discussed - that change contract notice is a part of the existing service arrangement that is completed.  It means we are not issuing a new service arrangement mid-year and then it is incorporated at the beginning of the following year.  It is a standard process where we provide additional funding or make a different change, not just funding related, mid-year.</p></speech>

It is clear that the stable door has been bolted but the horse is gone to a certain extent when one sees the annual compliance statements.

As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out earlier, it is a matter of necessity that we are in a position to rely on those.  If it becomes apparent, generally speaking, not just for the HSE but for the public sector, that we cannot, then we do have a very fundamental problem which will not be solved in the funding agencies.  It will have to be solved by changes in all their practice.</p></speech>

I think the Chairman will come back and ask us about what I would consider to be learnings from this.  There are fundamental questions, probably beyond the numbers of meetings, about the relationship between the State, as represented by the HSE, and section 39 bodies, particularly what might be called MONGOs - my own NGOs.  I think there are now very serious questions about where we go with that.</p></speech>

He must ensure that we have good governance.  It is clearly evident from anyone's analysis here that it does not look to be the case.  Efforts are being made, but they are being made at a very slow pace and internal audits are taking a long time.  The HSE has taken a long time even to try to get the process of an annual compliance statement for section 39s and it is still not in place.  Mr. O'Brien must take responsibility for the vast budget he has, the spending of that and the protection of the taxpayer at all costs.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct and that is why I am here.  That is part of my function, to answer these questions with him.  In answer to previous questions, I have set out a number of steps that have been taken, at my initiative, in response to earlier adverse events.  Good governance is not a static concept.  One has to introduce things continually, find out what loopholes people have found and then try to plug them.  As I said, we introduced the annual compliance statement for section 38s, which is where the vast bulk of this money goes.  It is typical, when managing risk, that one starts with one's greatest area of risk which is, generally speaking, related to the greatest amount of money.  We established the compliance unit because, frankly, over the years of massive change, reduction of staff and a lot of attrition of people with significant experience, I reached the view that many of those at local level were overstretched in terms of what was being required of them and did not have either the time or the ability to track this in an efficient way.  We set up the national compliance unit to provide oversight, as Mr. Purcell described, and we are continually strengthening that.</p></speech>

There should be more urgency attached to Mr. O'Brien's briefing when he says that the HSE is trying to get oversight in place for section 39s.

What I will come back to him and say is that we have taken a rigorous approach to strengthening governance.  I think we did not start in the best place and it takes time to fix all those.  Our statements of internal financial control are probably the frankest statements of internal financial control that will be found anywhere.  We identify very specifically what we see as the weaknesses and what, in the year in question, we are seeking to do.  We have followed through on all of those.  This has to be judged in terms of where does one start.</p> <p>  There were two founding documents for the creation of the HSE, whether one thinks it was a good or a bad idea.  One was the Commission on Health Sector Finance by Niamh Brennan.  She set out what the infrastructural requirements would be to have a national statutory health executive and how it could function to the best effect in terms of financial systems and so on.  I can say that was not part of the design of the HSE.  The HSE had some inherent weaknesses when it was created.  We are seeing the product of that and we are moving step by step to address those weaknesses.  Without those step-by-step attempts to address these weaknesses, we would not be talking about Console today.  Console would be carrying on in its own merry way, doing what it was doing and that would come out later.  There should be some credit for the action that has been taken.  I am not saying this is a good story but I am saying it is evidence of progress.</p></speech>

I hope he will communicate those concerns to the Revenue Commissioners because that is an outstanding revelation to make in terms of the website, their registration being intact and having a tax clearance certificate.  It is amazing and incredible for the premier body that looks after our affairs.</p> <p>  In terms of auditors who are registered with the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, and the oversight bodies, it should be communicated to those oversight bodies that audit reports were issued on foot of huge revelations.  I hope Mr. O'Brien's office would do that.</p></speech>

Console was set up 14 years ago in 2002 and was funded from 2005 by the HSE under two different arrangements - grant aid initially and then service agreements from 2013 onwards.

Why did the HSE not use the other powers it had? As my colleagues have asked in questions here today, red flags were raised on numerous occasions in Console's 14 years, particularly from 2005 when the HSE started grant-aiding the charity.  It was known.  Why did the HSE not use the powers it had under the service level agreements to actually go in and investigate the concerns of those people in whom it now places so much trust?</p></speech>

We have discussed the concerns from 2009, the meetings that were held and the discussions with the previous director.  At that time measures were put in place to restrict or cap the funding available to the organisation.  That remained the case until 2013.  The service arrangement process to which the Deputy refers did kick in, because what really brought all of this to immediate attention was the submission of the audited accounts for 2013.  Those audited accounts were submitted in 2014 and it was in light of the findings, and other concerns that arose at that time, that we asked internal audit to go in.  We were invoking our powers to go in and expecting full co-operation from the organisation, as we get from any organisation in an audit.  That was what we did at that time; we used our service arrangement and our actual power to carry out the audit.</p></speech>

We can only use civil powers.

Garda&iacute; would be used to perform a raid; I understand that.</p> <p>  With regard to the non-co-operation by the CEO of Console, the chairperson and the external auditor, I presume Console hires an external auditor as a consultant to perform its audits, as most private businesses do every year, and then to give the books over to the HSE for scrutiny.  Are there questions marks from this external auditor? I do not know who it is. I presume it was done in a private capacity.  From what I read in the HSE report, those auditors seem to have ignored the HSE requests for information and took a long time to answer.  They told the HSE they were too busy to meet for two months.  I find it strange that a consultancy, whose good name in the profession as an auditor it would try to keep, would refuse to meet the HSE for two months while the HSE was the paymaster of the charity's funding.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked earlier on about the liquidity of the business and whether our internal audit focused on that.  An internal audit does not focus on issues of that type.  However, as recently as September the 2014 accounts were signed and, as the committee knows, any material event since the completion of the audit should be reflected at the time of the signing.  They were signed as a going concern at that point.  The Deputy is correct in that there are questions to be asked.</p></speech>

We know the documentation that was presented as audited accounts appeared in multiple forms.  We cannot say that was any fault of the external auditor who produced the actual annual financial statement.  We are aware, and it is set out in the documentation, that we were unable to reconcile different sets of accounts which purported to be for the same period.  In other words, there were discrepancies.  However, I am not suggesting that the auditor produced those.</p></speech>

After 11 years of grant aid and payments of public money to Console - and I understand he has been asked this question several times - is Mr. O'Brien happy that the HSE did everything in its powers to ensure there was no wrongdoing or misbehaviour? Is he happy to sit here today and tell us that he did everything within his remit during those 11 years of charity aid to Console? In hindsight, does he feel he could have done more in those years?</p></speech>

I have two separate answers to that question.  Having had the discussions I have had with the officials available to me now, do I think the decisions they took and the considerations they made at the time were reasonable steps?  By and large, I think they were.  Clearly, if one or other of those officials had reached a different view at that time and triggered the internal audit, this might all have come to a head much sooner.  I do not know when these practices that are detailed in the internal audit started.  I cannot answer that question.</p> <p>  In response to an earlier question, I have absolutely no intention of trying to get an internal audit back to 2005.  I see no useful product in that.  It would be a poor use of the resources available to me, which are better deployed considering other agencies at this stage.  Maybe we could have done something differently earlier, had a different view been formed.  So far, however, it seems to me that the views that were formed were not unreasonable in the circumstances and at the time when they of course did not have access to the information that we all have now.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing but it only comes in 20/20 vision.  Foresight is a little more difficult.</p></speech>

Could Mr. O'Brien clarify when Console was a charitable organisation?  Was it a charitable organisation from 2002 or from 2005?  I am mixed up about when it became a charitable organisation and how long it has been a charitable organisation.  Has it been a charitable organisation for the full 14 years or for part of that time?</p></speech>

My understanding is that 14 individuals have been paid outside the public service guidelines as set down.  That is what we are here to probe.  If that money were proven to be paid - they are trying to claim it was paid from private sources within St. John of God - and if it were proven that they breached the guidelines laid down by the HSE under section 18, what powers could the HSE use to get that money refunded from individuals or from St. John of God as a whole?</p></speech>

Clearly, it can be dealt with through the level of funding that we give to St. John of God.  Only St. John of God may be in a position to recover that money.  We do not know the exact circumstances.  It is being suggested that whatever money was involved was funded from private income.  We would need to be satisfied that that is the case and that it was not in fact the recycling of public funding.  I am not reaching any judgment on such matters because to do so would prejudice the process, and I am very clear that St. John of God at this point is co-operating with this internal review, as far as we know, notwithstanding a legal letter.  I want the review to reach conclusions so that we all have the full facts, and then we can decide on the appropriate-----</p></speech>

We visit them by agreement.  It is not an audit of those entities and, therefore, we do not make a report - or at least a public report - on it.  If issues come to light, we bring them to the attention of the HSE.  In 2013 one of the bodies that we selected was St. John of God, so we visited its campus.  We went through a number of issues with them, including the remuneration of the CEO.  We identified a salary being paid from St. John of God community services which was compliant, but what we also identified with them was that there was a top-up payment from another source.  We were not told what that source was and we were not told the amount.  We saw the CEO's contract but the salary details were blanked out.  We informed the HSE of that and, lest it be misunderstood, that information was with the HSE in 2013.  Obviously, it was not the only organisation in which we had seen top-ups, and this was happening at the time of the internal audit investigation of top-ups.</p></speech>

Four hours later we have not really got anywhere.  I want to talk a little about that.  Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on here is like pulling teeth.  We have a duty to do so.  In his role as CEO, as the accounting manager or officer or whatever phrase is used now, considering the change in role of the Department of Health, does Mr. O'Brien accept that he is responsible for ensuring that all public moneys are spent appropriately and must in general do everything he can to ensure that happens?</p></speech>

Therefore, when it comes to the organisations - and a huge number of them are funded - there are various ways of analysing their performance and of looking under the hood at what they are doing.  For instance, outside of the actual financial auditing, which is a big strand that should net issues, were the characters in question, the people who are heading up many of these organisations or in key roles, checked?  Would they have been checked out by the HSE?  Would the HSE have looked at all these organisations, ensuring that the people who are running them did not have track records over which there are questions, or did not have issues in the past such as pretending they were people they were not, or anything like that?  I ask in general terms.  Does the HSE have a track record of checking out the people behind many of these organisations in general?</p></speech>

My question relates to the fact that the scenario since 2006 has been that various alerts were put in place which, for various reasons that we have not fully got to the bottom of, were never checked out.  My point is that in such scenarios, such alerts should trigger audits.  I am trying to get beyond the technicality of statements to the effect that the HSE did not have a process by which a financial audit would have happened.</p><p>I am trying to get to the point of whether there was any initiative in the HSE to consider if there were any problems.  Was there any foresight to ask if the issues raised should be checked out, as the normal net of financial checking and auditing had not worked?  Was it basically a case of boxes being ticked so the area would not be opened?  Was it a case of ensuring the HSE was covered in paperwork rather than ensuring public money had been spent appropriately?</p></speech>

In 2006, the issue was not financially related; it was around the supervision of counselling.  As has been answered before, changes occurred in that organisation at that time that were understood to have addressed that issue.  Those issues are not found to be present today.  In 2009 the query was raised as to whether the organisation was a going concern; it was examined and the organisation was found to be a going concern.  I know it is possible now, with what we know as a result of Dr. Smith's work, to put all these together, particularly in the context of some of the antics we now know about, and say there was of course a clear evidential trail.  I do not believe it was at the time.  It is not fair to say nothing was done.  It is already on the record of this meeting what was done.  Certainly, one could take issue with whether that was enough but to say that nothing was done does not seem fair.</p></speech>

The HSE must look after an incredible number of funds and public money and this committee must ensure that is done appropriately.  I will have questions for the Department of Health in a moment.  The HSE is an organisation.  It is not just about the financial tracking and auditing, which is clearly critical, but there must be intelligence in the organisation from various means - it is a small country - that should from time to time check out these organisations to ensure that public money is being spent appropriately and the people leading the organisations are appropriate to serve public money.  I understand they are appointed by a board but they produce the services.</p> <p>  As an organisation spending this amount of money, is the HSE being rigid?  Arising from this rigidity, do those processes, protocols and checks work sometimes but not at other times?</p></speech>

Reading this audit report is a bit like reading the script of "Catch Me If You Can".  One wonders if we are talking about Leonardo DiCaprio or somebody else.  I get that and it is extraordinary.  How does a process that took place in 2013 as to whether to rescue a helpline reflect back to a news report in 1987 about this individual impersonating a doctor, for which there was no criminal conviction, or that at one point he wandered the streets in an airline pilot's uniform?  How does one gather that kind of intelligence?  Obviously people will come out of the woodwork and tell us once the issue is out there but how can we get that cold?  It just does not happen and it is not realistic to suggest that.</p> <p>  With regard to the central point of the question, if the HSE was being truly rigid, my response to this would be to stop section 39 funding completely until I could audit all of them internally but that is just not practical.</p></speech>

With regard to the funding given out and whether there was misappropriation of public funds, it must be the case if one believes the following logic.  These organisations are funded collectively through funding given by the HSE and various fund-raising mechanisms.  One might imagine a big pie.  Nobody can distinguish which money is being used for what.  This document, which is one of the most incredible that any of us has ever seen or read, demonstrates that public money is being misappropriated.  We do not know which part of the pie is used in all the cases.  Does the witness agree with that statement?</p></speech>

I will get into a little more detail.  When this process started, how did it take 11 months for it to stop when issues arose?  The body in question was still allowed to provide a service.  I cannot understand how the HSE did not mobilise more quickly and do something about it more quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#AA01200"><p>If we were playing what I would metaphorically refer to as the "cover your arse" game throughout this process, that would probably have been a good thing to do.  I would have shut it down before it made its representations and due consideration had been given.  If we had been wrong, we could have destroyed not just one charity but perhaps the overall charity sector.  We needed to follow the steps, conclude due process and follow the principles and practice that internal audit is required to follow before reaching a conclusion based on the full evidence.</p> <p>  When the report was provided to the national director who had to make a decision on what to do, the legal advice on it was again very clear, given that we have a contractual arrangement.  She needed to give the body an opportunity and, right up to the day before it was completed, additional alleged evidence was being provided to try to put things in a different light.  If we do not go through those steps, we do not get the right conclusion.  The other issue is that throughout this period, the services we were buying were being provided in a way that was valued both by the clients using them and by ourselves.  We must take that into account and we did.</p></speech>

In doing so, there may have been a better response.  That is a subjective view.</p> <p>  I was taken by some of the answers from Ms O'Connor and Dr. Smith.  I do not want to put words in the witnesses' mouths but what I got from the submission was that there is an equation between the amount of time and effort taken for auditing and the fact that there are so many organisations, with some of them dealing with smaller amounts of money.  One must create a balance and justify it in that sense.  There are three categories of funding, which are below &euro;250,000, over &euro;250,000 and section 38 versus section 39.  I should say that &euro;250,000 is not Mickey Mouse money.  It is an incredible amount of money.  That equation needs to change.  If one applies to a local authority to get a grant of &euro;8,000 for insulation in a house, there is a volume of checks, balances and paperwork that we all know about.  It is incredible.  There is one meeting per year about these organisations, with a couple of boxes being ticked on a piece of paper.  For the people looking at this from the outside, that cannot happen any more.</p> <p>  I have questions about the governance framework for the Department of Health.  It is absolutely unacceptable that the Secretary General of the Department of Health is not here today.  There has been a change in the relationship with the HSE and the Secretary General should be here to close that circle.  Whoever is representing him here today might answer the following question.  Is the Department of Health satisfied the HSE has the best governance framework and controls in place to ensure that public money is being spent appropriately by all these organisations?</p></speech>

In response to the comment from the Deputy and earlier comments, I make specific reference to the letter of invitation issued from the committee to Jim Breslin, the Secretary General, which specifically said, "I am directed to request that you designate a senior official from your Department".

We share the view that the moneys involved with Console are very significant.  The overall amount of money across all these various agencies is very substantial.  There is probably a question around what triggers should institute certain actions and whether that needs to be worked on further, but we in the Department are supportive of the systems and structures the HSE has put in place, is developing and is continuing to develop.  We support what is being done there, but we expect things will be enhanced and improved over time.  I hope that is an adequate answer for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Across public sector funding generally, one might always want to have stronger controls, but there is a question of proportionality in terms of the cost of the controls and whether we bring the whole system to a halt by virtue of doing so.  The reference to local authorities and the installation grant is interesting.  It would be interesting to see what the cost and the checks and balances on that &euro;6,000 grant was, but in the overall scheme of things there is a system in place.  It needs to be improved.  We are clear on that and it is a process that is ongoing.  I could not say that the system is adequate, but it is difficult to say how we would define what would be adequate in the overall context of proportionality.</p></speech>

When we talk about proportionality and costs associated effectively with framework, management structures, controls etc., it is quite obvious to me and the rest of the committee that the balance in place for managing this process, the controls framework, simply is not up to the level required.  Based on that, does the witness think it would be better in future if the Department of Health directly managed the allocation of these funds to section 38 and section 39 organisations?</p></speech>

We will talk about resources if we have to.  We might be able to help with that.  In principle, given what we are hearing now, given the scale of this funding, given the direct responsibility of the Secretary General, who is the official Accounting Officer, for want of a better phrase, does the witness think that would be a better or stronger process than what we have in place now?</p></speech>

There are organisations currently having to address that.  I do not think, being realistic about it, that we will ever get to a point across this number of organisations, many thousands of organisations, where we would be able to say there is not a single one of them that does not have an issue going on.  It would be foolhardy of me to reach that view or to suggest it to the committee.</p></speech>

Every organisation will identify areas of weakness and seek to address them.  In this context, we need to further strengthen the work of our compliance function.  We are, as the committee knows, bedding down nine community health organisations, which will have a very significant responsibility around the management of contracts for services.  We have virtually completed the management arrangements for those.  A whole series of steps are being taken that will undoubtedly improve the compliance, value for money and safeguarding environments, but they cannot be done instantaneously or in one go.  Even when we have done them all we will need to think of more things we have to do, because there will always be weaknesses in the system.</p></speech>

We have asked for various documentation.  I have no doubt the witnesses will supply that.  I am not suggesting anything, but it would be helpful as a group, and there is a serious group here, if collectively as a management team - I say this to the Department of Health as well - they could forensically go back through documentation in their organisations and in the Department, and bring to our attention any documentation, correspondence, e-mails, references that they feel it is worthy for this committee to have relating to us dealing with this subject matter.  In other words, we will give a pass as regards a period of time to go and find and give us whatever information.  In this period of time we cannot ask for every single piece.  We found out about letters today that we did not know about.  There may be other documentation that we will not even ask about because we do not know about them.  Would the witness and those in the Department please forensically look and then bring it to our attention?  Subsequently, if it is not brought to our attention, we would have questions.</p></speech>

Some of what I will say is related to what Deputy Kelly said.  One of the perils of being among the last questioners is that one's questions may have been asked in some form already.  All of the good ones are gone, but I will roll out the greatest hits from the committee so far.  I am curious about what was said previously and the belief that no public money had been spent inappropriately.  I find that hard to understand, and many in the public would also find it hard to understand.  As Deputy Kelly put it in his pie metaphor, if 42% of the money is going to an organisation from the HSE in a given year and 58% of the money is coming from other sources, that goes into a bank account.  If I donate &euro;1 to an organisation and the HSE also donates &euro;1 to it, if &euro;1 is spent inappropriately, it is 50% of the money from both of us that is spent inappropriately.  Proportionately, it would appear that public money has been spent inappropriately.  Would this not be the case in that theoretical example?</p></speech>

First, I said I cannot reach an absolutely definitive view until I see what emerges-----</p></speech>

Second, we were not donating money.  We were buying a service, and we got the service.  We are not a donor.  We were not putting money in the Console box.  We were seeking a specific service which we know we received.  Had it had a more effective system of accounting, one that would have served it better in the circumstances, probably our audit would have only looked at our money and looked for corollary expenses equivalent to it.  We are told by the former interim CEO that, in his view, the costs incurred by Console over that period of time were greater than the amount of money we were giving.  That is how I form that view, but I have not reached, and cannot reach, a definitive view until we see the end product of what is in the net residual balance sheet.</p></speech>

Is that not a low threshold of expectation to the extent that the witness says he bought a service, received that service and perhaps paid less for it than it cost, in view of the fact that the association of this organisation with the HSE gives it a veneer of credibility such that people are inclined to donate also?</p></speech>

In fact, very few people do, to be frank.  This is a charity which had an extraordinarily high public presence and reputation.  In fact, one of the boxes of evidence that was sent to us by the former CEO to show that we should not have any concerns was a box full of photographs of all of the amazing people he had been photographed with, including foreign heads of state.  I do not think it sought to leverage its relationship with us to establish its brand at all.  In fact, recent weeks withstanding, it had a fabulous brand.  I am aware of the net point the Deputy is making, but I do not think it was used to that purpose.</p></speech>

There definitely is a clear case that Console utilised its HSE link to a certain extent to establish a veneer of credibility whereby people would presume that there had been an internal audit process, probably before the recent internal audit had taken place.</p></speech>

Sometimes they are dragged kicking and screaming to include the HSE logo, for the reasons I alluded to earlier.  However, this is an organisation that had clean audits by its external auditor.  It had a tax clearance certificate and a clean management letter.  Even now, it is on the charity list.  External consultants in a review, known as the Ruby review, that was provided to us in January 2015 - I think it was provided to us to try and head us off - said that Console had a high standard of corporate governance and financial management.  The organisation had many ways to try and bolster its public credibility.  Let us face it: this is an astonishing fall from grace.  If I had asked a random sample of 100 people six months ago where they would put Console on the ladder of credibility, it would have been right up there.</p></speech>

One ought reasonably to be able to rely upon the annual financial statement and its audit certificate, as provided by registered audit practitioners who are in a regulated profession and filed with the Companies Registration Office.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier, the entire public service, not just the HSE, must be able to rely upon that.  We have had occasion in the past to make complaints to professional regulatory bodies in other well known incidents, but it has not got us anywhere.  This will be pursued, but if we find - and I am not suggesting we have found - that this is a widespread problem, it would be a fundamental problem on a whole-of-society basis.  It goes to the heart of corporate governance architecture for both the public and the private sectors.</p></speech>

From a practical point of view - Mr. O'Brien alluded in his opening statement to lessons learned - I understand that the staff numbers in the HSE's internal audit team - forgive me if I am wrong - were 55 pre-crisis, then 40, and now 50.

With regard to the HSE's capacity to carry out internal audits - this is probably a "how long is a piece of string" question - how many audits can take place in parallel and how many audits are taking place in parallel currently?</p></speech>

By the very nature of internal audit, some audits would be at planning stage, others would be in the middle of field work, others we are analysing, etc., and others are waiting on management comment.  We could have a number of audits ongoing at any particular stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#DD00200"><p>Can I offer an additional piece of information on the internal audit process?  It is not directly related to Deputy Rock's question but I think it is an area that will be of interest to the Deputy because there was some discussion earlier about the role of the HSE's audit committee.  For clarity, documentation was sent on request to the committee yesterday that had certain information that is not really reflected in the discussions that we are having today.</p> <p>  The audit committee was briefed in relation to this audit on two occasions - once at the end of last year and once at the beginning of this year.  The audit committee has a cyclical approach to its meetings, not unlike the Committee of Public Accounts in some respects.  Consequently, once an internal audit has been completed, in this case on an external party, and then goes to the relevant national director for action, once that period has been completed, the internal audit committee looks to see if the HSE has dealt with the issue in an effective way and what are the lessons.  An inference was being drawn that in some way there ought to have been an emergency meeting of the audit committee.  The audit committee does not have an executive function.  It is very similar to other audit committees in the public sector and if the committee is in any doubt, it may be helpful for the Comptroller and Auditor General to speak to this issue as well.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly hit on this as well.  At this stage, should the HSE's practices be changed to ensure that boards of directors are verified or at least contacted prior to an internal audit, and that perhaps it should not take getting to the stage of such a drastic measure as an internal audit simply to verify the board of directors of an institution that is receiving funding at a service level agreement level from the HSE?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#DD00600"><p>Deputy Rock is referring to the fact that various individuals have, as it were, expressed surprise that they were directors of this particular entity.  We will certainly be looking at that as part of the outcome of this process.  The Charities Regulator was, in fact, established as a result of some discussions that we were party to, not in this room but the equivalent room that the Committee of Public Accounts sits in on other occasions.  Its role is developing and it will have investigative powers.  We will have more regulation generally, and this will be of benefit to us in this regard.  We will have to look to see what we might have to do arising from this issue.</p> <p>  It is not a normal process for an internal audit to contact all directors of a board.  Normally, they obtain their information and reflect back to the CEO and then in due course we expect that the final report is considered by a board.  That is what normally happens.  Obviously, in this case, that would not have added any value.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.830" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#DD00800"><p>Sure.  What I would not want to do, however, is to have the HSE take on a whole series of responsibilities which are wider than the HSE and which might more properly be done by other public bodies.  It is interesting that if one's name appears on the list of directors filed at the Companies Registration Office, even if one does not know about it, one is a director in law.  When this all came out, persons who were in that situation found themselves having to act as directors of Console during this interim period and making the decisions about liquidation, etc.  At a macro level, it would be far simpler and more effective that rather than the HSE, given that we are basically a health service provider, having to start verifying the names and legitimacy of registrations of directors, that such might be a change to the way we handle the registration of companies at a societal level.  That would be more effective.  Otherwise, one would have all arms of the public sector, rather than just one, having to do this.</p></speech>

That is a poor reflection on systems within the HSE.  If there were robust oversight systems, it would not be down to individuals.  The system should operate properly and records should be kept of complaints.  I acknowledge there has been constant churn in the HSE but saying that everybody has changed roles is not an answer to a question about whether there was a complaint ten years ago.  There is an acceptance that concerns had been raised of one kind or another since 2009.  I think the officials will accept that.  How was it then that, in 2013, Console's funding increased by 120% given many of those concerns were live and under consideration?  Why did the HSE increase the funding by 120% without, apparently, due diligence?</p> <p>  My second question relates to St. John of God and why action was not action.  We were told that the HSE was informed by St. John of God in 2013 that it was in breach of public sector pay rules.  The Comptroller and Auditor General told us that he informed the HSE in 2013 in the same vein, yet Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement: "Consequently, I have asked the HSE's internal audit division to conduct a review of these matters as a matter of urgency."  This matters were brought to his attention by St. John of God and the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2013 and, therefore, it is hardly "as a matter of urgency" that he is dealing with them in 2016.  What is the reason for the three-year delay?</p> <p>  My final question relates to auditing.  The HSE funds 304 organisations in excess of &euro;250,000 a year.  There are questions about others.  Could Dr. Smith take us through the procedure?  Presumably, all 304 organisations are required to have audited accounts.  Does the HSE receive copies of those accounts?  What is the oversight scenario regarding such accounts?  Dr. Smith referred earlier to accounts on which she conducts the external audit.  Who were Console's auditors?  Did they at any stage raise concerns with Dr. Smith about probity issues?</p></speech>

I will ask Ms O'Connor to address the 2013 funding issue for Console.  Dr. Smith will get some information on the audit and will deal with that in turn.  The 2013 event was not St. John of God representatives telling us they were not in compliance; it was telling us that they had addressed their compliance following work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as a result of which having declared themselves compliant, they were out of the major process that went on with section 38 bodies.  The national compliance unit, as part of the work described in the statement of internal financial control, is "rolling through the 38s".  A review commenced in April, which is being carried out by external consultants from Deloitte.  Did the process start in May?</p></speech>

After that, St. John of God representatives gave us written assurance - and we have agreed to provide this correspondence - that they had addressed the issue of non-compliance.  We then went through that massive health sector wide pay compliance issue.  As part of our general controls following the establishment of the compliance unit, we had decided to go through each organisation sequentially and it just happens that that process is under way in St. John of God.  What is now urgent is that the suggestion has come out into the public domain, not having been disclosed to us, that 14 persons received substantial lump sum payments to buy out their non-compliant pay.</p><p>"Buy out" may not be the right term.  There are instances in which buy outs can be approved in certain circumstances.  If someone has got ten years to go, they might buy out one or two years.  In this instance, it appears the full ten years may have been paid out.  This is the subject of the review.  The reason it is urgent is that it is one of the organisations that declared itself compliant some time ago.  It has brought to our attention only one issue of non-compliance, which was not related to these 14 people.  That is why I am having an urgent review now.  It is nothing to do with what happened in 2013, although it obviously relates to 2013 because it may be that the assurances given to us in 2013 were not whole and complete.</p></speech>

That happened on a large basis throughout this process.  Unless it was disclosed to us, we would not have known that through, apparently, some separate entity - part of the family, so to speak - the funds said not to be public funds were used to pay an additional sum in respect of the surrendering of that entitlement.  Again, I speak without the benefit of the results of this audit.  We will happily share all of the outcome of the internal audit once it is complete.</p></speech>

Those issues were discussed with Console.  In 2013, the funding increased.  At that time, it was urgent.  The helpline was about to collapse and there was a very significant focus on supporting people who were bereaved by suicide at that time.  An immediate action had to be taken.  Console were already a provider of a similar helpline and it was felt that was the best fit at that time.  The concerns that we see here in respect of the audit came to light and really materialised in 2014.  It was when the audited accounts for 2013 were presented to the HSE in 2014 that the red flags went up.  At the time the funding was given for the helpline in 2013, we did not have that information.</p></speech>

The issue really related to the financial situation of the organisation and some concerns in governance.  The previous director met the organisation in 2009 to discuss those concerns and to agree, through a series of performance management meetings, what the action needed to be.  A cap was put on its funding.  It requested additional funding in subsequent years and did not get it.  The only time it received additional funding was in 2013 when it took on the helpline.</p></speech>

It was not a general increase to Console's funding.  It was to specifically provide a helpline.  It was locked into Console agreeing to greater scrutiny and an external review of its services.  Again, I apologise, but I was not around at that time.  It was a matter of timing.  It was an urgent situation and there was not another provider.  Again, I cannot comment on the detail because I was not involved in it.  However, as I understand it, at that time it was urgent and a body had to take on the helpline.  Console was the provider already providing a helpline in that space.  It had the skills and experience to do it.  It is important to state that there have not been concerns about the service.  Our priority always has been to support the service users.  There was not a concern about Console's capacity to provide the service it was providing.</p></speech>

The heading is &quot;A note to editors&quot;.  It states:</p><blockquote>A review is underway into the St John of God Order&rsquo;s payments to mitigate a future possible pension liability and contractual obligations in 2013, which resulted in payments of &euro;1.64m to 14 employees.  On Friday 8th July, the HSE stated to the media that the Saint John of God Order was not in compliance in respect of these payments.  This statement was made before the review had even commenced and the Order believes such a statement is seriously prejudicial to a fair review.<br /><br />Separately the Order is still awaiting a response from the HSE on this matter, following a letter it sent to the HSE on Monday of this week.</blockquote> <p>I will cut in here to say that that letter was from a firm of solicitors acting for the order.  It goes on to state:</p><blockquote>The Order is very keen to co-operate fully with the HSE review once a fair and due process is followed.<br /><br />Understandably, subsequent media coverage has reflected the prejudicial nature of the HSE statement confirming the result or final determination of the proposed review.  Radio and TV interviews and commentary and press headlines and reporting have included frequent references to &quot;salary top-ups to 14 St. John of God&quot; personnel.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness and factual correctness, the order humbly requests that editors would use &quot;payments (totalling &euro;1.64 million) to St. John of God employees, which are now subject to HSE review&quot;.</blockquote> <p>Then in bold print one line appears which states:</p><blockquote>To describe them as salary top-ups is simply incorrect.<br /><br />The payments were made following independent professional advice to discharge a possible future pension liability and contractual obligations, and should not be described as a salary top-up.<br /><br />Further, also note the St. John of God Order is a worldwide organisation.  St. John of God Community Services (Ireland) is a section 38 entity.  Unfortunately, there have been frequent general references to the St. John of God Order and also references to St. John of God Hospital.  The hospital is not a section 38 entity or part of St. John of God Community Service.<br /><br />We would therefore request that TV footage or photographs do not feature the hospital.<br /><br />Our office will be happy to accommodate the media by arranging permission to shoot or photograph the appropriate facilities that are part of the section 38 St. John of God Community Services.  <br /><br />Kind regards.</blockquote> <p>It is signed by a named individual for a named PR company.  Then it states, &quot;On behalf of the St. John of God Order&quot;.  I will not name the PR company in this instance.</p></speech>

We have not used the terminology "top-ups".  It is the popular phraseology for payments that might be received that are outside the approvals given in the Department of Health consolidated scales.  They are obviously seeking to draw a distinction between an actual salary payment that occurs every month and these payments which, it has been alleged in some media circles, were effectively the advance payment of those.  They are clearly stating that they have legal advice and so on.</p> <p>  A procedure was put in place as part of the regularisation and the process of dealing with all of this, which involved the HSE and the two Departments that are here, whereby agencies that wish to seek sanction for buy-outs - special arrangements based on the legal situation in which they found themselves - could in certain circumstances have been approved, all other things being equal.  These were not part of that process, so, whatever these payments are, they were not sanctioned or approved in accordance with that process.</p></speech>

Because, if what Mr. O'Brien is saying is correct - and he has just accepted that these were very serious failings in terms of finance and governance and that this was extraordinary, possibly one of the worst that he has seen in terms of failure - surely that proves that the controls within the HSE failed.  One of the questions I asked Mr. O'Brien earlier was whether he believed there were any failings on behalf of the HSE, and he said "No".  Yet the actual internal audit report says something else, so how does he square that?</p></speech>

Clearly, our understanding of the past is now influenced significantly by this report, and it gives rise to serious issues about how we will in future safeguard funds in section 39 agencies.</p></speech>

If Mr. O'Brien accepts that there are serious failings of an extraordinary nature, in terms of finance and governance, within an organisation that is funded to the extent of 40% or more by the HSE-----he may not be the Accounting Officer - and, by the way, the Secretary General of the Department should have been here - but as the Accounting Officer to him-----</p></speech>

So I do not think it is appropriate to criticise him for not being here when he was not invited, because I have no doubt he would have come.</p> <p>  To go back to the central point, however, the issues that have been well documented in the internal audit report were failings within the organisation.</p></speech>

It is so extraordinary, so unbelievable that this could happen, and yet it happened.  The HSE put controls in place to ensure that such things do not happen.  If these things did happen, it means that the controls that Mr. O'Brien's organisation has in place have failed.  The fact that he cannot accept that or cannot say that, I find extraordinary.</p></speech>

The reason these are section 39 agencies is that they are not under our control.

There has been a good discussion of what those services are - I will not seek to reiterate it in the interests of time - which were purchased or paid for from that organisation for the benefit of clients who received that benefit.  Had there at any time been an issue about the quality of those services in this period, then that would have been a different thing.  It was concerns identified by the National Office of Suicide Prevention, particularly these incompatible sets of accounts, taken together with its failure to co-operate with the enhanced governance arrangements that flowed from the increase in funding for the helpline, that triggered an audit.  Because the organisation had not properly segregated what it was doing, we could not only audit the services we were providing for; the audit had to be global in nature.</p></speech>

Our job here is to make sure that controls are in place that are robust and sufficient to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent appropriately, and that there is sufficient oversight and governance.  It seems to me, from reading the report, that there are questions for the CRO about its processes.  I know somebody who contacted the CRO to establish a company and was told that he did not need photographic identification.  He was not asked for a PPS number.</p></speech>

In regard to any system of internal financial control, it is almost impossible to design a system that will definitively prevent any abuse, fraud or irregularity.  It is almost impossible to do it.  The best one can do is put a system in place that gives reasonable assurance that controls operate in the way that is expected.  Obviously, it is important, having put the system in place, to check that it is working.  I discussed that yesterday regarding a number of bodies - I think it was the ETBs - where I drew attention to the fact that the annual review of the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control had not been carried out, and I made the point that that is a very important exercise that is done.  In fairness to the HSE, I would have to say it does take that very seriously.  It does carry out that review of the effectiveness of the system and it accepts and discloses in the statement on internal financial control that it is not perfect and that it needs to be improved.  We make recommendations along those lines, and it engages with us seriously, but there are things that have to be improved in the system.</p></speech>

First, it was helpful that the witnesses came here today and attempted to answer questions.  That is welcome, and it is good for society.</p> <p>  I have made observations and asked questions.  I am sticking with those on the HSE's lack of action before and after the audit.  I will not go over it again.  I compliment the witnesses on the audit, which is very detailed.  My difficulty is that there was no action before by the HSE and I questioned its action afterwards.</p> <p>  It has been pointed out that the HSE received signed, audited reports - this was touched on by Deputies earlier - over a number of years.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

That is a very serious issue.</p> <p>  Second, with regard to staffing levels, has Mr. O'Brien ever put in a request for additional staff to allow him carry out his functions, given the number of organisations - 1,700 - under his remit?  How can he possibly assure the public that he can monitor those if he does not have adequate resources?  Has he requested adequate resources?</p> <p>  My final observation is separate from that entirely, and concerns responsibility on the part of the HSE.  When we as a society raise an organisation to the level we raised it generally, where the person gets a Person of the Year award and the President of Ireland is patron of that organisation, serious questions must be asked of ourselves in regard to unaccountability.</p> <p>  My two specific questions are on the audited accounts and whether Mr. O'Brien made a request for extra resources.  With regard to the accounts, Mr. O'Brien made an extraordinary statement, and I do not doubt him, that he made complaints to regulatory bodies in the past-----</p></speech>

I am self-employed and have to pay a good sum every year to get my accounts professionally audited and sent in for tax returns.  All those outside consultants are governed by a code of conduct and proper procedures.  I believe an oversight body deals with that.  I will ask a question that was asked already.  Since 2005, when the HSE started giving grant aid to Console, have there been audited accounts every year for those 11 years?  Are those audited accounts signed off by the consultant and were they to Mr. O'Brien's satisfaction?</p><p>I have a broader question about the 1,700 charitable organisations.  Do they submit audited accounts every year signed off by professional people who put their name to them and who have a standard of conduct to adhere to?  Does the HSE take their audited accounts as <i>bona fide</i>?  If there is a problem or skullduggery - that is probably the wrong word to use - with audited accounts, we have a bigger problem in the system overall.</p><p>I have another question.</p></speech>

Console as a company was established in December 2006.  The first set of accounts registered with the Companies Registration Office, for the year 2007, was registered in 2008.  The accounts for 2007, 2008 and 2009 stated that the company was non-trading.  In 2010, the CRO records the first set of accounts.  They were done for half a year from July to December 2010.  From then on - 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 - all of the accounts got clear audit certificates from their external auditors.</p></speech>

Given what we see in the HSE report, is there a question mark over someone?  I do not want to name anyone or say anything wrong, but are there question marks over those audited accounts the HSE accepted?  Are there questions to answer, particularly since 2010?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said he was learning every day about procedures and enforcement.  With regard to the general structure in Console, the CEO, the chairperson and the board, or so-called board, was in place.  From what I read it seemed to involve three members of one family, although other names might have been mentioned.  Did warning bells not ring in the HSE?  We are talking about 1,700 organisations.</p><p>What was in place to make sure the board or whoever was running the institution was up to scratch or providing the HSE with answers as to whether there was a proper structure or proper governance in place?  It seems to me that there was no proper structure in Console for years, only an individually run, family-controlled one.  Did it not signal a warning somewhere along the line that there were no outside board members, no proper board, no proper report and no proper, minuted board meetings and that when the HSE looked for information, there was no board there to answer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-15a.1017" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016071500002#JJ00200"><p>The founder CEO and family-type NGO model is not unique to Console and, to be fair, many very effective NGOs have operated that way in the past.  It is clearly no longer best practice.  We have seen that emerging through the sector.  My view on the matter - it is a fact, actually - is that the composition of the board is a matter for the company itself.  There may need to be some examination of that issue, but what has happened in the charitable sector is a bit like what happened in the banking sector.  I am sure this matter will be discussed in other circles.  Whether there is a need for a fit and proper person test to be a director of a charity is a question that emerges from this issue.</p> <p>  With the Chairman's indulgence, I will add one final point.  We have talked a lot about section 38s and section 39s.  It is not a distinction that we have created.  The sections are in the 2004 Health Act.  They were created by legislation.  They reflect the will of the Oireachtas at the time.  They create a distinction between different types of organisations.  That is why they are funded under different legislation.  It is a matter of fact that the HSE is not responsible for the running of section 39 agencies, whereas it has a much higher level of responsibility in respect of section 38 agencies, which are regarded substantially as public sector bodies.  The others are not.</p></speech>

In respect of the helpline and its continued existence, Mr. O'Brien said that it costs more than the funds that were being provided for its running.  The service has now been transferred to Pieta House.  Has there been a full appraisal of the real cost of providing this service, with real checks and balances, against what was indicated to the HSE, and will it now be funded to the true cost and the process involved in ensuring its continued existence to its full, optimum requirement?</p></speech>

This has not been a transfer of service; this has been the provision of a replica service by a new organisation.  That could only occur once the interim liquidator had been appointed by the High Court.  For the sake of the avoidance of doubt, Pieta House has not taken over any of Console's services.  It is running a replacement service.</p></speech>

It has only become apparent in the last three weeks that the cost was not what we thought it to be because we had not been asked previously for additional costs.  Pieta House is now working with the liquidator and with us to examine the real cost of that service and we will continue to work with them in that regard.  It is absolutely our intention to continue to support those services.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses representing the HSE to send a response to that to us by way of a note.  We will not start, at this hour of the afternoon, opening up the discussion to the lessons to be learned, but that is what it is all about, that we learn lessons for the future.</p> <p>  For the sake of clarification, Mr. O'Brien made quite the subtle point that we will not know the final financial position of Console until the liquidation is completed.  That could produce a situation whereby the HSE pays Console for all the services it provided, whereas the people who provided those services, that is, some of the people on the helpline, may not have been paid.  The HSE could find that, even though the service was provided, some of the resources that it provided for the service were not used to pay the people who provided the service.  That is possibly yet to be determined.</p></speech>

We will have further meetings with the HSE.  Of that there is no doubt.  I want to put on the record that no decision has yet been made by this committee on the publication of any documents that we have received in respect of this process.  We will discuss that in private session, but I just wanted to be clear on that.  Mr. O'Brien has made it clear in correspondence submitted to the committee, although the point was made more subtly earlier, that the HSE does not normally publish the internal audit report on its website.  It supplies them on the basis of one-by-one requests under freedom of information.  It does not publish them as a matter of course.</p></speech>
