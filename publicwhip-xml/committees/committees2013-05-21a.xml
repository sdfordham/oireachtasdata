The committee has had a series of meetings with different stakeholders to discuss the issues regarding the proposed code of conduct for the grocery goods sector, pricing and the impact on primary and secondary suppliers, support for local produce, and labelling.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person(s) or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I propose hearing the opening statements from both groups before members put questions in the normal fashion.  I call on Mr. Stephen Arthur of Fresh Milk Producers to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Arthur" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100003#D00400"><p>I am joined by Mr. Denis Fagan, Mr. Larry Hannon and Mr. Jim Mulhall.  We are fresh milk producers and I thank the Chairman for the privilege of addressing his committee.  Fresh Milk Producers is the largest liquid milk producer group in the country.  We supply Glanbia, which processes milk into well-known brands such as Avonmore, Premier and CMP Milk.  Fresh Milk Producers is a family farm structure that has been in existence for 75 years.  We have been producing milk for the liquid market since the 1930s.  We produce milk through statutory contracts with the National Milk Agency, NMA.  The organisation was set up in the 1930s, when there was a serious shortage of milk in the cities.  Milk was scarce so they wanted a steady, guaranteed supply of fresh product in the cities.  That is the origin of the contract system and how the organisation came into existence supplying milk.</p><p>  In Ireland, there are two forms of milk production, liquid milk production and manufacturing milk production.  Manufacturing milk production involves calving cows in the spring and following the grass growth curve.  They are dried off in the autumn and the milk is manufactured into powder for export to foreign markets.  Liquid milk production involves milking cows 365 days of the year.  They are calved in the autumn and spring.  It is important to calve cows over the two sections so that the milk is fresh to go into a bottle.  It gives a fresher, better product.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vivian Buttimer" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100004#E00200"><p>I am a liquid milk producer in west Cork.  The other members of my team include Mr. Richard Helen and Mr. Donal Kelleher, who are also liquid milk producers, and Mr. Ciaran Dolan, who is an agribusiness consultant.  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to put our case and describe the growing difficulties we are experiencing as liquid milk producers.  We are aware of the format and scope of this hearing and are strongly of the view that the concerns and problems of the liquid milk sector, while distinct, are also part of the overall issues being considered by the committee.</p><p>  The price received by liquid milk producers, relative to the increasing cost of production and, in particular, the cost of winter milk production, is such that the 1,800 liquid milk producers have no, or very little, income.  The returns from the marketplace are grossly inadequate given the amount of investment, labour and management inputs into our farms.  We are seriously concerned at the growing power and dominance of the multiple retailers and the ever-increasing share of the final price they have captured.  The continued downward pressure on price and the pressure they exert on milk processors which determines the price they pay to farmers threatens the very viability of the liquid milk sector.  We believe that the current situation is unsustainable and if it is not rectified, it will leave producers with no other option other than to reduce or cease winter milk production.  </p><p>  The format of our presentation will focus mainly on two aspects, namely, a description of the current price-cost squeeze on long-term trends and we will put forward a number of proposals to strengthen the bargaining power of the dairy farmer, in particular liquid milk producers.  </p><p>  We have read the report of the submissions to this committee by Mr. Paul Kelly of FDII and Mr. John Bryan, president of the IFA.  We fully support the comments of Mr. Paul Kelly regarding the need for the urgent implementation of a statutory code of practice for the grocery sector which should also include a provision for an arbitrator-Ombudsman along the lines already operating in the UK.  This undoubtedly would bring about an improvement in the situation and should eliminate or substantially reduce the number and the scope of unfair trading practices.  However, it would be rather naive to expect that a statutory code of practice, even with an arbitrator for the food sector, would not, in itself, bring about a level of price increases which is required.  </p><p>  There is a pressing need to strengthen the negotiating position of liquid milk farmers.  We will develop this point further as we feel it is an important aspect which the committee may wish to consider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Helen" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100005#F00100"><p>We feel we have no control over the price of essential feed products.  In 2004 soya beans, the main source of protein for milk production, cost &euro;280 per tonne, but that figure has risen to &euro;550 per tonne this year.  Our milk price fell in 2009 owing to the liquid milk price being matched with the manufacturing price.  These prices were matched to allow processors to buy milk even more cheaply.  The price we are now paid has increased slightly, but not by enough to cover our increased costs.  In 2013 our price has increased by 1.25 cent per litre, despite the fact that Dr. Joe Patton from Teagasc showed that our costs for feed alone had increased by 4.5 cent per litre.  Our price increase was funded by processors without any effect on retailers.  Our share of the retail price in 1995 was 43%, but this has fallen to a new low of 31% in 2013.  Operating a viable family business on these margins is not feasible and urgent change is needed.</p><p>  There is broad agreement on the extent of the problem facing farmers generally and liquid milk producers in particular.  The price-cost squeeze is not a uniquely Irish problem as dairy farmers in the United Kingdom are facing similar difficulties.  The latest reports indicate that UK farmers are experiencing one of the most difficult periods ever as production costs have soared, while milk prices have risen insignificantly.  The position of dairy farmers is similar in many northern EU member states.  Recent analyses by dairy farmers within the European milk bowl state a farm gate price of 51.5 cent per litre is required.  With the liquid milk price averaging a mere 32.5 cent per litre last year, farmers are losing close to 20% per litre when labour costs are factored in.  We describe the problem of our fellow farmers in other member states in order to emphasise that this is an EU-wide problem requiring an EU solution or a national solution based on EU legislation.</p><p>  The appointment of a groceries code adjudicator in the United Kingdom will, undoubtedly, improve the relationship between the major retailers and their direct suppliers.  Specifically, the UK legislation does not allow for any form of price setting or consideration of what should be a fair price as far as farmers are concerned, contrary to what some commentators have stated.  Therefore, any benefit to farmers will be indirect.  Something in addition to the statutory code and an adjudicator is required.  EU legislation has changed in recent times to allow farmers to come together, within limits, so as to strengthen their price negotiating position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Kelleher" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100005#F00200"><p>The facts of the matter are that in the winter just passed our costs increased by 4.5 cent per litre for feed alone.  The total cost increase, as Mr. Arthur mentioned, is up to 7 cent per litre.  This was flagged by farm organisations and the National Milk Agency as far back as last October.  A mere 1.25 cent increase has been granted to us by the processors.  Meanwhile, absolutely no money has been forthcoming from the retail trade in the form of a wholesale price increase to processors to cover any part of our additional costs.  There are 1,800 of us involved and at farm level we have invested somewhere between &euro;1.2 billion and &euro;1.4 billion.  That is the level of our investment in the business, but those who have made an investment in something that is 3 ft. wide by 20 ft. long by 6. ft high, with a refrigerator on the back, have all the power.  Approximately 80% of the milk produced goes through the multiples.  I have no issue with this, but I do have a serious issue with their not at least acknowledging that we have a problem and bringing something to the table to compensate us for our difficulty.</p><p>  In the supplier group to which I belong we have lost 20% of the suppliers in the past five years.  When I say lost, I mean they moved from liquid milk production to manufacturing milk.  In other words, they moved from all-year round to seasonal production, while another 20% have signalled that they intend to do the same.  These are not elderly people.  Generally, they are aged between 30 and 55 years.  That is the age category involved and it is a combination of small, medium-sized and larger farmers.  Many of us are third generation liquid milk producers.  In my case, both my paternal and maternal grandfathers milked cows in the morning and sold to the consumer before breakfast.  It is an industry that is just about to flow down the toilet, so to speak, and it is happening in front of our eyes.  I concur with what my colleagues have said.  It is time for urgent action.  I am not sure what action can be taken within the current law, but something had better happen or our industry will disappear.  In actual fact, we are the ones who have an option in that we can move to manufacturing milk production.  That is the option we have, but the processing sector may well be wiped out if there is no raw material available for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciaran Dolan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100005#F00300"><p>To follow on from what has been said, I wish to focus on possible solutions to the difficulties facing liquid milk producers.  Mr. Helen referred to a change in the law.  No doubt, the main thrust of the committee's consideration is the relationship between processors and retailers, but I wish to focus on the relationship between producers and processors.  In Ireland there has been major consolidation in terms of the number of purchasers of liquid milk.  There has also been a change in the corporate structure from a co-operative dominated to a company dominated one.  Mr. Helen referred to his colleagues in other EU member states and this issue has been under consideration for a long period, including by the high level group for the milk sector.  There was a change in legislation in March 2012.  It might be no harm to read an extract from the preamble to the regulations because no farm organisation would be able to write better on the issue of defending farmers' rights.  Recital No.14 of regulation 261 of 2012 reads:<blockquote><br />In order to ensure the rational development of production and thus a fair standard of living for dairy farmers, their bargaining power <i>vis-a-vis</i> processors should be strengthened which should result in a fairer distribution of value-added along the supply chain.  Therefore, in order to attain these CAP objectives, a provision should be adopted pursuant to Articles 42 and 43(2) of the Treaty to allow producer organisations constituted by dairy farmers or their associations to negotiate contract terms, including price, for some or all of its members' production with a dairy.  </blockquote>The document goes on to describe how that producer organisation should be registered and places a limit of 3.5% of the total EU pool, which is considerable, or 33% of the national pool.  That is EU law.  It is also significant, from the point of view of the work of the committee, that every single one of the heads of the national competition authorities objected to this and said it would be a wrong move.  They said it would result in an improper rebalancing.  Nonetheless, the European Council and the Parliament approved the legislation.  </p><p>  Our first suggestion is that it would be very useful for the committee to get the view of the Competition Authority on this EU law.  I am not criticising the authority, but rather than making an observation on competition law in Ireland, it has shown a strong willingness to use the full force of competition law against farmers who endeavour to strengthen their hand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100006#G00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses here today.  This subject goes way beyond farmers.  If there is no fresh milk on the supermarket shelves some winter, many people would ask why we did not see this coming.  It is interesting the National Milk Agency was set up in response to a problem.</p><p>  It was not mentioned but I would like the witnesses to comment on the fact that part of the leverage the supermarket multiples have is the importation of milk that is produced at a lower cost from Northern Ireland.  The amount of milk coming in has increased to 26% of the milk now being sold in the liquid milk market.</p><p>  Why can they produce it at a lower price in the North?  I also understand their peak to trough ratio is much lower than ours.  Milk production is spread out more evenly over the year.  Why is that?  If there was a single island economy, with the same cost base North and South, it would not be as easy for multiples to exert pressure.</p><p>  It was said there is a loss of 9 cent per litre.  To me that means in simple terms a producer loses more the more he produces.  There is no incentive to produce more; there is an incentive to get out of the business completely.  How is that calculated?  Does it include the single farm payment and the other grant payments?  Is it just the actual production and sale of a litre of milk?  Presumably that would include capital write off, where a producer must keep reinvesting in the business.  Perhaps that could be explained without going into complex accountancy exercises.</p><p>  I looked at the National Milk Agency report.  It was interesting that between 1995 and 2011, the percentage that goes to the producer has fallen from 43% to 32%, with the figure dipping under 30% in 2009 and 2010.  It has fallen from 40% plus at a steady level down to 30% give or take.  That is a huge fall.  Has that been caused by the importation of milk creating this leverage?  How was that allowed?  The National Milk Agency looks at the contract and the relationship between the processor and the farmer.  Since the 1990s, the power has shifted from the processor to the multiple and those are more powerful now, along with the leverage they enjoy from the imports.  Is that where the power has shifted?  Is that the reason for the overweening power of the multiple to push down the price?</p><p>  Does it make a difference that the number of processors has decreased radically?  Is it a challenge or is that irrelevant?  Is it a major problem that the multiples are now the biggest purchasers and power is concentrated in their hands?  We have had the multiples in here and they gave their side of the story, although Dunnes Stores did not come in so we do not know its side of the story.</p><p>  This committee wants answers; we want to resolve the issue.  We can hear the problems but we want legislative proposals to solve them.  We will be looking at the issue in depth to see if it is possible within the new EU legislation for us to act.  We face the challenge from the Competition Authority that the price for the consumer must be reduced at all costs and it does not matter what the collateral damage is over time, even if that means leaving the consumer without winter milk.</p></speech>

Producing liquid milk at a loss of 9 cent per litre cannot be sustained and something must be done to ensure the industry survives.  It was said that the deployment of a code of practice adjudicator is very important but it is not enough, and that the producers' negotiating hand must be strengthened by striking a better balance between farmers and processors.  Could we expand on that more balanced approach?</p><p>  The French system of data publication was mentioned, and the fact supermarkets have a 2% margin.  Should we take that on board?  The committee will try to address the operation of bloc exemptions trying to negotiate directly.  What is the best way to go about that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100007#H00200"><p>I thank the representatives of the various organisations for coming to today's meeting and making such interesting presentations.  I am a suckler cow farmer in south Kildare.  I am not a dairy man.  I have great respect for anyone who gets up seven days a week to milk cows.  The Glanbia plant in Ballytore in my local area employs 120 people in the dairy section alone.  According to the 2011 census, Ballytore village had a population of 685.  I do not need to elaborate much more on those figures to demonstrate the impact of dairy processing on our local community.  There are plenty of dairy farmers all around.</p><p>  Much of what we heard in today's presentations is not new to me, but it very concerning nonetheless.  We need to get to the nub of how we solve these problems.  I think everyone here agrees that there are issues that need to be addressed.  Do the producers have any information on how much milk is being imported, particularly from Northern Ireland?  I was struck by the suggestion made earlier that liquid milk will not survive a price war if action is not taken.  We need to talk about the action that should be taken.  A code of practice that would prevent below-cost selling and predatory pricing practices is needed as a key part of our approach.</p><p>  I would like to pick up on what was said about the processor in the middle.  Do the witnesses have a sense that the retailer uses the processor as a buffer so that it does not have to deal directly with the producer?  When we questioned the multiples at this committee about the horsemeat scandal and other matters, it struck me that it almost suits them to be at such a distance from the primary producer.  They claim that their dealings with processors that provide products like milk and meat gives them a knowledge of the cost base.  We need to ensure the multiples are more cognisant of the pressures that are faced by individual processors.</p><p>  What would the producers say in response to what the multiples said at this forum when they were asked about the possibility of an ombudsman being appointed?  An independent arbitrator is now in place in England.  The multiples argued that such a system would lead to increased costs, particularly if it was mandatory rather than voluntary.  They warned us in that respect.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?  We need to strike a balance between a system that would be overly restrictive on retailers, and thereby have a detrimental impact on consumer costs and consequently on producers, and a system that would mean the large multiples are free to carry on as they do at present.  We have very little control over their actions as things stand.  As a result, in recent times we have seen plenty of instances of suppliers being squeezed beyond the cost of production.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100007#H00300"><p>I apologise for being a few minutes late.  The producers are very welcome to this meeting.  It strikes me that the liquid milk sector is like a few other sectors that are living on depreciation.  One cannot invest constructively for the future if one does not have a sufficient margin.  It seems strange that a country which has aspirations to feed up to 50 million people under Harvest 2020 cannot maintain a constructive and solid production base.  The argument I have heard in favour of allowing farmers to take very small margins is that they are able to build up on scale.  That does not always work, however.  I am involved in the tillage sector, where one's efficiency decreases as one gets larger because of land fragmentation and all that goes with it.  We need sufficient headroom for investment.</p><p>  When I got out of milk production in 1991, the price was 28 cent a litre.  I have made that calculation by converting back from pounds.  Those present will remember that the price was approximately &pound;1 a gallon at the time.  Food and milk have been used to keep our inflation figures artificially down.  According to the figures we have been given today - I wonder if there is much of a difference between the normal price for milk and the price for liquid milk - the primary producer now receives 33 cent, which is an increase of just 17.8% over 22 years.  The inflation figure, if I can call it that, is 0.008% per annum.  No industry can survive over a period of two decades and get less than 1% inflation per year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100008#J00200"><p>I will be brief.  I thank all the four gentlemen who have spoken and look forward to hearing from the three who have not spoken.  Most of the questions have been posed very articulately by previous speakers.  I have never been a dairy farmer and know very little about the industry.  I am like an alien who has arrived in from Mars looking down on this beautiful green country.  All the aliens who are looking down must think we are completely mad from the point of view that we are producing a healthy product that everyone loves and needs and everyone consumes every day.  I love pictures.  The retailer is making 85%, the processor is making 39% and the men who are doing the milking are left with 38%.  Clearly 20% of those in the industry have left and another 20% are thinking of leaving.  We have reached a pivotal moment in the history of the dairy industry and we are close to a crisis.  I apologise that one of my questions is not about today's subject.  It is still cold out there, the grass is not growing and no silage is being cut.  How is the fodder crisis going to affect the industry?  The industry cannot afford anything to go wrong or any push in the wrong direction.  Everything must go perfectly on this margin, otherwise those in the industry will not be able to eat.  I want to know a little more to educate the likes of me.  What is the relationship between the processor and the producer?  The producers are very powerful people, we must have milk.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the law in place but surely there must be some way we can help to push for an increase for the industry.  At present the retailers are winning, somebody mentioned earlier that it is called footfall.  Sometimes there might be half price barbecues because we are coming to that season to encourage us to go in to Tesco or Lidl.  However, for 365 days of the year we all go to the shop for the cheapest milk but that has to stop because an industry is dying in front of us.</p></speech>

As most of the questions have been asked there is no point in repeating them.  The key point is that in 15 years there has been a 26% increase in imports whether from Northern Ireland or the UK in liquid milk.  Is that suppressing the price?  There is no point in closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  The problem does not lie with the retailers alone but the processors.  The witnesses' tables are very interesting, especially the table on page 15 of the documentation.  Table 2.1 which, as Deputy Pat Deering pointed out, shows that the retail price has risen on average to 111 cent per litre where what the producers receives has decreased from 44% to 32%.</p><p>  It would also be interesting if the witnesses were to show what the retailers' margin has been in those 15 years.  The reason the witnesses are before the committee and the reason the retailers appeared before the committee was to try to assess certain parts of the food industry.  We have asked them all about their margins but we will not get answers in respect of their margins in this country.  We have also asked about using fresh produce, whether milk, beef, lamb or vegetables, as a loss leader to try to attract people into the store.  That is an issue on which I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.  They have all used beer or alcohol or processed products at some stage but to use a fresh product as a loss leader is unfair as it pushes the margins on the primary producer down.  I think it all went wrong in 2007 and 2008.  It is clear from table 2.1 that from 2006 to 2007 the price of liquid milk increased by approximately 5 cent per litre but suddenly the retailer's margin increased by 20 cent and that has continued.  Since 2007 the retailers have got a 20 cent increase whereas the producers only got 0.2 cent.  It all went wrong in 2007 and 2008, whether it was due to pressure from the processor in making the producer continue with that price or the retailer putting pressure on the processor to maintain the price in order that they would not have to pay more.  I would welcome comments on the issue of using fresh produce as a loss leader as we have to prepare a report on these deliberations.  As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said, is the 26% increase in imports of liquid milk the reason the price is suppressed?  I am a farmer but not in the dairy area and I met the IFA yesterday.  It is not sustainable to produce liquid milk here at present?  Would the industry be better off to give up liquid milk production, except for summer production and produce it for product?  The people would then see where the country would source its liquid milk.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the fact that another group is coming in.  This is an important matter and a couple of key fundamental points have been made, particularly in respect of the negotiating power of the milk producers.  Even with a return to 43% of the retail price, they would be on only about break-even cost.  It appears to me from the evidence that has come before us today there is something fundamentally wrong with the pricing structure.  Somewhere along the line, either at the top-end retail price or in the cost base associated with production, even at 43% there is no profit in it.  That is something to bear in mind.  What is the best action to take for the survival of the sector?  As Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said this is a very powerful group.  It produces a fresh product on a daily basis.  Fruit and vegetables are the only items that are akin to the sector and we have seen what has happened in that area.  If people become accustomed to UHT milk is that going to be the acceptable norm?  That is the scenario I see except for seasonal fresh milk.  Perhaps Mr. Stephen Arthur would like to invite any of his colleagues to respond.</p></speech>

We are in a situation where we have to put our cows back in calf nine months after they calve and then they produce the milk for a further nine or ten months.  Once the cow goes back in calf the supermarkets are sure of their produce for the next 18 months.  That leaves us in a very difficult situation because they always have that buffer.</p></speech>

I am farming in south Kildare and we are second generation liquid milk producers.  We are passionate about what we do and proud of the quality product we produce.  Fresh Milk Producers is involved in negotiating with the processors.  The four of us enter talks and negotiate price.  It always seems to be a place where one goes in under severe pressure.  It never seems to be a place where one goes to negotiate up.  It always seems that we have to take less and that the processor and retailer are putting us under more pressure.</p><p>  What I do is important because we run a family farm and my father is still involved in the business.  I hope the next generation will be involved in the business as well.  What we do is important to the local economy.  If I buy something or put up something, I look to spend my money locally and that is important.  Reference was made to the liquid milk plant in Ballytore which supplies much of the country from Cork to Dundalk.  That is based beside me and there are 120 jobs there.  We are here because we are gasping for air at this stage.  We are under pressure and we need something to happen at the top level to filter back down.</p><p>  We feel vulnerable in the position we are in.  If something comes back from the marketplace and someone somewhere in between suggests that we have what we have and they cannot afford to give it to us, then, all of a sudden, we are left with the poor penny again and we have nothing.  It is vital that what we are trying to do is backed on a statutory level.  The National Milk Agency gives us our contracts and we produce our milk.  It looks after that end of it and that is important to us.  However, it is important that what we do as farmers is supported up along the line.  Statutory backing is important, without restricting us too much.  We need support against that background.</p><p>  We are constantly fighting for sustainability and that is the great problem we have.  We are part of a recovery pillar in the country and it is important that the domestic value of the sector continues to be looked on in this way.  My milk goes 100 metres to the plant and a further 100 metres to the shop and then the consumer has it.  It is milked today and sold tomorrow.  It is a business that turns money in the local economy.</p><p>  I am here to put a face to the problem.  I am one of the people struggling but I am passionate about what I do.  We produce a quality product and I am proud of what we do as farmers and as Fresh Milk Producers.</p></speech>

He asked about the northern price.   What is taking place in the North is there are people there who are getting less of a price than we are getting.  The people there are working in a worse situation.  They had free arms up there to expand.  In the North the theory is that a farmer will milk 100 cows this year and try to milk 200 cows next year with a smaller margin.  They got quotas for nothing.  It is a typical example of when expansion goes wrong.  Farms up there are completely bursting at the seams and full of cows.  There are articles in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on it every week.  There are families milking 250 cows and not even getting paid for it.  The situation is worse up there.  The processors are buying milk for nothing and selling it down here cheaper than the equivalent product here.  On average, Northern Ireland milk prices are running below our prices.  Their margin is a minus.  We have seen figures coming back from there in minus territory.  It comes back to what the committee has said about down here.  We are not getting a price to cover even family labour.  We are working for nothing.  All one need do is consider our situation and what occurred in England.  We are about two years behind them.  We were five for six years behind.</p></speech>

The farmers walked out of the industry over there.  It is as bad as that in England at the moment.  There were agents scouring the south east of Ireland looking for milk to supply health and food services in England as recently as one month ago.  That is the position in England.  It took French milk on the shelves in a shop, a large retailer in Birmingham, to realise they had a problem.  That was what started up the consumer agency over there.  They had to hit rock bottom before they realised there was a problem.</p><p>  I reckon we are less than two years behind England and if we do not do something now we will end up in the same boat.  We will be drinking UHT milk in the pudding on Christmas Day and that is a fact.  Up to 25% of our milk is coming in, that is, one quarter of what we drink.  One in every four litres of what we drink is imported.  What message does that send out around the world when we should be feeding the world?</p><p>  The question of whether we want the system used in France was raised.  France has no liquid milk business.  One cannot get fresh milk over there.  People in France buy milk powder in a box and bring it home to put it in the tea.  The French system is a Promar lock-in system.  A producer is locked in to a system and pays the margin.  There is no flexibility.</p><p>  I believe we are entitled to flexibility in our business.  If we get a good year we should be entitled to reap the rewards because we suffer all the bad years.  A structure with a little freedom should be put in place such that if a good year comes we are entitled to get some harvest out of it because, by God, we are getting plenty of bad years.</p><p>  Deputy Deering asked about milk quality.  All these things cost us money to produce quality milk.  I presume the Chairman is farming cows.  He knows what it costs to get total bacteria count, TBC, tests.  It costs money.  Unfortunately, the way co-ops and processors work means they want everything at the right quality but they do not want to pay for it.  A system is coming in at the moment and the Kerry Group and Lakeland Dairies will bring in a system to pay more for better quality.  Glanbia is also considering the idea.  Obviously the crowd is going to pull it.</p><p>  The question of loss leaders is a sad one.  Let us consider the approach to milk 75 years ago.  It was judged by how fresh it was when one stuck a finger in to test how warm it was.  What is milk like now?  It is like a CD on top of a newspaper.  That is what I compare milk to at the moment.  Put a fancy CD in a newspaper and one might buy the newspaper.  Now, they are sticking milk inside shops for nothing so that a customer might come in and buy a brush handle or something else that he does not particularly want.  That is what they are doing.  Retailers are using milk to get people in and to get footfall.  It is sad.  We have the healthiest food on the planet and we are using it to entice people in to shops to get them to buy something else.</p><p>  Let us consider the CSO figures that have come out.  Milk has not moved anywhere.  I listened to "The Ray D'Arcy Show" yesterday.  Food, potatoes, beef and everything else has risen in price but milk has not moved.  The question answers itself.</p></speech>

We need to guarantee that there will be fresh milk on the shelves 365 days a year.  I am convinced that unless farming is based on making a profit on everything produced, it is not sustainable for family farmers.  I asked about the position in the North because it was said to me it was the lever being used by the retailers to put pressure on the processors who, in turn, would put pressure on the primary producers.  I accept what the delegates are saying about what will happen 18 months ahead, but are they guaranteed they will have fresh milk three years ahead?  The answer is "No".  There are only 1,900 suppliers.  If half of them were to pull out, that would be curtains in the supply of fresh milk, unless we could get it from the North or Britain.  The remaining 1,000 farmers would not be able to scale upwards that fast.  It might be thought that the suppliers are in a powerful position, but we know they are not because we know that what they are telling us is true.  Where is the angle?  What is the leverage being used to get us into the farcical position where farmers are losing money on every litre they produce, which is totally unsustainable into the future?</p></speech>

At the time we were facing into a bleak winter.  In 1995 we were getting just shy of 33 cent a litre; in 2004 we were getting just over 32 cent and in 2012 just shy of 34 cent.  In 17 years there has been a shift of roughly 1 cent and a bit.  That cannot continue.  In 2004 when we were getting 32 cent, we were paying &euro;280 for one tonne of soya beans.  In 2012 when we were getting 34 cent, we were paying &euro;530 a tonne, a rise of almost 50%.  That wipes out our winter bonus.  That is not even the main cost, it is the extra cost.</p><p>  I know a dietician who allowed me to use his name; I gave literature on him to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  He has been my dietician for the past 20 years.  In his view the situation of Northern Ireland milk producers is not great.  They have serious debts and they are in a similar position.  Their industry was created on the bones of the disaster in mainland Britain.  That is how they increased and it is spreading to the Republic.  I do not believe in a voluntary code because we have a code of sorts already, yet when we politely told the multiples at the end of last summer that we were facing a problem, it fell on deaf ears.  We cannot protest as a group of farmers.  We are tied and the multiples know this.</p></speech>

Kerry Group exited liquid milk production, apart from its last remaining outfit, Killarney Dairies, which accounts for only approximately 12% or 14% of its original liquid milk pool.  That is very frightening for such a great and strong organisation and it probably shows how sick the liquid milk industry is in this country.  I assume that is why it exited because if there was money in it, Kerry Group would stay.  That bothers me somewhat.  That fewer players are involved in the business could have two effects - those who are left might say they would sell their product better to the multiples because there are fewer of them, but then they could be accused of colluding which no doubt some genius would assert, even if they were not.  From our point of view, as primary producers, were we to have more purchasers in the marketplace, it might create more competition.  There are several angles.  I am not saying it is good or bad, but it worries me that Kerry Group exited the business.  I cannot speak for it, but I can only assume that it knows, as the rest of us know, that there is not enough money to be made in this business to stay in it.</p><p>  New Zealand and town milk suppliers were mentioned.</p></speech>

Somebody decides to have a special offer and sells milk at &euro;1.29 or whatever to get footfall.  The problem is that if such an offer lasts for one week, other retailers wonder if they should follow.  They may decide to do so two weeks later, and tell processors the wholesale price is not sustainable because they have to follow the downward trend.  The next thing that happens is that the whole market collapses.  We are then hauled in to be told the prices we have agreed will have to be reviewed because the market has moved from X to Y and there is a problem.  Ultimately, we end up paying the price and if we say anything about it we are again hauled over the coals.</p></speech>

The code of practice is what legislators make it to be.  The issue of whether it is voluntary or statutory is, to a large extent, immaterial.  If we use the UK experience as a template - I do not suggest the Oireachtas be bound by that - we should note it is specifically prohibited to get involved in price and is confined exclusively to processor and retailer.  It has nothing to do with farmers.  Should any benefit arise, it will not be in the area of price fixing and will be indirect.  </p><p>  I understand, given the nature of the very limited scope of the UK legislation which will only apply to seven or eight retailers with a gross turnover of &pound;1 billion, the cost is in the order of a few hundred thousand pounds.  We can spend a lot of time fine-tuning the extent of the problem.  There is no doubt that over time the position of liquid milk producers in Ireland will get worse. </p><p>  The issue of whether the situation in Northern Ireland will pan out may be up for discussion.  The matter has been dealt with at European level for the best part of five years.  In the absence of anything else, there has been a retuning of balance in terms of competition law in favour of dairy farmers and liquid milk farmers. We should explore the possibility of doing that as a means of strengthening the position of liquid milk producers.  </p><p>  We should not import what is being done in France.  I can never get to the bottom of what is done there.  Under French law retailers are compelled to disclose information.  The members of the committee, as legislators involved in public policy, would not be begging retailers to give them information, rather, they would be compelled to disclose it.  If information on producers involved in collective or individual negotiations was disclosed, processors, retailers and consumers would be better informed.  </p><p>  It is important for Ireland, as a major exporter of food, to ensure that there is no substantial dilution of EU competition policy.  It is important that the committee bears that in mind, if I may say so.  We may want to undermine EU competition policy pertaining to the domestic market only to find we will have difficulties in exporting and getting our products on the shelves of other member states.  We need to be careful of that.  EU competition policy protects our industry. </p><p>  We should also ensure, with a more positive or proactive approach, to push this process at European level.  There is a danger that in the absence of an EU initiative each individual member state will implement its own domestic law.  We could find that we are excluded from prime shelves.  In the absence of anything else, it is worth exploring how we can improve the information flow as a basis for a more rational, informed negotiation, and then clarify the law with regard to the EU change which has been brought about.</p></speech>

The government had to introduce a subsidy to supply milk to local shelves. </p><p>  On Senator O'Neill's question on what is happening in England, there were family farms and then deregulation took place which led to factory farms.  The structure in Ireland involves family farms.  We do not have big tracts of land.  Companies in England buy tracts of land, put 2,000 cows on them and work for one cent a litre.  They do not even see the cows and have three or four people working for them.  Here an average liquid milk farm comprises a father, wife and children who run the firm.  It is a family enterprise. </p><p>  A speaker at a conference some years ago said the best unit one can have in farming is the family farm.  Our land structure is designed for family farms.</p> <p>On the question of what may happen in 2015, anyone in a position to change will change because the milk will be worth more in powder form and if exported to China.  Scale in terms of dairy farm health has not worked, either nationwide or worldwide.  What we have works.  A statutory code of conduct would be of long-term benefit to the consumer.  The fodder crisis is having a significant impact this year, but milk farmers have faced a crisis for the past ten years and it looks like it will continue.  It is very important that we accept and protect what we have.</p></speech>

We know where we want to go and we want to protect what we have, namely, the family farm producing fresh milk every day of the year to be placed on shop shelves of Ireland.  I do not think anyone on this committee would disagree with that aim.  What is stopping this happening?  The price is being pushed down and farmers are leaving the milk sector as a result.  One of the challenges we face is that there are four players - the consumer is the fourth, although we have not spoken very much about him or her.  The consumer wants cheaper everything and anything.  However, if he or she thought that it was cheaper not to have fresh milk available 365 days of the year for his or her cornflakes but to use UHT milk instead, he or she would decide to pay a little more to be guaranteed fresh milk.  There is, therefore, a need to inform and educate consumers.</p><p>  The second issue is what will happens if Northern suppliers suddenly find the British market is more lucrative than the market in the Republic and leave a gap in supply.  How likely is this to happen which would result in UHT milk being on the shelves instead of fresh milk?  That is the issue that will put the consumer on the side of the farmer when he or she realises they are both on the same side because the farmer has to survive.  How unstable is the combined British and Northern Ireland milk market in continuing to provide 26% of our fresh milk?  If that supply was to suddenly disappear, would milk suppliers here be able to make up the difference?</p></speech>

In these hearings we are dealing with four issues.  The other three are pricing and the impact on primary and secondary suppliers; support for local producers; and labelling.  These issues are very pertinent to the individuals whom the delegates represent.  I made the point before the meeting that we were not directly dealing with the code of practice.  I do not mean to simplify the issues involved, but processing fresh milk is the most basic of processing procedures.  It takes a lot of sophisticated equipment and investment, but it is straightforward, with a 24 hour turnaround time or less and next-day delivery.  Therefore, there can only be a certain amount of intervention by the processor and the distributor.  When all of this is taken into account, there is still an underlying issue with regard to the overall price.  That is the reason I spoke about the situation in New Zealand and Australia because I know for a fact that they had to introduce a method to support a continuous supply of fresh product because domestic consumers in New Zealand would not tolerate UHT milk.  It is a farce and rather like saying we will produce beef for export and use a beef substitute at home.  We have had enough of this and it may be an unfortunate example to use.  My point is, however, that it would be completely unacceptable if good quality beef was not available in this country, one of the world's largest exporters of beef.  The same applies to milk.  Members of the committee have summarised the core issues involved in their questions and we need to take the information supplied on board.  We have invited representatives of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency to attend and the value of that invitation has been confirmed by this discussion.  I thank all the delegates for their attendance.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to make a submission on the important issues of the proposed code of conduct for the grocery goods sector, pricing and its impact on primary and secondary suppliers, support for local produce, and labelling.  I am joined by the colleagues the Chairman announced, as well as by Mr. Walter Maloney, our distributor representative.</p><p>  The National Milk Agency was established under the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act 1994 to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the State.  The governing body of the agency consists of an independent chairman appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and 13 ordinary members, of whom five producer members are directly elected by registered producers.  The four processor members, two consumer members, one distributor member and one retailer member are all nominated by trade organisations and appointed by the Minister.  The agency is a unique organisation, representative of all stakeholders in its sector.  It is funded by a levy of 0.115 cent per litre on liquid milk purchases at farm and processor level and has a staff of five.</p><p>  Domestic milk supplies to creameries and pasteurisers last year amounted to 5.2 billion litres, supplied by 18,000 dairy farmers who milked more than 1 million dairy cows.  Domestic milk supplies are mainly based on grassland milk production.  Milk production follows a highly seasonal production pattern, with almost 60% of supplies produced in the five summer months, that is, April to September, and just over 20% produced in the five winter months, namely, October to February.  The manufacture of dairy products for export markets utilises more than 90% of domestic supplies, with less than 10% being utilised for processing for liquid consumption as fresh milk in the home market.</p><p>  The fresh milk market is the largest consumer market for milk and milk products in the State and requires a year-round supply of more than 11 million litres of high quality fresh milk per week.  Irish consumers love fresh milk and have the second highest <i>per capita</i> consumption in the European Union, more than double the European average.  The role of the agency is to ensure the availability of this year-round domestic supply of fresh milk for consumers in the home market.  Milk produced within the State cannot be sold or supplied for liquid consumption unless it has been purchased under a contract between a registered producer and a registered processor.  Such a contract, if it is to be registered by the agency, must provide, in the opinion of the agency's members, adequate compensation for the producer for milk supplied under the contract, taking into account, particularly in the winter months, the economic cost of production of milk of suitable quality.  Liquid milk producers registered with the agency are specialist producers who contract to supply milk to registered processors for 52 weeks of the year and whose premises have reached the required quality standards.  Last year 1,869 registered liquid milk producers, or 10% of all milk producers, had registered contracts and supplied 15 processors.</p><p>  A year-round supply of milk for liquid consumption gives rise to additional production costs in the winter months as cows producing milk over the winter, when pasture grazing is not available, require to be fed a high quality forage diet and supplementary protein feeds.  Increased labour costs and a substantial management commitment are also a feature of winter milk production.  Since the establishment of the agency, registered milk producers have received annual milk prices that were, on average, more than 4 cent per litre higher than the annual prices paid for seasonal milk supplies for manufacturing.  Last year the average producer price for milk for processing for liquid consumption was 34 cent per litre, which represented an average differential of 3 cent per litre over the estimated average manufacturing price.  Since last year more than 70% of milk supplies for liquid consumption have prices based on compositional manufacturing, plus a winter premium.</p><p>  There has been no shortage of winter milk supplies for processing for liquid consumption.  Even in the most recent prolonged winter period, the margin of safety of winter milk supplies by registered producers has been 21% over total consumption requirements, including imports of liquid milk.  Given the bruising outturn for the 2012-13 winter period, however, many registered producers are likely to review their commitment to autumn calving in 2013-14.  Accordingly, the above cover could be significantly reduced, particularly in the context of the abolition of EU milk quotas in April 2015.</p><p>  The agency has no role in milk imports which are specifically excluded from its remit.  Since 1995 milk imports into the State from Northern Ireland as packaged fresh milk or in bulk form, for processing and packing into liquid milk in the State, increased from zero to 145 million litres in 2012.  Imported milk packaged for liquid consumption amounted to 86 million litres and bulk milk imported for packing for liquid consumption in the State amounted to 59 million litres.  The graph in the document circulated to members illustrates that position.  Imports of fresh milk now represent more than one in every 4 litres of fresh milk consumed in the State.  However, these imports for liquid consumption comprise less than 30% of the total imports of 492 million litres of milk from Northern Ireland that were imported by creameries and pasteurisers and as packaged liquid milk last year.</p><p>  The agency has no role in retail or wholesale milk prices.  Since 1995 the annual average retail price of fresh milk in 1 litre packs has increased by 28 cent per litre, or 36%, to 105 cent per litre, while the liquid milk producer's price for 1 litre of milk has only increased by 1 cent per litre, or 3%.<b></b>In 2012 the average producer price for liquid milk supplies was 34 cent per litre compared with 33 cent per litre in 1995.  Even if the EU dairy premium payment of 3.65 cent per litre paid to eligible milk producers since 2004 is taken into consideration, the producer's return has increased by less than 5 cent per litre, or 18% of the increase in the retail milk price.  Since 1998 producers' costs for liquid milk production have increased by approximately 9 cent per litre.</p><p>  Since 1995 the fresh milk supply chain at retail, distribution, processor and producer levels has been changing and consolidating.  At retail level, two multinational discount retailers have entered the market.  The number of processors registered with the agency has fallen from 20 to 15, while the number of processing plants operated by registered processors for liquid milk has fallen from 30 to 16.  Two major processors have sold their liquid milk businesses and one major processor has downsized its involvement in the business.  The number of registered producers with contracts has fallen by 41% as more than 1,300 producers exited the fresh milk market.  Retail multiples have now become the main distribution channel for fresh milk, with three multiple groups in a dominant position with an 80% share of the grocery market.  In fact, five multiple retailers control 92% of the market.</p><p>  Last September, following the adverse summer weather conditions which reduced the quality and quantity of conserved silage and seemed bound to increase the costs of winter feeding, the agency commissioned an expert report from Teagasc on the increases in the economic cost of milk production in the current EU milk year, particularly in the forthcoming winter months.  The report concluded that while all milk producers would incur increased feed costs in 2012, specialist producers of milk for processing for liquid consumption would incur additional feed costs in excess of 4 cent per litre on their milk supplies during the winter months of October 2012 to February 2013.  The agency issued a press release and advised producer and processor organisations, together with the major retailers, of the agency's concern that the exceptional increases in the production costs of fresh drinking milk in 2012 were making the production of winter milk supplies for the domestic fresh milk market unviable and unsustainable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muiris &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100014#P00200"><p>I am going to deal with the first issue we were asked to address, namely, the code of conduct for the groceries goods sector.  There has been a long delay in the publication of the consumer and competition Bill, which will include the code of practice for the sector.  Retailers are now the main distribution channel for fresh milk, distributing 79% of all fresh milk.  The catering and door-to-door delivery channels distribute 11% and 10%, respectively.  Buying power in the retail and grocery trade is concentrated in a small group of retail multiples.  The three largest multiples control 80% of the retail grocery market.  The future of the domestic liquid milk market and its supply source is being shaped by the actions of the multiple retailers.  To attract customers, retail multiples keep the prices of basic food products, such as fresh milk, at low levels and thus reduce the margins of processors, producers and distributors further down the supply chain.  As a result, there is less value added in the chain for all participants with the exception of the multiple retailers.  The primary producer who supplies the milk is at the bottom of the supply chain but is at  the critical starting point and is continually under pressure and never more so than at present.  The processor is also under pressure, as a result of low returns, to exit the home market for liquid milk and will do so if other more profitable export opportunities become available.</p><p>  The code of conduct must be designed in such a way which will ensure that all stakeholders in the fresh milk supply chain will have adequate margins.  In the absence of such margins, product quality will suffer and supply will be endangered.  Accordingly, consumers  producers, processors and distributors have a direct interest in the proposed code of conduct and how it will impact on the supply chain for fresh milk.  The agency has considered the draft code - which will initially be voluntary in nature - and recommends that, if it is to work, it should be on a statutory basis and that a regulator with robust enforcement powers, of both a civil and criminal nature, should be appointed.</p><p>  The initial drafts of the code have dealt with the issues of payment and promotion including prompt payments; marketing costs; shrinkage payments; wastage payments; limited conditions for payment as a condition of being a supplier; compensation for forecasting errors; no payment for better positioning of goods unless in respect of promotions; and promotions.  Many of these have much to do with the relationship between the multiples and primary suppliers but they also have knock-on effects for secondary suppliers.  In initial drafts of the code the important provisions to which I refer were implied into the contractual agreement between processors and multiples and, therefore, the only remedy available would be through a contractual action in the courts.  The agency is of the view that a civil contractual remedy would be of questionable benefit where there is an imbalance in the relationship.  If the code of practice is placed on a statutory basis, however, criminal offences could be prosecuted by the regulator, if one were appointed.  That is one of the major arguments in favour of a statutory code.</p><p>  The agency is also of the view that in the context of any contractual termination provision in a contract relating to the supply of milk to a multiple, sufficient notice should be provided in order that account might be taken of the production cycle of the producer panel supplying that milk.  It is not just a question of turning off the supply because there is a cycle involved.  There should also be a redundancy-type compensation payment similar to that relating to discontinuance for which provision is made under the paid commercial agents directive in order to reflect the cost incurred by producers in developing all-year-round supply capacity.</p><p>  In the context of how the product is treated in multiple outlets, the use of fresh milk as a loss leader or its sale below cost should be prohibited under the proposed code of practice.  The use of milk as a key value indicator to increase both footfall and sales of other products in multiple outlets undermines the confidence of specialist producers in their product by seeing it debased and used as a commodity product and sold at ridiculous prices.  They can see their animals on their farms and are then obliged to watch advertisements on television which highlight the low price of milk, which is sometimes sold at prices equal to or just above those of bottled water.</p><p>  These are the issues which the agency believes should be addressed in the context of the code.  Mr. McEnteggart will now comment on pricing.</p></speech>

The Prospectus report on the dairy industry in 2003 placed particular emphasis on the need for movement away from commodity products where possible.  Processors of fresh milk have endeavoured to do this by building brands and developing new products.  Processors' brands have been undermined by the forceful implementation of retailers own-label brands, which enable the latter to seek tenders for supplies of own label milk and to switch very rapidly between processors and sources of supply.</p></speech>

The NDC&rsquo;s logo on consumer packs of Irish fresh milk which states &ldquo;Farmed in the Republic of Ireland" guarantees the domestic provenance of the milk and has received widespread recognition and support by consumers and is impacting on their buying decisions.  One major retailer has a declared marketing and purchasing policy to buy only milk produced in the State, to which it strictly adheres.  Other retailers who sell only own-label milk source product either from within or outside the State.  Others still source almost all their own-label milk from within the State or all their own-label milk from imported supplies which are packed in the State.</p><p>  The consumers&rsquo; ability to make a decision to support local produce and to buy products produced in the Republic of Ireland is dependent on consumers being able to clearly identify, distinguish and choose between products which are produced within the State and products which are imported from outside the State.  A fundamental pillar of the EU market is the free movement of goods and services across the Common Market.  That has been of great economic benefit to Irish exporters, to the national economy and to its citizens.  There is concern, however, that the consumer is unable to clearly see where a product has been produced.  Products should be clearly labelled both as to provenance and content.  The requirement is particularly apposite in terms of own-label milk which may be supplied and packed by multiple suppliers with milk sourced both from within and outside the State.  Accordingly, the country of origin of the milk and the name of the milk processor should be clearly stated on the pack.  Some retailers have been very progressive in this regard in relation to cheese and fresh dairy products and even show the farmer producer on the product label.  The EU numerical identification mark, which is compulsory on food product packaging, does not identify the source of the food in the pack and as it is coded is of little use to the consumer in identifying the country of origin of the food stuff.  The most relevant legislative provision concerning labelling is the sequence of Irish legislation commencing with the Communities (Labelling Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 and various amending regulations.  The 2002 regulations concerning labelling were transposed into Irish law by EU Directive 2000/13/EC re labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs.</p><p>  A basic requirement of the regulations is that the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs must be clear, unambiguous and must not mislead the consumer to a material degree.  In this context, it should be noted that &ldquo;labelling&rdquo; shall mean any words, particulars, trademarks, brand name, pictorial matter or symbol relating to a foodstuff and placed on any packaging, document notice, accompanying or referring to such foodstuffs.  A number of instances of confusing labelling of fresh milk have come to the agency&rsquo;s attention and the agency would recommend that the provisions of the above EU regulations be extended to fresh milk.</p></speech>

The annual report which we received also contains useful data and statistics.  On page 3 of the 2011 report it is stated that the continued availability of all-year-round milk supplies from registered producers cannot be assured at this level of compensation given the rising costs of winter milk production and the growing attraction of a seasonal milk supply model in a post-EU milk quota environment.  Is that still the view of the agency?</p><p>  The report also states that if the contract is to be registered by the agency it must provide, in the opinion of the agency&rsquo;s members, adequate compensation to the producer of milk supplied under the contract, taking into account in particular in relation to the winter months the economic cost of production of milk of suitable quality.  From what we heard today, the farmers are saying to us that is not happening.  In other words, they are not getting paid for the milk they produce and taking all their costs into account they are losing money.  Do the witnesses agree that farmers are not getting adequate compensation?  That seems to be a theme running through the presentation.  What legal powers are available to the agency in overseeing the contracts if it believes there is not adequate compensation.  It is no good giving the agency a job to do if it does not have the wherewithal to do it.  Should the agency have additional legal powers to ensure we get milk on the shelves every day?</p><p>  In view of what the witnesses said about 2012 and 2013 on page 5, taking all of the complexities of the modern market into account and the fact that the agency has no input into what comes in over the Border, what is the likelihood that in the next two to three years we could run short at any time of the year for one day or one month?</p></speech>

The statistics put before the committee are interesting.  Listening to Mr. Murphy, one would believe there is no future for liquid milk production in this country.  What does he think is a realistic price margin for liquid milk producers to receive?  We dealt with that in the discussion with the previous groups in terms of the tables the agency produced.  There has always been downward pressure.  I do not know if Mr. Foster wants to comment on that but Mr. Foster represents the retailers.  Listening to the presentations from Mr. Murphy and others, it appears the primary producer and the processor believe the major retailers have all the cards in their deck and that they are putting pressure on both the primary producer and the processor.  As a retail representative, Mr. Foster might want to comment on that.</p><p>  I might have misunderstood him but I thought Mr. Murphy said we might be over-producing by 10% in liquid milk production.  He mentioned that we are producing 21% of liquid milk and that there might be 10% over-production in that field.</p></speech>

I raise an issue that the previous delegations mentioned.  It was mentioned in this session, and it arose when we interviewed representatives of the different multiples, namely, that the cost of the statutory code of practice being talked about will put everybody out of business.  What is the witnesses' view on that?  Will it be cost-effective?  If there is to be a cost for it, who will pay?  Is the independent arbitrator a practical solution?  It was introduced in England at the start of the year and the feedback appears to be positive, although it has only been in place for five months.  Would that be a way of going forward?  Many of the multiples suggested in the past that they will have their own structures in place to ensure there is fair trade and so on, but if an independent arbitrator is in place to ensure that is working, there should not be a major cost involved.  I would appreciate the witnesses' views on that matter.</p><p>  There has been a lot of talk about Food Harvest 2020, enthusiasm for it and so on, but having listened to Mr. Murphy's presentation and the presentations made in the past hour, one wonders if it is aspirational, fantasy or realistic.  Will we have the levels of production that were spoken about in 2020?  Having heard the facts and figures given earlier, there is no way it will be financially viable to produce milk, particularly winter milk, in 2020 at the current cost.  It will not happen, therefore, fewer farmers will produce milk and a shortage will arise.  The chance of us reaching those targets by 2020 is fanciful.  What are the witnesses' views on that issue?</p></speech>

What profit margins have milk producers been operating under for the past month?  I do not expect Mr. Murphy to look into a crystal ball but even if normal weather conditions return for the remainder of the year, what profit margins can farmers look forward to, even at this early stage?</p><p>  With regard to the flexibility the own brand affords supermarkets to change producers, do the witnesses have any advice on whether it would be legal to ban own brand?  Would it be anti-competitive?  Has the agency obtained or sought any legal advice on that issue?</p></speech>

The liquid milk producers put their cows in calf in December 2012.  That milk will be available for the winter of 2013.  The big challenges facing into the winter of 2013 is whether they will put their cows in calf to provide milk in 2014.  That is the year they are heading into the abolition of EU milk quotas.</p></speech>

At the outset, we set up, through agreement among ourselves because very diverse interest groups are involved, a set of working guidelines as to how that will be done, and there is a set of parameters for that.  We look at this in two stages during the year, the first being in October and thereafter it comes up for renewal in July.  Historically, a premium has been paid for the five winter months and members can see the graph in the annual report showing how the liquid milk is attracting higher pay and how this has been consistent since 1995.  This is one power we have and the system has maintained itself.  However, when one experiences a year such as the one we have had at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, we do not have the power to deal with that type of emergency.</p><p>  That said, we did not merely put out a press release but wrote to every multiple and processor in the country making the point, because we have no control over retail or wholesale prices.  However, we attempted to put into the public domain, as well as that of the processors and the retailers, the point that this issue had arisen.  The point was that if they were interested in securing supplies going into 2014, which is the subject under discussion, and in having a domestic supply of fresh milk, this was a matter we wanted them to bear in mind.  To this end, we got an independent agency, Teagasc, to produce the Patton report, which we gave to them.  We got very little response, comprising responses from two multiples, but nothing indicating they intended to do anything radically different.  That is what is happening in that regard.</p><p>  We have submitted a request on our proposals for additional powers regarding evidence, etc. in order that when we inspect a place, the presumption is reversed.  In other words, it is up to them to prove to us that the milk is being used for something else other than liquid.  We have inspected the non-registered people and have prosecuted people who have not registered with us.  In this context, there were no imports when we were established and this is an issue we are chasing.  Moreover, it is an important issue for the agency and for the industry as a whole, particularly for producers.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned some other issues, including the groceries order and below-cost selling.  I believe the answer to that is we must get rid of below-cost selling, as well as this known value item, KVI, thing, and now there is an opportunity to so do.  My other colleagues will want to answer some other questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Kilcoyne" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013052100017#S00400"><p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question, the position in respect of milk differs somewhat from many other products.  We are of the view that the store or the person who sells the milk to the consumer is making a margin of approximately one third of the cost of that litre or 2 litres of milk.  Consequently, the producer or farmer, that is, the man or woman who looks after the cows, is getting one third of the price the consumer pays.  The processor is getting another third, approximately, and the store or multiple is getting the balance, namely, the other third.  However, that store really has very little outlay.  The milk arrives from the creamery, is wheeled in by the driver and then collected from the fridge by the consumer who pays for it on the way out.  In many cases, that supermarket or store does not actually pay the processor for 90 days in some cases and certainly not for one or two months.  Moreover, none of these stores and certainly not the multinationals will tell one what margin they are making.  We do not know what profits they are making, and in many cases the consumer does not know from where the product is coming.  There are loads of milk products on the shelves that claim to be made in Ireland or to be the product of Ireland and which carry the National Dairy Council label.  However, there also is milk available that carries no label and it should be mandatory that the source of origin of that milk, be it from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom, be on that label.  This is because, at present, we have no evidence that milk is not coming in from the United Kingdom mainland but it should be mandatory that such source of origin would be on the label.  It also should be mandatory that these stores should disclose the profits they are making.</p></speech>

The position is the agency's inspectors can inspect every liquid milk plant in the State, even those which are not registered with the agency.  They are able to determine whether the milk is being imported in bulk or what is the position.  Consequently, we have full knowledge in that area.  However, to provide additional information to members, the position is that one quarter of the milk being produced in Northern Ireland is coming into the State.  Since 1993, the milk supply in Northern Ireland has increased by 50%, whereas the milk supply in the Republic has increased by approximately 3%.  Moreover, 80% of that increased supply in Northern Ireland is coming down here either for processing by creameries within the State or into the liquid milk trade.  This puts together the picture for members but I reiterate we know exactly what is coming in.  The one that can be more difficult for us to track is what is arriving in the form of packaged liquid milk, but we are getting co-operation from processors on that.</p></speech>

Another point is the European Union mark only tells one where the thing was processed and not where the contents are from.  This can be critical and I am not just talking about milk, as one should know this for all products.  In the case of a chicken in a box, the box might be Irish, the chicken might not but yet it might have a processor logo including the letters "IE".  That is a problem.</p></speech>

On the future of liquid milk, it is seriously vulnerable at present.  There is no dependency in relation to Northern Ireland milk.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to this as well.  The Northern Ireland milk could be gone in six months' time.  If the position worsens in the United Kingdom, that milk supply could drift over, across the Irish Sea, into the United Kingdom and could be stopped from us.  To date, the liquid milk producers in the State have given enough cover in the wintertime.  That is part of their commitment.  However, their confidence is waning because of the losses they have incurred on their farms.</p><p>  I was asked about the figure of 10%.  The 10% figure is the proportion of the total production of milk in the State that goes into the liquid milk trade.  The 20% figure is the cover from registered milk producers for milk supplies in the liquid trade during the winter months.  That might clarify that point.</p><p>  I also was asked how the code of conduct might be funded.</p></speech>

The consumer must be confident in the product that he or she buys, in other words, that the product is what is referred to on the label, that he or she is getting the quality and the truth is on the label.</p><p>  Those who have dodged that in the past are some of the supermarkets when product, including their own label product, was not what it said on the package.  If there is anyone guilty and owes an obligation to the consumer, it is these guys who have operated in selling products under their own brand which were not accurately described on the box.  They were not penalised heavily.  I believe that they should have to pay the penalty for this regulation and pay the cost of it.</p></speech>

How will that add to the price of milk to the consumer?  If they were going to do it across all of their products, that defeats that argument.</p></speech>

At the outset, however, we are talking about the multiples and their reaction to the cost of a code of conduct.  It has been clear from the proceedings today that the only ones who are making money out of the liquid milk business are the multiples.  What else would we expect them to say?  If they are the ones who are making money and they are happy with the existing system, what else would we expect them to say?  Are we going to listen to that?

That milk has no home.  The milk business in Northern Ireland has not had sufficient funds to build processing capacity on its own soil and has left it on our doorstep.  That is a sad reflection on the significant growth in milk production in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked a simple question about whether we can cover the rising costs.  Deputy McNamara also mentioned it.  As a producer, I will tell the committee that over the past 12 months, every liquid milk producer in the country has lost money.  It is a simple fact.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether there is adequate compensation and he implied that the National Milk Agency has not done its business on a budget of &euro;600,000 to &euro;700,000.  That &euro;600,000 to &euro;700,000 is farmers' money that is deducted from their milk cheques every month, and one will travel the European Union and the world to find an agency that has done as good a job in the liquid milk sector as the National Milk Agency.  One will not find a liquid milk sector elsewhere in Europe such as there is on this soil.  We should be very proud of it and we need to nurture it.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether we will run short of milk in the winter months.  We may not run short of milk as we know it, but most definitely we will run short of quality fresh milk that is the ideal product to put into the consumer's bottle.  That point is often lost in the public media.</p><p>  We were asked about the cost of the code of conduct.  I addressed it earlier.  As the producer representative on the National Milk Agency, I will state there is not a liquid milk producer who would not willingly help if he or she thought the only person making money in the business in the current scenario, that is, the multiple, would take part of the burden.</p><p>  There have been a few sad histories of indigenous businesses on Irish soil.  There was a lovely sugar industry.  We did not nurture it, we lost it and now we would like it back.  There was the beefburger scandal where the frozen beefburger came under undue and unnecessary pressure from the system.  We are all aware of the end result, but it was the system that put the pressure on and left it as it was.  There was a more exemplary case quite recently in the clothing sector where the primary manufacturers of many of our clothes suffered a loss of life because the pressure the system put on the primary manufacturer was untenable and unsustainable.  It should not be allowed happen.</p><p>  I am a liquid dairy farmer and I am proud to be one.  I am here today to ask public representatives for help for the indigenous industry of which we are proud.  A little knowledge is dangerous.  Public representatives need to be properly informed.  I told the committee what happened in Northern Ireland.  We look across the water to the United Kingdom and what has happened to the domestic industry there.  The committee should get familiar with the situation.  We need to nurture the domestic milk industry.</p></speech>

The National Milk Agency's job is to ensure adequate compensation.  Two points have been made to us by its representatives present.  The first is that liquid milk farmers are not making money.  The second is, if I take it on a three to five year basis - taking anything shorter than that is a nonsense because of the cycle - the purpose for which the agency has been set up is to assure milk 365 days a year.  When I speak of milk, I refer to fresh milk because there is enough powdered milk in this country to keep us going forever.  The agency's job is to ensure the provision of fresh milk 365 days a year.  I did not blame the agency.  The question I asked was whether the agency needs more power to ensure the compensation which guarantees the supply in the longer term, because one cannot do it on an annual basis.  I will put a rider on it as well.  Should the agency have extra power to deal with extraordinary situations such as we have at present?</p></speech>

The winter of 2012-13 has created a huge blockage in people's thinking and we have had the fodder shortage as well.  However, the increase is still there and farmer confidence must be rebuilt to ensure that more milk is produced.  Liquid milk producers represent approximately 10% of producers but they produce approximately 16% of the milk.  Their confidence has been very badly rattled, but the agency cannot set the producers' price for milk.  It is not part of its role.  The producers' price for milk is set in the market in negotiations between producers and processors.  To date, the intervention of the agency has ensured that there is an adequate supply during the winter.  Going forward, however, there can be no assurance.  There is a question of whether the press release was adequate but we cannot go down and tell a processor what price he should pay for milk.  It is not something we can determine.  The members may have to rethink.</p></speech>

While we would love to have additional powers to deal with the situation, there are two sides to the discussion.  First, one is sitting in an EU environment in which one cannot price fix.  The National Milk Agency does its business by looking at whether supply will be maintained.  One of the items in the working guidelines is the question of whether a system is working.  If it is, we accept it.  Second, there is a history behind the co-operative and processor business in Ireland and they closely guard the relationships with producer panels.  Their entitlement is to design their own mechanisms for compensation.  By and large, those systems are working.</p><p>  What we are faced with now is a landscape in which fast responses are required.  As raised at the NDC conference last week, the industry must consider some immediate response mechanism or a mechanism for removing immediate risk from the system.  The producers along with the processors carry a great deal of risk.  The rotten thing about the job of a producer is the level of risk he or she faces.  That is the difficulty.  How one resolves it in terms of framing a power is not something I can give direct answers on here.  It is a difficulty and what the committee is saying is true.  The processors have their views on the matter also.</p></speech>

Last year, some of the major processors introduced a change to link the price for liquid milk to the actual manufacturing price base plus a winter premium.  That premium is now something over 3 to 3 and a half cent per litre.  We will again commission Teagasc to examine the cost of winter milk production arising from the disaster we have had in 2012-13 to see what costs have been incurred and to consider the levels of compensation for liquid milk production in the winter period.  We need to look at that.</p></speech>

It gives some degree of confidence to liquid milk producers that the State has introduced a statutory guarantee that a premium must be paid in the winter months to pay for liquid milk.  If we look around the rest of the islands, milk is just treated as milk.  That is why we have the situation in Northern Ireland where people are not doing well at all.  Here, we recognise that there is something to protect and that protection is important.</p></speech>

Certainly, the Northern Ireland situation is becoming quite unusual.  As some of the people attending the committee today have said, Northern Ireland producers have developed their scale and are approximately three times larger than producers in the Republic and they have absolutely enormous borrowings.  They are now looking at marketing opportunities without processing facilities.</p></speech>

RGDATA made a submission to the joint committee in March.  We have spoken about the three main players in retail who have an 80% share of the market.  We spoke in an earlier report about the fact that grocery prices are 18% higher in Ireland than in the United Kingdom.  Given that they have an 80% share of the market, the three main players must take much of the responsibility for the fact that prices are higher here.  I very much accept Mr. Kilcoyne's point that the profits should be revealed.  There is no doubt that a great deal of the money is leaving the State.</p><p>  Next time there is a milk war, the first thing members should do is to walk down the minerals section of any large supermarket and look at the mixer shelves.  When the price of milk goes down, they will see the price of tonics and ginger ales increase from perhaps &euro;1.09 to &euro;1.50.</p></speech>

After three hours of deliberations today, the committee is trying to bring itself up to speed on this matter.  I hope the representatives of all the organisations present will accept that.  As they can see, this has been done in a collegiate and cross-party fashion to extract the best out of this process.  Frankly, it would not be worth our while if it was turned into a political football.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made an interesting observation about a Northern Ireland dairy company.  The committee might recommend that our colleagues in the agriculture committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly examine this matter with regard to liquid milk.  This is a matter that brings in the issues such as the decimation of the family farm structure, the future of rural communities, animal welfare, etc.  We should notify the Assembly&rsquo;s committee of our concerns about this development because it is really a divide-and-conquer technique.</p><p>  When I asked earlier for a short answer as to whether liquid milk supplies were stable or unstable, the unanimous response was they are unstable.  With abolition of quotas and the seasonal manner in which the supply chain is planned, the committee has highlighted this issue that is coming down the tracks.  For those who want to continue to make profits out of fresh milk, they should take notice.  They have been warned of the implications of not retuning a fair price to the primary producer and, to be fair, the processors.</p><p>  Today, we had hearings for the past three hours from those involved in the sector.  It is interesting we have not mentioned subsidy once, except about a return to a subsidy for producers in New Zealand to make it attractive to supply milk to local shelves.  We do not want to go down that route.  The committee spends much time talking about schemes and grants but in this case we are talking about a return from the commodity to the producer and processor.  This is a commodity that needs a fair market return.  It does not need support from the taxpayer, other than that a reasonable price is returned through the supply chain.</p><p>  It was suggested earlier that the committee would invite the relevant statutory agencies in this sector to present to it which we will do.  On foot of that, we will be writing up our report which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and put into the public domain.</p><p>  I thank the delegations for attending and Members for their constructive contributions and lines of questioning.</p></speech>

I propose we deal with schedule B first.  It is proposed that the proposals listed on schedule B, apart from COM(2013)237, do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The schedule A proposals are as follows.  COM(2012)730 is a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal state aid and Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road.  This Council regulation is part of the overall legislative package on the state aid modernisation, SAM initiative, of the EU.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is supportive of this initiative and is also supportive of this proposed Council regulation.  This regulation proposes to extend the scope of the types of aid that could, in the future, be covered by block exemptions thus reducing the administrative burden on member states relating to state-aid procedures.  For that reason, it is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, I propose that the wider issue of state aid modernisation, the SAM initiative, be placed on the committee agenda as an item for consideration at a later date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM(2013)75 is a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on market surveillance of products which are mentioned in the current directive.  This proposal on a single regulation on the market surveillance of products is aimed at simplifying the current procedures on market surveillance and product safety for the benefit of both businesses and national authorities.  It is critical from a product safety and market surveillance perspective and will help the efficient functioning of the Single Market, which is a crucial component in assisting Europe's economic recovery.  As Ireland welcomes the proposal subject to some minor clarifications, it is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The construction industry in the Ireland has gone through a dramatic period of decline over the past six years.  Activity in the industry had been valued at &euro;38 billion in 2006.  However, that activity has experienced significant levels of decline in the period since.  In six years the value of activity in the sector has experienced a drop of approximately &euro;30 billion.  The decline in activity has had major implications for our industry.  There has been an enormous decline in the level of direct construction employment.  The peak of direct construction employment was reached in second quarter of 2007 when a total of 273,900 people were working in the industry.  The most recent figures for direct construction employment are from the last quarter of 2012, when the total level of employment was recorded as being 103,200.</p><p>  According to those figures the level of direct construction employment has declined by 170,700.  We estimate that when indirect employment and ancillary jobs are added in, the decline in the construction industry has resulted in a loss of approximately 250,000 jobs.</p></speech>

They outlined a number of proposals which have direct implications for Revenue's business processes.  What discussions have they entered into with Revenue?  Have they tabled proposals for pilot schemes directly?  I welcome the proposals on grant assistance for upgrading principal private residences in light of their potential for creating employment.</p><p>  Construction is probably the sector most targeted by those who sell illicit fuel.  What advice does the federation give to its members to alert them to the dangers of buying illicit fuel?  I understand the federation is working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on a new register of builders in order to curtail the black market.  What is involved in compiling that register and will it give rise to administrative costs?</p><p>  What advice is the federation giving to its members on existing REAs pending legislative clarification and what are the witnesses' views on the issue?  Perhaps we will invite them before us on another occasion to express their views on REAs but what are they currently advising CIF members in regard to obligations under existing REAs, particularly in respect of payments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013052100005#F00200"><p>It is clear that the experience of the industry is still pro-cyclical.  In other words, pro-cyclical policies brought it to a production output of &euro;38 billion annually but the flip side of those policies are to blame for its current output of &euro;8 billion.  Unfortunately the policies have not changed.  It is interesting that we are discussing the black economy on a day that a number of multinational companies were found not to be paying taxes in this State.  This is an important issue at the other end of the spectrum even if it does not directly relate to the federation.  Gaps in compliance and enforcement seem to be the crux of the problem.  There are regulations and standards but businesses appear to shirk their responsibilities to comply with VAT and other taxes, as well as on the pay and conditions of workers.  Clearly this is a challenge for those good companies which do their best by their staff.</p><p>  One of my fears with regard to the changes to REAs is that international companies will be able to tender for Irish construction projects without being required to pay at REA levels.  What sort of disadvantages will that pose to the federation's members?  All-Ireland harmonisation is also important in this regard.  Many of the federation's members feel disadvantaged in competing with operators from the North of Ireland for tenders in the South.  What advice would the witnesses give to the Government in working with the Executive in the North on equalising excise and other tax levels in order to provide a fairer playing field?  In the context of enforcement and compliance, the OPW has considerable influence over the tendering process.  How could it improve its services?</p></speech>

We have formed a new committee to draft this year's pre-budget submission, which will focus on the impact we can make in growing the economy, creating jobs and avoiding the black economy.  The Government always weighs its stimulus plans against the potential for economic leakage because it does not make sense to spend on a project if the expenditure is going to disappear into another constituency or the black economy.</p><p>  On the issue of illicit fuel, construction companies have a right to use marked gas oil on site.  The amounts used would certainly not be as large as in the agricultural sector.  I am conscious of where I come from, however, and there is a strong view in the agricultural sector that the rebate should be retained.  There is a high level of criminality involved, as well as environmental risk from dumping.  This has spread to Dublin city recently in terms of washing.  The CIF takes the view that if people could reclaim the rebate we would do away with criminality immediately and Revenue and the Customs and Excise could reduce the amount of resources they are required to devote to this area.  This is one of the biggest issue they deal with and, in terms of the black economy, diesel laundering represents one of the biggest areas of loss of revenue for the Exchequer.  These problems could be addressed with a stroke of the pen.  Our right to seek a rebate would have to be guaranteed but even if the rebate was doubled there would still be savings for the Exchequer.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Fitzpatrick to deal with the register of builders but the judgment on the REAs came as a shock to us.  We had been negotiating a reduced rate for the last 18 months but the machinery for negotiating deals is very slow and torturous.  We were only dealing with the compliance element of a 2.5% reduction.  We are considering the situation, which is new to us, and our message is that our member firms are still obliged to respect the employment contracts and agreements they have entered into with individual workers unless there is consensual agreement to alter them.  We are letting the hare sit and it is steady as it goes.  We are not recommending anyone to take advantage of the new situation because, even though the REAs have been struck down as unconstitutional, they are currently the basis for our employment arrangements.  We want to get our own act together before we sit down with any other sector.  I believe we are taking a responsible approach in letting things sit.  The judgment came as a bolt out of the blue.</p><p>  In regard to gaps in compliance and enforcement, there is generally an onus on clients, including the Department of Education and Skills, to award contracts to the lowest tender.  Quantity surveying is an exact science and it is not a big task to work out exactly how much a school with eight classrooms will cost.  Our president outlined the pressure on work.  We cannot justify or explain it but member firms have tendered below cost.  That is something we are trying to deal with inside the industry but clients have accepted these tenders.  We do not have a magic bullet.  A company that is well-financed could choose to build a school for half price in its own area if it had a mind to do so but generally we can no longer offer such largesse.  Below cost projects lead to problems, such as inferior work, risk of breakdown, major delays and extra costs in finding new contractors.  We believe significant responsibility rests with the clients, who should be more selective and critical in analysing the financial viability of tenders.  They are obliged under law to check everything and we believe there is scope in that regard.</p></speech>

If some of our suggested proposals were implemented, more work, for example, the refurbishment and improvement of houses, would be undertaken in a compliant industry.  They would ensure that VAT was paid and construction workers were registered for PAYE and PRSI.  They would encourage home owners to engage compliant builders.  The proposals would not have a major impact on the Exchequer but it would lead to a greater level of compliance within the industry, as people would engage compliant contractors so that they might recover their VAT or whatever the case might be.</p><p>  We have discussed a register of builders with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We hope to introduce a process for the registration of builders early next year.  We want the process to move to a standards-based registration system over time.  Initially, it would work on a voluntary basis with a view to it becoming statutory.  We are anxious to work with the Department on a scheme for the registration of compliant builders who will commit to a certain level of training and continuous professional development to ensure that they understand their obligations fully, particularly under the building control regulations, to build to the appropriate standards and adhere to all legal requirements.</p></speech>

For any construction industry to go from 20% of GDP to 4.5% would be a concern for anyone.  There are significant job opportunities.  I welcome some of the proposals, which the Government examined last year ahead of the budget.  Some are onerous, others need to be refined and others still might already have been implemented, but we need a scheme whereby only compliant builders who pay their taxes are used.  Tax evasion is a different issue.  We have referred to multinationals that comply with tax law.  It is important that the committee help the process, given the significant jobs potential.</p><p>  Trainee builders and trades people present an issue.  Given the number of young people being lost, there will be gaps in the trades.  Are we addressing people's skills?  Some people are only partly qualified and have been unable to finish.  Could we propose anything to the Government that would see them finish their courses?  It is a major issue for some people.  All of the committee's members would be happy to work with our guests in that regard.</p><p>  Last year, I carried out a great deal of work on the question of the fuel rebate.  The problem is marked oil, which would also be subject to a rebate.  A large quantity of the oil burned in private homes is diesel or kerosene.  Whichever it is, it is subject to a rebate.  We considered providing a rebate to the 120,000 farmers, but this would be a significant administrative nightmare and might not be wholly welcomed.  One way around that issue was to do something in respect of marked oil for home use.</p><p>  A new recording system was introduced last October, as diesel entering the country was not being recorded properly, particularly green or farmer's diesel.  The results of the new system should be available in June.  Hauliers have received a rebate.  We must be mindful to ensure that the new system works.  We are conscious of the issue, but it is important to have accurate information.  It is not just a simple question of introducing a rebate.  Revenue, the Department of Finance and everyone else are doing their best.  For example, work on a dye is under way.  Every time we come up with a dye, someone works out how to get around it.  A cross-Border approach must be taken.</p></speech>

To go from 273,000 employees to 103,000 is dramatic.  Twenty years ago, one could not get workers in the butcher and grocery trades unless they were paid outside the tax system.  Given the fact that this practice was stopped, there must be a way of stopping it in this instance.</p><p>  Our guests have made a number of suggestions that seem to involve a considerable amount of red tape for businesses and small start-ups: all construction clients should advise Revenue; a mandatory site notice should display the names of clients; a certificate of building costs should be posted; all commencement notices should be reviewed; banks should notify Revenue of all significant cash transactions, etc.  Start-ups complain to us about the amount of red tape.  The solution offered by our guests seems to involve even more red tape.  Will they comment on this point?</p><p>  Regarding illegal fuels, I gather that Britain and Ireland are the only two countries that use this agricultural fuel system.  Countries on the Continent, in particular France and Belgium, do not.  Is there a better system than ours for enabling the identification of lower rated fuel?</p></speech>

In hindsight, the old construction economy was based on an unsustainable and unstable base.  We know the consequences.  Will our guests broadly sketch out the new construction economy's shape and elements?  Will it be built on a more sustainable base?  What impact will large infrastructural projects like the national paediatric hospital at St. James's Hospital and Grangegorman have on unemployment levels among former construction workers in this city?</p></speech>

As the president stated, the industry is estimated to be worth approximately &euro;8.6 billion this year, some 6% of GDP.  It was unsustainable at 23%, or &euro;38 billion, of GDP.  In other countries, 10% to 12% is normal.  In Ireland, that would be approximately &euro;16 billion.  Our figures suggest that a &euro;1 billion investment in infrastructure would employ 10,000 people.  As such, an extra &euro;8 billion would employ 80,000 more people in the industry.  We can support these figures.  We carried out a report with the Construction Industry Council, chartered surveyors, engineers and other players.</p><p>  The children's hospital and Grangegorman projects would be worth &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million each.</p></speech>

It comes from foreign direct investment and areas such as semi-conductor manufacture.  The food sector is also in a growth phase at present.  There are skills shortages in those sectors.  Recently we met the Minister to discuss this shortage and to look at retraining existing tradesmen who may not have the skills in those sectors.  The problem is that during the boom time the majority of the work was in the housing, retail and commercial sectors, the areas which are currently in the biggest trouble.  Where there is growth, namely, in the industrial sectors, a different skill set is required of the tradesmen.  We have been looking at the tradespeople we have and at ways of setting up courses to get them upskilled and back into the marketplace quickly.</p><p>  For example, there is a very large project in Leixlip that we hope will come into place.  Many people will know about that.  There could be a situation where up to 6,000 workers would find work on that project by this time next year and yet there will be a shortage of workers.  We have a worry about certain types of trades and we urgently need to get people upskilled.  We believe there could be courses of six or nine months' duration in existing F&Aacute;S training centres that would allow these people, who are currently on the live register, be retrained and get back into the market to take up those positions.</p></speech>

What is required here is a partnership approach.  Senator Quinn alluded to red tape and he is probably right.  The last thing we want to do is to over-correct this and go to a system that has too much red tape attached.  A partnership approach is one to be considered.  We have a lot of intellectual property, or IP, in our industry and are willing to share it with whatever kind of group might be put in place.  This is something we have been talking about for many years but no correction has been put in place to pay the dividends where the Government is losing out.</p><p>  Back in the 1980s, I was negotiating with an industry that was coming out of a very dark place.  Most of the people I was negotiating with - plasterers, blocklayers, etc. - would have been operating in the black economy.  One would agree a price with them and, on parting, they would say, "That's into my hand now, isn't it?"  They had a domestic economy where they were getting a certain amount of money into their household.  They did not care how they got it but they were receiving it.  Then we moved into a compliant industry and had to compete with the non-compliant in the funds and wages which people were receiving, which pushed up our prices hugely.  We had to gross up their net income.  That is what we are facing in a couple of years' time when, as we hope, the industry will start to recover.  It will drive the cost of our industry through the roof unless we start now to deal with the black economy.</p><p>  As an industry, we have been lobbying for a single point of contact within Government.  I am sure Mr. Parlon can talk about that in more detail.  The fact we are here today and that the committee recognises we are so multi-faceted as an industry is a good thing but we still have not got that single point of contact.  It is something we lack and the Government and our industry could both take advantage from it.  It would be an advantage to all the various areas.  We have been in different committee rooms talking about this in the past.</p></speech>

Our industry has fallen so low that we must ask if we will be in a position to provide for the future needs of the country and if we, as an industry, can cater for the needs of the foreign direct investment companies that want major premises built to high standards in the coming years.  We would like to see all those matters addressed in order to enable the industry to revive and get back to a level that would be sustainable.  We believe the industry should be creating 10% to 12% of GDP rather than the current low level at which it is operating.</p></speech>

There are lots of difficulties but, on the other hand, we still have a huge industry even though we are down at &euro;8 billion.  We employ more than 100,000 people.  In terms of sophisticated jobs, Diageo is building a new brewery which is state-of-the-art in terms of output.  It is a cutting edge project and the company won the right to build it in St. James's Gate, rather than anywhere else in the world.</p></speech>

There is a culture in Ireland that believes backhanded payment for jobs is okay but the reality is that the State loses big time because it cannot put resources back into the country.  If there are no final comments before wrapping up the session, I thank Mr. Philip Crampton, Mr. Michael Stone, Mr. Tom Parlon, Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick and Mr. Dominic Doheny for coming here today and engaging.  There is no doubt we will see them here again.  The points have been noted and this is part of a bigger issue on which we are trying to work.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Deirdre Drennan, Mr. Joe Sweeney and Mr. John Prendergast of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents to the meeting today to discuss proposed solutions.  I also welcome Mr. Colin Fearon of Grant Thornton.</p><p>  I must read out some official instructions so the witnesses should bear with me.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  After that scary message and if she feels comfortable making a presentation, I ask Ms Drennan to commence the submission on behalf of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents.  I ask that the presentations be no longer than ten minutes as it will give more time for engagement with members.</p></speech>

The National Federation of Retail Newsagents is a trade association representing independent news and magazine retailers all over the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  Today we are here to discuss issues facing members in the Republic of Ireland, and we represent approximately 500 shops in the Twenty-six Counties.  All our members are independent news or magazine retailers, meaning we do not represent multiple stores; although some retailers would be in small groups, they would be independently owned stores.  All our members sell news and magazines.  Our members range from the traditional corner shop to the full forecourt with petrol pumps, off-licence etc.</p><p>  We are delighted to be invited before the committee because we have a number of proposals we think may curtail job losses in the industry and protect current jobs.  My colleague and district president, Mr. Joe Sweeney, is a newsagent from Dublin and he will go through some of the proposals we have.</p></speech>

Since 2008, job losses have continued to rise and employment across the entire retail sector has experienced a decline of 47,000 jobs from a peak of 314,000.  Within the retail sector, 86% of retailers have fewer than ten employees and the members of our federation would often fall into this category.  Unfortunately, we are all too familiar with announcements in the media of large numbers of job losses but what is not captured is the one or two employees sadly let go in small, independent shops all over the country.</p></speech>

We would like the Government seriously to consider adopting it in this country to fight illicit trade.  With regard to a smartphone app he is going to speak about, the NFRN will pay to build and implement that app.</p></speech>

The first is the smartphone app.  We all have smartphones and there are thousands of apps.  A new product called Codentify has been developed across Europe.  It is a revolving code that can be built into a barcode for cigarettes or any other product.  It is virtually impossible for that code to be broken because it revolves all the time.  If it is put onto a barcode on cigarettes it gets a unique code subsequent to the barcode.  The smartphone app is based on the fact that if one uses one's smartphone one scan the barcode, as you can check prices in a supermarket, the smartphone app would tell one whether that product was duty paid or not.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>  It does a number of things.  It gives the person who potentially believes he or she is buying a legal product - because these products all look legal - the information to make an informed choice on whether to buy a non-duty paid product or a duty paid product.  It gives the garda&iacute; on the street who are witnessing proxy sales a tool they can use to check whether a product is legal or not on site.  I stand to be corrected but I believe the Garda cannot approach somebody directly on the street now, but that is a job the Customs and Excise would normally do.  There are people in open defiance of the law on Moore Street, at farmers' markets and at trading markets selling cigarettes they are not licensed to sell.  We, as legitimate traders, have to have a tobacconist's licence to sell tobacco. We have to keep the product behind closed doors in our shops, where it cannot be viewed by the public, and these people are openly selling these products in defiance of the law.  There are a number of areas around that which we can discuss later.</p><p>  We have eight main ports in Ireland through which one can bring large freight.  None of them have built-in x-ray or scanning machines and the country has two mobile 40 ft. scanners that have to be moved around the country.  Realistically the criminals know where these scanners are going to be and which port they are going to choose so it is easy for them to tip each other off.  We would like to see a port scanner in every port so it cuts down again on the means by which they can bring these things into the country.  It is also a job generation project because one needs approximately 12 people to operate these scanners for every 24 hour rolling period.  It is job generative and cost-neutral because the money that will be saved through the catching of the non-duty paid products can go towards maintaining these jobs.</p><p>  The last item is the criminalising the consumers of illicit tobacco.  We are referring here to the province of Quebec in Canada and its experience of pursuing consumers who knowingly purchased illegal cigarettes.  Under the provision of the Tobacco Tax Act, consumers found in possession of untaxed tobacco are subject to a minimum penalty of C$350.  This policy has received widespread support from tobacco control advocates such as the Canadian Cancer Society.  The current regime for tackling the illicit trade in Ireland has focused exclusively on smugglers and we believe by introducing a credible financial deterrent aimed at consumers, the Government may be able to lessen the economic incentive to purchase low-priced cigarettes.</p><p>  On increased revenue resources, we believe that direct contributions from the tobacco and alcohol industries should be sought by the Government to enhance the Revenue Commissioners and Garda resources as these are the industries which will benefit the most from a clampdown on the black market.  We could be using the tobacco industries to finance the port scanners.  We do not have to like what they do but tobacco is currently a legal product in Ireland on which the Government raises substantial sums of duty.  We think we should be exercising every option to make these technologies available at no cost to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

The committee also met the groups at its recent meetings in Castlebar and Ballinasloe.  To hammer home the point in terms of employment, when we left Castlebar we stopped at a newsagent in Ballinrobe which employed 15 people two years ago, between full and part-time, and today employs one person plus the owner.  Mr. Colin Fearon gave us the same figure that morning in Castlebar but it was brought home to us very vividly a couple of hours later in Martin's own shop.  He is back working full-time and a member of his family helps him, having had 15 people, between full-time and part-time, just over two years ago.  Will he please describe the smartphone app, the development costs of which he said he was willing to fund?

I understand that retailers are in crisis.  It has been mentioned that nearly 50,000 people have lost their jobs and another 30,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the sector.  That proves that the sector is in crisis and, if the current economic climate continues, it has not reached the bottom unlike many other sectors.  The State does not give enough support to retailers and enterprise.  In the North of Ireland local authorities will often develop strategic plans for towns, merchandising Internet development, social media development, and different supports can be achieved.  Some local authorities provide the same support in the South but on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</p><p>  As much as 30% of all tobacco sales in the State are illicit which threatens the Government's health policy.  An illicit tobacco seller can be fined &euro;2,800 but some gangs earn up to &euro;3 million per week on the trade.  I would like hear the delegation's views on deterrents.  Can it suggest an appropriate fine?  </p><p>  Illicit fuel sales have been regularly debated by the committee.  The illicit trad will continue until an all-Ireland fuel price is introduced which is the only way to solve the problem.  As long as a differential exists someone will exploit it to make a profit.  No matter what type of response, such as surveillance, the trade will continue to exist.  We must resolve the matter.</p><p>  Earlier Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins mentioned that one of the barriers to facilitating a fuel rebate may be the North's policy of marked gas oil.  The committee and the Oireachtas should work with the Assembly in the North to create a joint response to the marked gas oil problem.  Fuel suppliers in my part of the country are under enormous pressure.  As mentioned earlier, anybody north of County Meath who fulfils their responsibilities regarding fuel and the State are, in many ways, not competitive.</p><p>  I want to hear the delegation's views on progressive rates.  Should some element be based on the profitability of business?  My party is working on progressive rates.  We want small retailers who are struggling to pay a slightly lower rate and large profitable companies, such as Tesco, should pay a marginally larger rate.  Such a provision would give small retailers breathing space because they are suffering during these very severe economic times.  </p></speech>

He asked for a description of the app which is connected to the use of Codentify technology and replaces the paper tax stamp with a digital one.  The codes would be controlled and issued by the Government.  Anybody who wished to produce tobacco products would have to apply to the Government to use them.  The codes can be changed daily and that is why they are so attractive to the legal trade.  Illicit traders can copy the paper tax stamp in three weeks but they cannot copy the codes as quickly.  The Government has also spent quite a bit of money on producing, storing and transporting tax stamps but they are vulnerable to theft and are easily copied by counterfeiters.  The new technology can track and trace trade and each packet of tobacco can be traced back to the machine that produced it.  If legislation is put in place to allow the Garda to use the product via a smartphone app then garda&iacute; will be able to identify whether duty has been paid on cigarettes in seconds.</p><p>  We advocate an on-the-spot fine for the possession of counterfeit products discovered using this method.  The technology can be extended to other products.  I talked about using it on tobacco products because that is what we have concentrated on.  It can be used for anything that is bar coded.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary mentioned scanners.  We are anxious that the Government takes the initiative to install scanners at all ports.  Ireland is an island nation and its ports make it vulnerable to the importation of illicit products which is an easy option for illegal traders.  They even use Ireland to smuggle stuff into the UK because it is so easy to smuggle stuff in here.  Port scanners are self-financing.  A port scanner costs about &euro;3 million and would pay for itself in a week because that is how must revenue is lost through illicit trade.  There is no reason not to go ahead with the option.  </p><p>  I shall now deal with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's questions.  I want all members of the committee to understand that retailers and the federation are not pro-smoking.  However, tobacco is a legal product in our shops and we deserve the business.  Our legal channels are the only way that the Government can implement a regulation to curb the availability of tobacco to young people.  Many of the NFRN members have found that people under the age of 30 do not frequent our shops seeking tobacco.  I have no problem with young people trying to buy tobacco in my shop because they can buy it easily and cheaply on the street.  </p><p>  The Deputy asked what help can be given to small businesses.  He said that not enough has been done for small businesses and we feel the same.  The federation has adopted a policy of carefully examining the matter in the hope of providing solutions which is one way that we differ from other groups.    </p><p>  The Deputy proposed a new rates scheme for small and medium sized enterprises.  We would like the Government to give a break to smaller retailers and businesses and charge larger retailers more.  We want it to implement a system similar to the one in the North that was introduced by Sammy Wilson.  Large businesses were levied rates and the moneys were put into a fund to offset the rates charged to small businesses.  Last year was its first year of implementation and 24,000 SMEs benefitted to the tune of &euro;1,000, or the equivalent in sterling.  </p> <p>The beauty of the scheme is that it is cash neutral for Government.  There is a further positive aspect to it here in the Republic of Ireland in that it retains some of the profits.  Many of those companies will be foreign national companies and it retains an amount of their profit in this country for the benefit of this country and businesses in this country.  We think it is an ideal scheme for here.</p><p> Councillors around the country have told me that they are constantly trying to figure out a scheme that will benefit small businesses.  They state that if they implement a reduction in the rate to accommodate small businesses, they must give the same reduction to large businesses and they will lose revenue.  This scheme solves that problem.</p><p> With regard to helping SMEs, we also need the Government to look at financing.  There is a big problem with getting finance for small and medium-sized enterprises at present.  The Government has a fund to which SMEs can apply for funding.  When I speak to politicians about this, they wonder why there is a small uptake on that.  The reason is that the term is too short and the interest rate is too high.  We want the Government to look at that scheme again.  We recommend that the term should be five years, not three, and that the rate of interest should be at least as low as 5%, not the current 8%.  These are unsecured loans and we understand the reason for the regulation surrounding it, but it needs to be changed.  If it is changed, there will be a much better uptake on it and it will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises.</p></speech>

We have met several Senators and Deputies, some of whom are present, and we have travelled to Brussels and spoken to various MEPs.  As the Vice Chairman referenced earlier, we have attended Oireachtas committee meetings.  We have tried to get a level of awareness for this scheme.  What we need now is for it to come into effect.  We would ask the committee to consider that it come in with the budget via the finance Bill.  We are conscious that new legislation can take a couple of years, if not longer, to come into effect and there are retailers closing by the day which do not have two years to wait.  If we could get it brought in to the budget in October, it would be most advantageous to the sector.</p></speech>

I will add what we would believe as being the functional aspect of the application, app.  The app is a simple technology.  One has ZAPA tags now for one's coffee.  Tesco has a tag.  Everybody has a tag.  It is not difficult technology to develop.</p><p>  Senator Quinn, coming as he does from the retail business, will appreciate that there is no smoking gun out there that will fix this problem.  It is not a matter of pulling the trigger and then it goes away.  It is a combination of issues.  Fixing one issue in isolation will not fix this problem.  As Grant Thornton stated, an overall approach needs to be taken.</p><p>  First, there is virtually no penalty on the smugglers coming in.  The maximum fine is &euro;3,800 or something like that.  There is no minimum penalty.  It is not a hard drug and there are much lower penalties than in the case of cocaine, heroin or such like.  It is much more lucrative for the smugglers.</p><p>  Generally, the worst the smuggler's people on the street will get, if they are caught, is a minimum fine or they will lose their product.  We know of one case where a Polish girl was caught in possession of a large quantity of cigarettes and she stated in court that she was made to by her boyfriend and the case was dismissed.  She was fined &euro;1.  For me, as a legitimate trader who is licensed by the State to sell a legal product, there is a minimum penalty of &euro;10,000 and a week's closure of the business, and I am heavily legislated for.  I am obeying the law, yet I am the one who has the biggest stick hung over his head.  We are doing all of this and we are acting legally, while those on the other side are being given <i>carte blanche</i>.</p><p>  On the end-user side, there are consumers who are unknowingly smoking illicit product that is incredibly damaging to their health.  They are buying the product that they think is legal-----</p></speech>

I am sure it is possible.  What I am saying is they are being sold across the road out of the boot of a car opposite the corner shop and one can stand in one's door and see the people buying the stuff across the street from the local seller.</p><p>  My point is that there must be an overall approach.  One must catch the smugglers.  The Garda must have the proper legislative tools and the proper electronic equipment to establish if something is duty paid or not.  One also must make the end-user responsible.</p><p>  The end-users cannot get a free ride in this.  They are buying, knowingly or unknowingly.  If one takes the person who is unknowingly buying a non-duty paid product that is very dangerous for him or her, and if he or she has a smartphone app, one has given him or her the tool with which they can establish that this product is what it is.  A large percentage of those may stop smoking that product simply because they know what it is or they may stop smoking because they may get caught.  Then there will be the hard core who will continue to smoke it.  People are put in prison for non-payment of a television licence but there is no penalty for bringing into the country, and smoking, an illegal non-duty paid product.</p><p>  All this is needed at the ports, with the Garda and the end-users.  If one takes that overall approach and one applies it evenly, we believe that one will get a good result out of it and everyone will buy into it.  That covers what I have to say and I thank the committee for listening to me.</p></speech>

I refer to the figures that were used in the report and in respect of all-island fuel pricing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Fearon" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013052100012#N01200"><p>The first question was about the methodology and I will answer that first.  We used much of the data that is already available, such as Revenue data and Irish Tobacco Manufacturers' Advisory Council, ITMAC, data.  Then we discussed the matter with retailers.  There is a KPMG star report, which is a detailed EU-wide report which compares tobacco instances, the amount of counterfeit and contraband, etc., against Ireland.  The committee will note that Ireland is still the fourth highest, at 19% of total cigarette consumption, for counterfeit and contraband.  That is still very high.</p><p>  I will move on to the Vice Chairman's main point, which is the &euro;200 million difference to which the Minister for Finance referred.  I acknowledge that is correct.  I think it is approximately &euro;182 million.  In our report, we add it as a caveat.  When we use that number, we have it noted below.  That &euro;182 million relates to non-domestic legal tobacco consumption.  Given the fact that there is a free market, that is technically legal consumption and it should not be classified as illicit.  The reason it has been included in our report is it has been widely accepted - the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, NFRN, will support this - that much of that is not necessarily being used for personal consumption.  If I go to Spain and I buy a pack of cigarettes in Spain for &euro;5 and then I come home and smoke it, that is perfectly legal.  We put it in our higher-end estimate because, based on the current personal consumers of persons, it is not possible that the number is really being used for personal consumption.</p></speech>

However, over the long and short term, and in the past, there has been illicit trade due to that specific issue.  I do not know if I can get into tax policy.  Would that mean that we would follow the United Kingdom tax rate or how would-----</p></speech>

The price would likely develop to be different in the North of Ireland to that in Britain but given there is not a land bridge between the two, it is not likely that people will drive to Britain to avail of the cheaper price.  It would contain the price on the island and reduce the need for people to smuggle.  In addition, we spoke with representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, earlier and it would start to level some of the inputs into construction, which would then make a level playing field more achievable North and South among different sectors of industry.  That is the idea behind it.</p></speech>

I cannot speak too much on that because we did not go into too much detail on it.</p></speech>

I found their submission very educational.  I have met them previously and I know there is something to what they are saying.</p><p>  The bad news is that I will not be supportive of their suggestion to tax the supermarkets higher to subsidise the smaller shops.  That would be a tax on every housewife who shops in a supermarket, and that could not be the right thing to do.  Increasing the costs to larger stores to subsidise smaller stores at a time when we are trying to contain costs is not a runner.  </p><p>  On the other hand, I am fully supportive of the steps they are taking about tobacco.  I cannot understand the reason we have not moved in various ways.  One of the witnesses mentioned that if a garda sees somebody whom he or she suspects has illegal cigarettes in his possession for sale, he or she cannot approach that person because that must be done by a customs officer.  Will the witnesses explain that again because I am not sure I understood it?  Do I understand that if there is a danger of them being imported it is a customs officer's duty rather than a garda's duty?</p><p>  I am excited by the thought of this app, which I gather costs very little, and that it could be used by every garda and customs officer to identify people.  Does it identify counterfeit as well as illegally imported goods?</p><p>  I was surprised by the witnesses reference to the fact that it costs &euro;3 million to put a scanner into the port but that it could pay for itself within a very short period.  Will they touch on that again because if we have eight ports and only two scanners, it does not make sense when we can spend &euro;3 million on a scanner that will pay for itself in terms of stopping these imports.  If the importers of illegal tobacco know there are only two scanners, they can easily avoid ever being caught.</p><p>  The fines for people caught with illegal tobacco are very small.  Mr. Prendergast mentioned a Polish girl who had a &euro;1 fine imposed whereas those of the witnesses in trade have to pay approximately &euro;10,000 and close their shops for a week.</p><p>  The steps the witnesses are taking are the right way to proceed.  We should be well able to argue the case for the State to take the right steps in that direction.</p></speech>

If somebody who has been in the business of smuggling heroin or cocaine gets a prison sentence they are never seen again but they can literally transfer industry and begin to bring in tobacco for which they get a paltry fine.  For example, under the Casual Trading Act the first fine is &euro;68 and the second fine is &euro;317.  If someone is bringing in goods worth thousands of euro every week, that fine will not deter them.  There is a maximum fine but there is not a minimum fine.  We would like to see a minimum fine of &euro;10,000 introduced for two reasons.  First, it would be a greater deterrent but, equally, it would narrow the price point between legitimate and non-duty paid items because they will have to recover their costs.  I do not know if that answers the Senator's question.  I think he just wanted the point confirmed.</p><p>  Equally, the Senator wanted the point about the scanners confirmed.  To us it is a no-brainer.  We have six ports that are wide open and with the level of counterfeit and contraband coming through, the scanners are self-financing.  They would make a profit in a couple of weeks.  To clarify how the scanner would work, we are all familiar with the scanners at airports through which one puts hand luggage.  It is that type of scanner but on a much larger scale.  A truck would drive through it, and that is how it would work.  We cannot understand the reason there is a problem with putting scanners in every port.  Does that answer the Senator's question?</p></speech>

The multiples can well afford it, and I am not specifically targeting supermarkets.  It applies to any large business.  It might be a manufacturer or any large company over a certain size with a certain turnover.  In the North of Ireland the rate of the levy is 8.5%.  It may be nothing like that here in the Republic because we have a bigger catchment of companies to target.  I do not believe it would be a noticeable cost increase to large companies to the effect that it would affect the housewife.  I will continue lobbying for it.</p></speech>

They would be levied on all businesses which currently pay commercial rates.  From our perspective, the idea is similar to what happens in the North whereby various components are based on the type of business, the size of the building and the level of profitability of the business.  Considering that Apple has been in the news recently for paying a corporation tax of less than 0.1% we are not looking to tax items bought by househusbands or housewives.  The idea is that all taxes implemented, except commercial rates, would involve some level of progressiveness.  The idea that the more one earns the more of a particular tax or rate one pays has been around since the 1700s but it has not been applied.  A flat level has been applied against retailers.  Many retailers are just keeping their heads above water and are on the tipping point.  If we can create a mechanism which is revenue neutral to the State so the local authorities are not at a loss these people will have a chance to see the next year or two through and, please God, if there is an upside to the market they will continue to operate.</p></speech>

RTE will not cover the proceedings if they are on because they interfere with the sound system.  I ask Members to bear that in mind and to turn them off.</p><p>  We are going to discuss the topic of climate change with officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  I welcome Mr. John McCarthy, assistant secretary, environment division, Mr. Owen Ryan, principal officer, climate policy, and Ms Caroline Lyons, assistant principal officer, climate policy, of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; Dr. Rory O'Donnell, director, Dr. Larry O'Connell, senior economist, Mr. Noel Cahill, economist, Dr. Jeanne Moore, social policy analyst, of the National Economic and Social Council; and Dr. Frank McGovern of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>  I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to section 17(2)(<i>l</i> ) of the Defamation Act 2009 who are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified or partial privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that the opening statements may appear on the Oireachtas website post the deliberations here this afternoon.   I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Before commencing I wish to say a few words.  We have been asked by the Minister to initiate the process with a view to preparing and finalising legislation around climate change.  We are going to invite a number of witnesses in the coming weeks and will build on those exchanges and their experience in order to provide a report to the Minister.  We have received more than 40 submissions.  We will consider them all and how to deal with them in private session later this afternoon.  At the discretion of the committee we will invite some of those representatives who made submissions to appear before the committee and will engage in public debate with them in a transparent manner in order to provide the best possible report to the Minister when we conclude proceedings.  It is fitting to begin with three key players - the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the National Economic and Social Council and the Environmental Protection Agency.  We are mindful of the roles these organisations play in the whole issue of the environment.  I invite Mr. John McCarthy to begin his presentation.</p></speech>

Ireland, like most, if not all, developed countries, faces a significant challenge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making the transition to a low-carbon future.  Transition is not a process where a one-size-fits-all approach will work - the policies and measures which are most likely to be successful in Ireland are those that best respond to our national circumstances as reflected in our greenhouse gas emissions profile, and the structure of our economy.</p><p>  The extent of the mitigation and transition challenge is immediately evident in the demanding greenhouse gas emission reductions which Ireland must achieve in the period to 2020.  For example, in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme, Ireland must achieve a 20% reduction in emissions compared to 2005.  This target is binding under EU law and compliance is not optional &ndash; it is absolutely paramount and national ambition on transition to a low-carbon future must include compliance with this fundamental mitigation commitment.  In response to the overall mitigation and transition challenge, the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, issued a review of national climate policy in November 2011.</p><p>  In presenting the outcome of the review to this committee at that time, the Minister addressed the need to build broad support for the steps that need to be taken if we are to meet our binding obligations under EU and international law, play our role within the EU and at a wider international level to combat dangerous climate change, and achieve our aspirations as a progressive and competitive player in the emerging global green economy.</p><p>  In any briefing or discussion on climate policy development in Ireland, we have to face the reality that we have a somewhat unusual greenhouse gas emissions profile in a European context, due to a number of factors, including the high share of emissions mainly associated with livestock in the agriculture sector.  On this point, it is important to clarify that this situation has not arisen because we have a carbon intensive agriculture sector &ndash; quite the contrary in fact, we have a very carbon efficient agriculture and food sector &ndash; it is primarily due to the scale of our agriculture industry in our overall economy.  The significance of the agriculture and food sectors in Ireland brings a sharp focus to the parallel international priorities of climate protection and sustainable food production in a world with a projected population of 9 billion people in 2050.</p><p>  The 2011 policy review pointed out that the consistent EU and wider-international focus on the long-term agenda to 2050 provided the context in which national policy will have to be progressed in the post-2012 period.  It also proposed that the largely compliance-based policy pursued up to that point would not be adequate for transition over the longer-term.  Transition to a low-carbon future is a much broader agenda and long-term planning will be key to its achievement, as well as building a solid foundation for effective engagement by Ireland in the emerging global green economy.  </p><p>  Following a very positive meeting with the committee in December 2011, and in response to a specific request from the committee, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, issued a two-year programme on the development of national climate policy and legislation.  Since the programme issued in January 2012, considerable progress has been made, including a two-month period of structured public consultation which attracted a very encouraging response, and the receipt and release of two significant policy analysis reports from the NESC secretariat.  The second and final policy analysis report was released together with outline heads of a climate action and low-carbon development Bill on 26 February 2013.  Both the final report and the outline heads of the Bill have been referred to the committee for consideration and provide the substantive background for today&rsquo;s briefing.  Therefore, policy and legislation are at the core of what the committee has been asked by the Minister to do.</p><p>  In issuing the programme for the development of national climate policy and legislation, and subsequently, the Minister has made it clear that he sees a central role for this committee in the policy development process.  The report which the committee is to prepare will be one of the key documents that will inform decisions by Government in adopting a national policy position on transition to a low-carbon future, including appropriate institutional arrangements, and finalising the introduction of primary legislation.</p><p>  That is a brief overview of the background and progress to date under the current policy development programme.  I wish to turn now briefly to a few more general points of relevance which the Minister has made over the course of the programme, and some brief points of information in regard to the EU and wider international context in which national policy is being developed.</p></speech>

I understand that the joint committee has been provided with a copy of this report.</p><p>  This introductory statement draws particular attention to our thinking on the institutional arrangements which we believe to be necessary and which differ somewhat from those in the heads of Bill.  We have discussed these with our colleagues of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and look forward to discussing them with the joint committee.</p><p>  Our report argues that the Irish Government and people should commit to the ambitious goal of becoming a carbon-neutral society by 2050.  Achieving this would mean that economic activity in Ireland would, overall, make no addition to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Our work has led us to the view that fresh thinking is needed on the climate change policy challenge, both at national and international levels.  Aiming for that point, carbon-neutrality, on the horizon, we believe that it is time to focus on &quot;how to&quot; achieve deep decarbonisation.  On the one hand, nobody knows how fast a large economy can decarbonise - if by &quot;know&quot; we mean knowledge of both technological possibilities and how to get policy adopted and implemented at international level and within states.  On the other hand, as discovered during our wide consultations on this project, there is a huge amount of innovation and fine-grained knowledge on decarbonisation in firms, public bodies and civil society organisations.  In conducting our work, we were repeatedly struck by the ambition and capability of organisations to understand and reduce their carbon footprint.  This &quot;how to&quot; project of decarbonisation is already a core skill for many Irish organisations such as Glanbia and Bord Bia, who assist farmers to increase efficiency and reduce emissions; Glen Dimplex in its smart electric storage heating system; Kilbarrack fire station, Ireland&rsquo;s first carbon-neutral fire station, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s work in supporting local authorities and communities to move towards sustainable forms of energy use. </p><p>  Our emphasis on &quot;how to&quot; does not imply a rejection of targets in climate change policy.  An intelligent use of targets and indicators, focused on concrete action in the near term and which are demanding on the stakeholders in a given area, has a critical role to play.  Targets on &quot;how much&quot; are effective only if they are part of a process that explores and improves the ability of organisations, technologies, farms and households to reduce emissions, increase efficiency and use clean technologies.  At national and international levels, to get more real commitment and effective action on &quot;how much&quot;, it is now necessary to put greater effort into finding out &quot;how to&quot; technically, politically and organisationally. </p><p>  We have identified five strategic building blocks for Ireland&rsquo;s carbon-neutral future: an energy system built on wind and other renewables, using a smart grid and integrated into a clean EU energy system; an energy-efficient society that uses renewable forms of energy for heating; a sustainable transport system; a world-class agrifood sector working within a carbon-neutral system of agriculture, forestry and land use; and an approach to resource management that gives Ireland a competitive and comparative advantage in a resource stressed world.</p><p>  Much of our report is focused on how Ireland can make progress on these demanding building blocks.  This is an enormous societal challenge.  It requires a total transformation of the energy and transport systems underpinning global economic activity.  Success depends on discovering and disseminating profound technological and behavioural changes in consumption, travel and heating.  </p><p>  To move Ireland towards becoming a carbon-neutral society, we propose a pragmatic three-track approach.  All three tracks should begin immediately<i></i>and proceed simultaneously.  What distinguishes them is the kinds of action required in each.  Track one is strategic and institutional under which Ireland must frame its ongoing engagement with EU and UN processes, create effective institutional arrangements and identify its strategic approach to decarbonisation, energy policy and green growth.  Track two is to explore and experiment; in a number of areas it is necessary to consciously explore policy possibilities and experiment, building policy and organisational networks to test and scale new possibilities.  We have identified six track two exploratory projects: working towards carbon-neutral agriculture; the smart grid; electric vehicles; the electrification of heat; biomethane and anaerobic digestion; and carbon capability.  Track three is design and implement; where early action makes sense and is feasible, it is necessary to design and implement policies.  In our two reports to Government we identify the scope for such action on energy efficiency, transport, agriculture, taxation and power generation. </p><p>  Real political commitment across Government and strong leadership are a critical first requirement for the success of this transition.  Our work suggests that to progress this agenda, Government needs to undertake a number of political and institutional steps, including embed the transition to carbon-neutrality, particularly the five strategic building blocks, within the core agenda of economic recovery and development ensuring that the allocation of resources reflects these new priorities and imperatives; create and direct a new policy process and entity, which we will discuss further later; continue the transparent process of periodic review of Ireland&rsquo;s overall progress on carbon-neutrality, centred in the EPA and involving the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht; actively engage with, and contribute to, new international thinking on designing more effective 21st century climate arrangements, identifying what distinctive contribution Ireland can make based on its resources and capabilities.</p><p>  We focus here on the new process and entity that Government should create to drive this agenda.  In broad terms, it should perform the following functions: assist central government in formulation of a new carbon-neutrality strategy and broad sectoral-departmental plans and targets; drive and oversee progress on the five strategic building blocks of Ireland&rsquo;s transition to carbon-neutrality; deliberate on the progress and challenges in each of the main carbon-neutrality building blocks and project areas, as advanced by the relevant Departments, agencies and networks; and provide these agencies and their networks with upward reach or a clearing house to get the system to remove roadblocks whether technical, legal or political. </p><p>  The main authority of this body would be Government&rsquo;s power to convene the relevant actors and sanction those that resist engagement.  Its central role is to ensure and organise the joint exploration<i></i>of successes and failures and to push the agencies and networks to continually advance the boundaries of knowledge and practice on &quot;how to&quot; decarbonise.  The new entity needs to have sight of the important innovations, progress and obstacles at the level of firms, agencies and localities that are critical in making progress.</p><p>  In a number of other policy spheres there is increasing success in Ireland in creating interdepartmental and inter-agency entities that have this exploratory and problem-solving orientation.  Some relevant models include the Food Harvest 2020 high level implementation committee, the recently established State bodies group on SME finance, the marine co-ordination group and new arrangements to govern the water framework directive.  Most of the human resources that are needed are already in existence in Departments and agencies such as EPA, SEAI, Bord Bia, Coillte, Teagasc, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and in firms such as the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Glanbia and many others. </p><p>  We believe the new process and entity should be structured around three elements, as illustrated in figure 1 on page 5 of this introductory statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100007#F00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  While I welcome the opportunity to have an input into this process, I have some concerns which I will try to set out in a concise manner.</p><p>  In terms of how we, as a committee, and the representative bodies organise our work and ensure transparency, given that this is an issue of national conversation, should these hearings not be held in a format similar to that used in considering the protection of life during pregnancy Bill in the Seanad Chamber?  It is important that we get this issue part of the national consciousness.  The three contributors have referred to the ambitious targets we are required to meet.  However, they will not be met by those of us present at this meeting.  The public must also be engaged in this process.  I would, therefore, welcome feedback from the delegates on the issue of public engagement.</p><p>  On the advice given to the Minister that we should not set targets, I understand the Minister has stated that that is the advice of the Attorney General.  It would be useful, again in opening up the debate on this issue, if the joint committee could have sight of that advice.  Mention was made of Ireland becoming a carbon-neutral society by 2050.  The targets of a 20% reduction by 2020 and 80% by 2050 are high.  Ireland has, through the offices of the Minister, called on the European Union to set out clear targets.  It appears that the logical thing to do would be to also provide for this in Irish legislation.  In other words, in calling for the setting of clear targets by the European Union there is a requirement on us to also set out clear targets in domestic law.  Perhaps an official from the Department might comment on this suggestion.</p><p>  Also on targets, there is a long road to be travelled between now and 2050.  An issue of concern to me from the commencement of this process is that if we do not set clear five year targets by way of a roadmap, etc., given that Governments come and go - as the maximum term of office of a Government is five years, we could have two or three new Governments in ten years; we once had three new Governments in two years - we could end up having in place a Government that was not as committed to tackling the climate change problem as another, leaving a lot of ground to be made up between before 2050 and the possibility of us meeting a carbon cliff.  It appears logical that we should not kick the can down the road on this issue and leave open to any Government the possibility of deviating from the targets set at any time in the future.  This is a matter of shared responsibility.  Each Government and all of us need to do what is required between now and 2050 to achieve carbon-neutrality.  I would welcome a comment from the delegations on this issue.</p><p>  Head 10 of the Bill provides for reporting on progress to the D&aacute;il.  It would also be useful to include at that point in the Bill that such a report from the Taoiseach be made on an annual basis.  Overall, given that we are asking the public, businesses and the local authorities to engage in this process, it is important that it is opened up from the start and that people are made aware of the importance of this issue.  The process must be transparent and people must be convinced that they are part of it.  If we are not transparent in how we do our business, including in publishing the Attorney General's advice and reports on the matter to the D&aacute;il, we will not capture the public mood and good in the way we need to do.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. McCarthy to make that presentation, following which he can respond to the issues raised by Deputy Brian Stanley.  I will then invite other members of the panel to respond.</p></speech>

However, I would say - it was a comment that ran through a number of the opening statements - what we are talking about here is a fairly significant societal shift if we are to get to where we need to be in 2020 and 2050.  It requires fairly extensive engagement in order to ensure that both the product of the committee and the policy product that the Minister and Government ultimately approve has as broad a base of support as can possibly be achieved.  A balance must be struck between engagement and a capacity to do one's work efficiently, but I would emphasise that what we are talking about here is a societal shift of a fairly significant order of magnitude.</p><p>  In terms of the Attorney General's advice, I am not a lawyer but my understanding is that the Attorney General's advice is generally not published.  I am not sure that such advice can be made available.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100009#H00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations which were quite informative and well explained.  I agree with Deputy Stanley that the failure to put in place 2050 targets or objectives at global, EU or member state level hollows out the Bill and reduces its strategic impact on Irish environmental policy.  It is a step back and is disappointing.  We have always portrayed ourselves as an environmentally friendly country wishing to embrace the global movement in this regard.</p><p>  To summarise the Bill, grandiose terms, challenges, opportunities, obligations and mitigation have been mentioned, and it has been said that cost efficiency should be the theme running throughout.  Ireland's vision to 2050 has also been mentioned.  We will have a 12 month timeframe to finalise this and afterwards will be assessed every seven years.  The witnesses spoke about how Departments can apply specific visions to their policies.  Is the timeframe for Departments the same as it is for implementing the Bill?  An expert body will advise on the process and there will be an annual report and review of our international commitments.  The expert body will also have periodic reviews with more reporting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Will it report to this committee?</p><p>  Aside from this, the EPA presentation mentioned the urgency of action required.  The NESC mentioned specific objectives which must be enshrined and, to be fair, makes suggestions on mechanisms which can be put in place for this to be achieved.  Will these mechanisms form part of the policy which will emanate from the various processes which have been put in place under the heads of the Bill?  What cost analysis has been carried out in this regard?  Costs will be involved in establishment and implementation but a cost benefit may accrue.  Has any cost measurement being done on what the State might derive from implementation?</p><p>  Will the witnesses provide specific details on the timeframe for the Bill to be published, brought before the Houses and approved?  Is it possible to have just one report per annum thereafter which would include a report to this body, being an all-party committee?  Only two years ago an all-party committee produced a Bill which went to the Government which included targets for 2050 and objectives specific to Ireland and cognisant of other international targets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100010#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Sometimes, the words "targets" and "objectives" are used interchangeably.  In some people's minds, they are different.  Targets are often referred to in terms of legislative provisions that are legally binding, justiciable, etc.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has undertaken development work that will lead to a national low carbon roadmap, which must be taken together with the Bill.  Instead of specifying targets in legislation, the intention is for the statutorily based roadmap to be the vehicle for setting out the overall national ambition.  I would not want members to have the sense that the absence of targets in the legislation means that we have no vision for 2050.  The sectoral roadmaps being prepared for agriculture, transport, energy and buildings are based on the work of the NESC.  There is a clear overall ambition for the energy, buildings and transport sectors, that being, as close to zero carbon as can be achieved.  The objective for agriculture is carbon neutrality.  The energy, buildings and transport objectives are in line with the EU's low carbon roadmap to 2050.  It is in the sectoral roadmaps, which will ultimately form the national roadmap, rather than in the legislation that the national ambition will be set.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy regarding the urgency of action.  This issue was mentioned in each opening statement.  Even for 2020, the urgency of action is abundantly clear from the EPA's projections, which were published in recent weeks.  As members will have seen from one of the graphs in Dr. McGovern's presentation, the emissions reduction target for 2020 is 20%.  Even in the best of the two scenarios displayed, we will only achieve a 10% reduction.  We need new policies and measures to address this gap of at least 10%.  Given the evolving debate on 2030 and onwards, the emissions reduction ambition is only going in one direction.</p><p>  The sectoral Departments are the owners of their sectors.  They know them best.  It will be a matter for them in their sectoral roadmaps to address issues of cost benefit analysis and appropriate paths to 2050.  This reflects another of our themes, in that, while this is challenging, it is also an opportunity that we need to grasp if we are to be in the right place in terms of reduced emissions by 2030, 2040 and 2050.</p><p>  Under the roadmap, it was envisaged that the heads of the Bill and the NESC report would be before the committee by the end of 2012.  Members received it in late February, approximately two months behind schedule.  We envisaged a report back from the committee by the end of June.  We are in discussions with the Chairman and have indicated that we are happy to provide further latitude, given the fact that we were a couple of months late in providing the material.  The intention was to finalise the heads by the end of the year, but that timeframe may stretch a little in light of the delay.  Subsequently, the Bill will enter the drafting process.  It will then be a matter of how quickly it passes through the drafting process and is laid before the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100010#J00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations and for the documents that have led to this point.  There seems to be a conflict in the advices of the current and previous Attorneys General.  The Government does not publish that advice, but it was the basis for not including targets.  It is important that we understand the reasons for the decision.  Were they purely financial?  Was it a question of protecting the State against the possible cost of not reaching our agreed international targets?</p><p>  The clock is already ticking on 2020.  It will not wait for the legislation.  As outlined today, more than legislation is required.  Practical implementation, good institutional arrangements and a means of tracking progress and making changes are necessary.  In terms of policy choices, the 2011 NESC report recommended that we consider measures that have a cumulative benefit.  The downturn in the economy has caused a reduction but perhaps we should consider the retrofitting of homes and so forth, measures that would have a benefit beyond 2020.  Is this matter being tracked?  The home retrofit scheme has almost collapsed and people are being alienated by policy decisions, for example, not ring-fencing the carbon tax.  People can see a relationship between one and the other.  Choices have a bearing on our culture.  Accepting that the clock is ticking, are we climate change-proofing policies and financial decisions?  We may need to reverse some policy decisions, even those made in the past year.</p><p>  The three main sectors are agriculture, residential housing and transport.  The changes in the public transport system that we are considering might have short-term gains, but they will not produce the long-term modal shifts that we require if we are to encourage people to use public transport.  This is the "How To".</p><p>  As milestones have to do with policy choices, I will not press the issue, but we in this country have made an industry of writing reports.  Given the amount of material that we are supposed to read on this subject, several trees must have been chopped down.  An element of simplicity will be necessary.  Policy nerds, so to speak, should not be the only ones tracking changes.  We must have simple mechanisms so that people can buy into them.  This change will not be imposed - people must buy into it.  This element is essential if we are to create a culture of individual responsibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100011#K00200"><p>To follow up on the Deputy's last point, she is correct in that an adequate response to climate change cannot come from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Custom House because we all know the key sectors for emissions giving rise to climate change are in transport, energy, buildings and agriculture.  Although some elements of the building trade are controlled by the Custom House, the rest are not.  That was a significant factor in the approach the Government decided to take to require the sectors and the Departments leading the sectors to prepare roadmaps for the sectors.  It is a fundamental principle of environmental integration that in policy development, account should be taken of the environmental aspects, including climate impacts.  That is the appropriate area, as the Deputy correctly points out, for planning in those sectors, including climate planning.</p><p>  The clock is already ticking for 2020, as the Deputy mentioned.  As I stated earlier, even in the most optimistic of the two scenarios presented by Dr. McGovern, there is still a significant gap between where those measures will take us and where we need to be in 2020.  The retrofitting of homes is led by our colleagues in the energy Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  It is still going on and being funded, and there is a smaller ongoing programme in retrofitting public housing stock for better energy efficiency, which colleagues in the Department are leading.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about simple mechanisms that will help in getting buy-in from people, and they are crucial.  As I mentioned, we are talking about a fundamental societal change.  One of the areas we must tackle in parallel with legislation and roadmaps will be how to put in place ways to assist various players, including the public, in taking a part in becoming more climate friendly, as we have done in the past with waste and other areas.  It is a matter of how to get it into the public mind and how we can get traction, as we have seen with waste recycling and recovery rates shooting up over the past decade from a very low base.</p><p>  The institutional arrangements were referred to in the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report and I will ask Dr. O'Donnell to comment on how those institutional arrangements might work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rory O'Donnell" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100011#K00300"><p>Our focus in thinking about the institutional arrangements very much reflects our characterisation of the climate change policy problem.  It involves, in broad terms, both the need for stronger political and societal will in all countries on the one side and innovation and the introduction of new technologies, along with fine-grain learning, on the other.  The problem requires both as they are critical in thinking about the institutions, because if we drop one of those, there will be a simple solution that will either enforce political will and tie the hands of future governments or leave it to the market.  Neither of those will work.</p><p>  The entity we have outlined involves an attempt both to drive and to capture change where it really happens.  In our study, we have observed and reported change in numerous organisations, such as Glanbia, An Bord Bia, Bewley's, Celtic Linen and other companies.  These firms are innovating, and the question is what institutional mechanism would lead to a public entity being built in a way that pushes other organisations to innovation and assists them in doing it while learning from them.  Hence the entity described in our note, which would have the elements of a high level board supported by a technical secretariat, both of which would be connected to networks which would tend to have an agency at its centre.  Teagasc works with large numbers of farmers and food organisations; the SEAI works with firms, big and small, and communities; and other agencies work within different networks.  Our institution is designed to reflect both the dimension of the need for drive and political will.  As the Deputy said, the centre cannot solve problems it knows less about than front-line actors.</p><p>  Our institutional design may be similar in many respects to what is in the heads of the Bill, but it differs in a number of others.  I will elaborate on that if the committee wishes me to do so.  The institutional entity we describe, as with that described in the heads of Bill, is more of the system than entirely independent.  For example, it has the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the SEAI and Teagasc among its members.  It has a role in assisting the formulation of both the national and sectoral roadmaps or plans.  It is also similar in having an information gathering role and undertaking research, and it also has the right to create committees or teams to probe more deeply into specific problems.</p><p>  Our proposal differs somewhat in a number of other respects.  Whereas the heads of the Bill see the body being supported by EPA staff, we suggest that it be supported by a small, technical secretariat drawn from a range of agencies, including the SEAI, the EPA, Teagasc and other relevant entities.  This reflects the need for this secretariat and its senior board to push a range of agencies and their networks, whether they are in farming, energy generation, transport, etc.  The heads of the Bill describe the expert body as facing mainly towards government - if I understand it correctly - and delivering advice to the Minister and others, but we suggest a body that would be in one sense closer to government.  For example, it could be chaired by a Cabinet Minister.  Equally, it should also face outwards to agencies and networks, where the real action, innovation and rich knowledge reside.</p><p>  Those two perspectives have subtle differences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1062" speakername="James Bannon" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100012#L00200"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their informative presentations.  Dealing with climate change is probably one of the greatest challenges we face today.  When the witnesses went through the heads of the Bill earlier they spoke about setting targets.  Targets can disappoint, as the witness correctly said a few moments ago.  A roadmap would probably be the better way to proceed.  Who will appoint the national expert advisory body on climate change?  Will it have representatives from the agricultural community, the construction industry and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  In the case of our road structure, for example, huge opportunities were missed when we were constructing the motorways throughout the country.  I and others of a similar mind thought we should have constructed a light rail line alongside the motorways to encourage people onto public transport systems, rather than use their motor vehicles.</p><p>  Dublin is gridlocked.  I am from a rural area and it takes me longer to travel a 3 km stretch of road in Dublin than to travel the 100 km to the city.  We should be examining ways and means of freeing up traffic in the city.  All main routes connect to the city.  Much of the traffic coming from Northern Ireland could be diverted through the midlands if roads such as the N55 were upgraded.  It is an area that has been bypassed for quite a long time.  In addition, will there be joined-up thinking in the various Departments?</p><p>  The paper by the National Economic and Social Council describes a vision for the future.  It outlines five building blocks, but the witnesses will be aware of how controversial some of those building blocks are at present across the midlands in respect of the first priority, developing wind energy.  There are problems with wind turbines in the midlands.  One will see meetings of up to 700 people gathering in a hall to protest.  They are totally against the construction of those monstrosities in the countryside.  The impact they will have on our tourism industry, people's homes, people's sleep patterns and so forth has been outlined to us repeatedly.</p><p>  With regard to other renewables, we all witnessed what happened with the biofuel episode.  It took off with a great fanfare of publicity a few years ago.  However, there were no markets for the miscanthus grass and farmers who undertook producing that agricultural product were denied their establishment grants and so forth.  There was a great buzz about that renewable crop at the time but nothing really happened.  When the climate was not suitable for growing biofuel products farmers were denied the grants.  It has left a very sour taste for getting people to adapt to change.  This is something that must be addressed.</p><p>  With regard to the wind turbines, there is little or no consultation by the companies that have been mandated to get them up and running across the midlands.  That is the big problem with the general public.  Representatives of the various companies have come here and met politicians on the issue, but there is very little consultation with the general public.  A negative attitude is developing.</p><p>  The EPA report talks about global action.  What is required is a global treaty on the reduction of emissions.  This must happen.  There is huge public hunger for serious action on this issue and it is growing.  We have heard the scientific case time and again and it is beyond doubt that action is needed.  We have witnessed the erratic and extreme weather conditions in this country and, indeed, the poor people of Oklahoma are witnessing that as we speak.</p><p>  There are huge challenges but there are a few questions I hope will be answered today.  The cost of carbon tax will increase the cost of public transport.  It should be designed to encourage people out of their cars and onto the public transport system.  Even school transport costs have increased.  It is a huge cost and it is impacting on the tourism industry as well.  The policies have not been thoroughly thought through with regard to those issues.</p></speech>

This is probably one of the most important meetings of this committee because we are all charged with sustainable development and ensuring that we, as politicians, leave the earth much better than we found it.  Hopefully, we will all strive to do that.  How to do it and how much it will cost are the two big questions.</p><p>  With regard to how to do it, we are looking to experts such as the witnesses and everybody else we can find to show how that can be done.  We all want to do the best we can.  That is what I will be trying to do anyway to lead to a progressive society.  We cannot lose sight of having a competitive society either in economic terms.  Developing a competitive society as well as a progressive and sustainable society is the balancing act we are charged with, and we want to know how best to do it.  That is what this committee is about.  I do not know how many times we will be able to thrash it out so perhaps the Chairman will tell me how much time we have to consider the issue.</p></speech>

Science has proven that global temperatures are rising but its hard to convince people when we have to put our coats on in May.  People assume that we are play-acting.  There must be scientific proof.  Even though we know that global temperatures are rising the public think such claims are a joke.  Scientific facts state otherwise.  We need an educational programme like Reduce, Reuse and Recycle to bring all of the actors with us.</p><p>  I am helping to organise a conference with EUFORES at Dublin Castle from 21 to 22 June.  Can the Chairman confirm if the details have been circulated to members?  Mr. John McCarthy rightly mentioned that breaking the link between energy and fossil fuel is our main objective.  The conference is on renewable and sustainable energy, etc., and all of the MEPs and actors in Ireland will attend.  I hope that an invitation will be issued to members from all of the Oireachtas committees, particularly this committee.  I want everyone interested in the matter to attend as all of the energy sectors will be discussed.  Can the Chairman confirm when the invitation will be circulated?  I think his committee has received an invitation.  The conference will be a great way to inform everyone.  People cannot understand why fuel is so expensive when we have so much wind available.  Ireland has the best wind production in Europe so we should examine the option.</p><p>  The clerk of the committee, Mr. Eugene &Oacute; Cruadhlaoich, did an outstanding job in compiling the many submissions.  Some of the submissions are similar.  Can the committee provide a graph on commonalities?  The committee would benefit from a compilation of common purpose contained in the submissions.</p><p>  Dr. Rory O'Donnell, NESC, stated its recommendation is different from the national expert advisory group's recommendation on heads 6 and 7.  NESC recommended that we get external advisory groups to deliberate as was done for the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer.  Clearly it is up to the committee to recommend which group is used, the national expert advisory body or the new institution and oversight board recommended by NESC.  </p></speech>

I call Deputy Michelle Mulherin and Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1070" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013052100013#M01100"><p>I join in the welcome to the delegation.  I watched much of this meeting on my monitor, as I could not attend.  To put this in context, we are constantly referring to experts to determine solutions.  We can see climate change, but the cause is not uniformly agreed.  I had the opportunity to attend a conference and participate in an element on peak oil.  It was an interesting debate, as even people from oil producing nations, including the US, were present.  We discuss renewable energy and the development of those resources in Ireland.  According to every graph that was presented, and regardless of how one looked at it, sourcing energy from renewable resources around the world was virtually a pinhead.  Even if some of the science might be lost on lay people, the global dependence on fossil fuels is tremendous.  It can also provide context.  One does not need to be a scientist to appreciate the consequences of the situation.</p><p>  When discussing targets and this Bill, we should have regard to the experience of businesses and individuals on the ground.  As Deputy Murphy stated, a dialogue is required, as a paradigm shift is necessary in terms of how we relate to the environment.  We are becoming more aware of the fact that we live in an environment and that if it is impaired in some way on the other side of the planet it will catch up with us as well.  This is the case in the global village.</p><p>  We are bound to targets.  I would never take from that position.  We have an abusive relationship with what we extract from the ground and how we use finite resources.  We must be more cyclical, as our needs will continue after those resources are gone.</p><p>  Fuel poverty presents a significant problem.  The refitting and upgrading of homes are under discussion.  For example, oil-fired central heating systems have been installed and back boilers have been removed in some local authority housing in recent years.  As I am sure members have encountered, the reason for the lack of carbon emissions is because people cannot afford to put oil in their tanks.  A carbon tax is applied to coal people buy for their fireplaces.  What will happen to these people?  They should not go without.  We would like people to be able to enjoy a basic standard.  This is how we live.  We must temper any measure introduced with the reality.  While it is all very well to introduce carbon taxes, how will hard-pressed people afford them?  I am not just referring to people in local authority or social housing but to other people who cannot afford to put oil in their tanks or to install new heating systems and are not in the vicinity of a gas supply or a fuel source with fewer emissions.  These are real problems.</p><p>  Transport presents a major problem.  The forecourt is all about oil.  Until it provides other types of fuel that have fewer carbon emissions &ndash; I am not just referring to batteries &ndash; we will not hit any target.  This applies across the board.</p><p>  We must show leadership in the development of renewable energy.  Wind is the most advanced of the industries.  Much of the misinformation that is presented as fact needs to be debunked.  It is not just for politicians or experts to claim they know best.  There must be a real and significant dialogue with people.  We must discuss the possible economic benefits as well as the environment so that people can be given a vision of how life may look and can buy into the idea of, for example, the necessity of transmission lines.  It is all very well to point to our considerable wind and wave energy resources, but people, and politicians in particular, are jumping on the band wagon at meetings.  I accept that people have fears, but these can be allayed, discussed and put in context.  However, when all that a politician does is put oil on the fire of fear, it shows poor leadership.</p> <p>One is not abandoning people in saying they want to be able to flick a switch and have cheaper power but that in the long run they should opt for renewables.  There must be a responsible conversation.</p><p> With regard to wind turbines, it is not easy dealing with people when they have been whipped up into a fury of protest.  I will provide the example of several councillors who went to see a wind farm.  They got out of a bus and could see a wind turbine a good distance away in the field.  They turned around to the man who was facilitating the trip and asked whether it was noisy.  The man asked them to turn around and showed them a wind turbine right behind them.  Turbines do not turn if there is no wind; therefore, we cannot hear them.  When the wind is blowing, we do not hear things so well.  I am not saying people are not affected by them, but farmers are also affected when roads pass through the middle of their farms.  People were affected when powerlines were routed through farms.  The dialogue is on the issue of whether the people who bear the burden of the infrastructure, whether it be transmission cables or turbines, can be accommodated or rewarded.  That dialogue does not just involve those who receive compensation for having something on their lands.  It also involves the communities that bear the burden of the infrastructure to be used in renewable energy projects.  They must be looked after properly.</p><p> Notwithstanding what has been said about the mistrust of politicians, people do listen and politicians have a platform.  They must be informed and listen to people, not just hold up their hands and say they are with the people on this issue and that the big bad guys are out there.  Politicians should not sell a lie about what it will take to achieve economic recovery and future growth.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion on the requirement for the Bill and its contents, but what we really need is action.  We have been talking about this issue for decades and can see the reality around us.  Nationally and globally, the impact of climate change is very evident.  I live near the banks of the River Shannon and there are areas where flooding previously occurred only in the winter but now occurs in the summer and the winter.  There are knock-on negative impacts on the environment, the economy and nature, with the demise of certain plants and creatures.  I am thinking, in particular, of the corncrake.  The officials will go back and expand on the heads of the Bill.  Urgency and a great deal of clarity are required in order that people can see their responsibilities and how we will achieve the targets set.  I wonder whether we are being ambitious enough.  Is 2050 too far into the future?  Should we pull back a little from that date?</p><p>  The delegates referred to the responsibility of all of us to think not only of ourselves but also of other parts of the world impacted on by climate change.  A presentation by Christian Justice Ireland reveals what African countries are experiencing.  It is fantastic to hear about companies that are not waiting, that are taking the initiative in the knowledge that they must make changes by 2020.  This is welcome and the example should be held out to other companies.  These are creative individuals who can see benefits for their businesses, as well as benefits for the economy and the environment.</p><p>  There are enormous challenges.  I live in a county where I have been heavily lobbied by environmental groups about renewable energy projects and their benefits.  Now, I am challenged by the fact that the same groups are returning and concerned about the wind turbines to which others referred.  We have a major job of work to do in education.  In this regard, I see an important cross-departmental role.  On the one hand, we are reading papers on the potential of oil and gas exploration and fracking and, on the other, looking at wave and wind power and renewables.  We are trying to get our head around the issue while trying to reduce the use of fossil fuels.  It is an enormous challenge and we all need to lead by example in Government Buildings, Departments and the offices of Members of the Oireachtas.  We should all take responsibility for reducing our carbon footprint in businesses and our homes.  It has struck me that there are 166 Members of the D&aacute;il, each with a constituency office.  We can make a difference by learning how to factor it in in our everyday thinking.</p><p>  With regard to education, we must go into primary schools.  Young people educate other generations and I would like to see this aspect being built into the Bill.  This is the first engagement and there will be plenty more.  I thank the delegates for listening and look forward to the rest of the debate and the production of the Bill.  Perhaps we might be given a timeframe for its production.</p></speech>

Deputy James Bannon referred to the expert advisory body envisaged in the legislation.  It is not intended to be a representative body, with various sectors having nominating rights.  Head 6(12) refers to a number of people from State agencies such as the EPA, the SEAI, the ESRI and Teagasc, being identified as members.  The others have relevant qualifications, expertise and experience.  It is a question of trying to populate the body with people who know the sectors involved and the challenges from a climate change point of view rather than asking directly for representatives of the various sectors.</p><p>  With regard to transport and energy, the big picture issues committee members have mentioned concern the road network, public transport, wind energy and renewables, community engagement and a buy-in to the development of wind turbines.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane mentioned the extent to which Ireland was well located geographically, particularly for the production of wind energy.  We are in a good location, but environmental issues and community acceptance are associated with it and we must chart our way through major societal shifts, supported by science, evidence and strong communication with the public and key stakeholders.  Rather than talking at people, we can talk to them in a language they understand in order that they will see the role they can play.</p><p>  Deputy James Bannon referred to the global treaty on emissions reductions.  This is a global challenge in that the issues involved will only be solved at a global level.  The intention under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, is to reach a global treaty by the end of 2015 that will kick in in 2020, after the second Kyoto Protocol period has expired.  It must be a treaty that will involve all countries making commitments in line with their capabilities.  The first Kyoto Protocol period has just come to an end and some countries, including EU member states, have agreed to have a second period under the protocol to 2020.  The Kyoto Protocol was built on architecture that split the developed and the developing worlds.  It was a creature of its time.</p></speech>

It is a transition towards 2050.  We are talking about a fairly significant societal and economic transformation and it will not be achieved overnight but for a transition, we need to know where we are going, how we are going to get there and what is the most effective pathway.  That is why the sectoral roadmaps Departments have been asked to prepare are so important in charting out that pathway in the individual sectors.</p><p>  Another contributor questioned whether we were being ambitious enough in regard to 2050.  As I said, 2050 may seem like a long time away - it is nearly 40 years away - but decisions taken over the next five to ten years will be crucially important in effecting change that will have long-term consequences.  I think 2050 is a well-recognised and well-established time framework within which to operate but with milestones along the way, including targets for 2020.  Further targets will be set.</p><p>  Deputy Mulherin mentioned the carbon tax, which certainly has an impact on price.  Stepping back from it again and looking at the bigger picture, when one looks at the overall price of oil and gas and the extent to which we are import-dependent for oil and gas - I should qualify this by saying the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources leads on energy matters, so I am not claiming to be an expert on it - that is the significant driver of what individual consumers and businesses pay.  There is an issue around how we substitute for that import reliability, greater reliance on our own renewable resources and address some of the difficult issues with which the Deputy and other politicians are faced.  How can we address them in a sensible evidence-supported way rather than in a way where scare stories and other issues get communicated as if they are gospel when that may not be the case?</p><p>  Dr. Rory O'Donnell and colleagues from NESC might what to say something on the education dimension and the engagement with behavioural change but before I hand over to them, I would like to say that we put in place a fairly extensive education campaign in primary schools in regard to climate change over the past number of years.  We worked very closely with teachers through the teaching centre in Blackrock and developed some very good resource materials, which are in schools and which are designed to ensure that in ten to 15 years' time, the people who have grown up out of the school system will have had an education in and a knowledge of climate change built into their consciousness from an early stage.</p></speech>

I am happy to provide a couple of pages describing our understanding of the differences, slight though they are, between the institutional ideas.  I suppose at the heart of it is - none of us would claim to have this sorted - what institutional design best links the how much and the how to in a positive dynamic.</p><p>  Other members raised some very important questions.  Whatever way one looks at it, wind energy has to be a key pillar of any future for Ireland as a low carbon or a carbon neutral country but at the same time, Deputies Bannon, Mulherin and Corcoran Kennedy have raised really knotty issues.  There is no question but that public acceptance could be one of the constraints which sets limits on Ireland's achievement of what is scientifically or naturally possible.  We take that very seriously.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Dr. Jeanne Moore, to say a little bit about some further work we are doing because we think that is very significant.  It is a version of the point Senator Keane raised in that in the area of climate change, we do not yet have something of the clarity of reduce, reuse and recycle which we have in waste and which captured everybody.  Not only did it capture everybody, it is really meaningful and it is a properly worked out concept.  We do not yet have the equivalent in the area of climate change.  My colleague, Dr. Jeanne Moore, might be better placed than myself to say something on both of those topics.  </p></speech>

In regard to the latter, we believe that could be a significant issue for the future transition to a carbon neutral society.  We have a background paper on some of the social and behavioural aspects of climate change and in that, we examine some of the current thinking.  An important point, which Deputy Mulherin mentioned, is that the process and type of engagement with communities is key to increasing social acceptance.</p><p>  To further develop this work, NESC has started a project which will look at the processes to design and deliver energy transformation in Ireland.  As part of that, we will look comparatively at Denmark, Scotland and Germany to see what types of governance were in place, what types of social acceptance issues they had to cope with, and what types of community ownership models and community engagement models we can draw from and develop some insights for Ireland.  We will develop that work this year.</p><p>  On the broader point in regard to a cultural change, the key point for us is that raising awareness is an important part of societal engagement but while that is important, it does not ensure behavioural change.  Behavioural change is changing the way we do things and that is quite a complex thing to achieve, but we know how to do it.  We have changed the way people recycle and the way people reuse plastic bags when they shop but changing the way we do things requires particular pro-environmental practices to become routine.  We develop new habits and practices so that they become everyday in society and it becomes a societal project.</p><p>  Education is something members have been thinking about a lot.</p></speech>

That agreement was that a new global treaty would be agreed by the end of 2015, to kick in from 2020.  It was agreed that all countries would subscribe to that new global treaty.  The end of 2015 is two and a half years away.  There will be three annual climate change conferences each December until then.  The next conference will be in Warsaw.  The last one, at which the agreement is supposed to be reached, will be in Paris, so there will be a strong European interest in that process.  We have all heard the recent statements from President Obama and from Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, which recognise the importance of global action on climate change.  It was interesting, in the response to Hurricane Sandy, the extent to which there was a very immediate link made, in the political system in the United States, between what was a very unique and different weather event and climate change issues.</p><p>  There are encouraging signs there but it is a long two-and-a-half-year road that has to be travelled from now to Paris at the end of 2015.  Interestingly, at the last UN Climate Change Conference in Doha in December 2012, the UN Secretary General indicated that in order to provide further impetus towards reaching that agreement at the end of 2015, he would be convening a special session at the UN in the autumn of next year for heads of state and government, in order to get buy-in and leadership at the highest political level among all UN member states.  There is a way to go but, equally, there is a lot going on.  Ultimately, the signs are encouraging but if we come back here in December 2015, I may be eating my words, or otherwise.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Councillor Neale Richmond and Ms Billie Sparks.  The delegation will address the committee on two issues: EM Ireland's submission to the committee on the future of the EU and Ireland's relationship with it and the accountability report, in respect of which the delegates will provide some details of the statistics.</p><p>  As members know, EM Ireland is an independent, not-for-profit organisation that works to develop the connection between Ireland and the EU.  Its yearly accountability report measures a number of key indicators that track Ireland's engagement with the EU at a number of levels and, where relevant, outlines where potential improvements can be made.  The report has been described as a scorecard of key issues in Ireland's engagement with the EU.  I note Deputy Kyne flicking through the report.  Members will note that it has a specific section on this committee's attendance and meetings.  It also has a section on last year's fiscal compact treaty.  Undoubtedly, members will wish to comment on those sections.</p><p>  Before beginning, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, make charges against or criticise a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her easily identifiable.

I intend to focus my initial remarks on our submission to the committee as part of the national debate on Ireland and the future of the EU, focusing particularly on the democratic legitimacy of the Union and what EM Ireland is doing in working towards increasing same, as well as the EU's transparency and accountability, before my colleague, Councillor Neale Richmond, discusses the latest findings of EM Ireland's 2012 accountability report, which was published on 7 May 2013.</p><p>  EM Ireland commends the joint committee on launching this national debate on the future of the EU and Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with it.  We were pleased to have had the opportunity to make a submission to the committee as part of that national debate and to present the findings of our submission today.  This crucial conversation is taking place against the background of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU, the 40th anniversary of Ireland's accession to the then European Economic Community and 2013 being designated as the European year of citizens.</p><p>  This is a crucial time in Ireland's relationship with the EU.  That relationship has undergone a dramatic change in recent years.  Since 2009 and as a result of the financial crisis, there has been an increasing amount of negativity and euroscepticism among the Irish people.  In EM Ireland, we are acutely aware of the challenges that this surge of negativity and anti-EU sentiment can generate, particularly in light of ongoing developments in the Irish-EU relationship.  We are working hard to ensure people continue to connect and engage with the EU through a variety of measures that help to foster reasoned, robust and measured debate on all matters European in Ireland.</p><p>  In our submission to the committee, EM Ireland is seeking to ensure an independent, not-for-profit, civil society voice is heard in this debate, relating as it does to the future direction and form of Ireland's ongoing relationship with its European partners.  Founded in 1954, EM Ireland is the oldest civil society membership-based organisation dealing with Irish&ndash;EU relations.  EM Ireland can and will continue to play a significant role in providing an independent, factual, non-governmental voice of reason on Europe that no other organisation can.</p><p>  In compiling this submission, we asked our members and advisory council to submit their thoughts on Ireland and the future of the EU as part of the national debate.  The responses received reflected the changing relationship between Ireland and the EU and dealt with many diverse issues.  It was felt that EM Ireland was best placed to deal with the modules in the call for submissions that dealt with democratic legitimacy and accountability, the matters on which we will focus today.</p><p>  With 2013 being designated the European year of citizens and Ireland hosting the Presidency during the first half of the year, there is an opportunity to engage Irish people in European matters and, consequently, to work towards increasing the democratic legitimacy of the Union.  EM Ireland is fully aware of this unique opportunity and we are working on delivering programmes and projects that reflect the current challenges facing Ireland and the wider EU while strengthening Irish citizens' engagement with the Union.</p><p>  This year, EM Ireland is particularly focused on seeking to develop a transparent connection between the ordinary people of Ireland and both the Presidency and the European year of citizens 2013.  In addition to our regular programmes and campaigns, such as the accountability campaign, which Mr. Richmond will discuss in further detail, and our work in the third level sector, we have increased significantly our communications and information dissemination campaigns and programmes.</p><p>  On the education front, we continue to pursue our grad jobs campaign, which is aimed at increasing awareness among Irish graduates of the opportunities that exist for them in the broader EU system.  A significant part of this work involves presentations to careers services, colleges, classes and societies throughout the institutes of technology and universities.  In addition, we are pleased to have been appointed to the national implementation body for the roll-out and delivery of the Blue Star programme in partnership with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State for European affairs in the delivery of the programme's second year in primary schools throughout Ireland.  The idea of the programme is simple: foster better understanding and knowledge of the EU and how it affects the lives of Irish citizens among primary pupils through classroom projects and activities.  The Blue Star programme aims to introduce participants, pupils, teachers, parents and the wider community to the EU, what it means and how it works.  The programme also aims to foster a strong sense of awareness of the EU among its participants that reaches far beyond the school walls and into the wider community.</p><p>  This year has been declared the European year of citizens, which EM Ireland was delighted to launch in Dublin City Hall in January.  The year was officially launched by the President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  This launch was followed by an afternoon session featuring an interactive and participatory citizens dialogue at which the Vice President of the European Commission, Ms Viviane Reding, and the Minister of State for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, engaged in a frank and open exchange of opinions with more than 200 citizen guests on the current economic crisis, the rights of European citizens and the future of the EU.</p><p>  Throughout 2013, EM Ireland will continue to roll out these dialogues by hosting a series of regional town hall meetings and local seminars on the theme of the European year of citizens.  Given that the significant majority of the official Presidency events will be taking place in Dublin, our series of regional town hall meetings are about reclaiming the debate.  Their aim is to ensure people have an opportunity to make their voices heard and to engage with those representing them on the European stage, thus further increasing the fundamental premise of democratic legitimacy, transparency and accountability.</p><p>  These dialogues are an opportunity for citizens in Ireland to participate in the important debate regarding the future shape of the EU, which underpins the purpose of this submission.  We have hosted two of these regional dialogues.  The first was in Cork, where EM Ireland hosted a regional dialogue with the T&aacute;naiste in City Hall.  We also hosted one in Galway with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, in April.   These regional dialogues are the commencement of a national discussion on the Irish&ndash;EU relationship by the citizens during this 12-month timeframe, and we look forward to rolling out a further four dialogues during 2013.</p><p>  Each attendee at these dialogues is asked to complete a questionnaire in order to share his or her opinions on the EU.  We look forward to publishing a report on our findings at the conclusion of the dialogues and to progressing the outcomes of this debate.  The dialogues are being supplemented by a range of small-scale talks on the EU and the Irish Presidency provided by EM Ireland staff to the public through a network of public libraries and Europe Direct information centres.</p><p>  One of the lessons learned from our two Lisbon referendums was the relative lack of knowledge about the EU among young people.  One way in which we are seeking to address this is with our youth media and the Irish Presidency programme.  As part of this programme, EM Ireland has recruited a team of 25 young citizen journalists from around the country to cover and report on the Irish Presidency from January to June 2013.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neale Richmond" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052100004#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for asking us to attend again.  My role here is to take members through our 2012 accountability report, which is found in the yellow book they have in front of them.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, we produced the third annual edition of the accountability report.  Throughout 2012, European Movement Ireland measured a number of key indicators tracking Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU at a variety of levels.  Our 2012 accountability report is based on a monthly analysis of 31 key indicators and builds on the work of the previous editions, extending and refining the systems used to identify, track and store the relevant data.  Data integrity was of central importance in the compilation of this report, and much time was dedicated to ensuring that tracking the information took place using only mathematical systems, thereby decreasing any opportunity for subjectivity.  The report&rsquo;s findings are based on statistical information that is both quantifiable and available as a matter of public record.   The accountability report is an organic document, and we go to great lengths to engage with elected representatives, officials and members of the public to deepen the report as much as possible.</p><p>  Essentially, we focused on six principal areas: European Council and Councils of the EU; European Parliament engagement; pre-legislative input to the European Commission; Oireachtas engagement; other European institutions; and the fiscal stability treaty referendum campaign.<b></b>I will begin with the European Council and Councils of the EU.  Average Irish ministerial attendance at meetings of the Councils of the European Union in 2012 stood at 97%, with either a lead Minister or a Minister of State attending 72 out of a total of 74 Council meetings.  This is an increase of 11% from the data recorded under the 31st D&aacute;il in 2011, and leaves Ireland in second position, behind Sweden and Poland which are joint first at 99%.  Eight out of ten EU Councils in 2012 had an Irish ministerial attendance rate of 100%.  Only two Councils, the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, ECOFIN, have less than perfect attendance rates, at 92% each.<br /><b></b>I move to European Parliament engagement.  Average Irish MEP attendance at plenary sessions of the European Parliament stands at 83% for 2012.  This is a decrease of 2% from statistics recorded in the accountability report for 2011.  Irish MEPs raised 455 parliamentary questions in 2012 - a 50% drop from the 683 questions raised in 2011, and a further drop from just under 1,000 questions raised in 2010.  During 2012, Irish MEPs made a total of 365 speeches, a decrease of 33% compared with the 2011 figure of 727 speeches.  Average Irish MEP attendance at parliamentary committee meetings stands at 76% for 2012.  Irish MEPs also acted as substitute members at 24% of committee meetings in 2012.  During 2012, Irish MEPs spoke 249 times during committee. This is a new indicator and therefore there are no comparisons available for 2011. There is Irish representation on 14 of the 20 standing committees and on one special committee, which began its work in March 2012.  Each of the Irish MEPs is a member or a substitute member of at least two committees.  The Agriculture and Rural Development Committee has the highest level of representation from an Irish MEP perspective.  In 2012, two reports were drawn up by an Irish rapporteur and four opinions were drafted up by an Irish rapporteur.  It is important to note that in addition to sitting on parliamentary committees and delegations, most Irish MEPs are also members of a range of inter-group dealing with specialised interest areas such as disability, media or trade unions.  Our report merely touches upon the workload of an MEP but we used the most scientific barometers at our disposal.<br /><b></b>In terms of Oireachtas engagement, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs met a total of 36 times in 2012.  The attendance rate for members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs during 2012 was 64%, a decrease of 7% from the overall attendance rate recorded under the 31st D&aacute;il in 2011.  Of the 74 Council meetings that took place during 2012, 25, or 34%, had pre-Council briefings in front of the relevant Oireachtas committee.  Of the 11 General Affairs Council meetings that took place during 2012, seven had pre-Council briefings before the Committee on European Union Affairs.  Based on this analysis, 64%, or seven out of 11 General Affairs Council meetings were preceded by a pre-Council briefing to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on  European Union Affairs.  This represents an increase on the previous calendar year&rsquo;s rate of 27%.<br /><b></b>I refer to the European Commission and pre-legislative input.  Individual, business and civil society input into the pre-legislative stage of EU policy formation increased by 0.5% in 2012 when compared with the 2011 figures.  Of the 51 European Commission consultations reviewed for this year&rsquo;s accountability report, the percentage of total submissions that originated in Ireland in 2012 ranged from 0% to 4.75%, with an average of 1.4 %.</p><p>  This year, to broaden the spectrum of the report, we decided to also look at Irish engagement with other European institutions.  We detailed the role and workings of the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  We also looked at the following statistical indicators.  The Irish attendance rate at plenary sessions of the Committee of the Regions in 2012 was 94%, which compares with the overall attendance rate of 79%.  In 2012, there were 30 Commission meetings of the Committee of the Regions.  Each Irish member is a member of two Commissions, although in some cases an alternative will attend meetings if he or she has a particular expertise.  The Irish attendance rate for Commissions was 97%, which compares favourably with the overall attendance rate of 82%.</p><p>  The Irish delegation had an 80% rate of attendance at plenary sessions of the EESC in 2012.  Irish attendance at 2012 plenary sessions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stood at 60%.  Attendance at plenary sessions of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe by Irish Members in 2012 stood at 75%.  Irish attendance at the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE during Ireland&rsquo;s presidency of the organisation in 2012 was 72%.</p><p>  One of the principal aims of EM Ireland is to facilitate debate and provide information on the Irish-EU relationship.  Our report does this by analysing the level of transparency and accountability at both national and European level so that Irish citizens can see how we are being represented by our elected officials.  This report is an organic document.  We have added a number of indicators this year and hope to develop the report even further ahead of next year.  However, we are limited to using only indicators that are on the record which can be easily accessed by members of the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052100005#D00100"><p>I thank Mr. Neale Richmond and Ms Billie Sparks for their presentation today.  I will begin by addressing some comments to Ms Sparks.  It is great that she has appeared before the joint committee to talk about the future of Europe.  All members respect the work of European Movement Ireland, EM Ireland, and its attempts to try to educate and inform people as to what is going on in Europe and where Europe is going.  I compliment it on this work, particularly in respect of its regional discussions, because it is important to get out there and remind oneself it is not simply about holding meetings within the capital and that it is necessary to go out and talk to people in the regions and get their views on Europe and how they would like it to develop.  I congratulate EM Ireland on that initiative and look forward to joining it at some of the locations throughout the country.</p><p>  This is EM Ireland's third year of producing the accountability report and it is very much a step forward.  It sets benchmarks for the various institutional attendance rates and performance.  In the spirit of trying to make next year's report even better, I have a couple of suggestions on which the witnesses might comment or else they might take them away.  The first pertains to attendance, and I will comment specifically about this joint committee's attendance rates.  Mr. Richmond noted the attendance rate at this joint committee was approximately 64%, and I have a couple of things to say in this regard.  First, it might be useful to note in the report that other committees meet at the same time as this joint committee.  For instance, as one can see on the room's monitors, an important meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children is under way, as are meetings of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  As many members of this joint committee will be leading the questions in the aforementioned committees, it would give a clearer picture were one to note members are on business elsewhere.  Moreover, members might be on business outside the Houses at the same time.  Consequently, I would not like the message to emerge from this meeting that one third of members are simply sitting this one out.</p><p>  I also suggest EM Ireland might give consideration to the issue of serial offenders.  Were it to delve through the actual attendance records, it would see that some people may need to be encouraged to attend these meetings more frequently.  I do not mean anyone who is present.  I am sick of the sight of Deputy Bernard Durkan and the other members in attendance today, who are present at every meeting.  However, one or two people could be encouraged to improve their attendance.  I will leave those suggestions with the witnesses.</p><p>  The second point relates to chapter 6 of the report, from page 87 onwards, on the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty.  As I note Mr. Richmond's comments on wishing to eliminate subjectivity, I will read out a couple of sentences that sprang out from that particular section and I hope he will see where I am going with this.  On page 88, the report states there were "commanding D&aacute;il performances from a number of [Sinn F&eacute;in's] more prominent TDs".  On the next page, it is stated that "Deputies Shane Ross and Finian McGrath belatedly came out against the Treaty".  A few pages on, the Taoiseach's decision not to take part in a formal debate is commented on and the report states "that decision may have impacted on the Taoiseach's personal popularity".  Further on it is stated "the contribution of Fianna F&aacute;il to the campaign cannot be underestimated".  I have no particular argument with any of these points other than that each is highly subjective and they are not based on fact.  Incidentally, EM Ireland's analysis of the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty is very good but it would be better if the report did not contain so much subjectivity.  This is not to agree or disagree with any of the particular statements, other than by stating I do not believe it is the place for such subjectivity, particularly bearing in mind how detailed a debate was held in this particular forum on the referendum and the strength of feelings it raised.</p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I believe it is a fantastic document, which can be very useful and I look forward to next year's edition being even better than this year's report.</p></speech>

The poll is very well presented and is one of the most readable and legible contributions I have seen thus far.  It reveals the level of support there is for Europe, in that 85% of Irish people believe Ireland should remain as part of the European Union, which is very good.  While it would not be our wish to have the United Kingdom leave, were it to so do, the general consensus is that Ireland would stay.  While the accountability report is extremely well put together, I refer to the list of members of this joint committee on page 61.  I am sure Deputy Joe O'Reilly would not wish to be deemed to be a member of Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

In any event, I agree with the Chairman regarding the questionable nature of the documentation on attendance.  While I have no problem with including members' attendance, one should go into it further and state precisely who is attending.  I was interested to see the contribution regarding the Council of Europe, of which I am a member.  I am deputy leader of that group and I compliment EM Ireland on including the details.  This document is very useful for many people, including students of Europe.  For example, it includes an organisation with which I am not that familiar, namely, the European Economic and Social Committee, which has no Oireachtas Member on it, as it happens.  Similarly, it refers to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, which of course includes representation by a delegation from the Oireachtas, and that is very good.  As far as attendance is concerned, again the report is slightly misleading in respect of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  We actually have a full turnout for the main sitting days, which take place between Monday and Thursday.  Friday typically is a day on which there is very little activity and, from an economic point of view, we tend not to attend on that day unless there is a matter of specific interest to Ireland.</p><p>  As for these details, as the Chairman stated, one may as well name those who attend the meetings and publish the attendance records.  I have no problem with that and think it is only fair.  However, when one generalises and cites an attendance rate of 60%, it is not actually that accurate.  It is 100% from Monday to Thursday, but if one divides by five, one will end up with X percentage gone.  However, it is important this activity is included.</p><p>  On the question of prominent Deputies during the election campaign, if "vigorous" means doing nothing, it was a very vigorous campaign because I saw no action on the ground as far as the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim was concerned.  However, if that constitutes vigorous campaigning, it is wonderful to describe it as such.  Perhaps I did not notice it but I certainly did not see it in the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.  While I did not see much vigorous campaigning by anyone during that particular campaign, that is neither here nor there.  Nevertheless, the decision was correct.  It is very difficult when one makes generalisations like that.</p><p>  I will conclude by noting that one thing that will affect support for Europe is the reduction in the number of MEPs.  Ireland supported the admission of Croatia and, in consequence, more than likely will end up with one fewer MEP, down from 12 to 11.  Were Turkey to join the European Union, Ireland would end up thereafter with possibly as few as six MEPs.  I understand the maximum number of MEPs is set at 765 and, consequently, the greater the number of member states that join, the smaller Ireland's membership of the European Parliament will be.  There is a possibility that Ireland, with a population of 4.5 million, will be reduced to the same level of representation as member states such as Malta or Luxembourg, that is, with six seats.  This is an important issue and I believe having fewer representatives in Europe will affect the actual voting record in the future.  In this context, I note the Connacht-Ulster constituency has 79% recognition of Europe.</p><p>  Other than that, I believe the production of this report is a very good exercise as far as Ireland is concerned.  It is good that a non-political organisation should put together a document like this.  It is a document I presume will be made available in libraries throughout the country because people can use it to conduct research about Europe.  I say well done and I have no criticism of the entire report but have mentioned something the witnesses may wish to bear in mind in future reports.</p></speech>

I must confess that I read the report and found it most interesting, hence my question about Joe O'Reilly of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Joseph O'Reilly of Fine Gael.  They might be two politicians or they might not, but before the report goes to the Library, I request that the matter would be checked.</p><p>  I do not wish the witnesses to answer the question if it embarrasses them but it is fascinating that two citizens are present in a voluntary capacity and that they have a programme of visiting schools and educating children, that they have the facility to produce such a report and that they are a non-political, not-for-profit organisation.  I did not realise they have a spy in the camp every day the Joint Committee on European Affairs sits.  They are more than welcome.  I am pleased to learn that at least one person in the audience represents European Movement Ireland.</p><p>  The witnesses will have noticed how sensitive the Chairman was about the slap on the wrist they gave on the relative drop &ndash; 11% - in committee attendance to 67%.  It is worth pointing out &ndash; the point might have been made already &ndash; that I can guarantee that as I clocked in today, my attendance record in the Houses of the Oireachtas is 94%.  That does not mean the national media, RTE and the leaders of all political parties recognise me as a great parliamentarian who is better than everyone else.  In a sense, what I say is that attendance is one thing and what goes on after the clocking in is more important.  It is not necessary for the witnesses to list each individual&rsquo;s attendance.</p><p>  I wish to focus on three key areas in the report.  The witnesses brought to our attention the fact that when directorates general, DGs, issue consultative documents, they seems to be at sixes and sevens about how they release the discussion documents, analyse the feedback and how matters are ultimately presented.  That is noteworthy.  The process definitely appears to require improvement.</p><p>  Perhaps it is not a fair question to ask but the witnesses can answer it if they wish.  I would welcome their views on the committee&rsquo;s oversight role on the scrutiny of European affairs.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade which has a similar role.  We had a discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, about the ability of elected public representatives to devote the necessary time to analysis and scrutiny in terms of our oversight responsibilities.</p><p>  I occasionally visit schools to explain what a Deputy is and I find it difficult to get the children to realise that a Deputy is not the same as a councillor.  I hesitate to say it in public but I am surprised that many of the teaching profession who are charged with educating children on the political context and structures of Irish politics are themselves confused about the roles of parliamentarians and councillors.</p><p>  In explaining European issues to children, the witnesses include reference to the "PAC".  I did not realise that in this context it is the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  Reference was also made to the OSCE but, more specifically, it is to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.  I did not realise there were so many parliamentary assemblies and I do not think the public does either.  I wish to ask a political question and I understand that the witnesses might not be at liberty to comment.  The public surely does not know about the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Are there too many such fora?  Is there duplication?  For example, the OSCE is based in two, if not three, countries.  One part is in Vienna, another part is in Copenhagen, while the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, wing is in Warsaw.  It strikes me that children might find it difficult to get their heads around all of those assemblies, the European assemblies and committees.  I would appreciate it if an opinion were forthcoming.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the comment on the fact that other committee meetings clash.  We will endeavour to include the information in next year&rsquo;s publication.  This is an organic document.  We are not scared of criticism and we welcome constructive criticism in particular.  Our chapter on the European Parliament in this year&rsquo;s report is a lot more detailed than last year because of the feedback received.</p><p>  The point about serial offenders is appreciated but to ensure the scientific merit of the report, we strictly do not individualise.  We just want the data for the collective and we do not intend to deviate from that position.  When we released the report two weeks ago, the first queries we received from the press related to individual rates but we do not feel we are in a position to rate individuals.  We would prefer to rate the collective.</p></speech>

The fiscal stability treaty chapter was taken from a wider report of 25 pages to 30 pages that we published within a week of the referendum result last year.  As outlined in the report, it is not our opinion.  It is based on the public opinion that was displayed either in the press or on public websites.  It is a review of the campaign based on public sources.  We appreciate that it is probably a bit too subjective.  Much of the content was not our words.  We just collated the information available.  Most of it was taken together.  We do a morning media watch service whereby we go through all media service to see who is talking about Europe, and then we collect the information and send it out to our members and anyone who wants to subscribe.  That is essentially what we felt was coming across as the themes of the campaign as reported in the media.  Some of the lines were direct quotes.  We had quotations in the wider report but in the condensed version we just collected the information into the ten pages available.</p><p>  In response to Senator Leyden, it is every editor&rsquo;s nightmare to see one has made an error but the Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of Fianna F&aacute;il is indeed Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of Fine Gael from Cavan-Monaghan.  I apologise heartily to him.  He is referred to as &ldquo;Joseph O&rsquo;Reilly&rdquo; in the official Council of Europe documentation so that is why I reported him as &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;.</p><p>  There were no Oireachtas Members on the European Economic and Social Committee, EESC, because it is a non-parliamentary body.  It is composed of people from various interest groups in the sector.  I am most interested in the point made about the Council of Europe and down days.  It is not fair to report on attendance in that regard.  That is a point that was made to us by many MEPs, especially in regard to their attendance in Strasbourg.  The Thursday is very much a travel day and the fact that there are no direct flights from Dublin to Strasbourg means that, as with the Council of Europe, one has to go to Baden-Baden, Frankfurt or Paris.  We appreciate that and we will definitely put that caveat into next year&rsquo;s report.</p></speech>

We are keen to point out that in all categories we rate that are comparable with other European nations, this country is very much in the top echelons for every area.</p><p>  We appreciate the points on the reduction in the number of MEPs.  We do not have a position on it because no decision has been made.  We know the issue is still with the European Parliament to decide on whether definitely to reduce the number of Irish MEPs.  We will review the situation when the decision is made and note the findings.</p><p>  The report is already available on our website.  It was sent to all Oireachtas Members, all Secretaries General of Departments and all libraries.  We do a lot of work with Europe Direct centres and libraries throughout the country.  We have already spoken to Europe Direct information centres in Mountmellick and Blanchardstown and we will be in Mallow and Dundalk over the summer.  We will go wherever we are invited to give our little spiel about Europe.</p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne raised a number of points.  I will hand one or two of them to Ms Sparks if that is all right because even though I presented the accountability report, it was very much a joint effort between not just the pair of us but the entire office.  As one might appreciate, no one person on his or her own could deal with the amount of data that had to be collected.  I will also refer to her the matter of the DG's consultation.</p></speech>

They were very interested and have taken that on board with a view to taking it further because they see it as a block and if it is easy to remedy they will consider it from a different perspective.</p><p>  We are aware of the scrutiny work and mainstreaming done by this committee.  We read the report by the committee for the purposes of our 2012 accountability report.  It covered only the first five months of 2012 so we have not included the data in our report because we did not feel it gave an overall picture.  We are aware of the work the committee is doing and the mainstreaming process is working well in terms of scrutiny from what we gathered from the report.</p><p>  Working in European affairs we constantly battle with the number of and confusion about the different European institutions.  For the purposes of what we do with the primary schools, the Blue Star programme focuses on four main areas: the history of the EU, its geography, the cultural and creative aspects of the Union and, for older classes, its institutions.  We do not get into the level of detail as outlined in the accountability report here.  The younger classes might learn the flags of the different European countries while we encourage the Blue Star schools to have a celebration on Europe day, where they bring in food from different countries.  It is informal learning about the EU.</p></speech>

Much of this is historical.  The Council of Europe existed long before what we know as the European Union, as did the OSCE.  Other institutions have emerged as the EU has developed and there was a need for a parliament that was directly elected by the people.  Then the Committee of the Regions came into being, as did the European Economic and Social Committee.  There are a lot but we stress in the report that some of these are legislative bodies while others are consultative.  The report is more than 100 pages in length compared to the 25 page report published in 2010 because we tried to explain this in detail and, while it is accessible to the public, it also has relevant academic standing.</p></speech>

MEPs took umbrage at some of the things in it but was there any explanation for the 15% drop in the number of speeches between 2011 and 2012 and the 33% drop in the number of parliamentary questions?  I know there was a comment on the costs of answering parliamentary questions because of all the translation needed.</p><p>  The polling data by Red C and the European Movement Ireland on attitudes towards Ireland in the EU is interesting, particularly that 89% of 18 to 24 year olds still believe Ireland should remain part of the EU.  The lowest figure for that was in the 35-44 age group, where 78% say Ireland should remain part of the EU.  That age group also has the highest number who believe we should leave the euro, and if Britain were to leave, Ireland should also leave, with 38% agreeing with that.  Is that data related to austerity or indebtedness, with people feeling they are being imposed on by Europe?  That cohort is the cohort that is most likely to be suffering.</p><p>  The Blue Star programme is confined to primary schools.  Is there engagement at second level, particularly with transition year students or those on the CSPE courses?  I attended some of those classes to speak and they address politics and similar issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013052100007#F00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and congratulate them for publishing this report.  It reminded me of what can happen when a book is published and the person reading it is worried he or she might be mentioned in it.  He or she looks at the index to see if his or her name is there and depending on the book, he or she is either disappointed or relieved one way or another.  Because we are the subject of this it is understandable we would all have an interest in the references made to this committee.  It is good to see this sort of detail and how the different mechanisms of the EU engage in their work.</p><p>  The focus on parliamentary questions, and the comparison made with the D&aacute;il, is extreme.  Members of the European Parliament may well use correspondence to elicit answers.  They are parliamentarians who represent far bigger constituencies than any of us so the level of engagement we have with individuals, and the number of questions we can generate as a result, will be always higher for us in the D&aacute;il.  I would caution reading too much into the use of parliamentary questions in the European Parliament.</p><p>  There was a reference to the fact that most of our MEPs are rapporteurs and draftsmen, which are extraordinarily important jobs in all parliaments but I would suggest that as an appendix to the next report, concrete examples be given of that work so the public and the media could look at the work and see its quality.  People might not readily understand what it means to be a draftsman or a rapporteur.</p><p>  The poll is very well presented.  The similarity between this poll and the last Eurobarometer opinion poll that was produced shows a very interesting dichotomy in opinions.  It showed that, even though the level of dissatisfaction with the EU has increased, the levels of dissatisfaction with the European institutions are still lower than for their national equivalents.  It is striking that when people were asked what level they thought the response to the crisis was at, the highest number said that the best response to our crisis is at European level rather than at national level.  It shows that even though there are growing levels of dissatisfaction, a lot of people still understand the best level of response to many of our difficulties is European rather than national.</p><p>  I finished a book lately called "The Widest Circle", a collection of essays dedicated to Michael Sweetman, who was a very prominent member of Fine Gael in the 1960s and 1970s.</p></speech>

I appreciate the comments made by members, especially those of Deputy Donohoe.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne noted that certain Members of the European Parliament took umbrage at our report.  We appreciate the comments of the MEPs in question.  As I noted, we went to great lengths to engage with them and their offices in advance of publication and they had sight of the report long before it was published.  A number of MEPs do not like the report or what we are doing and do not believe the report is accurate.  While we appreciate their comments, we have been contacted by many more people who believe the report has an important role to play.  I hope we will continue to perform this role. </p><p>  I stress again that the report has not been individualised because we do not want it to be personal.  As a scientific and academic exercise, it is preferable to examine MEPs as a collective.  The feedback we received from MEPs included explanations for the decline in the number of speeches made and parliamentary questions asked.  As Deputy Kyne stated, cost was a significant issue as the cost of receiving a reply from the European Commission can be up to &euro;1,600.  It is unfair to compare the D&aacute;il and European Parliament, as it takes up to six weeks to obtain a reply from the Commission.  In addition, MEPs represent much wider constituencies than members of national parliaments.  Many of them are selected from a national list and do not need to worry about the constituency concerns with which MEPs elected under the single transferable vote, PR-STV, electoral system must contend.  Asking a question is also less relevant when direct communication between parliamentarians and officials of the European Commission is encouraged and has become the norm.  There is no Government or Opposition in the European Parliament as the numbers have traditionally been such as to require a power-sharing arrangement.</p><p>  This year, in addition to statistics on speeches in plenary, we included statistics on speeches in committee session as the latter tend to carry much more weight.  Some MEPs stated it is easy to provide an explanation for a vote and have it registered as a speech or to submit a short speech of one minute to the President at the start of proceedings.  They do not believe such contributions are as important as some of the speeches made on legislation, either in the Oireachtas or at committee level in the European Parliament.  That is the feedback we received from MEPs on the issue.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the generational drop-off within the poll.  While we presented some analysis, we relied on RED C research and marketing for much of the analysis of the poll.  As a professional company that engages in weekly polling, members will be familiar with it.  RED C indicated that satisfaction levels among the generation aged between 35 and 45 years are consistent because this generation does not necessarily appreciate how much the European Union and European project has done for it.  Having been born long after the end of the Second World War, many people in this age group may have taken a cynical view of the decision to award the European Union the Nobel Peace Prize, notwithstanding that the EU was founded specifically in response to the Second World War and the impact it had on the European Continent.  The 35 to 45 years age group has also been squeezed most by the crisis in terms of the property crash and other financial measures.  That is not our opinion but a finding across all sentiment polling carried out by RED C.</p></speech>

We also run a series of talks in secondary schools entitled "The EU in 20 Minutes".  Under this project, we visit schools on request and make a presentation on the European Union, ideally in 20 minutes, after which we have a questions and answers session.  Prior to this academic year, we ran another second level programme entitled "My Vision for Europe".  This was an all-island initiative that focused primarily on transition year students in the South and 15 to 17 year olds in Northern Ireland.  The programme is not running this year, which is not to say it will not be renewed.  With the Presidency and so forth taking place this year, we did not have sufficient resources to run it this year.</p></speech>

In the past, these reasons were clear.  Initially, it was argued that European integration is a vastly better alternative to the wars that have destroyed our continent.  Subsequently, an argument was made that we should support European integration because of the economic benefits of the euro.  We are now in a position where both of these pitches are no longer clear-cut.  The argument about war is less relevant because of the generational change that has taken place, while the economic argument can no longer be made for clear reasons with which we are all familiar.  What are the best reasons one can present to the undecided in support of the view that Ireland's future lies in an integrated Europe?</p><p>  The backdrop to the European project will change radically if, as is possible, the United Kingdom holds a referendum on EU membership.  While this decision will depend on which party leads the next British Government, there is at least a 50-50 chance that Britain will hold a referendum.  The political cycle makes inevitable that a movement such as the Five Star Movement in Italy, Syriza in Greece or the True Finns party will enter government in a European country at some point.  Mr. Richmond and Ms Sparks are supportive of Europe but are not aligned to a political party and do not adhere to any particular philosophy about how integration should take place.  What, in their view, are the most convincing arguments for the European project?</p></speech>

Our funding primarily comes from our membership.  Individual members range from students to professionals and we also have corporate and institutional members.  We bid for a number of tenders to the European Commission, L&eacute;argas and the Government to run various programmes in schools and run our actions.  For example, we are the national implementation body of the Blue Star programme and receive an element of funding under the Department of the Taoiseach's block grant each year.  I stress, however, that this funding has declined greatly in recent years.  Those are the sources of most of the money used to support our actions.</p><p>  It could take a little longer to answer Deputy Donohoe's question but I will try to do so in 30 seconds.  European integration was very much a bottom-up initiative in which individual ministers from European countries, notably France and Germany, came together because they wished to avoid a recurrence of the devastation caused by the Second World War.  The European institutions developed as a result of this co-operation and the economic success of the early European Coal and Steel Community allowed the European project to develop and become attractive to peripheral states such as Ireland and independently wealthy states such as Denmark, Austria and Sweden which realised they would be better off in the European project.  Other states such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Norway realised they did not need to be part of the project.  </p><p>  The challenge is very much to the leaders of Europe to ensure the entity we know as the European Union does not become a top-down institution that lectures its almost 400 million citizens across Europe about why European integration is good.  Instead, it should deliberately show citizens why it is good.  It was easy in Ireland in the early 1990s to see the Structural Funds in action.  One only had to take a spin in the car on the M50 to see the road was largely funded by the European Union.  We no longer see this as evidence, which may be partly due to the way in which the media reports Europe. </p></speech>

I ask members to focus their remarks on the Bill on a head-by-head basis.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Caroline Simons, Mr. Tony O'Connor, Mr. Paul Brady and Dr. Simon Mills, who have given freely of their time to assist us.  Every expert who has appeared before us - they are witnesses, not experts - has given of his or her time freely to assist us.</p><p>  I remind members and witnesses of privilege, in that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  We have 50 minutes for opening statements, with four speakers.  I invite Dr. Mills to begin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Mills" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100002#A00600"><p>I thank the committee.  I compliment it on the extensive amount of work involved in the hearings of recent days as well as in the preceding hearings and the output of same, namely, the committee's report and the heads of the Bill that we are discussing today.  The Bill encapsulates the terms of the X case.  My broad overview of matters is that it does so adequately.  As the Government was entitled to do, the Bill leaves to one side broader considerations of Article 40.3.3&deg; for another day.</p><p>  The committee has my brief written submission.  Due to tight timelines and as with everyone who has contributed to the hearings, not everything that I originally thought about the Bill was contained in that submission.  As I have considered the Bill, a number of other matters have also come to mind.  I propose to use my opening submission to address a number of matters, aside from those set out in my written submission, that would be of relevance for the committee and, in due course, the Oireachtas to consider.  I will do so in the order of the heads of the Bill, precisely as one would do if making a written submission.</p><p>  The definitions of unborn and implantation as set out in the definitions section could be merged into one.  Implantation is defined as "implantation in the womb", but the word only appears once in the legislation, that being in the definition of unborn.  It seems logical that, if unborn is to be defined in the Bill, one could simply refer to implantation in the womb.</p><p>  The requirement to form a reasonable opinion is set out in heads 2 and 4 and defined in head 1.  As currently drafted, the reasonable opinion provision requires the doctors to have regard, in so far as is practicable, to the right to life of the unborn.  If this definition is to articulate fully and properly the tests laid down in the X case, the expression it gave to Article 40.3.3&deg; and the language of that Article, the reasonable opinion should also include, by way of balance, the obligation to have regard to the right to life of the mother.</p><p>  I will address heads 2 and 4 together.  Head 2 deals with a threat to the life of the mother arising other than by the threat of self-destruction.  Head 4 deals specifically with the question of suicide and suicidality.  Clearly, a decision has been taken to treat suicidality in a different and contingent fashion when compared with the threat of physical injury.  We must all be pragmatic about this - the reasons are, to some extent, political.  However, a number of issues should be considered in respect of heads 2 and 4 if head 4 is to survive and become part of the legislation.  I will refer to that matter in a moment.</p><p>  Heads 2 and 4 do not give sufficient detail to the test that is to be applied by doctors in assessing the threat to life.  An aspect of the X case judgment and the articulation it provided of Article 40.3.3&deg; is a requirement that the threat to life must be present as a matter of probability.  In so far as this formed part of the X case judgment, the requirement that the standard to be met on the part of doctors assessing the threat to the life of the mother should be expressly stated to be a matter of probability.</p><p>  Under heads 2 and 4, which require that there be an examination of the mother, it occurs to me that "examination" is the wrong word.  I touched on this issue in my written submission.  It may well be that there are assessments of the pregnant woman that do not require an examination of the woman herself, but an assessment of radiological images or blood tests.  It may be that a particular condition is so rare that a consultation must be held at a distance, meaning that a physical examination is not possible.  Where the word "examination" is used in heads 2 and 4, it might be made the subject of a definition under head 1 or be dealt with more extensively in heads 2 and 4 to address, among other issues, the express requirement for a consultation with the woman and the possibility that an examination might be other than a physical examination or might require something more than a mere physical examination.</p><p>  I anticipate that the issue of whether heads 2 and 4 should be separate will arise in questioning and I do not propose to deal with it in this submission.  I propose to speak to it later.</p><p>  Heads 6 to 9, inclusive, address the issue of reviews and appeals of decisions that are or may be made under this legislation.  I will deal with them collectively instead of breaking them down.  Having given the Bill consideration subsequent to the preparation of my written submission, a number of issues occurred to me that may be matters that the committee and, in due course, the Oireachtas wish to consider.  First, the requirement or otherwise for the provision of a scheme of legal representation for those who may require it in the setting of any review.</p></speech>

I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Dr. Mills, in commending the Chairman and the committee for the manner in which these hearings have been organised and conducted, both this month and earlier in the year.</p><p>  I provided short written submissions that deal with two specific issues.  As was noted, it was hard to be comprehensive in the time provided for preparation so I thought it best to focus on two issues.  Before I speak on those, I wish to introduce myself briefly because I have not been before the committee up to now.  I am a practising barrister and a co-author of the second edition of a book, <i>Psychiatry and the Law</i>.  In addition to my primary degree in philosophy, I have postgraduate degrees in legal theory, or law, from University College London, Harvard Law School and the King's Inns, and am currently completing a doctorate in the philosophy of law at Oxford.  My areas of interest are constitutional law, mental health law and medical legal ethics.  My publications include a piece on Irish constitutional law and statutory interpretation in the light of the European Convention on Human Rights.  My current area of research is the role of moral argument in judicial reasoning.  It does not take much imagination, therefore, to see how abortion law might feature is such research.  I am not here to argue for any particular moral or policy position on the question of abortion, however, nor, of course, am I here to give expert medical opinion.  Rather, I believe the role of the lawyer in the legislative process is at least a twofold one although my colleagues may have other insights in this regard.  </p><p>  First, I believe professional legal opinion can assist legislators in better understanding the legal meaning and legal effects of different draft proposals.  Supporters of a proposal may have a particular goal in mind but the draft may not accurately give effect to that goal.  Perhaps the examination requirement is a good example of that.  Second, professional legal opinion can assist legislators in better understanding the legal constraints within which they must operate.  The most obvious and perhaps the overarching legal constraint is the requirement under Article 15 not to enact any law that is repugnant to the Constitution, including the Constitution as it is interpreted by the courts pursuant to Article 34.  The converse of this is that legal advice should help critically to scrutinise claims that political decision making and legislative freedom are in some way restricted by certain legal requirements.  To my mind, a very noticeable feature of the political debate on the draft heads of the Bill, especially on head 4, has been the extent to which its political proponents fall back on arguments of legal necessity, which emphasise the Government's lack of freedom of choice, rather than offering stand-alone or policy-based arguments to justify the drafting choices that have been made.</p><p>  In sum, I believe the two functions of the legal input today are to help to clarify two issues, first, what is the legal effect of what is actually being proposed and, second, why it is being proposed.  My submission speaks of these two points as they relate to head 4 of the Bill.  I do not intend to summarise here those observations in detail but will be happy to take any questions members may have.  I will make a few brief points, however.  Many have called this Bill restrictive but that only begs the question - restrictive compared to what?  Obviously, any regulated abortion law will be restrictive compared to a wholly deregulated approach.  The absence of any estimates as to the level of need which head 4 is designed to address - an absence that is based in some cases on a lack of information, studies and so on - is problematic.  What will be the benchmark against which the operation of this Bill will be measured in order to confirm whether it is, in fact, as restrictive as its sponsors intend?</p><p>  Rather than talk of restrictive or non-restrictive, I prefer to examine what is permissible and possible under head 4 - I stress the words permissible and possible.  This does not mean &quot;probably&quot;.  Probability is not the only consideration.  One of the functions of legal advice with respect to the drafting of any legal instrument, be it a will, a business agreement or a Bill, is to help to anticipate and avoid possible unforeseen or undesired consequences of a particular wording.  I stress that this is a professional responsibility of lawyers and legislators alike.  It is not about casting aspersions on anybody, no more than, for example, various default clauses in a contract imply ill will or distrust of the person with whom one is dealing.  For lawyers and legislators not to ask difficult questions about the possibly unintended legal effects of a proposed wording would be irresponsible.  </p><p>  With respect to head 4, and in that light, I note in my submissions a number of legal effects which I believe, on its face, the Bill contains.  First, it is clear that head 4 marks a change in the law.   It is not accurate to say otherwise.  It creates, for the first time, a statutory basis in Irish law for what may be a direct and intentional termination of an unborn child's life.  In the January hearings Dr. Rhona Mahony articulated extremely well what she stated was the current practice in this area.</p></speech>

Before proceeding, I echo the comments of my colleague barristers on the conduct of the meetings and I congratulate the Chairman on the way they have been conducted.  It is a good exercise in democracy.</p><p>  I am here to try to assist the committee and others who may wish to ask questions about practicalities in the practice of medicine and law.  I find myself, in practice, most of the time trying to keep people out of court as opposed to fighting in court.  With particularly sensitive areas like this, courts are the not the appropriate venue to fight in an adversarial way about who is right or wrong.  There is some merit in the Mental Health Commission structure regarding inquisitive processes as opposed to the adversarial process.</p><p>  I thank the committee for asking me to attend the committee meetings and I focused on two particular issues, which have already been covered.  I took the opportunity of reading the transcript from last Friday and have had the benefit of reading in particular the views of Professor Kieran Murphy from the Medical Council.  When I prepared my written submission I had not been aware that he would cover this area and I should say for the sake of full disclosure that I attend meetings in my professional capacity before the Medical Council.  I have had no communications with the Medical Council with regard to its submission.  Nevertheless, Professor Murphy summarised very concisely the facts on the capacity issue and I echo and endorse the view of the Medical Council regarding the public interest in ensuring clarity for doctors in making clinical decisions.</p><p>  In the somewhat rushed draft I submitted early Friday morning in advance of any of these hearings I made a submission setting out present law regarding capacity and the scenario regularly faced by doctors.  Such doctors come to lawyers for advice on what to do.  It may be somewhat unsatisfactory in dealing with a woman's capacity to consent or refuse a procedure when there is impairment.  I note the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last year led to useful work by the Centre for Disability Law and Policy and I sincerely hope the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill, which is due to be published shortly, will be enacted this year, as it will help in many areas for doctors and clinical practice.  It is not seemly or right that many of the areas concerning capacity end up in the High Court.  Although it is not a frequent occurrence, one or two cases have been outlined in the written submissions of people going to the High Court in that respect.</p><p>  I have suggested in the introduction an amended wording for head 2(5).  It covers two or three issues that should be taken in by the legislation and although it is not perfect, it is suitable for discussion purposes.  It reads:<blockquote>Following certification in writing by the two registered medical practitioners in accordance with head 2(1)(<i>b</i>), including certification has been had with regard to the right to life of the unborn, a decision by or on behalf of the patient must be made and communicated in accordance with law before the medical procedure is undertaken by a registered medical practitioner.</blockquote>I am trying to cover two elements.  Head 2(1)(<i>b</i>) as currently drafted indicates that the patient has the ultimate decision but I am anticipating instances where the patient would not have the capacity to consent or refuse permission, and I am trying to anticipate the introduction of the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill, which will assist rather than substitute decisions.  I will go into that in more detail if this committee so wishes, although I note the justice committee has already dealt with it.</p><p>  Even if that Bill is not enacted, I suggest to the committee that the wording I propose would cover the area where a substituted decision must be made.  It also helps to fulfil the duty of the State as required by Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution to ensure that regard has been had to both mother and baby.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Simons" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100005#D00200"><p>Good morning Chairman, members of the committee, Senators, Deputies, members of the press and the public.  Once again I thank you for the invitation to attend today now that we have the heads of the Bill.  I have tried to listen, not to everybody's contribution over the last two days, but to some of them.  We have all been impressed by the professionalism and dedication shown by the medical experts.  I use that term to cover the experts from all the areas of medicine who we have been listening to.  In this phase of the committee's deliberations it has been particularly nice to hear testimony from some of the doctors who work in related areas.</p><p>  Yesterday we heard from Dr. Janice Walshe, the consultant medical oncologist from St. Vincent's University Hospital.  I was particularly struck by her when she said that oncologists who are dealing pregnant women who are suffering from cancer strive for foetal maturity rather than viability while providing all the care and cancer treatment the patient needs.  We also heard from Dr. Kevin Walsh, consultant cardiologist at Crumlin and the Mater hospitals, who spoke of the outstanding success of the Mater and Rotunda team approach to dealing with congenital heart disease in women.  I was delighted to hear about that because women listening to these proceedings need to know the medical teams in the hospitals are doing their best for patients with whatever complication of pregnancy they have and, happily, with great success.</p><p>  If the opportunity and time allows I might suggest the committee might also seek the advice and testimony of doctors from another branch of medicine which touches on this.  I refer, of course, to consultant neonatal intensive care doctors, who might have something valuable to tell us too, given the kind of conversations we have been having over the last few days about delivery of very premature babies.</p><p>  Our function today as lawyers is to assist the members in their analysis of the Bill.  As lawyers we can look to the formulation of the words in the heads of the Bill and advise the members as to its meaning and, more importantly, to the possibilities to which it might give rise based on our knowledge and understanding of the law.  We are not obstetricians or psychiatrists and so we rely on those experts for their expert testimony within their area of expertise.  I was interested and particularly impressed in the last couple of days with the understanding the psychiatrists have shown of the law and what this Bill will mean regarding the practice, although it is not their area of expertise.  When I hear Dr. Mills and others talk about merging heads 2 and 4, I think there will be some difficulty with that given the difficulty there has been around the suicide issue, which is the subject, as members know, of head 4.</p><p>  It is interesting that we have come to a point yesterday, which is a considerable development, when we heard the chief medical officer of the HSE talking about this Bill conferring procedural rights on a woman who believes she has a life-threatening condition.  We heard another psychiatrist talk about this Bill providing a service which should be accessible and efficient, which is a slightly different requirement than was made of us by the decision in A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland.  We need to examine what exactly this Bill is doing.  Is it about a service provision?  Does it have the backing of medical evidence?  It seems that it does not.  Even though medicine does not prescribe this procedure, it seems the law will demand it.  I agree with Mr. Brady beside me that, potentially, the law will allow it throughout the nine months of pregnancy, on a fair reading of the X case from paragraph 35 on and a subsequent case I dealt with in my submission.</p><p>  In my written submission to the committee I made a number of points.  The decision in the X case and these heads of Bill permit the termination of the life of an unborn child, not just the termination of pregnancy, and without any time limit, notwithstanding any of the statements of comfort which appear in the explanatory notes.  No evidence has been given to the committee that abortion is efficacious in the clinical care of suicidal women in pregnancy, while there is evidence of increased risk of suicidality following abortion.  The decision in the case of A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland does not require Ireland to legislate for the X case.  There are alternatives which this committee ought to consider, even at this point.</p><p>  The Bill proposes a procedure as a treatment which is untested, without any scientific basis and which must, therefore, be considered experimental treatment.  The usual criteria for the use of an experimental treatment cannot be satisfied by this formula.  There is an inconsistency throughout the Bill regarding what procedure the Bill permits.  I referred to this in my submission.  In head 1 it refers to the medical &quot;procedure that will end unborn human life&quot;.  In heads 2, 3 and 4 the wording is &quot;medical procedure in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended&quot; and in head 12 the wording is &quot;termination of pregnancy&quot;.  There are differences between these three wordings that have very different outcomes and this has ramifications throughout the rest of the Bill particularly regarding the conscientious objection clauses.</p><p>  Members will see that in my written submission I have dealt with the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights decision in the case of A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland and the requirements of the X case, and then I have looked at the law regarding experimental treatments.  Finally, because it is so important, I have looked extensively at the law on conscientious objection internationally.  Having said that, the law on conscientious objection should have no relevance whatever where we are talking about doctors wanting to practice good medicine and wanting to avoid something which has not been proven to be in any way useful to the management of a patient in circumstances where suicide is an issue.  I shall leave it at that and welcome questions the committee raises.</p></speech>

I shall address my questions to Dr. Simon Mills first.  Can Dr. Mills elaborate what he meant in the context of capacity and representation under heads 6 and 9?  Is he saying, for example, that a woman who has been refused through the panel and who lodges an appeal with the review panel would be entitled to legal representation or that somebody else could represent her if she felt she was not in a position to attend for whatever reason, medical or otherwise?  I seek clarity on the matter.</p><p>  Dr. Mills also mentioned a conflict of interest in the panel.  Is that a conflict in the context of conscientious objection or is it a conflict for some other reason?  He referred to being obliged to declare a conflict of interest.  I seek clarity on the matter.</p><p>  When Dr. Mills referred to criminalisation in the context of head 19, was he referring to the criminalisation of a person who would carry out the termination or also the criminalisation of the woman?  He referred in that context to it being quite problematic, so I want to get clarity on that as well.</p><p>  On the broader issues, Mr. Brady referred to the fact that a termination could take place up until birth.  He implied that it would be the intentional destruction of the baby.  Where is that stated in the legislation?  Where could that possibly happen?  Is he saying that the legislation overrides the right of the unborn contained in Article 40.3.3&deg; and explicitly stated in the Constitution?</p><p>  Head 4 has been quite contentious in discussions and we have had varying views.  The Government has made the decision to legislate, although the Oireachtas will decide at the end of the day.  Is there not a constitutional obligation on the Oireachtas when legislating to include the threat to the life of the woman because of suicide?  I seek clarity on the matter because I have heard varying views.  The Attorney General has a view but the senior counsel and BLs may also have a view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100006#E00300"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I thank each of our guests for attending this morning.</p><p>  I have a question for Dr. Mills on his proposed rewording of head 2 regarding GP involvement, where the current wording includes "shall consult" and "where practicable" and he suggests "where clinically appropriate" as an alternative wording in that regard.  This view argues for a less direct involvement by the GP, although the Bill as drafted does not require GP involvement as an absolute, only where practicable.  This contrasts with the views expressed by psychiatrists yesterday who argued that the GP should be fully involved, even to the point of suggesting that the GP should be the first to determine the need, or possible need, for a termination in the context of head 4.  Did Dr. Mills note their views?  I know it is very difficult to follow each of the day's submissions.  Would Dr. Mills like to offer any elaboration on his view in this regard and his view of their arguments, if he has had such an opportunity?</p><p>  On Mr. Brady's submission, specifically his written submission, which I have gone through, he is at pains to point out his position on the X case decision.  He says that a point not argued is a point not decided and references the two specific concessions, as he describes them.  Counsel for the Attorney General formally conceded two points. The first was that abortion is lawful under Article 40.3.3&deg; in certain circumstances, and the second concession was that in certain circumstances, an abortion could be the only way to avert the death of a woman from suicide.</p><p>  In his conclusions, Mr. Brady makes the point that the fact that these concessions, as he describes them, have determined the fate of such an important court case is perhaps regrettable.  He concludes that 21 years later, this is determining the fate of our legislators' deliberations.  As a legislator, I would like clarification of his view of this process.  Is it the failure of the Legislature to address the issue over the past 21 years that is inexcusable, which is his very last word in his written presentation, or is it that a decision, albeit a flawed decision in his view, of the Supreme Court, with its pre-eminence in law, is dictating the parameters for addressing these matters that is inexcusable?  I would appreciate it if he could clarify his position regarding these remarks.</p><p>  I record my thanks to Mr. Tony O'Connor for suggesting that we redraft head 2(1) and for the points he made specifically on head 2(5).  That is what this committee is about.  It is trying to find a way to improve the legislation and make it fit for purpose.  That is something we must evaluate.</p><p>  Ms Simons makes the point in the opening page of her written submission that the evidence given by every obstetrician and psychiatrist to the committee in January 2013 is totally contradicted by what is now being presented.  This has been strongly refuted during the course of these hearings by the most senior perinatal obstetricians in the land.  Ms Simons must understand that we are trying to go through all of this information and it seems that there is a strong difference of opinion in that respect.</p></speech>

We have received quite a number of presentations and heard a lot of information.  In the process we may have forgotten the basics.  Am I right that the proposed legislation will be operated on the basis of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution, which contains a constitutional commitment to the life of the woman and the unborn, on the basis that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, rather than the health, of the woman, that it will be permissible only where the risk can be averted by a termination, and that the woman make the final decision?</p></speech>

I would like to raise head 12 on conscientious objection, because it has come up several times and all of the experts have testified to their appreciation of the right to a conscientious objection.  However, it seems it has always been seen from the perspective of the doctor or the consultant.  Does a patient have a right to know if their medical practitioner has a conscientious objection?  We have seen it from one perspective.</p><p>  With regard to heads 2 and 4, the majority of governing and regulatory bodies have proposed that the two heads be merged.  Yesterday, for example, we heard that while in psychiatry there may be no biological markers, there are clinical signs and symptoms, and there was clear testimony to that fact.  I would welcome the panel's views on why they would agree or not agree with the proposal that the two heads would be merged.</p><p>  I note on head 19, which deals with the scope of the offence, that Dr. Mills' comments are in line with comments that have been made by me and others over recent days.  It is an issue we must look at.</p><p>  Several experts have raised with us the silence of the Bill when it comes to children, to girls, in particular Dr. Maeve Doyle's testimony on children who are in care because of an abusive situation.  It greatly troubles me that we will have a Bill that will totally ignore this small cohort of children who are voiceless and, yet again, may be left voiceless.  Is this an issue that we could or should address within the parameters we have?</p></speech>

The question at present is that the heads of the Bill are silent on dealing with that issue.  Is it their view, when three medical persons come to a conclusion no matter what way we structure this, that there should be a procedure put in place to deal with that from a legal point of view?  In particular, there is a distinction between someone who is under 16 and someone who is over 16.  I wonder would they clarify their own views as regards how we should go forward with that issue.</p><p>  Mr. Brady used the quote from Mr. Justice McCarthy from page 82 of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  It is important that I would quote what Mr. Justice McCarthy stated: &quot;In the context of the eight years that have passed since the Amendment was adopted and the two years since <i>Grogan's</i> case the failure by the legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate; it is inexcusable&quot;.  That was 21 years ago.  His criticism was about the lack of legislation.  I am not clear on Mr. Brady's criticism this morning as regards what he thinks is the best way of dealing with this matter.  The Supreme Court was quite critical of the Oireachtas for not having legislation.</p><p>  Ms Simons stated there are alternatives.  I presume to what she refers is that there should be no legislation and it should be by way of guidelines.  I may have misinterpreted her view.  I am wondering under what existing legislation is she talking about guidelines.  For guidelines to be put in place, there has to be legislation.  Perhaps she might outline alternatives to the way we are dealing with this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Mills" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100007#F00300"><p>In fact, I can deal with a couple of the questions in a way that I hope will respond to two or three of the Deputies and Senators at once, and I mean no disrespect if I do not deal with each of the questions raised by individual members.</p><p>  To deal with the first broad rubric which is that of capacity, and that arises from Senator Colm Burke's question, from Deputy Kelleher's question and from Senator van Turnhout's question.  Capacity comes in two forms when it comes to medical treatment.  The first is one's mental capacity, that is, whether or not one has the cognitive ability to take the decision in question.  The second aspect of capacity is one's capacity in terms of age - whether one was of sufficient age such that the law recognises one's ability to take a decision.</p><p>  To deal with Deputy Kelleher's question first in relation to capacity and legal representation, it is a somewhat complex issue.  In fact, capacity arises somewhat earlier in the process than merely heads 6 and 9 because one wonders what is the situation, for example, for a patient who may require a termination in a life-threatening emergency or who may require a termination under head 2 and who lacks capacity.  How are such decisions to be taken?  They are likely to be taken by reference to the mental capacity legislation, which is due to be introduced.  It currently goes by the Title, assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill.  It strikes me that a big part of the conversation we are having in so far as it concerns those who are vulnerable in terms of capacity can be answered by the prompt introduction of that legislation.</p><p>  The question that flowed from that is, "What is the story then about representation when it comes to a review panel?"  Again, the answer to that question starts slightly earlier.  What is the right of review for a person who lacks capacity?  If somebody lacks capacity - it has been suggested, for example, that she might well be somebody to whom head 2 applies and a decision is taken that head 2 does not apply to her - how is it determined whether that person has a right of review and how is that review to be exercised?  It is something that the Bill might consider.</p><p>  In terms of the specifics of representation, it seems that one of two approaches can be taken.  The first is that the Bill would provide for a general right of representation such that a person can be represented if the person wishes.  The alternative would be that some form of representation is guaranteed.  One thinks about, for example, the model under the Mental Health Act 2001 where a person is entitled to a review of his or her involuntary detention and legal representation is appointed for him or her.</p><p>  In regard to age, which Senator Colm Burke raised and which also touches on Senator van Turnhout's question, the law in relation to age is reasonably straightforward for over 16s.  Once one is over 18, one is an adult and there is no issue.  One has the right to consent to and to refuse medical treatment.  If one is 16 or 17, section 23 of the 1997 Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, which is, perhaps, an odd legislative instrument in which to repose the right to consent to treatment but which is where it resides, gives those aged 16 and 17 the right to consent to medical, surgical and dental treatment.  It does not give them the right to refuse, which is a significant omission that has been identified by the Law Reform Commission.  We simply do not know what the legal position is in the case of under 16s.  The Law Reform Commission has called for reform in this area and reform is certainly required.  The United Kingdom has adopted a doctrine called Gillick competence, which confers on under 16s a limited right to consent to treatment.  There is no such equivalent doctrine here, although the Law Reform Commission has recommended that one be adopted.</p><p>  To deal with Deputy Seamus Healy's question, the three assertions that he makes are absolutely correct.  It is worth observing that the three interpretations he invites us to agree with are also part of the bulwark which is, in effect, erected against many of the so-called floodgates arguments that are advanced, that however this Bill is ever to be interpreted, it is always to be interpreted against the backdrop of Article 40.3.3&deg;.</p><p>  Lastly, to deal briefly with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about GP involvement, it may well be that there is a wider role for the general practitioner than that which is currently countenanced by the legislation.  A GP is a doctor on the register of medical specialists.  He or she is on the register of medical specialists as a general practitioner.  The issue that I raise, I suppose, is the requirement that a GP shall be consulted where practicable raises at least the possibility of a bizarre procedural wrangle over the question of whether or not a particular decision is defective because sufficient efforts were not made to contact the GP prior to the termination being carried out.  It strikes me that the rationale offered in the Bill, which, ultimately, relates to follow-up care, certainly places an obligation on doctors to liaise with the GP on follow-up care but it is not clear to me that there must be an obligation for certifying doctors to deal with a GP, although there may well be a role for a GP in the certifying process.  I hope that answers all the questions that were put.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brady" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100007#F00400"><p>The Chairman indicated I have five minutes and I will try to do justice to the questions in that time.</p><p>  Briefly, in response to Senator van Turnhout's question regarding children, I would echo much of what Dr. Mills said.  The issue of consent to medical treatment of various kinds and children in Irish law is really a neuralgic point in Irish law because of various conflicting provisions, particularly the conflict between the definition of child in the Mental Health Act and also the provisions in section 23 of the 1997 Act.  Given what we have heard about how this Act might be applied and who may be using it, it seems to me that this is an issue that probably needs to be addressed in a determined and focused way by the Oireachtas, perhaps before this other issue of termination of pregnancy is addressed.  It is a stand-alone problem in its own right - consent and medical treatment for children.  It should not be dealt with as a kind of tag-on to this issue.  It deserves full consideration.  It would be very problematic indeed if this legislative machinery is set up while that issue is left parked and unclear.  It is a recipe for many problems ahead and unnecessary anguish, and perhaps cases before the courts.  That might give pause for thought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.340" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Connor" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100008#G00200"><p>I will deal with the questions that arose from each member of the committee as they were put.  Forgive me if I do not get to them all.  Deputy Kelleher mentioned conflicts of interest and legal representation.  On a pragmatic front, I believe the evidence which has been given to this committee by people like Dr. Mahony, Dr. Boylan and others, shows how doctors deal with this.  They are not out there to terminate the life of the unborn.  It works well but in a perfect world there should be a procedure, something like the mental health tribunals, in cases where a conflict is identified.  If the committee does not mind me saying so, I think it should be lawyer-free as much as possible.  We are here to help but we do not want to end up in the courts when we can avoid it.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy's perspective on criminalisation under head 19.  I think it needs to be more focused.  He mentioned the point about the constitutional obligation to legislate and that is undoubtedly the case.  It must be accepted by everybody that we are now 21 years on from the X case and there cannot be any further delay in implementing legislation.</p><p>  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his comments on the draft and I note that he will consider that.  He also made the point about the failure to legislate for 21 years.  It is time to proceed.  </p><p>  Mr. Brady raised the issue concerning the capacity of children to make the decisions.  He suggested that perhaps the legislation would be delayed pending the legislation on capacity both for children and vulnerable adults.  My own view is that we have waited long enough and we should get on with it.  However, this committee certainly should send a message concerning the legislation on the capacity of children.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned Dr. Maeve Doyle's evidence, which I did not read.  However, it is a matter that perhaps this committee should forward to the relevant Oireachtas committee and ask it to get on with the legislation about capacity for vulnerable adults and children.  </p><p>  I agree with all the points that Deputy Seamus Healy made, including that this law will comply with what he has sought to explain.  </p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned the obligation of a doctor to explain a conscientious objection.  This legislation does not provide for that, but it is my understanding that the evidence already before the committee is that in its code of conduct the Medical Council has provided that it should be.  The new code is to be introduced with the new Medical Council and that point should certainly be made to the Medical Council.  </p><p>  Senator Colm Burke asked a very relevant question on under-18s.  There is a deficit there but the doctors have shown the committee how it is working.  However, for legal certainty, I would urge the committee to send the message out that legislation is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Simons" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100008#G00300"><p>Picking up on the point that my former classmate, Mr. O'Connor, has just made, we are not obliged to bring in legislation.  Mr. Brady has made that point very well.  We do not have to bring in legislation to give effect to every expression of an unenumerated right in the Constitution.  For instance, there is a right to bodily integrity but we do not have legislation bringing that into effect.  In my own submission, I referred to Kenny's decision in The People <i>v</i>. Shaw in which he said that the word &quot;laws&quot; in Article 40.3 &quot;... is not confined to laws which have been enacted by the Oireachtas but comprehends the laws made by judges and by Ministers of State when they make statutory instruments or regulations&quot;.  Therefore, we are not talking about something that is not entirely clear.  This is a feasible alternative and might very much get one out of the difficulty concerning suicide, if the committee feels that is a difficulty.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout's question concerned who could exercise the right to conscientious objection, whether the woman could, and whether she would be entitled to know if a doctor has a conscientious objection to the treatment she is requesting.  I agree that she is entitled to that information.  However, I am a little wary of the suggestion that has arisen in the discussions over the last few days that there might be some kind of a list made of conscientious objectors.  I feel that is a little sinister.  I do not like the sound of that. </p><p>  I do feel that the list of people to whom conscientious objection is afforded under the Bill is very limited.  It is just given to midwives and doctors.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I believe this still to be the case.  The evidence that has been given on how the psychiatrists now are feeling about their participation in the certification process, in particular over the past day, has given greater substance to this point.  I was particularly interested when listening to the testimony from both the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and Professor Veronica O'Keane yesterday.  Professor O'Keane described the function of the psychiatrist as quite simply being a certification function and that it was not anything to do with treating suicidality.  She stated, in respect of the legislation, that psychiatrists will assess risk and will certify eligibility or otherwise, but it is the woman, not the psychiatrists, who is requesting the treatment.  The psychiatrist is only determining eligibility and, therefore, psychiatrists do not treat suicidal intent with abortion.  A woman chooses this treatment for herself.</p></speech>

She has preordained the treatment she wants, which is a termination under head 4.  In the absence of any mental illness, she is presumed to have capacity to make this decision and she is in a position to refuse anything that is offered to her by the psychiatrist.  This then would mean the only tool left in the kit that could address her suicidal ideation or suicidal intent is in fact abortion.  This leaves the psychiatrists in a very difficult position, which was acknowledged clearly yesterday in the testimony.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for them.  In the event of a later stage termination being carried out under head 4 at 24 weeks where there is a known high risk of disability and where the child is born disabled as a result, will the State, the HSE or the doctors be liable if the child or either parent subsequently takes a civil action?  In the event of a later stage termination being carried out under the legislation and where the child lives, who will be responsible under the law for the subsequent care of the child?  In a case where a woman has undergone an abortion under head 4, the risk of suicide, and where she subsequently regrets this action and suffers a psychiatric illness, will the State, the HSE or the doctors be liable if the woman takes a civil action on the basis she was not competent to make such a life-changing decision at the time?  In the event of a later stage termination being carried out under the legislation and where the child lives, will the biological father be liable for the costs in bringing up a child or will the mother be similarly liable?  If the taking of civil litigation by either a surviving child or mother is possible, what records will be available under the proposed legislation to assist a court in making a judgment?  In the event of a later stage termination being carried out under the legislation and where a child lives and if the biological father or a biological family member wishes to take over the care of the child, will this be permitted or will the mother be given complete control over the fate of her baby?  In the event of a woman presenting with suicidal ideation because of the baby's gender, under head 4 will she be entitled to an abortion?  Finally, is there any evidence to suggest that abortion is good for women?</p></speech>

I take the point about the current wording, &quot;where practicable&quot;, being rather vague.  Would it be helpful to include a specific requirement that the GP be consulted with the consent of the pregnant woman?  In a second point on definitions, Mr. O'Connor picked up on the definition of &quot;patient&quot;.  However, looking through the heads, I note the word &quot;patient&quot; is only used in head 4(4) and head 2(5) and elsewhere throughout the rest of the Bill, the term &quot;pregnant woman&quot; is used.  This might answer Mr. O'Connor's issue in that rather than being obliged to define &quot;patient&quot;, one could simply not use that term but instead could use the clearer term &quot;pregnant woman&quot;.  I seek his comments in this regard.</p><p>  In respect of head 1 and the definition of the unborn, this is something to which Dr. Mills referred in January.  At present, it appears to me as though this definition goes further than is required by Article 40.3.3&deg; and appears to cover, for example, both where there is no prospect of life outside the womb and where the foetus is in fact dead.  Should the definition of &quot;unborn&quot; at least be restricted to exclude this particular aspect, in accordance with what representatives of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists told the joint committee last Friday, which was that in this instance, they do not regard it as coming under the definition of &quot;unborn&quot;?  Finally, I was glad to hear both Mr. O'Connor and Dr. Mills state that head 19 is too broadly drafted.  I had taken the view that it is so broadly drafted, it would in fact be inconsistent with the Constitution, in line with the precedent in King<i> v.</i> Attorney General that it is too vague and covers too broad a range of activities.  I am grateful to both witnesses for pointing out the excessive broadness.  In particular, should members consider not criminalising the pregnant woman, in line with the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993, where the person who attempts suicide is not him or herself criminalised?  This is the Act referred to as a model in the notes to head 19.  I believe everyone is in agreement there should be some sanction for the doctors or persons who aid and abet outside of the legislation, at least within the terms of the Constitution.</p></speech>

In their evidence to the joint committee this morning, both Mr. Brady and Ms Simons stated the heads of the Bill as currently drafted would allow for the termination of life of the unborn baby.  They should clarify this point because my interpretation of head 4 is that the consultant psychiatrist must come to a reasonable opinion that there is a risk and that it can only be averted by the medical procedure.  However, the definition of "reasonable opinion" states there must be due regard to the need to preserve the unborn life, where practicable.  Based on this definition, how can they state it would be legally possible to terminate the life of the unborn baby?  I ask them to clarify their interpretation in this regard.</p><p>  In his initial contribution, Dr. Mills made the point that the threat to life will be on the basis of probability.</p></speech>

Is there any way the criminalisation provisions in head 19 are a danger to a person who is trying to operate within the confines of the Bill, assuming it is enacted?</p><p>  Is it possible to write a provision into the Bill to cover consent in the context of girls aged under 16?  It is clearly a difficult area because part of the problem nowadays is that people mature physically before they mature in other respects.  Would it be possible to come up with a wording to cover the issue?</p><p>  My final question is prompted by my colleague Deputy Regina Doherty.  It is directed to Mr. Brady in particular.  How does the judgment of the Supreme Court differ if it is conceded as opposed to argued?  Was this particular judgment unanimous and how does that position affect the judgment?</p></speech>

Dr. Mills mentioned conscientious objection in passing.  He referred to the freedom of medics in terms of the woman&rsquo;s right to be granted a termination.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.367" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Simons" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100010#J00400"><p>On Senator Bacik&rsquo;s question on the obligation to legislate, I refer her to page 6 of my submission, in which I deal with the obligations on us under the European Convention on Human Rights and Irish constitutional law.  I refer her in particular to the decision of Mr. Justice Murray in the case of McD <i>v.</i> L in 2010, in which he said that national law always takes precedence over international law.  He continued by saying that the obligations undertaken by a Government that has ratified the convention arise under international law and not national law.  Accordingly, those obligations reside at international level and in principle the State is not answerable before the national courts for a breach of conventions or obligations unless provision is duly made in national law for such liability.  Thus, contracting states may in principle, in so far as the effect of the convention at national level is concerned, ignore the decisions of the court.  Although I do not advocate that, I have pointed out in my submission that we are exemplary in our observation of decisions that are made in regard to us - much better, in fact, than Germany, Italy and other countries that I cited in the text.</p><p>  On the question on head 4, which is where we find the idea that perhaps this Bill and the X case would allow termination of life rather than termination of pregnancy, if one looks at paragraphs 36 to 38 of Judge Finlay&rsquo;s decision in the X case, one will see his consideration of the test that was proposed by the Attorney General, namely, that the life of the unborn could only be terminated if it were established that an inevitable and immediate risk existed.  The judge said that the formula proposed by the Attorney General insufficiently vindicated the mother&rsquo;s right to life.  In a later case, in the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the matter of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995, Judge Hamilton said the case of Attorney General <i>v</i>. X established that, having regard to the true interpretation of the Eighth Amendment, termination of the life of the unborn is permissible if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that risk can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  Where we are talking about a situation in which a woman who does not have a mental illness but who is suicidal because of a pregnancy requires treatment - namely, her suicidality is to be addressed - it will not be enough to deliver her so that she is not pregnant.  It may be the continuing existence of the baby that is causing her suicidality.  There is room to see in the judgments that she could look for a termination of the life of the unborn.  It would be reasonable to think that most people who would avail of the procedure would wish that result.  We do know that in 2005 in the UK 66 babies survived NHS abortions.  That figure was published in 2008.  Following that, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists introduced a guideline which required that once a woman who had elected for an abortion was 21 weeks and six days pregnant she was entitled to have a foeticide either before or during the termination.  Those are the kinds of things the members will have to think about.  As lawyers we have to tell the committee about the possibilities that are raised by the heads of the Bill, which must take cognisance of the decision in the X case, so there is room for manoeuvre.</p><p>  In response to Senator Bacik and others who have inquired on the matter of the criminalisation of women in abortion law, it is still a crime in the UK and the 1861 Act still applies there.  Members are probably aware that last autumn there was a successful prosecution of an abortionist in the UK and in recent times there was a prosecution of a woman who aborted her baby at 30 weeks' gestation.  She was given eight years by UK courts.  It is easy to say we do not want to criminalise women but there may be cases in which that is appropriate, and it would be unwise to remove the law.</p></speech>

They were theoretical questions about civil actions and biological fathers which would only prompt me to again advocate that the committee encourage the Legislature to introduce legislation on assisted human reproduction.  That is an area in which I have a particular interest and I take the opportunity to suggest that if the Deputy has an interest in it he should deal with it.  I do not mean to be dismissive of his questions.</p><p>  Senator Bacik raised a number of points and I hope to deal with all of them.  I agree that the consent of the patient to go to a GP is important in the context of what we are talking about.  I also accept her point that the term &ldquo;pregnant woman&rdquo; is used in other areas of the Bill and perhaps the term &ldquo;patient&rdquo; could be married with that.  I acknowledge her expertise, particularly in the criminal law area.  She is correct in stating, about head 19, that the phrase &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person to do any act with the intent to destroy unborn human life&rdquo; is too broad and will not stand up to scrutiny.  It needs better definition.</p><p>  Dr. Mills has dealt with the broadness of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  I have had a discussion with him on the matter of whether it covers ectopic pregnancies.  If one wishes to be clear then why not take the opportunity now to make sure it does not?</p><p>  Deputy Naughten did not address a particular question to me, but I understand his concerns.  The legislation has been awaited for 21 years and we must get on with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brady" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100011#K00200"><p>Senator Bacik's point goes the essence of one of the points I am trying to make in as far as I respectfully disagree with the Senator that we are required to legislate for the X case by reason of the A, B and C<i> v. </i>Ireland decision.  I do not think that is an accurate reading of the A, B and C<i> v.</i> Ireland.  I have put into my written submissions detailed references to some of the jurisprudence of the ECHR regarding the implementation of its decisions.</p><p>  A decision of the ECHR is primarily a declaratory judgment, it is not like a judgment in a domestic court, which generally gives a declaration as to who wins and states what the losing side must do about that.  Unless it is under a pilot scheme judgment, which was not the case in A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland, the court is declaratory.  That discretion of a contracting member state to implement a decision is increased when it comes to the implementation of a positive obligation.  The breach in A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland was a breach of the positive obligation on the State towards the third applicant under Article 8, not a negative obligation, to facilitate accessible and effective procedures to a woman in the situation of Ms C.  When implementing a decision regarding a breach of positive obligations, there is an even greater area of discretion.  That has been played down in how these matters have progressed.</p><p>  This leads to the second point raised by Deputy Naughten regarding my view as to how, in the case of head 4, a termination of the life of the unborn as opposed to the pregnancy, could occur after viability.  This comes down to the application of the test of real and substantial risk beyond physiological conditions.  In the case of a medical condition arising due to a physical aspect of the pregnancy, there will be a distinction between terminating the pregnancy and terminating the life of the child in that the death of the unborn child itself will avail nothing.  It may well be, however, that it occurs in the context of a procedure designed to assist the woman, whereas in the case of suicidal ideation or intent, as proposed under head 4, it is conceivable that the refusal of an abortion itself may be the cause of suicidality.  That was a possibility canvassed by many of the psychiatrists.  In those situations, to say that we will induce an early delivery is not responding to the threat to the life from suicidality on the grounds of that pregnancy.  The requirement in the Bill to have due regard to human life as far as practicable was also the test the Supreme Court was applying when it allowed for a direct termination of the life of the unborn on the grounds of suicidality.  It is not safe to assume that simply because at the moment best practice is not to do anything post viability that would directly end a life, that will continue under head 4.  I do not think head 4 requires that at all.</p><p>  To go back to the significance of the conceded point made by Deputy Doherty, Mr. Justice McCarthy, who other members referred to, in the course of the X case judgment himself at page 77 of the report referred to an earlier decision of SPUC <i>v</i>. Coogan and said he disagreed with that decision.  He was in the minority because he did not consider the point to have been decided in an earlier case which the court was referring to.  He applied the doctrine I raised, that an unargued point is not a decided point and is only binding for the case.  It leaves room for action, therefore, if the will be there.  That is not my business, but it is my business to point out if an artificial constraint has been put upon a person when that person is in fact free to make decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Mills" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100011#K00300"><p>On the question of merging heads 2 and 4, there are a number of ways of looking at this.  They can be dealt with separately but if they are to be dealt with separately it should be done by the application of the same legal test, whatever the threat to life of the mother.  No distinction was made in the X case and no distinction is made in Article 40.3.3o to the effect that with due respect to the life of the mother, except for those threatening suicide.  By that logic, once it is accepted, and I perfectly understand that there are those who do accept this view, there is no ground for discrimination between those threatening suicidality and those whose threat to health is physical, save for the expertise of doctors who may be called in aid when it comes to the provision of medical expertise.  It does not seem to me that the distinction stands up.</p><p>  That becomes clear when we look at head 4.  It asks for two consultant psychiatrists and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.  It leaves open the prospect that two psychiatrists might form the view that suicidality is present such that it poses a threat to the life of the mother only to be vetoed by the consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.  That is a vanishingly unlikely prospect but it is a curious prospect to have in the legislation.  Mr. Brady and Ms Simons talked about this earlier.  What are the consequences of the rules the Bill is laying down?  That is one consequence.</p><p>  Mr. Brady mentioned that head 4 changes the law.  I think the position is precisely the contrary.  To exclude suicidality is to change the law because the law as it currently stands is the law as laid down in the X case by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of Article 40.3.3o.  When that argument is put forward, there is curious burden shift that is not being dealt with in these hearings, which is that when the burden is all of a sudden about changing the law to exclude suicidality, that burden requires a heavy onus to be discharged by those looking to change the law.  It is for the committee to decide if that onus is being discharged.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about consequences of delivery.  I agree with Mr. O'Connor that it lies with the discussion of the heads of the Bill as they stand, save for one observation that might commend itself to the committee and the Oireachtas, whether or not there is a requirement, as there is under the Mental Health Act 2001, to deal with questions of civil liability that may arise from acts done in good faith under the provisions of the Bill.  It may be that some such section would be appropriate. </p><p>  Senator Bacik asked three questions.  She referred to the scenario where there is no fetal heartbeat and whether some form of clarification is necessary.  Once that is the scenario, one is talking about a wholly different medical phenomenon, missed miscarriage, and that falls to be treated in the way that a missed miscarriage would ordinarily be treated.  There is a half-way scenario that relates to the question of the inevitable miscarriage of the non-viable early pregnancy.  That remains a grey area.</p><p>  On the question of consultation with the GP and the woman's consent being required, that is a difficulty created by the introduction of the world "shall", saying doctors "shall" consult with the GP.  The requirement for the consent of the woman is atomised by that requirement.  She does not have an entitlement to give or withhold consent.  That might be a problem.</p><p>  On the question of attempting a termination and whether it should be criminalised, the confounding element is Article 40.3.3o itself, which contains an obligation to have regard to the life of the unborn.  It may well be, therefore, that an attempt to terminate the life of the unborn should be regarded as a criminal act.</p></speech>

This goes back to a question asked by Senator van Turnhout on whether there would be a requirement to disclose at the outset of a doctor-patient relationship.

There is a tension here but it is one that has been resolved in many other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Perhaps the legal professionals will be able to reply today.  Does the inclusion of a separate head on deliberate self-harm create a rebuttable presumption that mental illness is a reason to carry out an abortion?  On the capacity of a person to make an irrevocable decision, whether based on a state of mind or being a minor, perhaps the legal professionals will clarify whether it would be better to address this issue before the legislation goes before the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

On an issue that arose in the discussion with psychiatrists yesterday, a person who is not suffering from a mental disorder and cannot, therefore, be forced to undergo any treatment may well present herself for an abortion.  If abortion is considered the only outcome that can be offered to such a person, would there be an automatic obligation to provide the abortion purely on those grounds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Simons" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100012#L00800"><p>On the earlier suggestion that the law was not being changed by the proposed Bill, what the Bill will do, if one likes, is activate the X test.  It may not change the law but the law has not actively been practised in terms of medical practice.  The Bill will change medical practice and abandon the two patient model, which has been used.  Having heard Deputy English being congratulated on Friday, and as I know myself, there may be even more than two patients in a pregnancy.  The two patient model will go out the window if the legislation is implemented.  As I stated in January, doctors, in this case psychiatrists, will for the first time be faced with a request for abortion to treat suicidal intent or ideation.  They would not have considered abortion a treatment previously and still do not appear to consider a treatment.  Obstetricians will also be asked to carry out terminations of pregnancy on physically healthy women.  These are profound changes in the practice of medicine in Ireland.</p><p>  On whether we believe the passing of the Bill will result in widespread abortion, while we cannot look into crystal balls, it would be very foolish not to have regard to what has occurred in other jurisdictions where abortion has been introduced on grounds similar to those provided for here.  I am already hearing from lawyers in the United Kingdom where abortion is allowed on the basis of risk to a woman's mental health.  Suicide brings something that is incapable of prediction.  As we have been told by psychiatrists, abortion is not a treatment.  This legislation is potentially wider than that in place in the UK but we will have to wait and see.  I will not predict in the matter. </p><p>  Does the legislation legalise the killing of babies?  There is a very fair argument to be made that this is something that is understood by the breadth of the X case decision.  Again, it would be unrealistic of us not to look at what it is a woman wants when she says she is suicidal and wants an abortion.  There is certainly enough ground in the X case and the heads of the Bill to allow her to look forward to that. </p><p>  On Senator Walsh's question as to whether the psychiatrist would be obliged to certify for an abortion, as psychiatrists have stated in recent days, they would err on the side of caution.  Where there is nothing else they can offer and the woman is competent and perfectly entitled to refuse what they are offering, they would be in difficulty in relation to this. </p></speech>

She should be a lawyer asking "Yes" or "No" questions.  She can answer her question on whether the passing of this Bill will result in widespread terminations as well as I can.  My answer, however, is "No" as one would need a change of law in relation to it.  On whether the Bill would legalise the killing of babies, it will not do so any more than that which exists at present.</p><p>  Senator Walsh asked whether the Bill should refer to section 21.1 of the Medical Council guidance.  While I have not considered the issue in any great depth, I believe that to do so would complicate matters.  Unfortunately, I did not get the other question asked. </p></speech>

However, she did refer to circumstances where there was no underlying mental illness and other expert witnesses have said that they believed that the majority of women presenting under head 4 would be women with no mental illness, which makes this a real issue in terms of what that will mean in practice.</p><p>  To answer the second question as to whether this Bill is legislating for the killing of babies, as Deputy Byrne put it, I would say that by moving the test for real and substantial risk to the grounds of suicidality and away from physical issues, if the woman's threat is based on the existence of the child and the continuation of the pregnancy, whereby she says that if she has to give birth to the child she will kill herself, then what that woman is looking for is an abortion and not some other form of treatment.  In that sense, therefore, it can only be a fair reading that the Bill legislates as the Deputy has suggested.  </p><p>  In response to Deputy Troy, the position is that there is a presumption being stamped here that the legislature will create a statutory pathway, a formal legislative framework, whereby one can access a termination of unborn life on grounds of suicidality.  That would seem to suggest that the Legislature regards that as a valid proposition, a worthwhile end and something that needs to be done and in that sense, it does create such a presumption.  </p><p>  I have mislaid my note on Senator Walsh's question but will respond to it later, if I may.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with only one issue, namely the assertion that by legislating for mental health in similar ways, other countries have somehow found themselves on a slippery slope.  I would simply observe that I am aware of no country that has introduced a test along the lines that is being proposed in the 2013 Bill.  I am aware of no country that has introduced a test that is as restrictive.  The 1967 Californian legislation, which has been advanced as some sort of analogue a number of times, was a paragon example of bad legislative drafting.  Whatever else about this legislation, it is precise in what it is aimed at.  The California legislation was scatter-gun in its approach and involved a bowdlerised application of a legal test intended for other purposes.  The text of the penal code was at odds with the text of the statute and the Act was struck down for vagueness.  The English test is a far vaguer test than the one proposed in this jurisdiction.  The assessment that an analogy can be drawn between the proposed Irish scheme and other schemes introduced in other jurisdictions is flawed.  No one has been able to point to a statutory principle identical to that set out in the 2013 Bill that has been introduced in another jurisdiction and has, in fact, been abused in the way that is so often contended.</p></speech>

If I understand him correctly, he is asking whether the legislation creates a presumption.  My view, which may well differ from his own, is that it is representing the existing law.  It may be putting it into a statute, but it is the existing law.</p></speech>

He asked whether the Bill itself should include an expressed requirement that the decision should be based on evidence.

My first question is directed to Mr. O'Connor and Dr. Mills.  Are we, as legislators, obliged to legislate for the X case, a Supreme Court judgment that is now 21 years old, given that there is now unanimity among all the psychiatrists, as shown again yesterday, that abortion is not a treatment for a suicidal pregnant woman?  Indeed, Dr. Janice Walsh said that there was nothing new in the Bill to improve practice in the case of pregnant women with cancer, which was, of course, the C case.</p><p>  My next question is directed to the entire panel.  Bearing in mind the separation of powers, where does my duty lie as a legislator?  I realise that the Government wants us to legislate but where does my duty lie?  Am I to be enslaved by a 1992 judgment that is now out of date or am I to give due regard to best practice for pregnant women and the unborn and to reflect section 21.1 of the Medical Council guidelines, which ask me to give due regard to clinical-based research?  Can we, as an Oireachtas, satisfy the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights without legislation or by excluding head 4, which is clearly problematic?  Indeed, as Dr. Mills acknowledged at the outset, should head 4 survive?  If so, what is the way forward that the panellists would propose?  Are there other examples of Supreme Court judgments that have not been legislated for?  If so, I ask the panellists to list them.  Has the Oireachtas acted unconstitutionally for the past 20 years by not legislating for abortion on the grounds of suicide?  I ask for a "Yes" or "No" response to that question.</p></speech>

Does he think that the evidence presented in the X case would have been sufficient to justify a termination under this draft Bill?  I ask him to comment on the testimony of Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital, that the inclusion of suicidal intent as grounds for a termination was not evidence-based.  He said that it posed major ethical dilemmas for obstetricians and could lead to an increase in women seeking terminations.  In that context, are there any other areas in medicine or medical law that Dr. Mills has come across where a treatment is legislated for that is not effective and that leads to an increase in the suicide rate?</p><p>  My next question is a general one for all of the panellists and I ask that they give me a "Yes" or "No" answer.  The question relates to conscientious objection and head 12.  Earlier today the patient was mentioned, as were the doctors and midwives, in the context of conscientious objection.  Does an institution have a right to conscientious objection, as endorsed by the Council of Europe?</p> <p>Should head 12.3 be removed?  I seek a "Yes" or "No" reply.</p></speech>

One of the phrases very strongly used by the people who genuinely are proponents of this legislation is that there is no new law and no change in legislation.  I believe that was said by the Taoiseach in Boston yesterday.  As I believe Ms Simons has already addressed the matter, I direct my question to Mr. Brady.  Does he believe new law is being proposed?  Does he believe this is a change in legislation?  If so, what are those changes?</p><p>  Among all the interesting documentation we have received and read, sometimes one little sentence will jump off the page.  Dr. Mills made a very fine contribution this morning in addressing head 19.  His submission contained the following statement, on which we need to reflect and on which I have a question: "To claim that such terminations ... are not intentional destructions of the foetus is a legal ... fiction."  That is important.  I fully agree with him that claiming it is not intentional destruction is a legal fiction.  How does the proposed legislation stand regarding the constitutional right to life of the unborn?</p></speech>

We have heard from all the medical professionals, including the psychiatrists, who, while they might not agree on some aspects of the heads of the Bill, agree that abortion is not a treatment for suicidal intent or a suicidal pregnant woman.  My question - courtesy of Deputy Timmins - is as follows.  Are we now actually legislating for abortion to be a treatment for a suicidal pregnant woman?  Is that what the legislation asks us to do?</p><p>  I wish to address the situation of the viable child.  At 22 or 24 weeks, where this decision comes to be made, there could be an early delivery of a child with a disability that he or she will have to live with for the rest of his or her life.  Who is protecting that child?  I know Mr. O'Connor declined to answer some questions from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Given that we are discussing heads of a Bill and not specific clauses, I respectfully suggest we are entitled to consider everything that flows from this.  Who will stand up for and protect this child from any such injury or disability with which he or she might have to live for the rest of his or her life?  Would the child potentially have a cause of action against his or her own mother, the surgeon or the people who made the decision?</p><p>  How robust is the requirement to have the professionals to assess this?  We have already heard obstetricians say that it is a psychiatric decision.</p></speech>

We have heard two extremes.  Notwithstanding the profession of psychiatry and all the assurances we got, I am very sure right now I could name one particular type of case where there is not a mental illness involved and there is a pregnant woman who is suicidal, in which two psychiatrists would say completely opposite things where that woman is looking for an abortion.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on three areas.  In his opening remarks on head 4, Mr. Brady said we should not be under any illusions that we are creating new law.  Law emerges in many forms - through statute law, court interpretation, precedent, etc.  Section 21.1 of the current Medical Council guidelines states:<blockquote><br />Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother.  Under current legal precedent, this exception includes where there is a clear and substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide. </blockquote>My reading of that is that the current law, to which medical practitioners are obliged to have regard, states that there is a legal entitlement to a termination on the grounds of suicide.  Is that not the current law?  If it is, is it true to hold the view that we are creating new law?</p><p>  Ms Simons stated that to proceed with head 4 is effectively to abandon the two-patient approach.</p></speech>

Section 18 of the Offences against the State Act provides for a renewal mechanism of that legislation on an annual basis.  In the context of head 4 and the considerable concern about whether what is provided therein will open the flood gates, do the witnesses believe the Oireachtas should, following a defined period following enactment of this legislation, review it by way of a provision similar to that provided for in the Offences against the State Act to see if a consequence of its enactment has been an opening up of the flood gates, as some have argued will be the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Simons" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100015#O00400"><p>Because it has not been asked before I would first like to respond to Deputy Flanagan's question on the right to conscientious objection of institutions.  I refer to page 18 of my written submission wherein I point to a number of cases of the European Court of Human Rights which deal with that very issue.  In one case, Rommelfanger <i>v. </i>The Federal Republic of Germany , the court held that a hospital was entitled to dismiss a plaintiff because he took ethical positions which were contrary to those of his employer.  This would confirm that a hospital is capable in law of holding ethical positions.  That case was then confirmed in Lambardi Vallauri <i>v.</i> Italy in which it was held that a Catholic institution can limit the rights and freedoms of other people in order to protect its ethos.  I have also appended at the back of my written submission an extensive survey of the laws in the various states of the United States of America in relation to conscientious objection.  Members will note that many of them do afford a right of conscientious objection to institutions.  There is no difficulty at all in providing for that.</p><p>  On Senator Healy Eames's question of whether we are obliged to legislate for the X case, in my opinion, we are not, most particularly in light of the evidence that we received in January and during the past couple of days from the psychiatrists.  I believe it would be unwise and that members of the joint committee, as legislators, have a duty to the people they represent to implement good laws which are representative of the best of medical practice and evidence-based.  The degree of dissatisfaction among the doctors, as expressed over the past few days, should be a considerable cause of concern to members.  The division which seems apparent among the ranks of the psychiatrists would appear to be an ideological one rather than one based on medical evidence.  It might have been more appropriate for the institute to have made a representation on its own behalf, similar to the Law Library and solicitors-----</p></speech>

I will try to respond first to those specifically addressed to me.  On Deputy Creed's question in relation to the two-patient model, I believe there will be a change in this regard and for the following reason.  Currently, if a woman who is suicidal in pregnancy presents she is given appropriate treatment, including counselling and so on.  It appears that this is to be abandoned.  We heard from the perinatal psychiatrists in January that in their combined 40 years of experience they had never prescribed abortion as a treatment for suicidality and they did not consider such to be a treatment.  It is now proposed as a treatment under the heads of this Bill.  With respect, I suggest that for that very reason - at least in relation to head 4 and suicidality - the two-patient model will be abandoned.  I will hand over at this point to my colleagues but am happy to respond later to any further questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Connor" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100015#O00700"><p>Senator Healy Eames asked about the obligation to legislate for the X case.  Mr. Justice McCarthy stated in respect of the X case that there was a deficiency and it was up to the Legislature to legislate.  The Legislature can abdicate its responsibility and leave it to the courts to decide issues as they arise.  However, my personal view is that the Legislature should legislate.  Senator Healy Eames also asked about other examples where the Supreme Court may have been critical of non legislating.  There are quite a few cases, the most recent being the case involving Roche, in which parties had to go to the High Court and Supreme Court to vindicate their rights.  There are many instances.  I note the Senator is nodding in agreement.</p><p>  Although not directed to me, Deputy Flanagan asked if the view of the psychologist in the X case would be sufficient under this legislation.  The answer to that question is, "No, because there was only one person involved."  If I understood him correctly, Deputy Durkan asked if the obligation to legislate was in contravention of the Supreme Court or if the Legislature takes it upon itself to legislate contrary to what the Supreme Court suggested.  That is dangerous territory.  I am not sure if the Deputy is advocating that.  The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution.  If the Constitution has been ruled upon by the Supreme Court the Legislature cannot ignore that.</p><p>  Deputy Mathews, my local representative, referred to the six line recommendation I made as being too wordy.  It is only a suggestion.  Members may feel free to amend it.  I do not believe Deputy Mulherin was overly critical.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked a number of questions.  Each case, particularly in terms of negligence and duty of care, what loss will be compensated by doctors and so on, will have to be considered on its own merits.  I cannot give a general answer to that question.  It is worthy of a good article.  I could not understand all of the facts which the Deputy provided but I am more than happy to sit down with him and to advise in relation to each of them.  The Deputy will be aware that each case must be looked at on its own merits.  As regards the relevancy of this to the heads of the Bill, my understanding is that the heads of the Bill do not deal with negligence and duty of care.</p><p>  Deputy Creed asked some interesting questions.  I will try to address his question on whether, in terms of capacity and under-age, there is a deficit in there being no authorised officer to vindicate the rights of the young mother or unborn child.  There is a deficit.  I suggested at the beginning of my presentation that the joint committee send out the message that we need legislation to cover capacity and representation for other parties.  There are examples in other jurisdictions.  The Law Reform Commission report on vulnerable adults and under-age provides examples.  The Deputy also referred to the sunset clause provided in other legislation, whereby legislation falls after a specified period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brady" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100016#P00200"><p>I apologise to members if I am unable to answer their questions.  It will not be possible to address all the valuable and important questions raised.  I will group the questions together.</p><p>  On the obligation to legislate for the X case, which was raised by Senator Healy Eames and Deputy Durkan, Mr. O'Connor put it very well when he said his personal view was that the Legislature should legislate.  That is the only position a lawyer can take on this issue.  If a judge points out a gap in the law it is important that we note it.  In most cases it is absolutely something to be remedied.  However, I do not think that creates a legal or constitutional duty on members to the effect that they do not have to consider whether they wish to legislate.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that is the case.  They are left with the duty of deciding what they think is best.  We hope that in most cases our Supreme Court will make decisions with which all of us are happy.  If it does not, the Legislature has various options, such as to propose a referendum, but it does not have to follow every judicial statement seeking further legislation.  It is certainly not a legal obligation.</p><p>  As regards whether one's own views can taint legal advice, it is fair to say that is a standing fear or problem on any issue and in any profession.  All I can say is that if barristers are asked to provide legal opinion on a set of papers they will not get far if they insert their own personal opinions instead of what they consider the law to say.  As lawyers we are trained to stand back from our own personal views to provide an opinion on the law.  I hope that is taken at face value by everyone here.</p><p>  Senator Bradford and Deputy Creed asked about changing the law.  There are ways in which this is implementing the judgment on X and other ways in which it is changing the law.  It is changing the law because it is repealing a statute and creating a new offence.  Many of the reservations expressed about section 19 would not make sense unless changes were being proposed to the law.  It is inaccurate to argue otherwise.  Regarding the substantive issue, a statutory framework is being created, with tests, procedures and particular personnel identified, and this has not previously been the case.  With respect to where the onus lies, this is clearly a debate which will go back and forth but the Supreme Court decision on X was based on a concession between the parties rather than an articulated point.  If it had been argued, the court would have had to consider various implications regarding treating suicidality like any other medical condition but it did not decide on that basis.  The onus has never been discharged in so far as it was decided on a concession.</p><p>  Deputy Creed referred to the right of the unborn and asked whether it should be represented.  A number of parallels have been drawn with the Mental Health Act 2001, including the suggestion that only a GP and a psychiatrist should be required under head 4 on the basis that such a combination was provided for under the Act.  However, that overlooks the fact that four doctors are involved under the Act.  One GP can recommend and one consultant can admit but an automatic review process takes place within 21 days under which a second opinion is sought from a consultant and a tribunal which includes in its membership another consultant.  Up to four doctors may in fact be involved because the patient's constitutional right to liberty is at stake.  The expert group recognised the logic of arguing that two constitutional rights are at issue in these decision making processes, one being the right to life of the unborn.  Encapsulating that is a political decision but I do not think it is legally unfounded.</p><p>  As regards a sunset clause, I agree with Mr. O'Connor that it is ultimately a political decision but against what is such a clause is to be benchmarked?  We know from Dr. Rhona Mahony's estimate that between ten and 20 procedures may take place under head 2.  As I do not know if any number has been suggested under head 4, what benchmarks will be used if there are two procedures per year or 50 procedures per year?  Will such figures been seen as a success or a failure of the restrictions?  The current lack of figures may feed into the question of whether the policy is viable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Mills" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100016#P00300"><p>As with Mr. O'Connor, Mr. Brady and Ms Simons, there is a limit to the number of questions that I can answer in the time available to me.  I will start with Deputy Terence Flanagan's questions.  He raised an interesting issue pertaining to conscientious objection by institutions.  There is a tension in the Bill between the conscientious objection granted to individuals and the assertion that institutions are not entitled to conscientious objections.  If no institution is entitled to a conscientious objection, what happens if every individual in that institution exercises a conscientious objection?  It could possibly lead to the bizarre scenario of an add-on question at job interviews along the lines of how the applicant feels about the protection of life during pregnancy Bill 2013.  That is not necessarily an absolute tension and there may be flexibility in terms of the provision of medical services but it strikes me as a tension none the less.  The Deputy and I did not agree about much during on the last occasion we discussed these issues but I think we can agree that head 12 creates a certain tension.</p><p>  However, I disagree with Deputy Flanagan on the question of suicide and termination.  I do not accept the premise of his question on the indication for prescribing a treatment that increases the rate of suicide.  The evidence to support that assertion is simply not available because the group of women we are discussing for the purpose of this Bill have not been studied in the way suggested by the Deputy.  His question does not bear the weight of its closing premise.</p><p>  A problem that has bedevilled this issue is the assumption that because the area has not been thoroughly studied - the difficulties in doing so have been identified repeatedly - the ensuing absence of evidence can be flipped on its head to be used as evidence of absence.  What witnesses have in fact said is that we are discussing a tiny cohort of women for whom the threat of suicide in pregnancy is a problem and the number of those for whom the question of termination might arise.  The presumption that because this tiny group has not been studied, no conclusions should be made about them and they should be excluded from the protection of the Constitution, which is the logical conclusion of what is proposed, is a stunning assertion.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked about my reference to the exclusion of head 4.  She seemed to believe I was making some sort of concession that suicide would end up being excluded.  That is not what I meant when I said "excluded".  I meant excluded in the sense of being merged with head 2, which is a very different matter.</p><p>  This brings me to something Mr. Brady said.  He opened his contribution by stating that the law is being changed when it comes to head 4.  In his closing contribution he changed his position to state that the change in the law relates to the way we are legislating for the 1861 Act.  </p></speech>

I was delighted to be here last January and it is a privilege to be here again today.  It is the third day of the committee's deliberations, second time around, as it were, so I will not weary the committee with a reiteration of points the committee will have heard many times before.  However, in the few minutes I have I would like to concentrate my opening remarks upon the suggestion by the Taoiseach that it is a necessary requirement that we introduce legislation to deal with the European case and, specifically, that we introduce legislation in accordance with the X decision, the Supreme Court decision.  I wish to challenge both of those propositions and I hope we will have an opportunity during questions to address in more detail the points that I would wish to make on those two points.</p><p>  First, do we need to implement the X case through legislation as a result of the European Court of Human Rights decision?  The answer is emphatically &quot;No&quot;.  If one listens very closely to the Government, it will concede that point.  No legal argument has been put forward that I am aware of which argues that we are legally obliged as a result of the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland decision, to implement that decision simply through the process of legislation.  There are many other ways that we can implement that decision.  What that decision requires is clarity in the law and also an assurance that if an individual, a woman who is seeking an abortion, gets a &quot;No&quot; that she has some system whereby she can, as it were, appeal that decision to get a second view or second opinion on the matter.  Essentially, that is what the European Court of Human Rights requires.  It does not require us to implement the X case decision and it does not require us to take any position whatsoever in terms of constitutional law as regards the fundamental policy of the State.  I will say more on that matter at a later stage but it is a crucially important point because it means that the Oireachtas, far from being constrained into having to introduce this legislation, actually has a range of options to introduce clarity into our law.</p><p>  The second point I make by way of a side-point.  When one actually reads this legislation it is clear that it does not introduce one ounce of extra clarity into the law in the sense of actually giving specific medical content to decisions that doctors have to make.  Doctors have to make decisions every day in the context of pregnant women, but also in the context of non-pregnant women and men.  They make judgments about medical treatments.  The committee members will note when they read this particular Bill that it does not contain the details of medical treatment.  Rather, it contains a principle which was already there, a principle which is contained in the amendment itself, that is, in Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.</p><p>  The third point I wish to make is that the Supreme Court decision, of course, represents the law of the country.  It gives the authoritative constitutional interpretation of this country.  Of course it is true to say that one cannot defy a Supreme Court decision, which is part of the law of the land.  However, that is only the beginning of legal analysis rather than the end, as the Government would suggest.  This is because sometimes the courts get things wrong.  Sometimes the courts get things in ways that frankly are either out of sync with the science or out of sync with fair, reasonable values.  In this particular case, the decision of the Supreme Court over 20 years ago sadly got it wrong on the science, on the medicine, on the psychiatry and also in terms of a fair human rights protection.</p><p>  This is because what the Supreme Court did in that case, as the committee is aware, was to authorise the intentional taking of the life of an innocent human being during pregnancy on the basis of suicidal ideation.  We would immediately reject that proposition in respect of any other human being, a born human being, for example, however pressing the circumstances, and we can think of very pressing circumstances where suicidal ideation might occur as a result of a close dependency relationship in regard to people who have been born.  That proposition is unstatable, unthinkable in regard to children who have been born.  However, the Supreme Court embraced that proposition as an interpretation, a wrongful interpretation, we would suggest, of Article 40.3.3&deg; in the decision.  Therefore, far from being a decision that the Oireachtas must follow, I would respectfully say it is a decision that the Oireachtas must not follow, because if the Oireachtas were to introduce that decision into law through legislation, it would be introducing bad medicine, bad psychiatry and a violation of human rights.  It is absolutely not the way for the Legislature to go.</p><p>  What are the options for the Oireachtas in these circumstances?  The first thing the Oireachtas can contemplate is simply in the exercise of the separation of powers and in the exercise of the legislative powers of the Oireachtas so as not to make the mistake of going down the wrong scientific route and the wrong route as far as human rights protection is concerned.  It is the entitlement and the prerogative of the Legislature not to implement a bad law.  Would that put the Oireachtas in conflict with the Supreme Court decision?  Not necessarily, as it happens, because the Supreme Court decision decided the case on the basis of the facts as presented to it.  As the committee is aware, the facts as presented to it did not involve any expert psychiatric evidence from a psychiatrist, none at all.</p><p>  In other slightly less contentious or controversial cases the Supreme Court has accepted that it makes judgments on the basis of the evidence presented and it does not purport to have the last scientific word.  If I may, I will mention a case to the committee.  It is a case that some committee members may remember, namely, Best <i>v</i>. Wellcome Foundation, which involved the question of whether a vaccine had caused brain damage to a little boy.  The Supreme Court came to the conclusion in that case that the vaccine had caused damage to the plaintiff.  In that case the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, made it plain that when it comes to a decision on a scientific matter it was not purporting to make a final scientific or authoritative scientific judgment.  Rather, it was simply making an adjudication on the basis of the evidence presented to it.  In that case there was a very understandable and appropriate judicial modesty as to the court's role in regard to matters of science.</p><p>  We now come forward 21 years.  The committee has heard the evidence from the psychiatrists.  The committee has heard that to introduce this particular ground would be highly controversial from a psychiatric point of view.  The science has not been with the Supreme Court over the past 21 years, but that is not its fault.  It received no scientific evidence and no psychiatric evidence.  As I will stress to the committee during the questions and the discussion, there is no obligation to implement the Supreme Court judgment as it articulated that principle in the context of the facts in that case.  The Legislature is perfectly entitled and, I would suggest to the committee, absolutely obliged in conscience on the basis of human rights protection not to go down that route.</p><p>  I wish to point to another aspect of the X decision, the Supreme Court decision which the Government is very unwilling to talk about.  I have been watching, listening and waiting to hear a considered analysis from any Government member during the past six months - indeed, I put it to the committee, any Government member in the past 20 years, but that is another matter - but specifically now as we are actually putting forward legislation.  I would love to hear the Government case in the context of an issue that has arisen.  Indeed, it is an issue that has always been asserted by the pro-life campaign, namely, that the Supreme Court decision in the X case does provide for abortion during the nine months of pregnancy.  It sounds like a horrendous and horrific proposition.  One must ask would the court, if it actually had to address the matter again, take that particular position in terms of its normative preference?  Who knows?  The actual normative preference, the way the court approached the issue of suicidal ideation in the X case is as follows: essentially, it stated that if a woman is suicidal in circumstances that the only solution is to terminate the life of the child, one terminates the life of the child.</p><p>  I refer the committee to the general principle stated by the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, in paragraph 36 of his judgment.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here and I thank the Joint Committee on Health and Children for its invitation to be a witness before the members today.  My interest in the legislation is as a constitutional lawyer who works on the institutions of Government, separation of powers and, in particular, on the relationship between national law and supernational or international law.  I am also keen to ensure, as we all are, that the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution are upheld and vindicated fully.  All of us come to this question from different perspectives with different professional expertise to offer as well as different personal experiences, but as a constitutional lawyer speaking to the members as legislators, our Constitution is our common ground and the starting point for this conversation and discussion today.</p><p>  It is a Constitution that is uncompromising in its defence of human life.  According to Articles 40.3.1<sup>o</sup>, 40.3.2<sup>o</sup>, 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>, 15.5.2<sup>o</sup> and 28.3.3<sup>o</sup>, the direct and intentional taking of a life is prohibited.  The Constitution prohibits the taking of innocent life but it also prohibits the taking of guilty life by banning the introduction of the death penalty in the strongest possible constitutional terms.  If we were to assess the compatibility of this legislation simply with the text of those articles of the Constitution, it would be very difficult not to conclude that head 4 is unconstitutional.  That is because it targets a specific subset of those who are guaranteed a right to life under the Constitution and makes the direct and intentional taking of their lives permissible under certain circumstances.  A court faced with that kind of scenario would apply a proportionality analysis, examining the legitimacy of the infringement on the right in question in the light of the rationality of the means chosen to pursue that infringement.  Head 4 would fail parts 2, 3, and 4 of the test for failing to choose a means that is rationally connected to the ends sought, for failing to impair the right as little as possible, and for being disproportionate to the ends.</p><p>  The genesis of head 4 is not to be found here in Leinster House but rather in the Four Courts in the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case.  In seeking to uphold the Supreme Court decision, head 4 succeeds in replicating the conditions of the test laid down in the X case.  Where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman which can only be averted by abortion, reading head 1 in conjunction with head 4, we find that human life can be ended at any time following implantation until such time as it has completely proceeded in a living state from the body of the woman. </p><p>  In its detail, the legislation is faithful to the test laid down by the X case.  It appears, however, not to be cognisant of the fact that there has been a development in the X case test in later cases that deal with suicidality. One of those is the 2006 case of Cosma <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice in which a woman sought that her deportation order be quashed on the grounds that if she were to be deported, she would commit suicide.  The Minister refused to allow her to stay even after he had seen two psychiatric reports that detailed the strong possibility that she would commit suicide, and the court upheld the Minister's decision.  In this case the High Court adopted and developed the test from the X case of real substantial risk to life in a decision that was not overturned by the Supreme Court.</p><p>  There are three important findings from that case to which I want to draw the members' attention.  The first is that the High Court held that the absence of a treatment plan for a presenting psychiatric condition and the fact that a person was not undergoing therapy for counselling are relevant factors in determining just how real is the real and substantial risk to life.  Second, the court held that the fact that a claimant has not seriously considered another option and has not considered removing the risk to life by treatment or by some other means is relevant to considering whether the risk can really only be averted by the means she prefers.  Third, the Minister, the Minister for Justice and Equality in this case, was entitled to take into consideration arguments of public policy.  He had argued very strongly in submissions that he should be allowed to take into account that &quot;to permit the threat of suicide to act as a stop on the execution of administrative decisions, such as deportation, would be to open a Pandora's box of potential abuse with possible effects of paralysing administrative activity in any given area of Government&quot;.</p><p>  On the basis of the Cosma decision's reading of the X<i></i>case test, head 4 would fail to meet the necessary standards because it basically violates those three findings that I mentioned.  It does not require evidence of a treatment plan, it does not require that there should be serious consideration of other means to end the risk to life, and it does not take into account, as the Minister had insisted we should, the arguments of public policy that would lead to an opening of a Pandora's box which would, ultimately, if carried to the extreme, undermine the rule of law.</p></speech>

It is 21 years since the Attorney General<i> v.</i> X was decided and it is useful to recall the order of the High Court.  That was restraining the first defendant from leaving the jurisdiction for a period of nine months or from procuring or arranging a termination of pregnancy or abortion either within or without the jurisdiction.  That was the order appealed from.  There had been an earlier <i>ex parte </i>order which resulted in X and her parents returning from London where they were arranging for the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  There has been a great deal of talk about the fact that there was no psychiatrist in the case.  There was what is described as a very experienced child psychologist whose evidence was of an extremely cogent kind, most strikingly as set forth in the judgment of the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay.  He had told the High Court that when he had interviewed the girl he wanted to have a continuing discussion with her parents but did not have anybody available to sit with her in his waiting room.  His view, on his past experience, of the risk of her committing  suicide was so real that however inappropriate it might have been he asked her to remain in the room while he discussed the problem with her parents.</p><p>  It is well also to recall that the judgment of the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, contained in a single, plain, unadorned but forceful paragraph, invokes the preamble to the Irish Constitution where it is stated:<blockquote>We, the people ... seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity [which Chief Justice Finlay emphasised], so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained ... Do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.</blockquote>In the passage leading into the formulation of the test the then Chief Mr. Justice Finlay, said the court must, among the matters to be so regarded, concern itself with the position of the mother within a family group, with persons on whom she is dependent, with, in other instances, persons who are dependent upon her and her interaction with other citizens and members of society in the areas in which her activities occur.  He went from that to formulate the test of a real and substantial risk to the life, rather than the health, of the mother.  That is how the then Chief Justice Mr. Justice Finlay, dealt with what he characterised as the intimate human problem of the right of the unborn to life and its relationship to the right of the mother of an unborn child to her life.</p><p>  Some pro-life advocates have strenuously denied that Attorney General <i>v.</i> X was correctly decided, particularly in extending the principle of a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother to suicide.  That is an argument which they are perfectly entitled to make.  However, I do not believe, and this separates me from Professor Binchy and Dr. Cahill, that a lawyer who believes that Attorney General <i>v.</i> X was wrongly decided can credibly or responsibly approach the question of the constitutional position in Ireland in relation to abortion on the basis of a denial that the decision of the Supreme Court in Attorney General <i>v.</i> X represents at the present time, until such time as it is departed from by the Supreme Court or there is a further amendment by referendum of the Constitution, an authoritative statement of the constitutional position.  This might seem a fine distinction but it is clear.  One is perfectly entitled to disagree with the judgment of the Supreme Court but that does not entitle a lawyer to deny that the law in Ireland is as expounded by the Supreme Court in Attorney General <i>v.</i> X, that is to say that the termination of the pregnancy is constitutionally permissible where it is established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life of a mother if the termination was not effected.  The obligation to accept that this is at the present time the constitutional position is something that is bound up with the sovereign, independent and democratic nature of this State.</p><p>  The decision of the Supreme Court in Attorney General <i>v.</i> X was affirmed in the clearest terms three years later in the reference to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Bill 1995.  That was the Bill that sought to prescribe the conditions under which information relating to services lawfully available in another State could be provided as contemplated by the fourteenth amendment.  In the single judgment of the Supreme Court given by the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hamilton, the judgments of the Supreme Court in Attorney General <i>v.</i> X, particularly that of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, are relied upon throughout.</p></speech>

The single judgment of the Supreme Court of the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hamilton, given on an Article 26 reference, specifically affirmed the correctness of the decision in the X case.  There has never been the slightest suggestion that the X case was wrongly decided.  Moreover the State has itself elected to rely on the X case in resisting challenges brought against it under the European Convention before the European Court of Human Rights.  This is particularly true with regard to the argument successfully advanced by the State in D <i>v</i>. Ireland that the applicant had failed to exhaust her domestic remedies.  This entailed the State arguing, as it did based on the opinion of counsel, that there was at least a tenable argument that a foetus suffering from a fatal abnormality was not an unborn for the purposes of Article 40.3.3&deg; or that even if it was an unborn, its right to life was not actually engaged as it had no prospect of life outside the womb.  Of course it goes further than this.</p><p>  Constitutional amendments which sought to exclude suicide were rejected by the people in 1992 and 2002.  In 1992 in rejecting the exclusion of a risk of suicide the people adopted the 13th amendment which provided that Article 40.3.3&deg; did not limit freedom to travel and the 14th amendment which provided it did not limit freedom to obtain or make available information relating to services lawfully available in another state.  The 13th and 14th amendments can be seen as responses by the people to the facts of the X case and to the judgments of the Supreme Court.  The judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case is to this extent not merely something that is established in law; it is woven into the fabric of modern Irish democratic politics.  The reason this is a point of importance which is necessary to emphasise is there is a concern, and the committee can see the reality of this concern from what we have just heard, that behind the argument, which I struggle to comprehend, that legislation of the character contemplated in the heads of the Bill is not necessary, lies a mute refusal to accept the position in Irish law as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Attorney General <i>v</i>. X and Others that the X case is part of the Irish constitutional <i>acquis</i>.</p><p>  There are several dicta in case law which illustrate the difficulty of leaving a lacuna in Irish legislation.  In A and B <i>v</i>. Eastern Health Board, District Judge Mary Fahy and C, Mr. Justice Geoghegan asserted it would be wrong to turn the High Court into some type of licensing authority for abortions.  In A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland the European Court of Human Rights held the court does not consider the constitutional courts are the appropriate fora for the primary determination as to whether a woman qualifies for an abortion which is lawful in a state.  In particular, this process would amount to requiring the constitutional court to set down on a case-by-case basis the legal criteria by which the relevant risk to a woman's life would be measured and further to resolve through evidence largely of a medical nature, whether a woman had established this qualifying risk.  The court went on to state it would be equally inappropriate to require women to take such complex constitutional proceedings when their underlying constitutional right to an abortion in the case of a qualifying risk to life is not disputable.</p><p>  I wish to comment on the heads of the Bill which will be dealt with in due course.  The scheme of the Bill is conceptually conservative.  It seeks to translate into legislation and give legislative effect to the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case without either widening the category in the X case or adding to the categories in the X case.  It might appear a Bill which is so conceptually conservative and so restrictive is of little consequence in that it does not add to what is already established by the X case.  I do not think this is right.  It is not simply that it introduces a scheme which gives effect to the rights established in the X case.  It is true we are obliged to legislate for the X case because of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland.  The introduction of the Bill seems to be none the less a momentous event in the sometimes turbulent journey of Irish statehood.  On the enactment of this legislation the rights enunciated by the Supreme Court are no longer external to, or divorced from, the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill achieves the repatriation of this fraught and deeply divisive question to where, subject to the Constitution, it primarily belongs.</p></speech>

I am very much honoured to be asked again to discuss the questions arising out of the heads of the Bill.  I noted in the letter the Chairman sent inviting me that witnesses were asked to discuss the actual heads of the Bill and go through them rather than go back over the same arguments we had the last time.  I am disappointed to find we are going through the same arguments about picking over the analysis of the X case.  As I made very clear the last time I was here, my strong belief is the decision in the X case is the law of the land and it is necessary to introduce legislation.</p><p>  Professor Binchy stated we have a range of options.  This comes a bit strangely from the mouth of someone who, since 1983, has been trying to reduce the range of options available to legislators to deal with the question of abortion by the very introduction of the amendment in 1983 which, for instance, means one cannot legislate for the question of what happens in the case of rape which is, according to present opinion polls, approved of by 75% of the Irish people, and which may indeed be more easily dealt with than the question of suicide, which is a complicated question, as I perfectly well acknowledge.</p><p>  We also see the point made by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and again by Dr. Binchy about the dangers of late abortion.  It brings the whole question of abortion into a human rights area.  Where one puts it into the Constitution one creates this question of constitutional rights of the unborn and the constitutional rights of the mother.  The arguments can be very readily made that one cannot put a time limit on constitutional rights and the Government is probably right in saying this.  Therefore, one cannot do what Dr. Martin suggests in the last line of his letter is done in other jurisdictions; one is not free to introduce a time limit.</p><p>  We must remember when we speak about a range of options that this range of options is dealt with by what happened in 1983 much more than merely the Supreme Court's interpretation of what happened in 1983 in the X case.  I should state when giving evidence here I am a member of the working group established by the standing committee of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland which has already made written submissions to the committee and I am in general agreement with these submissions.</p><p>  I appreciate and entirely agree with what Mr. Callanan stated about the legal interpretation of the X case and the fact it is the law of the land.  The Government is constitutionally constrained to bring forward this legislation, and in framing the general scheme of the legislation.  By and large I am in general support of the heads of the Bill as set out and it appears they are consonant with the provisions of the Constitution as interpreted in Attorney General <i>v</i>. X and Others.</p><p>  As I stated in my previous oral evidence, I see myself as expressing the middle ground in the debate which has surrounded the proposed legislation, and therefore I do not stand for either extreme side in the argument.</p></speech>

Since the Government has decided to legislate, that part of the debate is over.  However, the debate on whether the Oireachtas supports the legislation is not over.  For this reason, we as Oireachtas Members are trying to go through the legislation.</p><p>  I assume that no Government could present legislation to the Houses if the Attorney General advised that it was unconstitutional.  Experts on both sides can make their arguments, but we as Oireachtas Members must assume that, given the fact that the Bill has been presented to the Houses and in light of the Attorney General's role as the Government's legal officer, the legislation is at least constitutional.  Subsequently, we can argue in the abstract about the other issues.</p><p>  Some witnesses have stated that, under this legislation, the intentional destruction of the unborn could occur up until the time of birth.  They assert that the Bill will not vindicate the life of the unborn.  I am referring to intentional destruction as opposed to the termination of a pregnancy.  Is this not at variance with Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution?</p><p>  The issue of term limits has been mentioned.  In this context, we are discussing heads 2 to 4, inclusive, rather than just head 4.  Where a pregnant woman beyond a certain term quickly becomes sick, presenting a medical emergency, having a term limit would mean that her life could not be vindicated.  Will the witnesses elaborate on these issues?</p><p>  The broader substance of the matter has been debated and expert witnesses have appeared before the committee.  We cannot dismiss the fact that suicide in pregnancy is a real issue.  It has happened in rare circumstances and we must be conscious that this fact has been stated at our hearings.  While there may be varying opinions on the matter, most witnesses accept that it happens.  Whether a termination is a treatment for suicidality is the issue most in dispute.</p></speech>

Head 11 of the Bill removes freedom of information from the ambit of the proposed Bill.  Nobody proposes that individuals' names and addresses be mentioned in any official record keeping yet head 11 goes much further than that.  Bearing in mind the seriousness of what this Bill proposes, and the political and cultural struggle with matters of transparency, do the witnesses believe the breadth of what is proposed in head 11 is an unwelcome aspect of the Bill?  It also seeks for the law to provide a register of pro-life psychiatrists so that these persons would not be able to make abortion more difficult.  In the interests of equality, and bearing in mind the various procedural abuses recorded in the UK by pro-choice psychiatrists, should a register of pro-choice psychiatrists also be provided to ensure that access to abortion will not be widened in a way that would be contrary to the spirit and letter of the law?</p><p>  I have some questions for Professor Binchy.  Is there a definite constitutional obligation to legislate for every higher court decision?  Has the Oireachtas acted unconstitutionally for the past 20 years by not legislating for abortion on grounds of suicide?  Should the law affect section 21.1 of the Medical Council guidelines which require that due regard be given to clinical research in the area of psychiatry?  A person who is not suffering from a mental disorder as defined by the Mental Health Act 2001 cannot be forced to undergo any treatment against his or her will.  In light of the X case, which attested that termination of pregnancy should be the only means of averting the risk to the life of a mother, does it follow that abortion will become the only means available if the woman refuses all other interventions?</p></speech>

I have a question for all of them.  In recent days we have heard from some of the medical professionals, in particular some of the college obstetricians, about the amalgamation of heads 2 and 4 which would mean we would not differentiate between the health threats to a woman's life and would not distinguish between the threat from suicide or from a physical illness.  Late last night we heard from a cardiologist who said this will change matters for some of the patients he treats, and that no longer will women who suffer with life-threatening heart defects have to suffer the stress and stigma of having to go to the United Kingdom to have a termination,  He stated that things will be changed for the better for those women.  Is that something about which we should be cognisant?  Should we give serious consideration to amalgamating heads 2 and 4?</p><p>  I have a final question on criminalisation for which I seek some input.  The Bill stands to criminalise women and girls who procure abortions, for whom there would be a sentence of 14 years.  That has a chilling effect.  Medical personnel are also involved.  In reference to the Suicide Act, I have stated before that although a person who dies by suicide is not criminalised those who aid and abet the person are sanctioned.  Is that something we should replicate in this Bill?</p></speech>

My role as a legislator is to uphold the Constitution.  I refer to head 4.  Many legal debates occur about the X case but I am very conscious that it was about a 14 year old girl.  That is what we are discussing.  As Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness noted, it is about that human life.  In regard to head 4, to exclude suicidality is to change the law.  As Mr. Callanan stated, the people voted in referendums in 1992 and 2002.  In Article 40.3.3&deg;  no distinction is made.  The application of whatever is the threat to the life of the mother needs to be the same in all cases.  Should we merge heads 2 and 4 in order to ensure the application of the law is the same?</p><p>  Adding to Deputy Conway's question, I refer to head 19 and the scope of the offence, which is extremely broad.  It deals with the criminalisation of any act that has the intent to destroy human life.  We need to be clearer and more precise about the activities that would be covered and on this I ask for the opinion of the witnesses.</p></speech>

The answer on that point relates to the absolute constitutional imperative to preserve the right to life of the unborn, even in an X type situation, if the unborn is viable or on the cusp of viability.  The reason this is a matter of great public concern is the Irish abhorrence of regimes in other jurisdictions which are believed, rightly or wrongly, to permit abortion on demand.  The scheme of this legislation to give effect to a constitutional right is entirely different.  For that reason, I do not believe the inclusion of prescriptive time limits is called for.  Inclusion of such limits also opens up the unwelcome prospect of a constitutional challenge on the grounds that the legislation infringed the equal right to life of the mother as construed by the Supreme Court in the X case.</p><p>  Deputy McGrath raised the interesting question of whether the Oireachtas could be said to have been in breach of its obligations since 1992.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor William Binchy" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100024#Y00200"><p>The discussion has been very interesting and the questions that were raised have advanced the progress of the debate.  Both Deputy Kelleher and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the question of late abortions.  It is very interesting to listen to my colleagues who take a different point of view and who are here as experts today.  I hope I am not misrepresenting Mrs. Justice McGuinness or Mr. Callanan, but they seem to advocate no time limits.  That is what the Bill has - no time limits, right up to birth.  Indeed, Mr. Callanan said that if there were time limits, there could be a constitutional challenge to the legislation.  This is worth looking at because everybody agrees that in the late period of pregnancy, if some disastrous or life-threatening condition arises for the mother, the doctors must do everything they can.  This is not a point of disagreement; it is a point of complete agreement.  The doctors will do whatever is necessary and sometimes there will not be a safe delivery of that child.  Sometimes that child will die and that is absolutely, as it were, the way it has to be.  There is no dispute about that.  It is necessary, in that context, that term limits in this area continue right up to birth so as to allow doctors to intervene at all stages during the pregnancy in order to protect the life of the mother.  That is absolutely clear.</p><p>  However, Mrs. Justice Mc Guinness - I hope I am not misrepresenting her, and she will have the opportunity to clarify her position if I am - takes the view that the X case provides for the termination of pregnancy and, indeed, the termination of the life of the child at all stages during pregnancy.  That brings us back to the suicidal ideation situation, which is quite different.  It is not about removing the child from a danger zone, from the mother, but about terminating the life of the child.  That is what the suicide issue raises.  The mother says, in these circumstances, "If this child lives, I die."  Doctors in these circumstances are faced with a stark choice.  It does not matter how many obstetricians come in here and tell the committee that they will not terminate the life in such circumstances; if the law requires them to do so, subject to conscientious objection, they will have to do so.  They will have to do so, for example, at 20 weeks, it is agreed.  They will have to terminate the life of that child.  That is agreed, so the question is, how many weeks more will they have in which to terminate the life of the child?  I repeat - and this issue has not been answered by my colleagues here today or by the Government - that the basic principle of the X case decision is that suicidal ideation, on the basis of the very existence of the child, requires terminating the life of that child, not relocating the child.  It is important to get an answer from the Government on that particular point.  That is my primary response to the contributions today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria Cahill" time="12:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100024#Y00300"><p>I will start with the question posed by Deputy Kelleher on the constitutionality of the legislation.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that it is the duty of the Legislature, under Article 15.4, not to legislate in a manner that is incompatible with the Constitution.  It is not a duty of the Attorney General but of the Legislature itself.  None the less, there are two options provided under the Constitution whereby, if the Legislature fails in that duty, the legislation in question can be challenged, under Articles 26 and 34.  I am not a legislator so I do not start with the assumption that the Bill is constitutional.  Certainly, all of these issues can be raised.  I raised the Cosma decision to illustrate that what the Government is doing under head 4 is not compatible with what was done in the High Court in 2006.  That must be taken seriously in order to be sure that the Legislature wants, in this instance, to trust the advice given.</p><p>  On the question of late-term abortion, the Deputy is right that abortion fails to vindicate the right to life of the unborn under Article 40.3.3˚ in all circumstances, including pre-viability and post-viability.  I am sure the Deputy, and indeed most people, would like to prevent the possibility of late-term abortions or partial-birth abortions and that is also indicated in the explanatory notes.  However, when it comes to interpreting the section, the Supreme Court is not going to ask for the personal views of Deputies or look to the explanatory notes.  It will look to the text of the legislation as provided.  The text allows, under the definition in head 1, that an unborn is a person post-implantation until the moment that he or she has been successfully delivered from the mother's womb.  That is what we are dealing with as a matter of law.  I just wanted to make it clear that, as a matter of law, that is where we stand.  </p><p>  On the question posed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I am not calling into question the integrity of psychiatrists or the care that they would give.  What I am saying is that under head 4, there is no provision for an ongoing psychiatric relationship between the person who is being certified as suicidal and the professional who can help her with that suicidality.  Again, perhaps that is something that has been overlooked, but there is no provision in head 4 for an ongoing treatment plan or for ongoing counselling and care of that woman.  That is my concern as a woman and as a lawyer.</p><p>  Finally, I will refer to the human element, because it has been raised a number of times.  It just so happens that I am not much younger than the girl who was at the centre of the X case.  It was, in fact, the first time my parents had to explain to me both what had happened to her and what she wanted to do.  I am in no way impervious to the gravity of her situation and to the human element involved in her life and the lives of many other women in this country.</p></speech>

While I have held some legislation to be unconstitutional in my time, there is a very strong presumption that the courts should not be lightly arguing with the legislators.  We can take it that when the legislation is brought forward, it done so with the best legal advice that the Government feels it can obtain.</p><p>  On the question of term limits and the difficulty of introducing them, as I pointed out, once one starts bringing this into an argument about constitutionality, which basically is as a result of the insertion of the original amendment into the Constitution, it is that itself that is creating the problem about term limits.</p></speech>

Professor Binchy and Dr. Cahill expressed dissatisfaction with the X case judgment and referenced Cosma <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In the X case a psychologist report was produced while in the case of Cosma<i> v.</i> Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform there were two psychiatric reports produced.  The legislation we are discussing would necessitate three medical reports.  The argument is that by having legislation where there must be evidence from three experts, there is clarification of the issue.  Professor Binchy seems to be very concerned that the X case was a wrong judgment.  Is the argument not that there is nothing preventing the Supreme Court from getting it wrong again and even widening the interpretation of what was intended by Article 40.3.3&deg;?  Dr. Cahill states in the submission that the &quot;courts have determined, therefore, that a medical opinion on the existence of a real and substantial risk is not the same as legal determination of that criterion&quot; and that they are free to depart from the opinion of a medical expert.  Is that not more reason for legislation?</p><p>  I have raised a point with all the people who have come before us over the past two days.  This is the matter of people who are under 18 and the lack of any reference to them in the heads of the Bill.  In what way should that be clarified so as to deal with expectant mothers who are under 18?  If we go forward without legislation, there is a proposition for guidelines and regulations.  I asked the question this morning but it was not answered by those four people so will the witnesses tell me under what legislation can we bring in those guidelines and regulations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100025#Z00400"><p>I have long held the view that any woman who finds herself in a position with an unwanted pregnancy is in a difficult and dark place.  A woman with an unwanted pregnancy and with additional suicidal tendencies, I am sure we would agree, is in an even darker place.  That is the challenge for us as legislators, with all due respect to the people on my left, as well as the medical witnesses yesterday and the witnesses who attended on Friday.  As has previously been said, this does happen, although it may be rare.  Some of those who attended on Friday described the occurrences as very rare, which is a good and welcome fact.  Nevertheless, this is the reality and as legislators we must deal with it.</p><p>  I cannot get into all the arguments because of time constraints but one of the main reasons given for not introducing this proposed legislation is the terrible question of "floodgates".  The floodgates have been open since the mid 1960s, and the accumulated figure is shameful.  It takes in our neighbours and friends.  The floodgates have opened but we are not dealing with them.</p><p>  To paraphrase Mr. Callanan, he indicated that this was a "conservative" Bill.  I am one of the people who will vote on it and I see it as a very conservative Bill because it is dealing with a very restricted area.  That may change.  If, for the sake of argument, the legislation passes in July and if somebody finds themselves in a position of having an unwanted pregnancy with suicidal tendencies, do we really believe the person will go a GP, psychiatrist or get a draft of the Bill from a politician?  That person will not do so but she will travel to England instead.</p></speech>

The Supreme Court X case decision facilitates the introduction of abortion legislation but is there anything in the Constitution that makes the introduction of such legislation an obligation?  Does the definition of "reasonable opinion" in head 1 give significant weight to the duty of care towards the unborn and the equal right to life under the Constitution?  In the event of a later-stage termination being carried out under the legislation and where the child lives, will the child have a legal right to know the circumstances of his or her birth and the identity of his or her mother?  If a patient is a minor, suicidal and suffering mental health problems, how will she be able to give permission for an abortion in accordance with head 4?  Can a well-founded reasonable opinion as defined in head 1 be formed by a medical practitioner where a patient is suicidal but not suffering from any mental illnesses?  Will the proposed legislation create a legal precedent in making something legal that would otherwise be illegal merely because of the threat of suicide?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100026#AA00200"><p>I thank the speakers for their evidence.  I ask Mr. Callanan to comment on Dr. Cahill's evidence on the Cosma<i> v.</i> Minister for Justice case and give us his perspective on that.  Both Mr. Callanan and Mrs. Justice McGuinness have said the legislation before us is quite conservative and Professor Binchy made the point that the Supreme Court decision on the X case allows for the termination of the life of the unborn rather than terminating the pregnancy right up to term.  In light of that, does head 19 not restrict that right in that it makes it illegal to kill the unborn as set out in the legislation?  If so, is it the case that the legislation before us does not go far enough and could be unconstitutional on that basis?  If the legislation, as it is framed, does not provide for late terminations on the grounds of suicide, does that raise constitutional issues regarding the ability of a woman to avail of the legislation and does it raise issues for the decision of the European Court of Human Rights?  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of guidelines and regulations without primary legislation.  Would that not facilitate a mechanism of regulatory creep regarding what is allowed depending on the Minister of the day?  Could someone clarify that for me?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100026#AA00300"><p>I thank in particular to Mr. Callanan and Mrs. Justice McGuinness for their comments on head 19.  I share their concerns about the over-broad drafting of that criminal offence.  Could I ask them both specific questions about this Bill being conceptually conservative, in particular in head 1 in respect of two definitions?  I agreed with Mrs. Justice McGuinness when she said she regretted that the proposed legislation does not exclude a situation where a foetus is already dead or has no capacity for life outside the womb.  In that instance it seems overly conservatively drafted compared to Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution and it should at least exclude that situation.  Also under head 1, the definition of &quot;reasonable opinion&quot; is probably too conservative in that it makes no reference to the right to life of the pregnant woman, only to the need to preserve unborn life.  Some balance is required there.</p><p>  I am amazed to hear Dr. Cahill suggest the Cosma <i>v</i>. Minister for Justice case is in any way relevant to an interpretation of the X case.  Cosma was a 2006 decision of the High Court in the context of deportation proceedings in which the High Court did not accept that the evidence established a risk of suicide.  I utterly refute the suggestion that it is relevant to an interpretation of the X case.  Professor Binchy raised the issue of time limits, and that was dealt with very clearly in Friday's hearings.  Mr. Callanan's submission points out that when a foetus is viable, or on the cusp of viability, it is constitutionally mandatory that every effort must be made to protect the life of the unborn.  That is very clear and it is current clinical practice.</p><p>  I have a final question for Professor Binchy.  As one of those responsible for drafting Article 40.3.3&deg;, the amendment from which this derived, does he not accept that the amendment was flawed?  In 1983 Mary Robinson and others predicted that a case like the X case would arise and that ultimately we would be left with a situation where this matter is in the Constitution, where it does not belong, and the Legislature is therefore, as Mrs. Justice McGuinness has said, utterly constrained in its ability for legislate for the real needs of the thousands of Irish women who are travelling abroad every year for abortion, as Deputy Maloney has said.</p><p>  Under head 4, do Professor Binchy and Dr. Cahill have any compassion for or trust in the young women and girls who are actually going to be affected by this, in particular the girls who are unable to travel because they are in the care of the HSE?  It was accepted in yesterday's evidence that these are the real people who will be affected because any other woman is going to travel rather than put herself through these utterly restrictive procedures.  Do they have any compassion for those girls or trust in them and their psychiatrists?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100026#AA00400"><p>From a legal perspective, if the Oireachtas were to pass legislation providing clinicians with full legal clarity, excluding suicide - by which I mean not prescribing for suicide but leaving it as case law - is it possible the Supreme Court could deem it to be in line with Article 40.3.3&deg; having regard to the up-to-date evidence from the psychiatric profession?  Former Chief Justice Cearbhall O'D&aacute;laigh said a point not argued is a point not decided, and this doctrine goes for constitutional cases.  Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, the best Chief Justice we never had, according to Dr. Cahill, said therefore the court decision can only bind the particular case as it was based on the conceded and unargued construction.  The Government is arguing that women are currently entitled to abortion under the X case, so it is obviously not taking that position, and that it is only codifying the law, which is currently allowed.  Is the Government correct in that presumption?</p><p>  The unborn has, <i>inter alia</i>, a constitutional right, the equal right to life.  Head 4 deals with suicide.  All the evidence before us from the psychiatric and medical professions is that it is very difficult to predict suicide.  The heads allow for a review where abortion is refused and that review is confined to the mother making the application for the review.  Given the equal constitutional right of the unborn to life, is the constitutional right of the child not entitled to advocacy in that scenario, or are we in fact depriving the child of its constitutional right by allowing for no advocacy on behalf of that child in that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100026#AA00500"><p>I take the points made by Senator Colm Burke.  One leaves it open for the Supreme Court to get it wrong again if one argues that the Supreme Court was wrong in the first place.  This seems like quite a logical argument but it is unforeseeable and that is one of the reasons legislation is necessary.  Otherwise one is leaving it as it is.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly said it does not want this to be left in its hands to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  This also refers to what Senator Walsh said, that a point not argued is a point not decided.  This is one of the difficulties about saying the Supreme Court decided abortion could take place right up to the end of the pregnancy.  Those were not the facts before the Supreme Court, and courts really do decide on the facts and the cases before them.  While it may be inferred that the Supreme Court meant that if it had been asked that at the time it may not have agreed to that at all.  This whole argument that the Supreme Court had decided that one could have a termination right up to the ninth month is unrealistic in a sense.  It is also clear from the medical evidence before the committee that cases would be dealt with in a way that would preserve the life of the child in so far as that was possible at all.</p><p>  I appreciate what Deputy Maloney said.  It seems to me too that the gateway and referral path put up in head 4 is so complicated and lengthy that the likelihood is that anyone who has the means and the understanding to be able to go abroad, will go abroad.  On the other hand, as was mentioned, we are probably dealing with the case of the under-18s and we need something more about that in the legislation.  We also need to deal with the area of people who have not got proper capacity to consent to medical procedures of any kind and that should be dealt with by the enactment of the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill, which is being prepared by the Department of Justice and Equality and was produced by the Law Reform Commission, if I may refer to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maria Cahill" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100027#BB00200"><p>To start with something that must not have been clear in my presentation, I am not saying that the X case is a flawed decision.  I am saying it is a non-decision on the question of whether suicidality can be treated by abortion.  The court did not hear arguments on that point and it did not make a decision on that point.  I am not saying it made a mistake; I am saying it did not decide.  That is the first point.</p><p>  I thank Senator Colm Burke and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for taking the time to look at the written submission as well as my oral comments, and for the question that Senator Colm Burke raised on the reasonable opinion of the psychiatrist.  Now, with the heads of Bill, the Minister is adding in three medical experts.  What I want to draw to the attention of the committee is that in the X case the expert, who in this situation was the psychologist, stated that he would not leave that girl alone and the court decided the opposite, that she should have an abortion.  In the Cosma decision, the two psychiatric reports stated there was a strong possibility this woman would committ suicide and the court disagreed, stating it thought the real and substantial risk to her life had not been established.  What happened there on both occasions is that the court has found the opposite of what the expert has found.  One matter on which one must be careful in the definition of reasonable opinion is the fact that the legal test laid down in the X case was to be determined at law whereas in the heads of Bill one is only determining that as a medical question which means that there is also a constitutional vulnerability and a professional vulnerability for psychiatrists who would make determinations of that kind.  I thank them for raising that.</p><p>  I did not discern a question from Deputy Eamonn Maloney for me.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked is there an obligation to legislate.  To take it back to the start, what the Constitution does is give Members an enormous privilege.  One of the matters that this debate is about is the role of the Oireachtas.  It gives Members an enormous privilege to legislate.  What the Oireachtas is bound to do is legislate within the terms of the Constitution.  Sometimes what comes up in the rhetoric is that the Oireachtas is bound to legislate for the X case, even though the X case, as I stated, did not decide the question of whether suicidality could be treated by abortion, and the Oireachtas is bound to decide by reference to the two referenda that were failed.  The Oireachtas is not obliged to legislate for what the people did not put into the Constitution.  What the Oireachtas is given is the possibility and the constraint that is on the Oireachtas,is the Constitution, and fundamental to that constraint in this situation is Article 40.3.3&deg;.</p><p>  On Senator Bacik's questions, of course, I am not saying that the Cosma decision is of relevance to the X case because that would be time-travelling.  On the other hand, in the High Court, Mr. Justice Hanna, in the Cosma decision, decided that the X case was highly relevant to his determination.  He used it verbatim.  He analysed the different elements of the X case test very rigorously.  What I am saying is that the Cosma decision has built on the X case and now it is relevant as the Oireachtas goes forward to legislating in respect of the heads of this Bill.</p><p>  Finally, on the question of what is my concern about children under head 4, I think everybody under head 4 is vulnerable.  All of those who will come under head 4 will be vulnerable persons.  We should be concerned about all of them, both over 18 and under 18.</p><p>  On the last question on advocacy rights,-----</p></speech>

We have the privilege here of having with us a former Supreme Court judge, who was in the courts for many years and on the Supreme Court for a number of those years.  It is worth examining what she said on the question of late abortions because the Government has said nothing other than that there is no problem.  Let us examine what Mrs. Justice McGuinness has said in order to enlighten us in terms of the analysis here.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated that she was confident that doctors would do the right thing.  As I say, obstetricians would wish to do the right thing but if legislation constrains them to carry out an abortion in circumstances where they do not wish to do so, their only strategy in those circumstances is conscientious objection.</p><p>  Mrs. Justice McGuinness also stated we are not dealing with a kind of legal concept.  Sadly, that is exactly what we are dealing with.  We certainly are dealing with a legal concept.  The legal concept in question here is the legislation which allows for abortion from the very beginning of implantation up to birth.  We are dealing with a legal concept.  What is striking is that neither of my two colleagues here who are advocating in favour of the legislation have presented any argument that, in fact, the legislation does not embrace the termination, which means the intentional termination, of the unborn child in the latter stages of pregnancy based on suicidal ideation where the mother says the very existence of this child is intolerable for her.  This is a crucial question and it is interesting that the two speakers who have come along to advocate for the Bill have, as it were, supported our analysis as lawyers rather than contradicted it in any coherent way.  I think that is a fair point.</p><p>  On that issue, I would like to say - because my remarks have been, perhaps, a little concentrated in that area - we are not in favour of time limits.  Time limits is absolutely the wrong way to go.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness more or less made the argument it is unfortunate we have to start here because it is all the fault of the original pro-life amendment.  I would suggest that, perhaps, the difficulty lies in the Supreme Court decision, but we have to start here.  We very definitely have to start here.</p><p>  The question is: do we implement the Supreme Court decision which allows for abortion throughout pregnancy or do we take a different course of action?  In the light of the changed information - the 21 years of scientific experience so that we can test that particular issue - the Legislature is perfectly entitled and would be very well-advised to take a different course.  The Constitution does not require the Legislature to implement the X decision.  It has a range of strategies.</p><p>  The common ground here is that all necessary medical treatment should be given to women during pregnancy.  That is not a question of contest.  The contest is on the suicidal ideation issue.</p><p>  On the suicidal ideation issue, we have had support today, rather than contradiction, to the proposition that the opponents of the Bill have put forward, which is, that this allows for suicidal ideation being a ground for termination, not only of pregnancy but of the life of the unborn during the currency of the pregnancy.  That is a startling proposition but, nonetheless, it is a legal concept.  With respect to Mrs. Justice McGuinness, it is one that the legislators have to contemplate and, I would respectfully say, they should decline to implement that type of legislation.</p></speech>

There is a constant thread from one argument - that we do not need to enact legislation and that we could do exactly what the Supreme Court wanted us to do by use of regulation.  From a lay person's point of view, can the witnesses explain what the difference is with regard to the Constitution?  If we actually enshrined a woman's eligibility for a termination in regulation, as against enshrining it in law, what difference does that make under the Constitution today, if any?  Perhaps it does not make any difference.</p></speech>

There has been a spectrum of opinions.  I live by consensus medical opinions and the development of evidence-based medical guidelines, and we have not had it.  The thing that is most extraordinary to me is that two people who have come here today as constitutional lawyers, can in their submissions and writings discuss this issue and never mention the fact that we have had two referenda.</p><p>  In 1992, the question that was put to the people in a referendum was utterly clear cut.  It was: do we exclude suicide or not?  The answer was utterly clear cut - it was two to one.  There was no ambiguity about this. </p><p>  In 2002, in a highly nuanced and more controversial and complicated referendum proposition, which included other issues, the decision was closer but it was still carried by the people.  I would like to know by what authority do those who believe we should thumb our noses at the Constitution of this land, think we should act in contravention of the Constitution, in excluding suicide from a Bill where we have been mandated by the highest definitive court in the land, and twice by the people, not to exclude it?</p></speech>

Clarity and, indeed, that right of appeal that I mentioned, can both be provided without any legislation simply by a ministerial non-statutory scheme - for example, by the Medical Council, with as much detail as anybody would want.  I again stress the fact that this legislation has not an ounce or iota of detail in terms of specificity or in terms of medical treatment.  Therefore that can be done.  It would also be perfectly possible for legislation, a facilitating Act, to be passed providing that the Minister for Health shall make regulations dealing with safety considerations during maternal pregnancy and some greater specificity in terms of what the Minister does concerning guidance regarding best practice.</p><p>  Picking up on what Senator Crown said about best practice, it is guided by consensus but also open to new medicine as well as established old medicine.

This appears to me to be not entirely in sync with what the Constitution requires.  In response to Senator Crown, I repeat my statement about the X case, which was not that it was a flawed decision but that it was a non-decision.  Moreover, for that I am relying on a Supreme Court decision.  It should be borne in mind that the precedential value of court decisions is not determined by the Senator, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health but by the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has held that if a point is conceded, the precedential value of that case is vanished.  The Supreme Court in 1965 has provided an answer to what has happened in the X case.  It has stated that when the argument is conceded, the precedential value has disappeared to vanishing point.  The person on whom I am relying and who first made that argument is a person with 29 years' experience on the Supreme Court.  Consequently, I believe we can take what he says seriously.</p><p>  On the point of referendums, I have heard the Senator making this argument many times and have been answering him on the television at home-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100029#DD01400"><p>The main question asked here is about regulation.  One cannot approach the matter by regulation alone, because to be enforceable and to be part of the law, regulation must stem from another item of legislation.  There must be a clause giving the Minister power to make regulations and the law is such that with regard to any act under that, the regulation must be within the power the Minister has been given by legislation.  One can have a whole set of beautiful regulations but they are not, as it were, enforceable.  They are mere guidance principles and while guidance principles are fine and lovely, had members listened over these many days to the arguments on both sides in this case, they surely would realise the task of someone setting out consensual guidance principles would be extremely difficult, because there is no consensus.  There does not appear to be consensus at any level.</p><p>  I must add that I think Dr. Cahill is entirely misinterpreting what was said by the clinical psychologist in the X case, when he stated he would not leave that girl alone, by which he meant the girl might commit suicide, were she left alone.  Moreover, the Supreme Court's decision was to let her go with the consent and in the bosom of her family, with her father and mother and not alone, to England.  This was a family decision and not akin to throwing the girl out of the window.</p></speech>

We now move to the time allocated to non-members of the joint committee.  There are 30 minutes and again I ask Members to be brief and to ask questions on the heads of the Bill, as that would facilitate more than the norm getting in.  I will start with Senator Mullen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1146" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100029#DD01600"><p>Perhaps the experts would all agree with me that it probably is unfair to challenge an expert, given the pressure of time here, for allegedly ignoring the human element.  Perhaps even Mrs. Justice McGuinness would agree with me that precise distinctions of law must be made sometimes to ensure the law is an instrument of compassion and not one of injustice, as that is what is at stake here.</p><p>  On the housekeeping question I have asked of all witnesses, I note this morning Deputy Durkan raised the bizarre proposition that lawyers might sometimes be coloured by their personal opinions.  I acknowledge that in his submission, Mr. Callanan mentioned he is a trustee of the Fine Gael Party and Professor Binchy has mentioned his long association with the Pro Life Campaign.  However, purely as a matter of housekeeping, may I ask whether any witnesses present were consulted in the wake of the expert group report, in the context of the preparation of these heads of legislation?  Ought they, in the spirit of full disclosure, declare whether they have any party, political or past or present campaign or lobby group affiliation?  This is not to judge anyone but simply to allow members to consider everything in the round.</p><p>  Has Mr. Callanan misunderstood what Dr. Cahill is saying in respect of the Cosma case?  As I understood it, she was not saying it subtracted from the X case decision or the real and substantial risk test but rather, that it specified, as it were, an interpretive key that must now be used and that what she had to say about the Cosma decision raises implications for Mr. Callanan's analysis of the heads of this Bill, in that they are not sufficiently specific in terms of establishing whether a person meets the real and substantial risk criterion.  Perhaps he might comment on this point.  A real issue that has emerged today, as in previous days, is the huge difference of opinion among eminent people.  In particular, it appears that the law is changing in one respect, in that the law of unforeseen consequences may apply in respect of the question of term limits and members may indeed be looking at a case in the future where this legislation could be challenged.  I have not heard that proposition challenged but I invite Professor Binchy to comment briefly on Mr. Callanan's submission, both at page 3 and page 6, where, in respect of the former, he suggests the Supreme Court in 1996, in the Article 26 reference, did dispose of the argument that X was not properly decided by reference to the fact that medical issues were not fully canvassed.  Is this a different question from stating it was not fully decided, in the sense expressed by Dr. Cahill?</p></speech>

This is a reference to the Strasbourg court decision.</p></speech>

I believe it is worth considering Dr. Maria Cahill's analysis of the reason the Bill might be unconstitutional.  Members have heard warnings in the past and this possibility is worth considering.  The evidence about the lack of a treatment plan is particularly relevant.</p></speech>

After all, this is what the joint committee has been asked to do, namely, to offer such clarity to the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>  I also have difficulties with head 19, which I consider to be overly stringent with regard to criminalising the woman.  In particular, I wish to raise the issue of time limits.  Yesterday, Dr. Peadar O'Grady stated that eight to nine weeks was the critical or best time to intervene in a pregnancy.  As the witnesses are aware, this Bill introduces no time limits.  This next question is addressed to Mrs. Justice McGuinness because she has asked members to look at it from a human point of view, which I am doing.</p></speech>

I wish to make an aside which I consider relevant.  Professor Binchy mentioned the adoption referendum of 1979, which was necessary and was passed overwhelmingly.  On the same day, the people voted to extend the Seanad voting rights to allow additional people to vote in Seanad elections.  That was 34 years ago and we have not legislated for that particular proposal.  Others now have an idea of legislating for another future for the Seanad.</p></speech>

We like to be in a comfort zone politically.  I certainly do.  One likes to believe that one is doing something because one has to do it.  That brings me back to the central divide between the witnesses before us now and the earlier witnesses on whether we are obliged to legislate.  We can produce tomes and have legal presentations but it requires a "Yes" or "No" response to the question of whether we are obliged to legislate.  I direct my question to Mr. Callanan and Professor Binchy.  Could they indicate "Yes" or "No", not whether it is right or preferable, not the reasons for either position, but whether we are obliged to legislate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.558" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100030#EE00500"><p>I wish to refer to two areas and I do not wish to rehash what has been said.  In the previous session Mr. Paul Brady strayed into the area of constitutional law.  He made particular reference to the suicide grounds in the X judgment.  Dr. Cahill made reference to it in her report.  I will ask Dr. Cahill specifically and Mrs. Justice McGuinness as well to respond to me.  If the suicide ground was conceded in the X case and was not argued and therefore is not binding other than on the specific facts of the X judgment itself, is that currently the legal position following on from the 1965 judgment to which Dr. Cahill referred in her presentation?  If it has not been argued before the court, is it binding and is it correct that we should put an elaborate arrangement in the legislation, with 95% of which Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas agree?  The central issue is head 4.  Should we build such an elaborate mechanism if the decision in the X case on that specific area is not binding?</p><p>  My final question is specifically for Mrs. Justice McGuinness, whom I have observed for years.  I was present in January for the three days of hearings and I have been present for virtually all of the current three days of the hearings also.  She was asked directly in January about the question of fatal foetal abnormalities.  I remember it distinctly and it stuck in my mind that she said to legislate would be unconstitutional.  Perhaps I misheard her earlier.  I have an infection at the moment which is affecting my hearing but I think she said that she regretted that the heads of the Bill do not include a provision to deal with the case of fatal foetal abnormalities.  Perhaps I misunderstood or she was expressing the wish that the constitutional provision would be amended.  Could she clarify the position please?</p></speech>

I wish to inquire about head 12 which relates to conscientious objection.  Reference has been made to patients, doctors and midwives being allowed a conscientious objection, but does an institution have a right to conscientious objection, as endorsed by the Council of Europe?  Should head 12(3) be removed?  Could the witnesses indicate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; response?</p><p>  Is there a definite constitutional obligation to legislate for every decision of a higher court?  Deputy Mattie McGrath asked a question which was not answered yet by the panel on whether the Oireachtas has acted unconstitutionally for the past 20 years by not legislating for abortion on the grounds of suicide.</p><p>  My final question is for Dr. Cahill.  Could she explain why we are not compelled to legislate for the X case?  Why does she think we have been told repeatedly that we must do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1104" speakername="Billy Timmins" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100030#EE00700"><p>I respect the expertise of our witnesses and their ability to cross-reference other experts.  Time and again we have heard the claim that abortion is not a treatment for suicide.  Everyone, including the medical experts, are weary of it.  Could Mr. Callanan clarify, if we enact head 4, whether we are creating abortion as a treatment or measure to deal with suicidal intent?  Could he also comment on Dr. Cahill&rsquo;s point that if we are to legislate for the X case, we are legislating in defiance of science?</p><p>  I wish to address two questions to Mrs. Justice McGuinness.  It is unique that we have someone who has served for such a long period in the Supreme Court.  I would like to get her general view on which she touched in her contribution about the concept of the intent of the Legislature and the literal meaning of the legislation.  In Britain they call it the golden rule and the mischief rule.  What is her view on the Supreme Court decision of 1992?  Does she believe it interpreted the intent of the Legislature at that time or did it go along with the literal meaning?</p><p>  In her contribution she also mentioned opinion polls and lobbying.  It is important to point out that relying on opinion polls on social issues can be most unreliable.  In the children&rsquo;s referendum the poll was on 10 November.  In a Red C poll of 19 October, 91% of people said they would vote but only 33.5% did.</p></speech>

The Red C poll stated that 4% would vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; while on the day 42% voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness also referred to lobbying individual Members of the Oireachtas.  I can only speak for myself but in so far as I was lobbied, I have been lobbied by those who are in favour of the legislation to a far greater extent than those who are against it.  I can only speak for myself.  I did not get elected to respond to lobbyists or to represent the will of the people.  I got elected to do what I believe is right in the common good, as did most Members.  I do not wish the myth to develop that some people might be responding to lobbying.  I certainly am not.</p></speech>

It relates to the possible need to include some enhancement for the legislation.  I refer in particular to a clear pathway to an assessment.  Given the basis of the European Court of Human Right&rsquo;s criticism of us was that we failed to provide such a path, that the legislation provides that the path will be established by specialists, and that the only way to a specialist assessment is by referral from a GP, who if one likes are the gatekeepers to specialist treatment, unless one is admitted to an accident and emergency unit; it seems that the legislation should be at pains to provide a clear path out of the GP&rsquo;s surgery and how one establishes the right to eligibility.  More importantly, there should be a clear timescale.  There is clarity on a timescale, what happens and how it happens when one is making an appeal, but there is not clarity when one is trying to access the system.</p><p>  I have concerns under both heads 2 and 3.  In the case of head 2, the woman has no role until the very end.</p></speech>

With regard to the question from Senator Mullen, which is trying to flush out whether we have any dire back-up here, I do not belong to any group of any kind on this.  I have already made it clear in my initial statement that I am a member of the Church of Ireland and was part of its working group to frame its statement on this, which clearly takes the middle ground in saying it is very much opposed to abortion but accepts there are cases of strict medical and other necessity in which it may occur.  Members all received that submission.</p><p>  Perhaps I should, to make clear what my position might be to Senator Mullen, repeat what was stated by the standing committee of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland in 1983:<blockquote>In our opinion a proposed amendment to the Constitution and a referendum will not alter the human situation as it exists in this country, contribute to its amelioration or propose a responsible and informed attitude to the issue of abortion.  We gravely doubt the wisdom of using constitutional prohibitions as a means of dealing with complex moral and social problems.</blockquote>I still agree with what was said in 1983 but we must deal with what we have now.  That is my background for Senator Mullen, but I have no political background.  He has a religious background as well.</p></speech>

Senator Healy-Eames asked if we can satisfy the A, B and C <i>v.</i> Ireland judgment without head 4 or the Supreme Court decision in X and I do not think we can.  Is it unconstitutional to introduce time limits?  Perhaps the Oireachtas should try it and see if it is ruled unconstitutional.  It might be something the Oireachtas could consider but, as things stand, it is difficult.  The Government probably does not want to introduce new difficulties that are going to make constitutional challenges practically a certainty but it might be worth a go.<br /> I entirely agree with Dr. Binchy that it is possible to change everything by referendum.  Perhaps the reason we feel wary of the idea of a referendum is the level of virtually abusive lobbying that goes on every time there is a referendum and every time this issue comes up.  Perhaps we should be looking at the psychological care of the various, particularly Fine Gael Deputies, who have been subjected to this kind of lobbying.  Perhaps they are the ones who should be looking for psychological care.</p></speech>

It has acted neglectfully in not bringing in legislation but that was not unconstitutional.  It is free not to legislate.  The situation changed, however, after the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case and because the present Government decided it was time to bite the bullet.</p><p>  Was X in accordance with the intent of the legislation?  That does not arise because there was no legislation at the time.  The Supreme Court was only looking the Constitution, not the legislation and therefore could not refer to it.</p><p>  We should improve the pathways to treatment and the fact many of the people who will be involved in these procedures, apart from the emergency situation, but particularly under head 4, are those who have little money and cannot avail of the services offered abroad.  They are often, as shown in Dr. McCarthy's evidence, involved in the drugs scene, young and unmarried.  Those people might not have a GP.</p></speech>

The answer to this question is to be found in rule 6 of the rules of the Committee of Ministers for the supervision of the execution of judgments and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the terms of friendly settlement.  Countries are supposed to legislate to prevent the recurrence of the breach which gave rise to the violation that was found in the relevant judgment.  In that circumstance, one is dealing with a woman, applicant C in the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland decision, who discerned herself, by means of a Google search, that there was a risk to her life and wanted to have this risk recognised.  It was a physical, medical risk to her life and does not, therefore, come under head 4.  For this reason, it would be possible under the legislation to remove that head and still be in conformity with what the European Court of Human Rights decided.  In general, as was reiterated on 10 April this year, the principle that the Committee of Ministers uses is the principle of subsidiarity under which a member state should choose how it wants to become compliant with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights.  To respond to Deputy John Paul Phelan, that is the Supreme Court decision on the X case.</p><p>  Deputy Terence Flanagan asked whether the Oireachtas had been acting unconstitutionally for all these years.  I agree with Mrs. Justice McGuinness that is not the case.  On the constitutional obligation to legislate for every Supreme Court decision, there are several Supreme Court decisions, for example, the<i> re </i>a ward of court case, the P.K.U. test case, the Ryan <i>v</i>. the Attorney General case and the Kennedy case, where the Oireachtas has not legislated for the rights that were recognised.  It cannot be said, therefore, that there is a constitutional obligation to legislate for every decision or right that has been recognised. </p><p>  I ask myself if I dare to restate my position on the X case.  My position is that the court did not determine the question of whether suicidality could be treated by abortion and, therefore, suicidality is not part of the judgment of the court.  I do not know why Members of the Oireachtas have been told so often that it is necessary to legislate.  That view must be based on non-legal considerations. </p></speech>

The basic question was whether we should legislate.  I compliment Mrs. Justice McGuinness on her open and honest contribution.  We should listen closely to what this former Supreme Court judge stated because she essentially confirms the argument being made by this side of the argument, namely, that legislation is not necessary and that the Legislature has not been in breach of the Constitution since 1992 in not legislating.  I suggest that to legislate now on the basis of the X decision, which was based on absolutely discredited medical and scientific evidence, would be wrong.</p><p>  When one considers the totality of the contributions of the speakers today, they support the argument we have been making.  They have been met by silence from the Government, except for one rhetorical statement that nothing has changed and one need not worry.  We have put the argument that this legislation extends throughout pregnancy and Mrs. Justice McGuinness has not contradicted that position.  It is interesting to show the dilemma in which the Government finds itself if it is seeking to legislate in accordance with the X case.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated that, in the term limit area, the Oireachtas might consider "having a go" - that was the expression she used - at putting forward legislation with term limits and see how it goes with the Supreme Court.  I suggest a more radical course of action, namely, Members should have a go and, if they believe it is appropriate, introduce legislation dealing with the medical matters.  These are matters of no dispute in the country and the Bill, as it is addressed in heads 2 and 3, does not give any specificity in regard to medical matters.  These are areas of complete non-controversy.  The single area of controversy is the suicidal ideation ground in head 4.  In this context, to introduce that legislation would be a complete abnegation of the responsibility of the Legislature to protect the lives of human beings in this country.  This is an important point.  In recent years, the issue of principle has been one that has come before Members.  It is of great significance but that does not mean abortion is the most important issue in the world - of course that is not the case.  There are many issues of social justice that are hugely pressing.  However, underlying this proposed legislation is a principle which contradicts the fundamental basis on which the Constitution is based, namely, respect for every human being. </p></speech>

On Cosma<i> v.</i> the Minister for Justice and Equality about which a question was asked, that is for an entirely different statutory purpose as it is an application of the Attorney General and X judgment.  It is very difficult to see how an application could somehow retroactively modify the judgment that was being applied.</p><p>  As to whether there is an obligation to legislate for X, the short answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  It is true that the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case did not specifically state that legislation was required but it is difficult ti see what else arises in an Irish context.  If one wants to think about regulation, one is looking, as Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated, at some sort of enabling legislation, followed presumably by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, making regulations.  I imagine it would lead to political uproar if the enabling legislation was passed and it would be subject to a different set of constitutional objections.</p><p>  In the Tysi<b><font color="#444444">ą</font></b>c <i>v</i>. Poland judgment - in case this is where Professor Binchy is suggesting we should be going - the attempt by the Polish Government to rely on pure medical regulation or whatever guidelines were in place for the organisation representing the medical profession was a failure. </p></speech>

I know the members of the committee have heard a great deal in the past few days and I do not propose to delay them unnecessarily with what I have to say.  Over the next few minutes I will give a very brief outline from an ethical-legal perspective in respect of the heads of the Bill.  I will begin with the ethical issues, moving on then very briefly to the legal considerations that necessarily arise.  I will then synthesise them regarding some general comments I wish to make in respect of the heads of the Bill.</p><p>  As the Medical Council has made clear, good medical practice depends upon a relationship of trust between the profession and society at large.  That requires the highest standards of professional practice and behaviour.  That is the expression the council uses in its guidance.  At the heart of this are the concepts of honesty, responsibility and accountability.  To fulfil the duty the council defines for doctors requires that doctors seek the highest standards regarding their practice.  A failure to meet those highest standards will attract opprobrium.  It may either amount to professional misconduct on what they call failing below the reasonable standard test or indeed it may also amount to poor professional performance.  However, that is a bit academic.  At the heart of this is a requirement that proper professional standards be met and a failure to meet those standards is one that will result in certain sanctions, the nature of which do not actually concern us this afternoon.</p><p>  At the heart of this is something simple - the safety of the public.  It is about assuring that individuals receive the quality of care they deserve on the one hand.  It is also about assuring that one can ensure that when that care is being delivered it is being delivered safely.  I want to demonstrate that it is really not about matters of simple independent opinion.  In other words there are objective standards that must be applied.  Lest it be considered that this is simply an ethical matter which is of concern, in our legal order this is also given certain force.  In so far as the law of tort is concerned, it used to be dealt with in the context of whether one followed, adhered to or subscribed to a general and approved practice, in other words one which was followed by a responsible, reputable or respectable body of professional opinion.  That was the classical test and the classical formulation.</p><p>  That seems to have undergone something of a transformation, particularly in recent years.  I wish to reference two particular instances where this has occurred.  The first was the case HM <i>v</i>. the HSE and a decision of Mr. Justice Charleton from July 2011.  The case is significant because it actually incorporates evidence-based professional guidance into the appropriate standard of care.  It is almost a reflex of incorporation and is virtually a definition of equipollence or equal power as between professional guidance which is evidence based on the one hand and then also the standard of care in so far as the law of negligence is concerned.  That seemed to represent something of a shift in so far as the courts are concerned from this deference to clinicians in terms of what is or is not appropriate.  That is hardly surprising given that over the past 25 years there have been very significant shifts in terms of evidence-based practice in general.</p><p>  A further issue has also arisen.  In its decision in the case of Kearney <i>v.</i> McQuillan, the Supreme Court went further in stating that health care professionals owe and always have owed a duty to patients to protect their constitutional rights.  This in so far as our legal order is concerned has been elevated to a significantly higher level as well.</p><p>  There is a question of an affirmative duty - an affirmative duty on the one hand which is imposed by the proper practice of medicine and secondly an affirmative duty which is then reflected in terms of what the courts have found and in particular the decision of the Supreme Court in the past 12 months or so.</p><p>  Underscoring all of these it seems there is a requirement for some evidence in terms of one's practice.  In other words, in order to fulfil the obligations that doctors have, be it at an ethical level or a constitutional or legal level, there must be some evidence in terms of what they do and that is about the only way the ethical injunction of <i>primum non nocere</i> - first do no harm - can actually be fulfilled.</p><p>  That forms the backdrop to what I want to say in the context of the heads of the Bill.  It would not be particularly useful for me to go through it head by head because the members of the committee and the Members of the Houses will have heard a great deal of that from other contributors and also previously.  Suffice it to say that the heads of the Bill in terms of their philosophical approach having regard to those ethical-legal imperatives seem to have adopted an inverted approach in terms of what they seek to do.</p><p>  When it comes to the question of certifying certain opinions in head 2, 3 or 4, in each case there is a requirement that the opinion be formed in good faith.  With respect, when one is relying upon a good safety justification, that good safety justification as a matter of practicality will always succeed.  Trying to demonstrate bad faith - <i>mala fides</i> - or even improper motivation in this area is virtually impossible.  There is a whole series of cases where this has arisen under the old mental health legislation over the past 40 years.  With respect it seems that this represents a very old-fashioned approach which is inconsistent with the ethical, now the legal and elevated to a constitutional duty that the courts have elaborated over the past two years in particular.</p><p>  By incorporating some kind of objective standard or a reference to evidence-based practice, at least there is some template against which practice can be measured.  That is simply not possible in the context of a statutory schema, which is predicated solely on the good faith of individual practitioners.  I do not need to mention in this House the issues and problems that have arisen over the years in terms of individual practitioners - one would imagine acting in good faith - who were nevertheless damaging individuals in the most egregious circumstances.</p></speech>

It occurred to me when passing my alma mater, Trinity College, that I have been teaching and researching in this area for almost 20 years.  I am honoured to have this opportunity today.</p><p>  For someone like me who works in the area of ethics and law the proposed legislation in terms of its recognition of a public obligation to implement an existing constitutional right to life-saving abortion, is welcome.  However, it does not do enough to meet the ethical obligation to value women's lives.  I will focus my opening remarks on four key points, including the definition of the unborn; the significance of risks under heads 2 to 4 justifying a termination of pregnancy; the limits on the rights to conscientious objection and the inappropriateness of criminalisation.</p><p>  On the definition of the unborn, head 1 suggests that the unborn should be defined to mean following implantation, drawing on<i></i>Roche <i>v. </i>Roche concerning frozen embryos as a precedent.  With respect, the ethical arguments for choosing the point of implantation as a significant moment for legal protection of human life have not been adequately addressed.  Given past failures to interrogate the assumed wrongness of abortion and, given the particular factual context of Roche<i> v. </i>Roche, it is open to this Legislature to consider more fully the criteria by which the unborn should be defined.  The best ethical argument available to us from the literature and moral philosophy justifying protection of early forms of unborn life from implantation is that of potential personhood.  This is the argument that from its earliest stages, subject to assistance from the pregnant woman, the embryo and foetus will go on to become a person.  This future personhood argument does not apply, however, to foetuses with lethal abnormalities.  Much to the anguish of their parents, they will die after birth and, therefore, they do not have a future as persons.  That ethical argument does not apply in this case.  Moreover, the State argued in D.<i> v. </i>Ireland that foetuses with lethal abnormalities could be excluded from the legal and constitutional definition of the unborn.  Given that D lost her case before the European Court of Human Rights, partly because this was the argument made by the State and domestic remedies were not exhausted, there is, I would argue, more of a moral obligation on the Legislature to deliver on that argument and to address the definition of the unborn in a way that excludes foetuses with lethal abnormalities.</p><p>  A second important aspect of this ethical argument for protection of early embryonic life from implantation is that it rests on the potential to become a person rather than on actual personhood.  Potential personhood is best regarded as giving early embryonic and foetal life moral value because of what it will become in the future.  This potentiality is obviously ethically significant but not as significant as the moral status we give to sentient forms of human life, namely, forms of human life that are developed to the point of feeling pain or pleasure.  That is another stage of development with another set of capacities and another level of moral protection is due it.  It is also not the same as the higher moral status which comes with full personhood, namely, the capacity to reason, communicate, will and act on our lives.  A person's interest in her own bodily and moral integrity may justify limitations on the duty to sentient beings.  This is because part of what makes life valuable is the person's ability to reflect on her life over time in particular factual circumstances and to make moral choices in that regard.  That is part of what we value about being human.</p><p>  To sum up, the following categories I would suggest provide a better ethical framework for the protection of unborn human life than does the assumed significance of implantation underpinning the legislation.  First, pre-sentient embryonic and foetal life has moral value rather than moral status.  It should be taken into account in moral decision-making but in itself does not impose harm-reducing duties on others.  Second, sentient foetal life has moral status and may impose a duty on other persons to reduce harm to that sentient foetal life.  Third, self aware personhood has a higher moral status than sentient life and this can limit the duties we owe sentient forms of life.  They are the three ethical frameworks discussed in literature on medical ethics and law, which I believe will be helpful in informing the debate around protection of unborn life in its early stages.</p><p>  My recommendation in this regard is that the unborn should be defined so as to exclude those foetuses which have lethal abnormalities and which will not have a future independent life.  This possibility is open to the Legislature.  It does have the power to do this.  Also, the unborn should be defined to mean the foetus following the earliest moment at which sentience is possible.</p><p>  On heads 2 and 4 and the risk of loss of life that justifies a termination of pregnancy, these heads provide for the kinds of risk to a woman's life which will legally justify a termination of pregnancy under the scheme.  Others have commented more eloquently than I can on the need to remove obstacles in life-saving abortion care and on the troubling mistrust of women with suicidal ideation.  I would like now to focus on the narrowness of the risk to life ground for termination of pregnancy.  This ground has been drawn very narrowly, in part because it is assumed that Article 40.3.3&deg; requires the life of the pregnant woman to be treated the same as the life of the embryo or foetus.  Again, turning to ethical moral philosophy and legal theory, equality scholars have long argued that equality does not mean sameness rather ethical treatment requires the accommodation of actual differences between beings of all shapes and forms.  Vindicating the life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life as directed by Article 40.3.3&deg; should entail a full evaluation of all the interests that the woman's life entails, as well as all the interests of the unborn.</p></speech>

I was also the editor of the Irish Reports at the time the X case was decided.  We edited and prepared a special edition of the Irish Reports setting out the relevant arguments.  However, anything I say this afternoon is entirely in a personal capacity.  I want to make constructive criticisms of the Bill in a spirit of interrogating what might be possible.  My criticisms should not be taken to suggest they will inevitably come to pass but, as legislators drafting legislation, it is important to examine the provisions to determine what they actually provide for, bearing in mind that our purpose is to bring clarity to the rights of the mother and the unborn child.</p><p>  As there is no presumption that the heads of the Bill are constitutional, we can proceed on the basis of criticising them in that way.  I do not want to rehearse the arguments made by other speakers but I wish to speak about the drafting of the legislation.  In regard to clarity, head 2 on necessary medical practice in the context of physical risk contains nothing new.  Medical practice in Ireland has been excellent in treating both mother and unborn child over decades.  I am not sure any additional substantive clarity is brought to the matter by this head, which is unobjectionable.  An issue that remains unclear, however, is head 4 and the threat of suicide.  In this regard, I want to mention what was decided in the X case because we cannot leave out of the picture the fact that the Supreme Court formulated the test without the benefit of medical evidence or best psychiatric practice.  The court did not have to consider and weigh expert testimony or psychiatric evidence as to whether abortion is ever a treatment for suicide or if other treatments could be utilised to avert the risk.  This is what members have been considering over the past several days.</p><p>  On foot of the Supreme Court judgment in X, a superstructure is going to be imposed in order to meet the test, involving various medical professionals.  An earlier speaker argued that X was wrongly decided.  I will not argue that but certain matters were not considered in X because certain concessions were made.  X is silent on some of the issues arising around the threat of suicide and it now appears that the best psychiatric evidence indicates that abortion is not a treatment for suicide.  However, the structure we are examining proposes to put in place and medicalise what in fact was a legal test.  It cannot be ignored that the evidence of a psychologist, who was not advocating abortion, meant that the X test was fulfilled.  A question arises as to whether we are legislating on a flawed presumption or hypothesis.  It seems to me, based on the best psychiatric evidence available, that is what is being proposed.  The medical evidence indicates that abortion is not a treatment for suicide.</p></speech>

He referred to the Medical Council's guidelines, the importance of professional integrity in dealing with the public and the expectation that medical professionals will act in good faith.  There is an obligation on such professionals in that regard and the Medical Council's guidelines are the essence of this.  The 2009 edition of the guidelines specifically states, in the context of suicide as a threat to the life of the woman, that a termination is lawful in this country.  Is Dr. Craven of the view that the guidelines in question are at variance with good medical practice?</p><p>  My second question is directed to Ms McDonagh.  In the context of the debate on the protection of life in which we sometimes engage, reference is made to the obligation on obstetricians, psychiatrists, cardiologists, oncologists and medical professionals in general to vindicate the life of both the mother and the unborn in so far as is practicable.  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution is specific in this regard.  Where in the legislation is provision made for the intentional destruction of the unborn to safe the life of the mother?  We can understand that in the event of an intervention prior to foetal viability, while it would not be intentional, the life will be destroyed.  From where in the heads of the Bill did Ms McDonagh obtain the perception that there will be intentional interventions in order to destroy the life of the child and after viability as well?  If an ability in this regard exists, perhaps she could enlighten us as to how we might tighten up the position.  I do not believe any Members of the Houses or any professionals would like legislation to be put in place by means of which we would almost obligate or allow medical practitioners to intentionally destroy life.  If we were to do so, would we not - at the very least - be passing legislation which would probably be against the spirit of Article 40.3.3&deg; and also unconstitutional?</p></speech>

I will be brief, as usual.  In respect of Dr. Craven's presentation I take it that he has difficulties with the Bill but that he is more of the opinion that the template of the Mental Health Act would be more appropriate, operable and practical in this area.  Is that is the case?  What is Dr. Craven's view?</p><p>  Dr. Fletcher referred to the question of fatal foetal abnormality, an issue I raised early on in the first day of these hearings.  I asked Dr. Tony Holohan of the Department of Health why this issue was not covered in the legislation, particularly in view of the State's case at the European Court of Human Rights.  Will Dr. Fletcher clarify and expand on that point, please?</p><p>  Ms McDonagh referred to the question of appropriate location.  Again, I raised this issue on Friday morning.  I take it Ms McDonagh has a difficulty with it.  Perhaps the committee has a difficulty with it as well.  Will Ms McDonagh confirm that the matter could be amended and clarified in the legislation?</p></speech>

In the course of recent days we heard from Dr. Anthony McCarthy, who is the head of the School of Psychiatry and is a perinatal psychiatrist who works in that field extensively, being only one of three in the country.  He stated that it is true that abortion is not a treatment for suicide but he added that counselling and anti-antidepressants are not treatments either and that there is no treatment for suicide.  He argued that we have to try to prevent suicide by looking at the reasons for suicide.  I put it to the witnesses that we all advocate that abortion is not a treatment for suicide, but it is the choice of the woman and it is the doctors who certify the woman to be suicidal.  These are trained medical psychiatrists who, day in, day out and week in, week out deal with risk and put people on suicide watch.  Are we now to believe that they are incapable of ascertaining whether a woman is suicidal?  We all agree that abortion is not a treatment for suicide.  It is the woman's right to choose.</p></speech>

I am not here to advocate a policy, such as a woman's right to choose, but I am addressing the psychiatric evidence which is available.  One wonders why the entire matter has been medicalised if, in fact, the idea behind the Bill is a policy consideration that women should have the right to choose.  It is not that I have a problem with anything to do with appropriate legislation, I am merely drawing the attention of the committee to what the consequences could be.  I am here as a lawyer not as an advocate.  I am merely pointing out that the HSE under the Health Act can enter into an arrangement with any provider provided, it seems to me, it is co-located with maternity services, etc.  I am only pointing out that one could have a situation where one could have, in the grounds of a hospital, a private provider.  One wonders was that what was intended, if there is to be oversight.</p></speech>

All of these things can be amended or changed.  One presumes that is why we have all been called to give our view.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher raised a question about abortion being a treatment for suicide.  In response, in the penultimate paragraph in the explanatory memorandum to head 4 the framers state, "In circumstances where the unborn may be potentially viable outside the womb, doctors must make all efforts to sustain its life after delivery."  However, it is not so much a matter of where in the Bill one finds that the unborn is going to be targeted.  The question is where does one find in the heads of the Bill protection given to a foetus who is potentially viable outside the womb.  By extension, I would say that one also has a difficulty in principle once it is acknowledged that there is a right to life once a foetus is viable.  Where does one draw the line?  Where does one draw the line if it is 20 weeks and some form of protective treatment can be put in place for four weeks?  It is very difficult once the viability argument is conceded to see if there is not a principled argument throughout.  Anyway, I do not see here any explicit protection for the unborn up until viability.  Let us not forget the other related point that came up in respect of the definition of "unborn".  One is unborn until one has proceeded fully from the womb, according to the explanatory section.  That does not give any comfort if, in fact, the life of the unborn can be terminated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.614" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100037#MM01000"><p>I wish to respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about whether the recommendation is equivalent to the merging of heads 2 to 4.  In short, the answer is "Yes".  Having extra procedures and extra personnel required in the case of suicide risk is effectively discriminatory against people who threaten suicide.</p> <p>The effect of my recommendation is to remove that kind of discriminatory provision within the heads.  The effect could be achieved through having the same test and, effectively, merging heads 2 to 4.  Therefore, I would support that.</p><p> I will respond to Deputy Healy's question on the definition of the unborn and the possibility for having that definition exclude foetuses with lethal abnormalities.  The main argument I was making in terms of having a brief to talk about the ethical arguments today, was that the future potential personhood of those foetuses unfortunately is not going to be achieved.  In ethical terms, one is asking women to sustain pregnancies when a future independent life is not going to be achieved at the end of the day.  It would be regarded as unethical in that sense in that one is imposing suffering when a good is not going to be attained out of that suffering at the end of the day.  </p><p> On the legal point in D <i>v</i>. Ireland, given the ethical arguments and given the legal possibility of defining the unborn in a way that it would exclude foetuses who have these particular extreme conditions, which mean that they cannot survive birth, that would achieve the delivery of the State's argument in D <i>v</i>. Ireland which, in effect, meant that D lost her case before the European Court of Human Rights because she had not gone to a local court in Ireland.  The European Court of Human Rights said that argument could have been made before a domestic court and therefore the case was thrown out.  That gives the Legislature an added responsibility to act on behalf of those women given that this case was thrown out by the European Court of Human Rights on the basis of that argument because it believed in the possibility that Irish courts and the Irish Legislature could interpret Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>in this way.  The Legislature does have a moral obligation to pick that up as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.616" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Craven" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100038#NN00200"><p>I will deal with the questions in the order in which they were put to me.  I will deal with Deputy Kelleher's question first.  What he said about the Medical Council guidelines on suicide is correct but the council is simply making a statement of its understanding as to the current legal position.  It is doing no more than that.  I certainly do not think on any reasonable reading of that particular provision that it is actually saying this is nevertheless ethical.  Having said that, I recognise there is a fundamental inconsistency between a bald statement in relation to legality divorced from any consideration of the ethicality of what is actually stated.  I should say that I do not hold a brief for the Medical Council and I am not here to defend its position or what it has said in this area.</p><p>  Moving on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments, he was quite right in what he said.  It is fair to say that I am highly critical of the approach the Bill has taken.  There is a certain philosophical inversion in terms of what is required.  Rather than simply examining what the evidence is and, therefore, what is ethically and legally mandated, it seems to decide there are certain procedures which are not defined which somehow are lawful and defensible and then it invites the professional bodies and the regulatory agencies to provide assistance in relation to the implementation of the legislation.  With respect, in terms of a very significant policy issue, that strikes me as being an inversion.  Whatever doctors, the regulatory bodies and the professional bodies may say about these matters, the questions of policy and the principle are not ones which, in my respectful submission, are capable of being avoided by the Oireachtas.</p><p>  My comments in relation to conscientious objection have to be taken in context.  If the proposed Bill is reflecting proper ethical, legal consideration, then the question of conscientious objection simply cannot arise because it accords with both the ethical imperative and the legal imperative as I tried to make out.  If, on the other hand, it is doing something different, then it may well be the case that a question of conscientious objection arises.  Whereas the case has been made that conscientious objection is something of a personal right and is vested in individuals, it in itself, as we know from other jurisdictions, is capable of giving rise to all kinds of issues and difficulties when one steps one position more remote from the person who is involved in the procedure.  In our neighbouring jurisdiction there have been significant problems in relation to it.</p><p>  In so far as the question of whether this is a right which vests in institutions is concerned, again the courts recognise that no doctor or health care professional can be obliged to do something which he or she considers to be contrary to the best interests of the patient.  Institutions do not have arms and legs or eyes and ears, they can only operate through the personnel they employ or engage.  Trying to make a distinction between a right to object in relation to institutions, on the one hand, and individuals, on the other, is, in my view, not sustainable.</p><p>  Moving on to deal with Deputy Healy's question, I hope I have not misled him in regard to the Mental Health Act.  That Act of itself is one with issues related to it.  Since the question has been raised, that Act evolved and was designed with a particular policy objective in mind and it sets out the various principles which were to apply and then it sought to import those principles by way of giving effect to the policy objective.  While I am certainly not holding it up as a paradigm in terms of how it might be done, the point I wish to make is that with the policy having been decided one cannot then seek to implement it without having reasonable regard to the ethical legal principles which will result in proper implementation of the policy.</p><p>  Deputy Conway's question has probably already been dealt with by Ms McDonagh in her response.  In so far as Dr. McCarthy is concerned, the evidence given before the committee on 8 January of this year was pretty much to the same effect.  The argument is not being made that abortion is a treatment for suicidal behaviour, suicidal intent, suicidality or however one wishes to characterise it.  If it was the case that the Oireachtas seeks to introduce a regime for other reasons, then that is policy debate of an entirely different order.  As Ms McDonagh has already pointed out, what this Bill purports to do is to medicalise the matter.  If we were to engage with it from a rights-based perspective, that would be a debate on an entirely different matter.</p></speech>

I understand that under Article 40.3.3&deg; the life of the unborn is protected.  If the unborn has only the prospect of surviving one second after being born, the legal position is that the pregnancy cannot be terminated.  Dr. Fletcher seems to have a different view and I would like her to clarify that issue.</p><p>  Ms McDonagh referred to the Mental Health Act and the structures that are in place.  In terms of the heads of the Bill, is it her view that we should have a similar structure for dealing with whatever procedures have to be put in place to deal with such an application, especially under head 4, or is she suggesting that a more comprehensive structure should be put in place?  Once a decision is taken in this case it is not reversible and when the procedure goes ahead it is not reversible.  Ms McDonagh might clarity that matter.</p></speech>

In the witnesses' opinion is the ability of the State to enforce an abortion against the will of the family covered in the heads of the Bill, and would that be an ethical process?</p><p>  Second, what limitations, if any, should be placed on a physician's choice of method or technique for abortions either before or after viability?  Where the child is not viable, may the physician use a procedure, for example, which would directly end the life of the unborn?  I do not want to go into the gruesome details that entails but issues arise such as suction aspiration and dilation and evacuation, D and E, where the child is partially evacuated.  Post-viability, even though there are serious risks attached to the health of the child, what is the position with regard to the person performing that abortion, having regard to perhaps a safer method of abortion which would involve the death of the baby as against another method such as induction which might save the life of the baby?  Is the Bill clear on that and the ethics attached to it?  Third, is there an obligation on us, as legislators, to enact laws that are just?</p></speech>

My first question is to Dr. Craven.  I am at a loss to understand his submission - I have read his submission as well as listening to his contribution - and the basis for his opposition to the heads of the Bill.  His view is that it changes the current two patient duty, as he put it, but in my reading, and according to the experts we heard earlier, the heads of the Bill do nothing to change the current duty under Article 40.3.3o, which is a duty both to preserve the right to life of the unborn as far as practicable and to preserve the right to life of the pregnant woman.  Head 1 of the Bill, which sets out the definition of "reasonable opinion", and head 19 specifically cover that requirement as well as the duty that others have referred to of any practitioner operating within the Bill to observe the terms of Article 40.3.3o, which remains in place.  I cannot accept the basis for that submission.</p><p>  Dr. Fletcher made some very thoughtful points in her submission about the issue of life.  I ask her about heads 1 and 19 in particular.  On head 1 she points out the difficulty with the definition of "unborn".  My reading of the current definition is that it covers cases where, tragically, there is no longer foetal life, in other words, a foetus which is no longer alive.  The witnesses from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists told us that they would not regard that as an unborn and that they would regard it as miscarriage but my reading of the definition is that it is not sufficiently focused to exclude that, and that it would lead to the difficult and traumatic situation of a pregnant woman being forced to carry to term a foetus which she knows to be no longer alive.  That is a traumatic thing to require any woman to do.  Dr. Craven helpfully reminds us that section 58 of the Civil Liability Act 1961 refers to unborn, specifically stating "provided the child is subsequently born alive".  That bears out the argument the witness is making.  Clearly, there is litigation waiting to happen along the lines of the D case in an Irish court where a woman with a fatal foetal abnormality challenges the State for failing to provide her with the right to a termination.</p><p>  On head 19, Dr. Fletcher made a very strong argument about the need not to criminalise the woman, or indeed the young girl, who attempts or carries out an abortion on herself, which is a real practical point because so many young women are importing abortion pills for use in this jurisdiction.  I take her point, which was helpful of her to make.</p></speech>

I ask her to clarify that for me.</p><p>  I read with interest Dr. Fletcher's contribution and thank her for appearing before the committee because it opens up an issue that needs to be debated.  She referenced the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in her paper and the threshold of the 24 weeks gestation.  As she is aware, there was a case in the United States in which Amelia Taylor was born just short of 22 weeks gestation.  In those extreme circumstances would that neonate have less legal protection if we introduce a definition along the lines she is talking about?</p><p>  In that regard, at the other end of the scale and following on from the question Deputy Catherine Byrne asked, which is a valid question, Dr. Fletcher made the point that a person's ability to reflect on life over time and make their own moral choices.  We all accept that but someone with Alzheimer's disease, for example, would fall into that category where they cannot reflect on their own life or make their own moral choices.  How do we deal with the ethical issues that raises?</p></speech>

The first question was on the Mental Health Act.  I do not hold a view as to precisely what should happen but I would like to point out that there are other safeguards in the Mental Health Act other than the ones I have mentioned.  The Mental Health Commission is an independent statutory body and it advertises and recruits independent lawyers, lay people and psychiatrists to sit on its tribunals.  It is also mandated to act in the best interests of the patient.  Interestingly, there is a five year review clause for the mental health legislation also.  Looking at this proposed legislation, when we come to the review panel, it is the Health Service Executive that licenses the hospital, yet the HSE is also the body tasked with setting up the review panel and a HSE employee acts as convenor of the panel and chooses the panel.  It was the framers of the legislation who were looking to the mental health legislation as a template and if it is to be seen as a template, it might be an idea to take some of these further safeguards from the mental health legislation.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Byrne.  I do not believe that this is a very complicated issue.  One would hate to think that the intervention of lawyers and doctors was over-complicating what is essentially a very simple issue in which everybody in the State and the people who enacted the Constitution have a stake and a right to have a view on.  It is finding the right balance between two competing constitutional rights and one would hate to think lawyers were trying to be obtuse when, ultimately, it comes down to simple value questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Fletcher" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100040#PP00200"><p>Many rich questions were asked and I thank committee members for them.  I will address the points on the definition of the unborn.  The question was asked as to how the proposed definition of "unborn" would deal with the idea that it applied to those foetuses which are born and survive for one second.  Another issue was whether it includes dead embryos or foetuses in the womb.</p><p>  At present we do not have legal precedents on the definition of the unborn where a lethal abnormality exists.  We do not have a direct legal precedent on this particular issue.  Because we do not have this direct legal precedent the Legislature has the ability to define "unborn" in a way which would address these problems which have arisen through acknowledging the suffering of women and couples who have had to travel, even though the pregnancies will not survive.  The view has been put forward that "unborn" could apply to foetuses which have survived even for one day, but I advocate we do not accept this view and that we define the unborn in a way which excludes foetuses which do not have the capacity to survive.  This is not to say these foetuses have no value; I do not argue this at all.  I am just arguing no good will be achieved by forcing a woman to continue a pregnancy when the child will not survive.</p><p>  With regard to the point on the current definition of the unborn being overly broad and not excluding even dead embryos or foetuses, it is interesting that the institute raised this issue.  Obviously as a medical matter it is seen as excluded and comes under the category of miscarriage.  This is what is happening in medical guidelines and practice at present.  We need a tighter definition of the unborn to exclude this possibility.  We also have an opportunity to have a definition of the unborn which deals with foetuses which would survive through pregnancy but would not survive for long after birth.</p><p>  The second interesting set of questions raised were to do with arguments around full personhood and how we distinguish between the foetus as sentient life and the born patient stripped of consciousness because he or she was in a crash or is a patient with Alzheimer's disease.  We are not stating that full personhood is all that counts; we are saying there are three different forms of human life which all impose values and status.  I distinguish between the example of a person with Alzheimer's disease or the person in a crash and sentient foetal life in the womb because a person with Alzheimer's disease or a person who has been stripped of consciousness through an injury had been sentient with a conscience and a will but through accident or disease this capacity has been lost.  Because such people had this full personhood status it is possible to distinguish them from an earlier foetus which has not yet attained these capacities.  Its ability to attain these capacities is dependent on a pregnant woman getting it to the point of attaining them.  There are ethical ways in which we can distinguish these cases.  The ways in which they are similar are obviously that in all cases families and loved ones are concerned about the value of these forms of life.  If they are sentient forms of life they are similar in this way and this can impose duties on us.  I am just saying they are not the same order of duties as full personhood would impose.</p><p>  The final point raised had to do with criminalisation.  One of the big risks of criminalisation, or why we should not act disproportionately and punitively in implementing Article 40.3.3&deg;, is because it will affect the most vulnerable.  Young women who are avoiding using health care practice by ordering medical terminations over the Internet are a classic example.  We would be effectively criminalising this behaviour and making the situation worse.  This is not a good use of our law when we have the opportunity to do something more positive and progressive.</p></speech>

I listened with interest to what Dr. Fletcher stated and it strikes me as quite a novel proposition that we can characterise life as having three different forms.  Be this as it may, I am concerned about Senator Bacik's characterisation, and I am subject to correction on this, when she discussed the question of lethal foetal abnormality and whether it is something which ought to be protected.  We must be very careful to note the mere fact a baby happens to have a lethal abnormality does not of itself mean it is wholly inconsistent with life.  Generally it means it is inconsistent with prolonged life.  It may well be a matter of minutes, hours, days or even months.</p></speech>

Dr. Craven referred to good faith.  It may be a lay term and it may be old-fashioned, but I have relied on it for all my life, as have many ordinary people.  It is in good faith that we trust daily - when we take a bus to work, when we cycle or when we put our names on lists for operations.</p><p>  I thank Dr. Fletcher for her answer.  I raised my point because my understanding was that a brain dead person's life ended when the life support machine was turned off.  There is a difference between this and the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, for example, my mother.  She lived, walked around, breathed, ate and was able to wash without needing a life support machine.  My impression, regardless of whether it is right, is that the machine is the mother's womb.  Does Dr. Fletcher understand what I mean?  This is the lay person's vision of the situation.  These hearings are about understanding the situation in lay terms.  I do not have the ethics, surgical knowledge or so on, but I have a lay person's thoughts on the matter.  When people attend my office, I must reply to them in lay terms.</p></speech>

This is a problem.  I am against the criminalisation of attempts, as it would bring the law into dispute if behaviour intended to result in the destruction of unborn life was unsuccessful.  It would be contradictory in its objectives.  I hope that I have understood the Deputy's point correctly.</p><p>  I may have cited two different examples together in a desire to answer several questions.  In response to the point that Deputy Catherine Byrne is raising now regarding forms of life, brain dead life is a biological form of life sustained by a machine.  There is value in the example in that sense.</p></speech>

It is a policy matter as to whether it is in the public interest to pursue the issue.  I do not differ particularly from Dr. Fletcher.</p><p>  Regarding Senator Henry's point, I fear that I have been misunderstood.  I was making a simple point that I may have put somewhat inelegantly.  There are ethical imperatives in professional practice.  There are legal imperatives that dovetail with them.  There are objective standards.  They are not questions of good faith.  There have been episodes in which excessive reliance was placed on good faith and undue deference may have been paid to the profession.  The point that I wished to make was a simple one and was from the perspective of 2013.  The degree of deference one should have to the medical profession, I respectfully submit, should be tinged with a certain caution.  This is why we have external regulatory bodies and oversight.  Ms McDonagh has alluded to this issue in terms of the appointment of the psychiatrist, the convening authority, composition and funding of the committee and so on.  Some kind of external oversight is necessary.</p><p>  In so far as our hospitals are concerned, this is a generic point, as the standards are set externally by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The standards promulgated by the professional bodies are evidence based, in so far as that is possible.  The protection of the public safety, which is a question of assuring quality of care and ensuring that care is delivered safely, requires external oversight.</p></speech>

I believe it does, which means that it would require women, even where they do not wish to do so, to carry to term a foetus that is not alive.  That is my concern, and also that in head 19 we are criminalising those women and girls.</p></speech>

Again, we have heard some very differing opinions about certain ethical and legal realities.  In regard to the question of fatal foetal abnormality and those very tragic situations, I wonder whether that debate is not more appropriately categorised as part of a euthanasia debate.  Defining the unborn by reference to any future personhood or life that he or she might have seems to miss the point of what the eighth amendment was about, namely, to recognise the right the unborn has in the present.  It would seem to me immaterial what the future life of that child should be.  It also seems that a dangerous approach is being advocated because there is such uncertainty here.  When we talk about foetal abnormality, as Dr. Craven noted-----</p></speech>

As to whether there is an obligation to maintain a pregnancy where a child has actually died, frankly I find that very surprising and such would not be my understanding of the law.  Perhaps others would care to comment.</p><p>  Ms McDonagh spoke about medicalising a decision that is not medical.  Is that a fundamental problem with the proposed legislation?  Is it almost ethical bad faith?  We are not talking about cases of mental health where I believe it has been well established to everybody's satisfaction that abortion is not a treatment for suicidal ideation.  That would imply it is not a treatment for suicidal ideation that arises in a mental health difficulty.  Is it Ms McDonagh's position, therefore, that psychiatrists are being drawn into a role that is not really a role for a doctor and that there is thereby a kind of ethical unsoundness at the heart of what this Bill presents?</p><p>  Do any of the witnesses have a view on whether it is legally necessary to go this route in order to satisfy our obligations under the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg?  Is there an alternative path?  Part of the rhetoric around the Government's proposal has been that this action is necessary but we heard that disputed in earlier sessions today.</p><p>  What is the view of the witnesses as to whether there should be a review?  Is there a disproportionality about the fact that the refusal to certify a termination under head 4 is susceptible to a review at the request of the mother, while there appears to be no legitimate contradictor or possibility that somebody else might invoke a review, given the final and fatal consequences for the unborn in that case?</p></speech>

He stated that a conscientious objection does not arise when there is evidence-based practice and a duty to both patients.  What about the Supreme Court judgment in the X case which was not based on medical evidence or best practice?  In Dr. Craven's view is this judgment ethical?</p><p>  I agree with Dr. Fletcher that we have an ethical obligation to value women's lives.  Is there an equal ethical obligation to value the life of the unborn?  I am somewhat uncomfortable with Dr. Fletcher's recommendation No. 1, about the definition of the unborn.  She said this should be defined in order to exclude those foetuses which have lethal abnormalities.  Medical error is not uncommon and doctors frequently get things wrong.  I met a mother recently who gave birth to twins.  In the UK she had been advised to have a termination on the basis there was a strong likelihood the babies would be Siamese twins.  They are now healthy eight year olds.  In formulating her view, I wonder what research Dr. Fletcher has done and whether she has asked mothers and women who have carried babies that had lethal abnormalities what status they would have put on the unborn.  I know many women are delighted to be pregnant, even though they may not give birth to a live baby, or a "take home" baby, as it is sometimes called.</p><p>  My final question is for Ms McDonagh.  Earlier I asked Mrs. Justice McGuinness about the introduction of time limits and she said we should have a go, in spite of the fact that it might be deemed unconstitutional.  Would that be Ms McDonagh's view?  Yesterday, for example, Dr. Peadar O'Grady, representing Doctors for Choice, suggested a limit of eight to nine weeks.  If time limits are introduced would it follow that under head 4, after a prescribed time limit all unborn babies would be safe?</p><p>  I beg the Chairman's indulgence for a final question to Ms McDonagh, to hear her legal wisdom.  In the event of premature induced delivery, post viability, where the baby may be severely disabled, could the State be deemed liable, given it would be working against best practice under head 4?</p></speech>

In regard to head 1, when does she believe a life becomes human and when does it acquire human rights?  What rights does life acquire?</p><p>  I refer to the panel and medical ethics.  There are many genuine concerns in this Chamber and in the Oireachtas as we look around at other jurisdictions and as we see what has happened in the United Kingdom, where medical practitioners have flouted the law with some regularity by providing pre-signed abortion consent forms.  From a medical ethics point of view should the proposed law be cognisant of the very real possibility that abortion safeguards will be flouted, especially by those who consider that such safeguards unfairly limit the expression of abortion rights?</p><p>  I refer to head 12 which deals with the rights of conscience and conscientious objection.  There was mention of the patient, and of doctors and midwives having a conscientious objection.  Do institutions have a right to a conscientious objection, as endorsed by the Council of Europe? Is it the witnesses' opinion that point 3 in head 12 should be removed from the Bill or should it stay?</p></speech>

During the course of the past 40 years the legislative and ethical issues dealing with women's reproductive concerns have had a fairly messy history in this country, to put it mildly.  We have struggled with issues such as who should be given the contraceptive pill and, in legislating for the morning-after pill, what the definition is of the unborn.  We had the same concerns about when human life supposedly begins when legislating for the implantation of the Mirena coil.   We still live in a country where there is no legislation governing either <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation or stem cell research.  As Dr. Craven noted, we can order RU486, an abortifacient tablet, over the Internet, with no legislation intervening.  The individuals who would be ordering such medications are the most vulnerable people of the cohort of women we are discussing.  At very best, they see doctors and the wider administration of the Government, the churches, or whatever as adversarial, at worst they believe we are trying to criminalise them.  As a member of the legal profession, does Dr. Craven agree that perhaps we should not have punitive legislation that would set down how many years a person should be imprisoned for if, for one reason or another, she was using this medication?  That question is also addressed to Dr. Fletcher.</p></speech>

If we reviewed the drug on a trial basis over ten, 15 or 20 years - in a sense, like the X case - and it was the view not just of most people but of everybody that it was not suitable, I believe it would not be licensed.</p><p>  With reference to head 4 - the rest of the legislation could be passed in a half day in the Oireachtas - there is the proposal of the concept that abortion is a suitable treatment for suicide, notwithstanding the fact that every presenter this week, last January and over the course of the debate has said the opposite.  What is the response of witnesses to that?  Is it ethical to put into law a treatment we know is not a treatment at all?</p><p>  I thank Dr. Fletcher for the contribution and I very much appreciate where she is coming from philosophically on the topic.  She mentioned what was described as a troubling mistrust of women with suicidal ideation.  We have been asked by the Chairman not to use emotive language and I do not believe the problem to be the mistrust of women with suicidal ideation; we are proposing the possible mistreatment of women with suicidal ideation.  Will the witness comment on that?</p><p>  I concur with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames on the proposed new definitions of "personhood", the "unborn" and difficulties which may flow from that.  It is somewhat cold to state people do not have a future as persons.  It almost sounds Orwellian and it is frightening language.  That is why some of us are so fearful of this legislation, as we are afraid of the scary thoughts it may bring us.  That is why we must be careful.</p><p>  I thank all the witnesses as they gave very interesting and worthwhile presentations.  We can agree to disagree on some issues.</p></speech>

I have a point that may have been covered earlier and one speaker can respond to it.

The Chairman is really too quick off the mark.  When did they first decide to become unborn?  These are philosophical questions as this is a matter of texture, depth and profoundness.  We are here specifically to try to determine clarity in the law and the Constitution with regard to two lives.  With the new life, the question is when the life begins, and there is also the question of the host life, or that of the mother.  We can argue for days, weeks and months and go into law in different jurisdictions.  We have always gone to the English-speaking world but in France in 1975, tight legislation was introduced in this area.  We mentioned earlier that in France girls, even those under 16 years old, can go to a general practitioner and have an abortion without the knowledge of parents.  That is the reality.  We must face up to the question.</p><p> The issue highlighted is head 4.  The evidence from experts in psychiatry, obstetrics and gynaecology, ethics and law is that where there is no other treatment available for the threat or intent of suicide, there is a legal justification in the proposed Bill that the termination of the life of the unborn is legally allowable.  That means the mother would have to have in her intentions the termination of that life.  We would be accessories to the termination of a life in order that the host life can be saved when it is not the only possible treatment for that life.</p></speech>

Under the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case we must ensure our law is clear and accessible, and we are given a margin of appreciation.  Ireland is one of the only countries I know with an explicit right in the Constitution giving a right to the unborn.  Comparing us with other jurisdictions is not particularly helpful in that regard.  We are entitled to ensure our law is clear and if this is about clarity, the suggestion that we should have a go at putting in certain time limits in our legislation must be the antithesis of clarity.</p><p>  The question has arisen of the necessity to legislate now because there have been many years since the X case and we have maintained our excellent medical service.  No other girl has come to court except for the girl in the C case, who I now understand regrets the course of action that her case took.  It seems to be working well at the moment.  With regard to the Supreme Court and the X case, the test now being proposed is supposedly a medical test but there is no evidence in the Supreme Court test and when it considered the issue, there was no idea of averting the right to suicide.  We know it is a principle of Irish law that a point not argued is a point not decided but one needs to only look at how the Supreme Court has approached, for example, cases of historical sexual abuse, where insights gained from psychiatry and psychology as to why people do not come forward sooner, the nature of disclosure and the effects of abuse on complainants.  In the case of SH <i>v</i>. Director of Public Prosecutions, there was acknowledgement of the insights brought to bear on the Court's thinking on advances in psychiatry and psychology.</p></speech>

It might be easier if I deal with the questions which have arisen in an omnibus manner.  Ms McDonagh has already dealt with the question whether legislation is necessary.  The State is allowed a fair margin of appreciation in terms of how it approaches this matter.  It ought not to consider that it is wedded to legislation and that this is the only manner in which one may proceed.  There are other legitimate options about which we may disagree.</p><p>  Regarding the question of the X case and whether a conscientious objection might arise in those particular circumstances, even at the time of the X case it struck me that this was bad medicine.  If it was not bad medicine then, it is bad medicine now.  For one to feel oneself constrained in any sense or be put in a position where one would have to comply with that kind of situation now seems to me to be fundamentally untenable from an ethical perspective.</p><p>  On the question of flouting of possible safeguards, the members do not need to hear from experts in ethics or law on that.  They can engage in their own sociological review on that and that speaks for itself.  The question on a licensing board, reviewing whether a certain drug treatment were appropriate in the circumstances, is a point well made and underscores what I have been attempting to say, which is that one should proceed only if one has decent evidence which makes it safe to proceed.  That is why I characterise the approach that is being promoted by the Bill as not alone regressive but also potentially dangerous.</p><p>  Deputy Timmins raised the question on whether there might be any lawful proxy decision makers in respect of issues which might arise.  The Bill is silent on it, but that is not a criticism of this particular Bill but a criticism which one might apply across our legal order where there are gross deficiencies regarding the role of proxy decision makers and what one does when one has individuals who are incapacitated.</p></speech>

Second, I have been following the hearings as closely as I could manage, and have noted that there is a high level of consensus on most of the provisions contained in the General Scheme.  There are also, of course, diverging opinions on some of the provisions - both within and between the legal and medical professions represented before the committee.</p><p>  I assure you Chairman, and the members of the committee, that we will examine these issues from a policy and legal perspective with a view, where possible, to improving the operation of the Bill.  I am confident that all of the submissions, and the report that this committee will produce on its deliberations will greatly assist me, the Minister for Health, and officials in examining and refining the issues involved in the drafting of this Bill.</p><p>  The aim of the Bill is to regulate access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the X case and the A, B and C<i> v.</i>  Ireland judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  The purpose of the legislation is to clarify in statute what is currently already lawful as a consequence of the judgement in the X case, and to set out clearly defined and specific circumstances in which this treatment may lawfully be provided.</p><p>  I would like to address some of the issues that have been raised by contributors during the debate, to allay, if possible, some of the concerns involved.  I am aware, for example, that there has been considerable debate about head 4 and the inclusion in the legislation of the risk of loss of life by way of suicide.  The Supreme Court in the X case specifically recognised a risk to life arising from suicidal intent, which it referred to as a risk of self-destruction, as a legitimate basis for permitting termination of pregnancy - but only in circumstances where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, and where this risk could only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy.</p><p>  Ireland, as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, is under a legal obligation to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in A, B and C<i> v.</i> Ireland<i>, </i>and must put in place a legislative or regulatory regime providing effective and accessible procedures whereby pregnant women can establish whether or not they are entitled to a lawful abortion in accordance with Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case.  The Bill has taken account of the fact that assessment of self-destruction is more subjective and, therefore, requires more safeguards to be put in place.  It specifies that three doctors are required to form an opinion and jointly certify that a termination of pregnancy may take place if it is necessary to save the woman's life.  This provision is made in the Bill in recognition of the clinical challenges associated with accurately assessing suicidal intent, and the absence of objective clinical markers.  The legislation specifies that one of the doctors involved must be an obstetrician-gynaecologist and the other two must be psychiatrists.  It also allows that it may be appropriate that the pregnant woman's GP is consulted during the process of assessment, where practicable.</p><p>  I am also aware that the lack of a gestational time limit in the Bill has been raised, and that concerns have been expressed in respect of where a termination of pregnancy is deemed necessary, and the pregnancy has reached a stage of gestation at which the foetus is or may be viable.  In such situations, it must be stressed that the wording of Article 40.3.3&deg; and the judgment in the X case make it crystal clear that the life of the unborn must be protected and vindicated where practicable.  This means that where a woman has a pregnancy that places her life at risk, and her foetus is or may be viable, she may have a right to have the pregnancy brought to an end but not a right to insist that the life of the foetus be deliberately ended.</p><p>  In circumstances where the unborn may potentially be viable outside the womb, doctors must make all efforts to sustain its life after delivery in accordance with existing medical practice with early deliveries.  In this regard, I note that this aspect was referred to at some length by a number of the obstetrics experts who appeared before the committee.</p><p>  It should be noted, however, that this requirement does not go so far as to oblige a medical practitioner to disregard a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman on the basis that it will result in the death of the unborn.  Essentially, the decision to be reached is not so much a balancing of the competing rights, rather it is a clinical assessment as to whether the mother's life, as distinct from her health, is threatened by a real and substantial risk that can only be averted by a termination of pregnancy.</p><p>  Concerns were raised about ensuring that the monitoring systems provided for under head 11 would incorporate appropriate requirements to preserve the confidentiality of the patient and the certifying practitioners.  The provisions with respect to monitoring have been included in the Bill because there is a need to keep records on the terminations carried out, and the medical reasons that gave rise to same.  Information is also required to inform policy, as well as to ensure that the various statutory principles and requirements are being upheld.  However, although the Bill provides for the collection of this data, it is not the intention that personal or identifying information will be published.  I think it is clear in the explanatory notes to the Bill that it is not proposed that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 will apply to the records collected as part of the monitoring systems.</p><p>  In closing, the main objective of the legislation, if I may reiterate again, is to clarify what is lawfully permissible in cases where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of a pregnant woman, and to set out clearly defined and specific circumstances in which a termination may lawfully be carried out.  As the committee will be aware, a very significant amount of work was involved in producing the heads of this legislation.  More than 50 drafts were composed as we moved to produce what we believe to be balanced proposals that meet our obligations.  Of course, as the committee is fully aware, the next phase is the drafting and publication of the Bill.  Following publication the Bill will go through the Houses of the Oireachtas, where there will be further opportunity for parliamentary engagement and input.  I look forward to working closely with colleagues in both Chambers as we consider the Bill.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman, his officials and all of those who have participated in any way in these public hearings for the invaluable contribution they have made to this issue both now and at the public hearings in January, and for the assistance they have provided to me, the Minister for Health, and our officials in this work.</p></speech>

We had the three days of hearings and preliminary discussions about legislation in January and there is no doubt they were beneficial in terms of Members being able to ask questions of experts.  The Minister of State said he was following the debate closely and noted a high level of consensus.  I can assure the Minister of State there was a high level of consensus in the areas where Members agree and where experts agree but there was a high level of non-consensual discussion as well in the sensitive area of head 4.</p></speech>

I thank all who participated over the past three days of hearings.  I do not exaggerate when I say that this has been an intense and sometimes gruelling engagement.  In particular, I commend the Chairman and members of the Oireachtas joint committee who very responsibly faced the task that was set.  The process has been and will continue to be challenging for many of us.  It has been a necessary engagement and, as described by one of the participants, an exercise in democracy.</p><p>  The hearings have helped to tease out and clarify a number of issues related to the heads of the Bill.  This has not been about trying to get some Members of the Oireachtas across the line, as portrayed by some sections of the media.  The media's focus, and I mean no disrespect to any of them, on Oireachtas voices who hold strong rejectionist views of the Bill, many of whom are not members of the committee, has overshadowed the hard work and dedication of committee members from all parties.  Real questions and deep concerns have been addressed here, and that is positive.  No one should be surprised that consensus has not emerged among all of the medical and legal voices.  Among them, as much as any section of society, there are diverse views on the question of abortion.</p><p>  That said, I believe there is now a very widely held view, and I would say it is a majority view, in society that legislation along the lines set out in the heads of the Bill is not only necessary but long overdue.  Implementation of the X case judgment and legislation in compliance with the A, B and C case judgment are required as soon as possible.  We must safeguard the lives of women.  We must provide legal clarity.  We must ensure there are clear guidelines for clinicians.  Some have argued that these conditions already exist.  I would argue, and Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued, that is not the case and, hence, we need the legislation.</p><p>  Much of the focus of these hearings, and public discussion generally, has been on the inclusion in the heads of the Bill of the threat to the woman's life through suicide.  That is understandable.  All aspects of that question have been thoroughly explored.  Varying views have been given but the time for decision is approaching.  While the anticipated incidence of its employment is thankfully very low, it is our view that it must remain in the Bill.  It is a pity the suicide aspect has dominated discussion.  It has tended to obscure the other vital and important elements of the Bill and other much more prevalent, commonplace and likely threats to the lives of women in pregnancy.  Do the heads of the Bill go far enough to protect women in that regard?  That is a question we must all, individually and collectively, address.</p><p>  We must move on.  The Government needs to publish the Bill.  It needs to be progressed through the Oireachtas.  Sinn F&eacute;in will assess the published Bill in light of its party policy and the questions, answers and issues raised during the hearings and in the wider debate.  We will engage on each Stage of the Bill's passage.  We are committed to ensuring the strongest possible protections are in place.</p></speech>

I thank all the various witnesses who presented over the past three days.  I thank each and every member of the committee and other Members of the Oireachtas who contributed.  I also thank the committee secretariat for its excellent work.</p><p>  The process has been ongoing for quite some time.  We have debated the issue on three occasions in the D&aacute;il Chamber, two to discuss the Bills published by Deputy Clare Daly and one to discuss the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion.  The committee held a hearing that lasted three days in January and we have had another three days now.  With so much discussion and all of the presentations, it can be difficult to see the wood for the trees, to some extent.  Therefore, it is important to restate the parameters within which the legislation is being brought forward.  They are restrictive.  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution protects the life of the woman and the unborn.  The X case concerns a real and substantial threat to the life as distinct from the health of the mother.  In a situation where the threat to a woman's life can only be averted by termination, the woman will have the final say.</p><p>  The past three days have been very helpful and necessary.  We have heard varying degrees of views right across the spectrum, which are sincerely held views that were well thought out and put forward.  The Minister and his Department will have to examine, give further consideration to and allow discussion on the many areas that have been highlighted, such as an appropriate location, the very significant criminal sanction in the Bill, the timeframe for review, consent regarding people who are under age, particularly children, monitoring of the Bill and various other areas that were highlighted over the course of the hearings. </p></speech>

I thank the clerk to the committee and his team for their support in preparing the past couple of days.</p><p>  Following on from what Deputy Seamus Healy spoke about, that there have been three Private Members' Bills on this issue and the committee held three days of hearings in January.  I would go further and say there have been six successive Governments which have spoken about this and which have done nothing.  I, for one, am glad to be a member of the Government that has decided to legislate for this issue and it is incumbent upon us to ensure that happens now because we have talked and talked about it.  We now need to see the Bill published on this important issue for so many women and to see it pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  There is only one issue which I want to bring to the attention of the Minister of State, namely, head 19 on the criminalisation of women.  We have heard, most interestingly, from psychiatrists on both sides of the argument who agree that this is a difficult area, that they do not want to see criminalised women who may purport to take medication that would be, in essence, a medical abortion.  The head is drafted broadly.  Today Mr. Callanan even spoke about the fact that it is drafted so broadly that it could be interpreted that somebody who is advocating for a pro-choice regime could be liable to criminal sanctions.  That is something that should not be part of the heads of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister of State to bring that back to the Department and the drafters and that we would refocus our energies around head 19, taking reference and looking at the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993 which similarly imposes a penalty of 14 years but does not criminalise the person who attempts suicide.  We could use this as a basis for us having similar sanctions for those in relation to abortion.</p><p>  I thank everybody.  I thank my colleagues and fellow members of the committee for their contributions over the past number of days.  As they say, it has been emotional.</p></speech>

I worked in the private sector for 15 years and then headed up different children and youth NGOs, both in a voluntary and professional capacity.  In these roles, I have always listened to the debate but I have never had to actively formulate a position.  I am a little nervous now because this is the first time I am publicly stating how I feel on this issue.</p><p>  The hearings we held, both in January and over the past three days, have given me an opportunity to form a definitive position.  I want to begin by thanking all of the experts, both in January and over the past three days, for their informative and sometimes contradictory testimonies.  All have been extremely useful.  I thank my colleagues, the secretariat and, in particular, the Chairman, Deputy Buttimer.</p><p>  I can now say in confidence that I support the Government's decision to legislate.  These heads of the Bill only deal with difficult, rare and complex circumstances.</p><p>  Of course, I would add some caveats.  I am concerned about us separating out physical and mental health.  In the wider public debate, it will be a step back for us.  Therefore, I believe that heads 2 and 4 should be merged.  I have not heard legal reasoning - obviously, I have heard contradictory reasoning - but from what I have taken, I do not believe that they should be distinguished.  As noted by the expert group, differentiated treatment does not appear to be required for medical or practical reasons.  Dr. McCarthy stated that suicide in pregnancy is a real risk; it does happen.  There is no distinction in Article 40.3.3&deg; and, therefore, to exclude it in these heads of the Bill would be to change the law.  I do not believe that we should have any differentiated treatments.</p><p>  I am concerned about the scope of head 19.  It is extremely broad, in fact, too broad.  It covers a wide range of activities, including and beyond those previously covered by sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.  Some of the scope is unclear about what exactly is covered and the penalties are disproportionate.</p><p>  I have concerns over the appeals process timelines and conscientious objection.  We need a further discussion exploring this issue.</p><p>  I am concerned about the silence in relation to children, specifically young girls.  I believe we need specific legislation to address many of the issues raised over the past few days.  I am troubled that we will compound the situation of voiceless children who are in the care of the State in this legislation.  The hearings have also highlighted the importance of the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill, which is urgently needed.</p><p>  I found any association, actual or implied, between abortion in Europe and the Holocaust to be distasteful in the extreme.  Besmirching the memory of millions of murdered Jews by turning them into a pawn in the abortion debate displays a woeful ignorance of the Holocaust and a woeful disrespect to the memory of the victims.  Whatever one's opinion on the abortion issue and the debate between well-intentioned persons on both sides of the argument, there are no two sides of the Holocaust.  I would respectfully encourage my colleagues to desist from making this highly offensive connection during the continuing debate.  We must not allow the 6 million victims of a diabolical premeditated attempt to eradicate an entire people to be dragged into this abortion debate.</p><p>  I was appointed by the Taoiseach, particularly in recognition of my work on children's rights.  Advocacy on children's rights has not been an easy road to travel.  Therefore, on this decision and in talking about child protection, I had to consider my position, but I stand here in confidence and I will continue to constructively engage with care, conviction and compassion.</p></speech>

We have seen it over the past three days.  It has been a privilege to be here.  I have been proud to be in the Chamber with Members, those on the committee and those who are not.</p><p>  I have been moved and touched by many statements that have been made.  Most of all, I want to express how proud I am of the experts who have been here from all walks of life, whether doctors, medical experts, lawyers or whoever.  It shows the considerable expertise in this country and the pride we should have in our systems, whether medical or legal.</p><p>  Our role of the past three days was to listen and learn - that was my role anyway and I am sure it was that of the members of the committee as well - because we can only learn if we listen to each other.  We learn wisdom, we learn understanding and, above all, we learn compassion.</p><p>  As I stated, the heads of the Bill are about having compassion for those who find themselves in a very difficult place.  Whether in the D&aacute;il, in the community or at home, now and again, we all must have a bit of compassion.</p><p>  My focus over the past few days was on saving women's lives as well as the life of the unborn.  It was made very clear by doctors here that their job is to save lives, whether it is the mother or the unborn.  That came across clearly to me.</p><p>  On whether the heads of the Bill go too far or go far enough, one aspect that stood out which is not in the heads of the Bill was that foetal abnormality was raised on a number of occasions by many in the Chamber.  Many of the calls I received have been about that issue.  As to whether it deserves consideration at this time, I am not too sure.</p><p>  The role of GPs, which was referred to by many Members here, is most important.  The GP, for anybody, whether a mother, a father or a child, is the first port of call.  We need to rely on the expertise of the GPs.  In my view, that is honest and open.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.692" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100048#XX00200"><p>I will start by thanking the Chairman for accommodating me as a substitute member of the joint committee, for his engagement prior to the hearings with regard to people coming in and for his subsequent chairing of the joint committee, which was good.  That said, the process was very rushed.  While that was not the Chairman's fault, it was rushed both for members and for those presenting, as some of the latter have noted subsequently.  Despite this, however, it has been quite productive.</p><p>  The question all members will ask themselves is what they have learned from these hearings.  Before the proceedings began, for example, members knew the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case in the European Court of Human Rights did not involve suicide.  They learned that the circumstances of the C case were covered adequately by current medical practice on the treatment of cancer patients and this point was stated here emphatically.  They also learned, which they probably knew, that the European Court of Human Rights required not legislation but clarity surrounding the treatment to which Miss C was entitled.  They learned an interesting point today in respect of the X case, which is that where an argument in the Supreme Court or any court is conceded, it loses its evidential value and therefore, it only binds the parties in that particular case.  This was the incontrovertible evidence presented to members today.</p><p>  A number of those who presented today stated we are not required to legislate in this instance.  I took particular note of the comments of the eminent former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice McGuinness, who stated that over the past 21 years, Governments did not act unconstitutionally by not legislating.  Members also learned, although they probably knew it from the previous hearings, that it is not possible to predict suicide.  A British study demonstrated that it is only correct in 3% of cases, with 97% being false positives.  Emphatically, members learned from all psychiatrists appearing before the joint committee, be they pro-choice or pro-life, that abortion is not a treatment for suicide.  I believe that was a unanimous view.</p><p>  Members did learn something that presents a challenge to the Government, namely, that where a woman presents with a crisis pregnancy and in distress seeking an abortion and is not mentally ill, she is entitled to refuse other treatments such as psychotherapy or home visits that might be offered to her.  If she still refuses, she then will be entitled to a certification to allow her to have an abortion.  Because of her distress, she will perceive her only solution to be a termination of the life of the baby.  This presents a significant challenge and from what I have heard in recent days, I believe that what the Bill is most likely to deal with under head 4 are cases of suicidal intent not associated with mental illness.  I believe, as stated by a number of witnesses, that both in law and in practice, this is a highly significant change from the current position.</p><p>  Members also learned, which certainly has concerned me and I expect most members of the joint committee, the psychiatric profession is divided and more or less polarised on the issue.  If, as has been suggested, pro-life psychiatrists do not participate or the selection process is skewed or both, my honest opinion is that Ireland will have a liberal abortion regime within a short period.  As the debate progresses, I genuinely hope the Government will pay attention to and act on the evidence presented generously to the joint committee over the past three days by those who appeared before it.  This did not happen on foot of the hearings last January and in this instance, I appeal to the Government to pay close attention to the points made, which summarise much of the evidence that came before members.</p></speech>

I also say well done to his staff at the top table.  The Chairman kept everyone under control and a very good exercise was conducted.  I actually learned a lot over the past three days.</p><p>  In his statement to the joint committee, the Minister of State stated, for the benefit of the public, "Of course as the committee is fully aware the next phase is the drafting and publication of the Bill".  Can he provide a timescale of when that publication will take place?  From the first page of his statement, I understand he intends to take into account the submissions that have been made during the past three days.  Again, he should elaborate a little in order that people, including me, are assured these submissions will be taken into account.</p><p>  Three areas really stood out for me.  The first was the area in respect of children highlighted by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  Many questions have been asked about young girls in care in particular and on how precisely that cohort of people will be dealt with.  I am sorry to bring it up but I have concerns in respect of head 19 and the reference to 14-year sentences.  One thing I learned in the course of these meetings is that women are importing abortifacient drugs to have abortions.  Were a girl or young minor to import some kind of drug, would such a person face criminal charges associated with that provision?  I do not believe the issue of people importing such abortifacient drugs was really discussed.</p><p>  The final issue pertains to the issue of conscientious objection, which was brought up today.  I seek assurance that there will be a balance between what will be the law of the land and the conscientious objections of the medics.  While I understand it fully, I also wish to ensure that a woman who enters the hospital will be assured of the best treatment.  Dr. Simon Mills today brought up the provision that no institution, organisation or third party shall refuse to provide a lawful termination of pregnancy to a woman on grounds of conscientious objection.  However, if, in respect of a board of management or whoever runs a hospital, this is not the case, how shall one ensure that this woman will get the treatment she expects?</p></speech>

I also thank the clerk and the secretariat for running the proceedings so well.  I feel privileged to have taken part and to have been enabled to take part as a substitute member, that is, as someone who has just come to the committee.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his clarity in addressing some of the issues that have arisen over the past three days.  All members are mindful of his comments that they are scrutinising the heads of the Bill to ascertain in what way they can improve the operation of the Bill, bearing in mind their obligation as legislators to ensure an effective and accessible procedure is available for women who seek to access the lawful abortions to which they are entitled where their right to life is threatened by the continuance of a pregnancy.</p></speech>

They have been extremely well organised and conducted.  I thank you and the staff for the work done.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and thank him for his contribution this evening.</p><p>  I came to the hearings with reservations concerning two issues.  I felt we had not done all of our homework on the heads of the Bill.  The same two issues emerged as being of general concern.  The first was head 4 and how the decision is arrived at by the two psychiatrists and the obstetrician making the decision.  The proposals from the Medical Council and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland should be taken on board.  It is interesting to see that they are both coming out with the same view.  The heads of the Bill do not adequately deal with cases where an expectant mother is under 18 years of age.  The issue must be examined carefully.</p><p>  It is interesting that it is our role to be legislators and that it is not the role of the courts.  It is important to remind ourselves again of the words used by Mr. Justice McCarthy on page 82 of the judgment in the X case: "The failure by the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate; it is inexcusable."  That comment was made on 5 March 1992, more than 21 years ago, yet nothing has changed in the intervening period.  We have a role to play as legislators and that is what we have done over the past three days.  We have examined all of the angles on the preparation of the legislation we so urgently need to deal with the issue, and also to provide clarity to those who work in the medical profession.</p><p>  I pay tribute to all of the experts who came before the committee, who gave of their time and who also put a lot of work into preparing the submissions.  No one came before us without having carried out a detailed examination of what they had to say.  They spent a long period putting their submissions together.  No matter what angle they took &ndash; even if I disagreed with their views &ndash; everyone who came before the committee was extremely constructive.</p><p>  On the completion of the hearings it is important to say to those in the medical profession that we are fortunate to have the lowest perinatal mortality rate in Europe.  We should never forget that.  It is the reason we must put supporting legislation in place to give clarity to those who provide the service on a daily basis, regardless of the time of the day or night they are required to provide the service.  I thank the leaders of all of the groups for their constructive contributions throughout the three days.</p></speech>

I regret any offence to the cat community for the latter remark of drawing an analogy between cats and Irish parliamentarians.</p><p>  There can truly be few situations where the will of the people and the voice of the Constitution have spoken as clearly as they have on the narrowly defined necessity for abortion in very narrow circumstances, ones which entirely relate to the life of the mother, the termination of which life would also by necessity result in the termination of the life of the child.  People who are pro-life need to understand what the Bill is about.  It is about saving life; it is not about ending life.  Those who allege that they have a superior pro-life position to others in that the position of those who support the Bill is somehow less purely pro-life than theirs are working on an assumption which has been tacit, and in some cases explicit in recent days, that a large number of citizens are plotting in advance to game the law, to cheat, to lie and to collude in the death of an unborn child for some secondary gain other than their own health.  There is no other way to cut this up.  That is the only interpretation that can be put on the suggestion by some that somehow the Bill will give wide access to abortion.  I just do not think it is true.  We must follow the Constitution.</p><p>  We all have positions on abortion.  It will surprise many of those present to know that I was the recipient of a scathing editorial by Doctors for Choice Ireland who pointed out that I was an anti-choice person.  I have to say I am; if choice means having the right to choose to kill someone else, I am anti-choice.  I do not support that right.  I have a very nuanced position on abortion, which is one that would not make people on either side of this House particularly happy, but it is irrelevant today, as are the considerations of evidence-based psychiatry.  We are here to defend the Constitution and in this regard let me remind the committee of the Garda oath:<blockquote>I will faithfully discharge the duties of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with fairness, integrity, regard for human rights, diligence and impartiality, upholding the Constitution and the laws and according equal respect to all people.</blockquote>We have the privilege of sitting in these Chambers without having to swear such an oath and not having to declare our loyalty to the Constitution, something which I hope will be fixed.  That is all we are doing today; one Supreme Court verdict, Article 34.4.6&deg; &ndash; the decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and definitive.  It is not a case of ignoring it if we do not like it or think it is flawed.  There is stuff in the Constitution I do not like but I will live by it and if I want to agitate to change it within the law, I will do it.</p><p>  It is regrettable that the Minister, the CEO and the-----</p></speech>

The debate became intense at times and I have the utmost respect for people and their views.  For me this debate is about women, pregnant women.  The reality is no one knows more about pregnancy than women themselves.  I do not want to insult any of my male colleagues and I know men play their part but they do not become pregnant.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that there were times I found the debate here offensive.</p><p>  As a woman, a mother and the mother of a teenager, I support this legislation for the X case.  I know personally it is not always possible to save both mother and baby.  I believe we must protect our doctors in the rare event that the mother's life is at risk and a termination is required.  Where a woman with serious heart disease is pregnant and needs a termination to save her life, I would like to think she could have the termination in this country and would be able to avoid the distress of travelling.</p><p>  As I asked in January, what about the parents who have a 14 year old daughter who was raped and made pregnant and may be suicidal?  Parents along with that daughter must make a decision.  I know not all but most parents would do one thing.  I have concerns for children in care who are in that position and that position must be clarified.</p><p>  There must be some changes to the Bill and I look forward to further debate as the Bill goes through the Houses.  I am proud to be part of the Fine Gael parliamentary party and I am proud of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Government for bringing forward this Bill to protect women in the future during pregnancy and for saving lives, not killing babies, saving women's lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.706" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100050#ZZ00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his professionalism during the last three days and the entire team for the way the hearings have been carried out.  It has been a pleasure to be here.  To have had access to the level of expertise we have had for the last three days has been humbling for someone like me.  To hear their opinions, expert and personal, has been hugely informative and I have been struck by the things I have learned in the last three days that I have not considered before.</p><p>  I never thought I would be an expert in anything but I have decided I am an expert, I am expert on me.  I am a woman who has been pregnant five times and I have four truly great children.  I do not want there to be any legal doubt whatsoever for any of the doctors who made a presentation before us, or any of the wonderful people who deliver babies in this country and provide medical treatment to women, or any legal doubt, pause or cause for concern in how they would offer treatment because of a lack of clarity in the law.  On that basis, I am very pleased we will bring clarity to the law.</p><p>  On the suicidality element of the legislation, I have thought about this long and hard, particularly thinking of my own children, and such an awful thing happening to anyone I care about deeply as happened to the young girl in the X case.  I have come full circle and decided I would want clarity not just in the assessment of eligibility but in the speed and swiftness of the action if anything like that ever happened to someone I love.</p><p>  I am glad that the last three days have provided clarity for many people, not just in these Houses, but in the wider population.  I am proud to have been part of this process and I urge speed in enacting this legislation before the summer recess.</p></speech>

Many issues have been raised on elements of the Bill and it is clear there are many areas where it must be strengthened.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the one contentious issue is that of head 4 and suicide.  Over the last three days of hearings, we have spoken in abstract on the issue of suicide and mental health but the reality is that suicide occurs in this society on a daily basis.  The real issue of mental health and suicide should be a focus, with the necessary resources made available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-21a.709" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013052100051#AAA00200"><p>I thank all Members for their contributions in the past three days, specifically during the closing session of this extremely important process of pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the Bill, for which I have the privilege of being present.  I thank the main speakers of the main Opposition parties for their initial contributions, in particular Deputy Billy Kelleher for his extremely helpful insights.</p><p>  When I stated my belief that there was a large measure of agreement throughout the three days of hearings, I was not oblivious to the considerable discussion that had taken place on head 4.  I was simply pointing out that I believed there was a reasonable measure of agreement, a conclusion I reached primarily on the basis of the relative silence on many aspects of the heads of the Bill.</p><p>  While I accept that Senator Walsh would have preferred the debate to have lasted longer, three days of discussion would be considered reasonably lengthy in anybody's book.  I am sure all the concerns people have about aspects of the heads of the Bill were given some airing during the course of the hearings.  From my observation of the deliberations, I share Deputy Kelleher's view that head 4 is the area of greatest concern.  This was evident in the discussion. </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is correct that the hearings were a very useful exercise in democracy.  I was a Member of the Seanad, the House which normally sits in this Chamber, before my election to the D&aacute;il and appointment as Minister of State.  Parliamentarians on all sides may sometimes wish to have an opportunity for greater scrutiny of legislation.  The scrutiny of the legislation before us has provided important insights which will be extremely helpful to the Government.  Irrespective of which side of the argument one is on, all of us will agree that this has been an extremely positive exercise from the point of view of public elucidation, elaboration and questioning of issues.  </p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne stated she was proud to have been involved in this process and noted the level of expertise that was made available to the committee.  Her point is well made.  We should be thankful that such a high level of expertise is available to us and independent experts are willing to come before the committee, give evidence and subject themselves to what is essentially a cross-examination by Members. </p><p>  I thank Deputy Seamus Healy for his contribution.  The Deputy commented on a number of specific aspects of the heads of the Bill that he and others wish to have addressed in the period ahead.  He referred, for example, to the definition of the term &quot;appropriate location&quot; and alluded to the stringency and extent of the criminal sanction provided, the periods to be allowed for review and the issues of consent and monitoring.  I emphasise that all issues raised by Deputies and Senators in the course of the debates will be considered.  I want to give people the comfort, respect, courtesy and assurance that everything that has been raised here will be considered and addressed in the preparation and publication of the Bill. </p><p>  Deputy Ciara Conway made a fair point that, at least on one view, society, the country and Parliament are somewhat overdue in addressing this issue.  Those of us who argued in the past that it was taking too long to address this issue can now cease doing so.  Let us get on with the process that is required.  While I agree with the tenor of the Deputy's remarks, I am glad, as she is, to be part of a deliberative process that is finally bringing forward legislation.  I also accept the point made by Deputy Conway, Senator Bacik and others in respect of head 19 that the offence or restated offences has been cast, at least in one view, in relatively broad terms.  We will consider this matter.  The chief medical officer, Dr. Holohan, also made this point on the first day of the committee's hearings. </p><p>  I thank Senator van Turnhout for her most insightful contribution.  She and others raised a concern about the differential treatment of a risk to life based on physical risk as opposed to a risk to life from suicide.  As colleagues will be aware, the expert group addressed this issue.  The language that has been used and is reflected in the Bill comes at least to some extent from the expert group report, which stated the following:<blockquote>Finally, the role of the psychiatrist is key where a termination of pregnancy is prescribed as appropriate treatment in case of suicidal ideation/intent. There are recognised clinical challenges in correctly diagnosing expressed suicide intent, for instance, the absence of recognised clinical markers.</blockquote>The issue was, therefore, addressed by the expert group.  I thank the members of the expert group, including Mr. Justice Ryan.  While I accept there has been some debate about the group, on any reading, its report is a rigorous treatment of the issue which provides an extremely helpful background and foundation for the work we are doing.  </p><p>  I listened to the comments of Senator van Turnhout and others on penalties, sanctions and appeal times.  On the two periods of seven days provided for in the heads, it is important to emphasise that these periods are maxima as opposed to prescribed periods.  If the persons who are to consider the review have been empanelled within two or three days, the clock stops and the second seven days within which they must make their determination begins.  The periods are maxima which arise from genuine concern in respect of the practicality and pragmatic requirements of bringing together professionals in the field in one place to do this work.  The periods were set down as a result of a practical consideration and have certainly not been born of any other motivation. </p><p>  I appreciated Deputy Catherine Byrne's comment that the time was right for the Bill.  She and other speakers also raised the issue of foetal abnormalities.  I believe it would be fair to describe her view as one of regret that it has not been possible to address this issue in the legislation.  It is regrettable that this is the case.  The issue may be revisited either by the Houses or the people at some future time.  If I may express a view, I would support such a course of action although it is not something that can be addressed in the context of this legislation.  </p><p>  Senator Jim Walsh makes a reasonable point, albeit one with which I do not agree, in asking what was the requirement of the European Court of Human Rights.  The decision in the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case required clarity, as the Senator acknowledged.  The Government decided that the best way to ensure this clarity was by means of primary legislation to be followed by regulations.  The Oireachtas makes the law and it is necessary to provide clarity to medical professionals. </p></speech>

All submissions will be carefully considered and taken into account.  She also raised the issue of the breadth of head 19 and expressed concern about the importation of abortifacients.  All of those issues and concerns will be addressed.  The Deputy also raised the issue of conscientious objection.  She spoke about the fact that conscientious objection can be invoked by a practitioner but not by an institution.  That is very important.  An institution cannot invoke the protection of conscientious objection.  Only an individual can do that.  There is a further provision in the draft legislation that where an individual practitioner invokes conscientious objection, steps must be taken to ensure that the care is given, nevertheless, by a colleague or someone other than the person exercising that objection.</p><p>  Senator Bacik asked that we look again at a number of specific issues.  She raised the "appropriate location" question and I understand her point in that regard.  I also understand her point about the requirement for a psychiatrist to be attached to a particular institution.  Indeed, I would make the same point to her in respect of the time limit.  These are maxima but still, I take the point that she raises.</p><p>  I thank Senator Burke for his contribution and his reflections on head 4, particularly his concentration on the issue of minors.  He raised particular concerns in this regard in the course of these hearings, as did others, and those concerns will be addressed.  I agree with Senator Crown's ringing invocation of the Constitution and the importance of the Constitution as the foundation of our laws.  I absolutely agree with him in that regard.  </p><p>  I am sorry if the impression was given that the Minister, the chief medical officer or the Secretary General of the Department would be present throughout the course of these hearings.  It was never my understanding that it would be so.  There was no discourtesy intended to the committee.</p></speech>

The proceedings are being monitored and will be considered carefully.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked us to take on board key learnings and best medical practice.  I say again, at the risk of repetition, that everything that has been said here will be considered.  I must say, however, that the Government will introduce this legislation to the Houses.  The Government will do that.  The Government will introduce this legislation and it will certainly be based, in large part, on what has been before this committee in recent days, namely, the heads of the Bill.  There is always scope for addressing technical questions, amendments arising from technical issues that have been raised, drafting issues that have been raised and so forth.  Sometimes unintended consequences emerge in the course of debates and these issues can be addressed too.  That is why these deliberations were so useful because they will help us to improve the Bill as we go forward, but a Bill there will be.  A Bill there will be, I must say that.</p></speech>

However, it remains the clear intention of the Government that this legislation will be enacted, subject to the agreement of the Houses, by the summer recess, which is the end of July.  We are getting pretty close to that in terms of parliamentary schedules and so on.  If members work back from the end of July, they will see that it will be necessary to publish the Bill in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Senator Henry is absolutely right and I agree that this debate is about women's lives.  While public and parliamentary deliberations are not confined to one gender, the Senator is right when she says that this is about women, their rights and their lives.  I agree with her on that.  I thank Deputy Regina Doherty for her contribution on the necessity to bring clarity, which is what we are doing with this legislation.  I understand the points made by Deputy Naughten and heard his contributions over the course the three-day hearings.  He referred to head 4 and expressed concern about some of the issues that arise there.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman, the committee secretariat, the members of the committee and all of the Members of the Oireachtas who took part in this debate.  It is important that they did so.  The Government has introduced a very useful pre-legislative scrutiny process, not just in regard to this Bill but others too.  I thank everyone for their contributions and look forward to further co-operation and close work on this Bill, which will be required over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

We have had almost 30 hours of hearings, 40 expert witnesses appeared before us and on average, between 18 and 20 Members of the Oireachtas have participated in the discussion on the heads of the protection of life during pregnancy Bill.  I wish to address my remarks to two audiences, if I may.  First, to the people who are watching and listening at home, whether on Twitter, <i>journal.ie</i> or the Oireachtas website, what we have been doing over the course of three days is discussing the draft heads of a Bill.  This is a draft document which sets out the objectives and the main provisions of that proposed Bill.  It provides a framework, but not the detail.  It is not the final Bill, as the Minister of State has said.  It is not the new law but rather a preliminary document which is to be used to facilitate discussion and consideration before producing the Bill.  It is part of a pre-legislative consultative process.  I am very heartened by the number of people who have listened to and followed this debate through a variety of media and I wish to thank them for that.</p><p>  In reforming the Houses of the Oireachtas, this Government has referred heads of Bills to committee.  Indeed, this is not the first time our committee has considered a Bill on this basis.</p></speech>
