    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800003#G00200"><p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to come before it and make a presentation.  I am a dietician and manager of the Nutrition and Health Foundation.  I have worked with the foundation since 2008 and prior to that I worked in hospitals, GP settings, food law research, private practice, public health nutrition and in the food industry.</p><p>  With the Nutrition and Health Foundation, the consumer is the principal concern and the heart of our mission, which is to promote a healthier Ireland through co-operation with industry, internationally recognised scientists, key health professionals, the Government, its agencies and the consumer.  It is about promoting a balance between physical activity and good nutrition, which is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  All relevant stakeholders must work in partnership to promote this message and make a real difference to Irish society.</p><p>  Since 2005, IBEC's Food and Drink Industry Ireland has invited different organisations to join the foundation to jointly address the health challenges.  This multi-stakeholder body provides consumers with evidence-based information on nutrition and physical activity to help enable them to make informed lifestyle choices.  To date, more than &euro;2 million has been invested voluntarily in the organisation by a number of food and beverage companies.  The initiative may come from the industry but the foundation takes direction from its council, which is comprised of industry and non-industry stakeholders.</p><p>  I have provided a full listing of members in the presentation and in the interests of time I will not go through all of them.  Examples include Glanbia, Mars Ireland, Coca-Cola, Danone, Kelkin, the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute - the professional body for dieticians in Ireland - the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, and academic institutions like UCD, UCC, DCU, St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra, etc.  It is about bringing together the different and relevant stakeholders with an interest in health to the table and working together.</p><p>  It is a multi-stakeholder partnership approach, and contribution from all supporters is essential.  All activities must be agreed by all stakeholders.  The foundation does not speak on behalf of the industry, defend it or lobby on behalf of food companies.  We are focused on the health agenda, with aim being to promote positive messages of balance within diet and lifestyle.  We also ensure messages are compliant with the Government and other stakeholder messages.</p><p>  There is the important question of what the foundation can do.  It is about bringing balance to the obesity debate through evidence-based information on nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle.  This is a multi-stakeholder group, with key professionals such as Professor Pat Wall, Professor Mike Gibney, Professor Donal O'Shea and Professor Niall Moyna, as well as non-governmental organisations and representatives from the industry.  It is very much about thought leadership and comprehensive communications and initiatives.</p><p>  There is also the question of what can be done for the foundation.  That issue is about recognising, supporting and publicly endorsing the work of the foundation through party or individual statements.  We all have a responsibility with regard to obesity, irrespective of the sector in which we work, and we must work together.  There is a workplace well-being campaign that will be partially funded by Food and Drink Industry Ireland's Live Well initiative, which I know the committee has heard of previously.</p><p>  One aspect of the foundation's activities is to enhance consumer understanding.  I have brought a sample copy of a booklet that has just been launched, entitled Eat Smart, Move Smart.  We have done this in working with the Camogie Association of Ireland, and it takes in nutrition, physical activity, food and supplements.  It deals with different questions that teenage girls and players brought up with regard to lifestyle issues.  It is a toolkit to try to promote continued involvement of teenage girls in sport.</p><p>  We work with the European nutrition foundation network and we have developed a European food framework for use either in schools or outside them, targeted at six to 16 year olds, taking in nutrition, physical activity and energy balance.  One cannot discuss energy in without talking about energy out, and there must be balance in the lifestyle.  There is also the Kids Size Me, an initiative taken with the Restaurants Association of Ireland to deal with providing child size portions of adult meals in restaurants.  It will work in addition to a children's menu, because when something is taken away, people look for it.  It is about providing greater choice for parents and children when in a restaurant, and we have developed nutritional guidelines where meals are prepared that may be consumed by children.  The initiative also extends to drinks and desserts offered.</p><p>  We also work in research to enhance consumer understanding, and we have been involved with lifestyle behaviour change for general practice, which relates to a paper published by the Irish College of General Practitioners.  There was partial funding of the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance teenager survey from 2008, with our own research taking in motivational aspects of behavioural change.  We are very much involved in research either as funders, partial funders or in an advisory capacity.</p><p>  With regard to communication, we have been working within the Houses of the Oireachtas to lobby on the obesity issue and ensure it remains on the political agenda.  We are also looking to work with the catering team on portion sizes and healthy options on menus.  The work is ongoing, although there is great sadness because Mr. Don Rice has retired.  I hope to work with Ms Gr&aacute;inne Barrett in future, although Mr. Rice was a great advocate and is sadly missed.</p><p>  The workplace well-being campaign is an initiative taking in workplace nutrition and physical activity, and free booklets are available to employees.  There is information on what can be done during a working day with regard to nutrition and physical activity and improvement of overall choices.  We hope that message will filter into homes.  We have more than 100,000 employees and in excess of 300 organisations involved in that programme to date but we are looking to expand.</p><p>  We also did work on Eat Smart week, a healthy eating week.  We work with chefs and different organisations, and this year we dealt with My Kids Time.  This shows people that healthy eating does not have to be complicated, expensive or boring.  There is certainly an image of healthy eating by means of a carrot stick and lettuce leaf, when everyone else is getting stuck into a steak and chips.  The information is available through the website.  A balance to the healthy eating side of the process is the Move Smart week, which is about being out and physically active.  No matter what we eat, we must burn off calories as well.  The campaign was about showing that physical activity is not boring or hard to do and about showing easy ways to do it.</p><p>  We also have a consumer-friendly website that takes in both nutrition and physical activity, as they go hand in hand and we cannot speak about one without the other.  Anything we do is publicly available.  We are working with the Spurling cinema group to carry out a survey of consumer behaviour at the cinema.  It asks if consumers purchase food going into the cinema or outside it, what they purchase, the portion sizes, etc.  This will indicate whether we can undertake an initiative taking in healthy options in cinemas, although that will depend on what consumers tell us.  For example, they may argue that the cinema is a treat area and should be left alone.  Nevertheless, we must get an idea of people's perceptions and behaviour when they go to the cinema.</p><p>  We also have an annual seminar, which was kindly opened by the Chairman this year.  That examines the role of public and private sectors in tackling obesity, bringing different groups to the table and offering the opportunity for members of the public to ask questions.  It involves national and international academics, as well as representatives of the food industry and non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>At the seminars, national and international academics, the food industry and NGOs address and debate research and initiatives in the fields of nutrition, lifestyle and physical activity.  People can avail of this work as a networking opportunity.</p><p> It is important to acknowledge that many factors play a role in the prevention and management of overweightedness and obesity in Ireland, including Departments, education, the food and beverage industry, sectors that are responsible for physical environments and the social and community sectors.  A co-ordinated, united, cohesive approach is necessary if we are to address obesity.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I will happily address the questions they may have.</p></speech>

Her presentation was interesting.  Beyond what has been done to date, what can the committee do to promote her work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00400"><p>Acknowledgement of the work in party and individual statements.  As we have initiatives that may be of interest in members&rsquo; constituencies, the committee could convey that information.  Information on what we do is freely available through our website, for example, the workplace initiative and seminars.</p><p>  The booklet is available to download for free on the Camogie Association of Ireland website.  We will put it on our website shortly.  The hard copies will be for sale and can be pre-ordered for &euro;7.99, which is not expensive.  It is another opportunity to convey healthy messaging, particularly to teenage girls in school.  As they might have jobs and are trying to study, etc., a balance must be brought to their lives that sees them being physically active.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00500"><p>I thank Dr. Cullen for her informative presentation.  Does the growing poverty trap mitigate against the foundation&rsquo;s efforts to encourage healthy eating?  Many people, particularly low income families, find healthy eating difficult.  People will go for the cheapest food.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00600"><p>While that is the behaviour, we must send the message that people can buy cheaper cuts of meat and still reduce the fat content through the way they are cooked.  The same applies to frozen fruit and vegetables.  Fresh can be more expensive, although it depends on where one shops and what is available.  Frozen fruit and vegetables are not as expensive and one need only use what one needs without wasting anything.</p><p>  The message must be that healthy eating need not be too expensive or require the freshest food available.  Often, frozen foods can be more nutritious, in that they are flash frozen immediately after being picked instead of sitting on shelves during transport and losing nutrients every day.  It is just a matter of shopping wisely and encouraging people to make better choices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00700"><p>I thank Dr. Cullen for her presentation.  In today&rsquo;s society, we can see the problems with obesity that future generations will face.  Conveying the message is important.</p><p>  Dr. Cullen mentioned that the foundation incorporates 14 industry members from which it receives &euro;2 million in funding.  From where does the rest of the funding come?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00800"><p>Funding is purely from the industry.  The &euro;2 million relates to the past seven or eight years.  Each company pays.  I would love for more companies to be involved, as it would mean more money for me to do more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H00900"><p>That was where I was going with my next question.  Over seven years, 14 companies in the industry have provided &euro;2 million.  I am disappointed that more names are not on that list.</p><p>  When funding is lacking, it is difficult to get the message out.  This committee has an onus.  As Dr. Cullen stated, the Nutrition and Health Foundation, NHF, does not make recommendations on any product.  It is neutral.  However, it would be of the utmost benefit to us.  I am new to this committee in that I have only been a member for one and a half years and am only now discovering that something like the NHF, which relates to the nation&rsquo;s health, is underfunded.</p><p>  I do not know what interaction the NHF has with the HSE or the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Health.  Do they provide funding to convey this message?  Relaying it would benefit the country.  Obesity is a problem in other countries and we are destined for the same, given people&rsquo;s lifestyles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H01000"><p>Yes.  To be honest, we have not approached the other sectors for funding, as we recognise that these are financially constrained times.  We have a relationship with the Department of Education and Skills and we liaise with the Department of Health to ensure that our activities are in line with the recommendations and to make the Departments aware of what work we will undertake.  We also make the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine aware of what we are undertaking and would like to undertake.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H01100"><p>I thank Dr. Cullen for her interesting presentation.  From a communications point of view as much as anything else, the NHF seems to do excellent and important work.  Does its work cross over with the work of other agencies?  In a way, Senator O'Neill stole my question when he asked about how the NHF links with State agencies, and <i>safe</i>food forms part of this industry.</p><p>  I am trying to understand the NHF's background.  Dr. Cullen stated that it does not get involved in lobbying.  For example, the issue of cheese was considered recently by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  Was the NHF involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H01200"><p>No.  We will start considering such work, but there are a few elephants in the room, as we call them.  Given the fact that industry and non-industry actors are at the same table, there are divergent opinions on some issues.  However, we will consider this area to determine whether we can develop position statements.</p><p>  There are cross-overs with other agencies, for example, <i>safe</i>food and the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI.  The entire point of the NHF is to bring these groups together.  Historically, debate centred on whether something was the private or public sector's fault.  Everyone happily blamed everyone else.  The NHF aims to cut that out and to get people to work together, as everyone has a responsibility and a role to play.  If we are to achieve something, we must stand up at the table, be invested in health and work together on moving the situation forward.</p><p>  Each of the organisations has its own activities.  Under the umbrella organisation of the NHF, organisations work together on different activities to avoid cross-over.  Anything that we undertake is agreed by all of our industry and non-industry members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H01300"><p>I thank Dr. Cullen for her presentation and I apologise for missing the beginning.  I needed to step outside for a minute.</p><p>  One of the slides in the presentation referred to bringing balance to the obesity debate through evidence-based information on nutrition.  Where is the debate unbalanced or what type of balance did Dr. Cullen mean?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Muireann Cullen" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800004#H01400"><p>There are a number of aspects, for example, the demonisation of the food industry or particular foods.  It can be easy to claim that something is the fault of the energy in side, but we need to consider the energy out side as well.  As a nation, we are not as physically active as we used to be.  Levels have gone through the floor.  From research in the United Kingdom that will probably show to be the case in Ireland also, we know that carrot consumption has reduced in the past 60 years and that physical activity levels are abysmal.  We would be lucky if 10% or 15% of teenagers met the requirements for physical activity.  The same applies to adults.</p><p>  It is a matter of achieving balance.  Speaking as a health care professional, there is no such thing as a bad food.  What matters is how often one eats it, how much of it one eats and how one cooks it.  If one has a nice shiny apple and then deep fries it, one is doing it no favours.  It is down to moderation.</p><p>  My friend has a great expression that I love: "If you are sitting on it, you ate it."</p> <p>We need to get up, get moving and be physically active.  People do not realise how much effort it takes to burn off the calories we consume.  A standard confectionery bar can be equivalent to 45 minutes on a treadmill.  Have it as a treat but one should not have it on a daily basis or three or four of them in a day.  There are many such foods.  It is about moderation and conveying the message that we need to burn it off.  We all have that responsibility and a role to play, be it the Government, industry, non-industry or the consumer.  We have the power as consumers over the food we purchase and industry responds to what is being purchased.  If we opt for healthier options all the time, industry will respond to that.  It is reformulating products and looking at different portion sizes.  We, as consumers, also have the power.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of the meeting.  I am looking at the list of members, industry and non-industry.  I am pleased to see that St. Angela's College, which is beside my home, is working with the foundation.  Does the foundation deal with schools or liaise with secondary schools and third level colleges?  Do members visit the classroom to talk to people?</p></speech>

On a day to day basis, it is myself and another person working half-time.  At present, I am fortunate to have interns with me as well, but they will leave at some point.  We have developed the European food framework through the European Nutrition Foundations network, which I am happy to circulate to people.  It is basically a guidance for use either in schools or outside regarding nutrition, physical activity and energy balance from five or six years old to 16 years of age.  In some schools the social, personal and health education, and the healthy eating aspect, is very much promoted, but in other schools it is not promoted as much.  It depends on the focus and recognising there are time constraints from a teacher's point of view as well.</p><p>  However, it is about getting that message out in as many ways as possible and trying to find different ways of doing it, such as the Kids Size Me initiative, the cinema work and the camogie booklet.  It is a case of trying to find alternative routes, because many areas are very crowded.  Hopefully, people will hear the messages in different areas and then come across a booklet or whatever it might be, and seeing that in other areas as well.  It is trying to get the message through subliminally as well.  However, it is very much about positive messaging and encouraging people to get out, get active and eat healthily.  As soon as one starts criticising somebody, it puts their back up immediately.  It is a case of: "Who are you to come along and tell me what to do?"  The approach we took with the camogie booklet is that we conducted focus groups with a number of teen squads to understand what their questions were, rather than us going to them and telling them that they need to know about X, Y and Z.  Instead, we asked them what their concerns and issues were.  Essentially, it is for them and by them at the end of the day.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting today was to let members become aware of it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Senator O'Neill referred to what the committee or members could do.  We all have websites, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts so the first thing we could do is put up a notice pointing to a link to the NHF website and the booklet, which is free online.  That would be a start.  The second thing, which has just been referenced by Senator Comiskey, is the fact that schools, particularly primary schools, have successfully developed the Green Flag programme.  Joining with that in some fashion might allow it to become a module of the Green Flag.  The programme was initially about recycling and then included energy saving, so it has moved beyond the first aspect of green.  What we are talking about is sustainable eating, and the buzzwords "eat smart", "move smart" and "energy in, energy out" are easy to message to people.  It is something we should encourage.  The fact that the non-industry stakeholders outnumber the others is a healthy sign, even though the industry people provide all the cash.  It is probably a balance one would like to see in other areas but it is hard to strike.  The autonomy of the NHF must be preserved, and I know it is.  As Dr. Cullen said, I opened this year's seminar and I was very impressed.  It included Annalise Murphy, our unluckiest Olympian, who gave a very interesting talk.</p><p>  It is a matter of creating awareness.  We are all aware that obesity exists.  Professor O'Shea and others who are doing a great deal of work on this are genuinely concerned about it.  We all have a duty to ensure that we at least keep the issue on the agenda.  When we get submissions from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, for various reasons we should continuously challenge that they are health-proofed.  We had an issue with the cheese, as Deputy Heydon said, and the National Dairy Council became very exercised by it.  It gave a graphic and factual demonstration of what was at stake and why, in its view, it was a flawed proposal.  It was agreed to withdraw it afterwards.  That is what we must continue to work towards.</p><p>  I thank Dr. Cullen for attending.  Perhaps she would send the link to that booklet to the secretariat of the committee.  We will circulate it to the members and we can put it on our social interactive pages on the web so that people can read it and realise it is free.  I suggest that members do that when they get the opportunity.</p><p>  We will suspend the meeting to allow Dr. Cullen to withdraw and the new witnesses to take their seats.</p></speech>

Before we begin I must go through the matter of privilege.</p> <p>It is a formality.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members have already been reminded of their privilege responsibilities.</p></speech>

The Environmental Pillar is a coalition of 26 national environmental non-governmental organisations.  We work on a range of issues.  We are particularly interested in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, because it has a huge impact and huge potential in terms of the natural environment and conservation.  It is important to state that all of the organisations represented by The Environmental Pillar are altruistic.  As not-for-profit non-governmental organisations, we do not represent any particular vested interests.</p><p>  I will start by speaking about the basis and the context for the greening of CAP.  The need for Ireland to meet market opportunities is most relevant.  Agriculture will play a key role in economic recovery and future prosperity in Ireland.  Many of the measures that can be funded under CAP are necessary if we are to meet the demand from across the EU and further afield for sustainably produced agricultural products.  This real opportunity for Ireland is being pursued by industry leaders.  The heads of organisations like Bord Bia and Glanbia have spoken about the need to make sustainability a national mission in Ireland.  We need to do more to make sure CAP incentivises and supports sustainable farming practices.</p><p>  The greening of CAP can help us to deliver public goods with public money.  Citizens and taxpayers across the EU have been kicking up a fuss and asking how the spending of 45% of the EU budget on agricultural payments can be justified.  The second pillar of CAP, which I will discuss in more detail later in this presentation, is the key public good justification for the allocation of CAP funding.  The greening of the first pillar is another really important aspect of these reforms.  If we do not green it as we have promised under this reform, we will put the future of CAP funding at risk.  The European Court of Auditors has identified that relatively few wider public gains have been achieved.  CAP needs to play its role in reversing the trend of declining biodiversity observed in agricultural landscapes across Europe, including in Ireland.</p><p>  The state of the environment is another reason for the greening of CAP.  The natural environment in Ireland is facing enormous challenges.  Farmland bird populations are declining more quickly than any other group of bird species.  We are facing huge water quality challenges.  Birds are indicators of the health of countryside.  Losses often equate to losses in ecosystems services which are a valuable asset to Ireland.  This tells us that we need to do more to maintain the balance of nature across Irish farmland.  We have multiple ways of meeting that objective, including the EU 2020 biodiversity targets and international commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity.  CAP can provide win-win opportunities to address those challenges and help farming to support nature.  This depends on effective co-operation with farmers, who are the curators of the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s rural landscape.</p><p>  The Environmental Pillar is adamant that overall levels of CAP funding and support need to be maintained.  We are quite insistent that there should be meaningful delivery of public goods and that harmful farming practices should not be subsidised.  Payments under the second pillar of CAP - rural development - are targeted to deliver specific objectives.  Therefore, they have greater potential to deliver public goods in return for payments.  We have seen in the last week that the second pillar of CAP is facing disproportionately severe cuts.  A cut of 13% has been proposed for the second pillar of CAP, whereas the proposed cut for the first pillar of CAP is just 9.7%.  In addition, the introduction of reverse modulation from the second pillar to the first pillar has been proposed.  This could lead to a cut of up to 25% in the funding of the second pillar of CAP, in effect.</p><p>  All of this is being negotiated at the moment.  This is really important across Europe.  The second pillar is seen as the key mechanism for us to deliver on the public good objectives of CAP.  If we allow it to be disproportionately cut, we will delegitimise the entire payment.  More and more questions are being asked about the overall proportion of the EU budget spent on CAP.  Some of the information we have on this issue comes from Eurobarometer studies.</p></speech>

If it is, the entire CAP will fail to deliver on promised green reform and will not be supported in the future.</p><p>  I will now speak about rural development and agri-environment schemes are the green backbone of CAP.  Agri-environment schemes play a crucial role in supporting farmers to introduce environmentally friendly practices and have a proven delivery for the environment.  We are asking for 50% of rural development funding to be ring-fenced for agri-environment and climate schemes.  I refer to schemes like the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, which were previously known as agri-environment schemes.  If such schemes are well designed and implemented, they can deliver targeted support to address well-known conservation problems and provide long-term assistance and much-needed income to rural communities.  This issue was covered on the "Drivetime" radio programme yesterday.  When people who were protesting outside the Taoiseach's constituency office were interviewed, they spoke about cuts in funding for rural development and REPS and called for such agri-environment supports to be reinstated.  That would be consistent with our call for the funding of agri&ndash;environment schemes to be ring-fenced.</p><p>  I would like to speak about the use of rural development funding to support Natura 2000, special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  Many of Ireland&rsquo;s most unique habitats and much of its wildlife is found in Natura 2000 sites.  Many of these sites need specific management to achieve favourable conservation status.  Appropriate farming practices must be supported.  Apart from the environmental value, farming in these areas has cultural and language associations which are also hugely important.  Natura 2000 can have significant benefits for local communities, including farmers and broader society, in terms of public goods such as water quality, biodiversity, tourism and education potential.  Ireland needs to seek higher co-financing for environmental measures under the second pillar of CAP.  At the moment, higher co-financing is allowed for measures like knowledge transfer and producer groups.  If it were to be allowed under Natura 2000, we would be more likely to be able to seize the opportunity to ensure those who are farming in Natura 2000 areas receive payments.  It would enable Ireland to respond better to the challenges facing marginal agriculture and associated natural habitats.</p><p>  High nature value farming also needs to be supported by means of payments through both payments of CAP.  High nature value farming systems have a rich cultural heritage and tend to generate lower income from the market than other farming systems while delivering higher public good benefits. There is huge pressure on high nature value farming systems in Ireland.  These tend to be the extensive grazing systems.  There is a great deal of land abandonment, especially in the west, mostly in what we would classify as high nature value farming systems.</p> <p>Given that they have lower income and provide higher public good benefits, they must be supported through the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p> There is also significant potential to support forestry and agroforestry.  Strong supports are available to foster alternative sustainable approaches to forest management.  Agroforestry is land management that combines trees and crops or livestock using agricultural and forestry knowledge to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land use systems.  It can help to meet the climate change, biodiversity and economic objectives of land management, while providing fuel wood, shelter for animals and other benefits for the farmer.</p><p> I will now address first pillar payments.  As I noted, the 30% greening payment provides legitimacy for the first pillar budget.  Most first pillar spending is untargeted. The indicated approach for the division of first pillar funds between countries - the external convergence - suits Ireland reasonably well.  Ireland must not only support the principle of greening but also ensure that greening measures deliver credible benefits which can stand up to scrutiny and deliver real improvements to environmental quality.  This returns us to my comment concerning the legitimacy of Ireland marketing its farm exports and produce based on sustainability.  If there is no substance in these criteria, we will be highly vulnerable when making such claims.</p><p> The distribution of Common Agricultural Policy funds to individual farmers in Ireland remains an area of debate.  With respect to the flat rate payment for internal convergence, studies have shown that the majority of farmers in Ireland would benefit from this approach.  Not only would most farmers gain but this approach gives equal treatment to intensive, extensive and low intensity farming.  Under the current distribution of first pillar payments, many extensive farms are, at best, operating marginally in terms of economic return and the farm families and communities associated with them are at great risk of leaving farming altogether.  This is the process of land abandonment I described.  It is also the case that this shift does not need to be front-loaded as we have until 2019 to move towards flat rate payments.</p><p> Extensive farming systems, which would be better supported by flat rate payments, often deliver goods that are not rewarded by markets.  Public goods such as landscapes and a high quality natural environment that is rich in biodiversity underpin rural communities and economies in areas of the country that often struggle to attract outside investment.  Extensive farming systems in Ireland are generally not able to match the yields of intensive farming and need to be supported to maintain farming activities.</p><p> Another area that should be supported is training advisory services.  Many of the measures that would be implemented under the rural development programme require skill and knowledge of wildlife needs.  There is currently no absolute requirement for training advisory.  The mid-term evaluation of Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2007 to 2013 recommends that there should be a more focused structure to support delivery of proactive environmentally friendly farm practices, including provision of guidance and best practice.  Good advisory leads to good compliance, which is cost effective.  This is important for short-term and long-term jobs.  There is a crucial role for providing ongoing advice if we want to be effective in the targeted schemes under second pillar.  A focused and tailored training advisory system must be incorporated into the rural development programme to maximise the extent to which participating farmers are meeting objectives.  A ring-fenced fund is required to support this.</p><p> On the issue of consultation, it is becoming increasingly urgent for all of us to address the issue of biodiversity loss and climate change.  Environmental objectives are increasingly being incorporated into the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is imperative that the agricultural sector and political and administrative process works in partnership with the environmental sector to ensure meaningful co-operation.  It has taken ten months for The Environmental Pillar to come before the joint committee.  While we are delighted to be here, we need to advance this partnership approach to develop these measures, especially in the preparation and monitoring of the national strategy plan and preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the rural development programmes.</p><p> The Environmental Pillar and its constituent organisations are calling for CAP reform to bring real public benefits.  It is these public good benefits that will assure future spending on the Common Agricultural Policy by European taxpayers.  We must do more to reward those who deliver the environmental benefits that society values so highly.</p><p> To summarise the key issues, 50% of expenditure on rural development should be allocated to target agri-environment schemes and measures.  These have a proven delivery to address known issues and we need to ensure they are strongly supported in the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Ireland should also investigate opportunities for modulation of first pillar funds into second pillar because they support the widely beneficial actions that are delivered through second pillar.  We also need to ensure we support farming in Natura 2000 and support high nature value farming.  These areas need targeted support because farmers engaged in these areas face special challenges and must be incentivised if they are to meet them successfully.  The Common Agricultural Policy must ensure sufficient funding and resources are allocated to delivering this support.  Ireland should also seek higher co-financing for environmental measures under the second pillar to support marginal farming and associated natural habitats.  I assume members will have some questions.</p></speech>

While we all accept that maintaining the countryside is fundamental to what this country and the European Union should be about, difficulties arise with regard to how one achieves this objective.  I welcome the statement that there are many aims to the Common Agricultural Policy.  Food production is one of the most important aims of CAP because none of us could survive without food.  All farmers must play a role in maintaining the environment and in some areas this role is a larger part of their job than the production of food.  This depends on whether they are in Natura 2000 sites and so forth.  Irrespective of whether a farmer is in a Natura 2000 site, where he is subject to severe restrictions in production, or the Golden Vale, where one finds the best land in the country, public interest aims are being paid for out of the Common Agricultural Policy.  To put the matter crudely, without wide environmental objectives, citizens, especially urban citizens, would stop paying their cash into the Common Agricultural Policy and the money flow would stop.</p> <p>Farmers on good land are dependent on the farmers on the Natura 2000 land and all the other environmentally sensitive land to deliver the environmental goods if they want the money to continue to flow.  There is a direct relationship with the Natura 2000 fund and the total fund and how well, within intensive farming and extensive farming, we maintain and protect the environment, which differs from area to area.  The key statement is that the CAP needs to provides incentives and specific support for positive management of farmed habitats in Natura 2000 in Ireland.  If we want farmers to continue farming marginal land, it has to pay them to do so.</p><p> That brings us to the tricky issue of ecological balance.  Michael Gibbons, an archaeologist in Connemara, who is probably known to the witnesses, took us on a hill walk near Leenane during a hillwalking festival and pointed out that there is no unfarmed land in Ireland.  In other words, it is the way it is because of human intervention.  There is no wild land.  High on hills, behind Leenane, he pointed out where the original settlement was, which was higher than the present one.  What we have and what we tend to preserve is not God-made but was fashioned by millennia of people living and farming there and creating it.  That gives us the challenge of the ecological balance.  I will be interested to hear the views of the witnesses on the debate which is taking place in the context of the commonages.  I am thinking of areas that have been subject to the efficacy of what I term prescription farming.</p><p>  Prescription farming is where a Government agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine come and put a prescription on what one can do.  Most times they do not consult the people who know the dynamic of the area, that is, the local farmers who understand the damage they have done, through the ewe premium, of over stocking but also understand the perfect balance they used to maintain until they were enticed into not so good farming practices.  My experience of prescription farming has been that it lurches from one extreme to the other, where we have had massive destocking in Connemara and now farmers are being ordered to put the sheep back on the hills.  However, somebody forgot a problem in the equation which is that if sheep are put back on the hill rather than breeding sheep back on the hill, the sheep will run back to home and will not stay on the hill.  Therefore, one cannot suddenly increase the number of sheep on a mountain pasture.  We would argue that the prescription approach, often done by ecologists, who are fine ecologists but have little knowledge of hill sheep farming, has failed and has caused damage in its own right which it tried to alleviate.</p><p> With Michael O'Toole who was a soil scientist and worked for Teagasc and was also a hill sheep farmer, we spent half a day trying to argue with the NPWS that it would destock Connemara excessively.  It did destock the area excessively and now it is appealing to the farmers to restock but they cannot do it.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' view whether the prescription approach is the right approach or whether we would be better off adopting the approach taken by the Burren project under Dr. Brendan Dunford which involves a participative approach where the knowledge of farmers is seen as useful.  It is not instructing farmers but is a partnership between different skill sets and seeing the farmer as an equal partner with an equal skill set in the operation.  The other point I would argue is that where farmers are involved - we took this approach with Comhairle na Tuaithe - they are doing what is being done not because somebody told them but because they agree with what is being done, having had an input and the arguments they put up having been listened to from an ecological point of view.  I would be interested to hear witnesses' view on that issue.</p><p> The witnesses have mentioned REPS.  Unintended consequences are the bane of every politician's life and should be the bane of all our lives.  One does something that looks very simple and looks very good, but one gets a totally different result.  REPS was great for tidy farming.  It cleaned up the countryside, put up good fences, got rid of the mattresses gates and so on.  It was very good for what I would call tidy farming but I am not sure if it was good for ecological farming because one of the things REPS rewarded was monoculture farming.  In other words, in many cases to get the money and maximise one's take from REPS, simplifying one's farm system from, say, cattle to sheep, for example, or just to sheep or cattle and not getting involved in any kind of curad&oacute;ireacht, tillage, or anything else was the easy way to comply with the REPS specification, which was very prescription driven.  One got one's money and by simplifying one's system one managed one's take.</p><p> The witnesses represent BirdWatch Ireland as well as The Environmental Pillar.  A point was made to me some years ago by somebody who knew the countryside that if one went back 60 years ago in non-tillage rural Ireland, and I remember this when I came to Connemara, that everybody was setting potatoes and sowing a field of oats.  The elimination of ploughing and turning huge swathes of the soil in the country into any type of tillage or curad&oacute;ireacht has had a huge effect on songbirds.  I would be interested to know if the witnesses believe that the change in farming style from mixed farming to what is the practice in large parts of the country where there is cattle and sheep farming has had an effect on a point they highlight in their paper, namely, bird diversity and so on and whether we need to examine that.</p><p> In the previous round of CAP negotiations I had proposed that under REPS, if people were willing to set a kitchen garden or whatever, they would get &euro;1,000 or a some specific payment for doing that.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' view on whether the current monoculturalism of most farming in Ireland has a negative or positive ecological effect.</p><p> That leads on to the next contradiction in the witnesses' paper, and while I apologise for that, these issues are very important.  I share their view in terms of the second pillar and it is fair to say that while we are all debating the first pillar, the second pillar is hugely vulnerable both in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and, as the witnesses pointed out, in the distribution of second pillar funds among the different countries once they through the MFF.  That will pose a huge challenge in terms of maintaining even a good proportion of the farm incomes that farmers in more marginal land areas and more ecologically sensitive areas have had.  That will lead to the question of land abandonment becoming widespread.</p><p> There is also a second challenge on which I would like the witnesses' thoughts.  As the greening stakes are upped in the first pillar through good farming practice and then the greening element is brought in, the justification for giving a significant REPS payment, and all the REPS measures are costed, reduces to the point that if there is a high enough greening threshold in the first pillar, it will be difficult to give any significant REPS payment.</p> <p>To put that in context, the REPS payment used to be &euro;14,000 and it came down to &euro;11,000.  The AEOS payment is more like &euro;4,000.  With all of the challenges to the second pillar, I believe a REPS payment of &euro;4,000 is more likely at this stage than a payment of &euro;11,000, &euro;12,000 or &euro;14,000.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  The higher the greening stakes are raised the better.  However, the cash needs to go with that.  Front-loading the funding back into the second pillar might mean there is cash available, but it cannot it be given out because the extra payments cannot be justified.  No doubt Senator Comiskey was involved in the negotiations.</p><p> To give an example, there was a very good REPS payment for farmers in hilly areas who destocked sheep.  Built into that scheme was a 35%  destocking of valuable Leitrim sheep, which were a lot more valuable than the Connemara sheep.  However, the Connemara farmers benefited from the very good deal that was done at the time.  Most of the farmers never realised, however, that written into the agreement was the fact that, through REPS, a certain number of sheep would have to come off the hills throughout the country.  On average, a hill sheep was worth a certain amount of money and this was beneficial to Connemara at the time because Donegal, Leitrim and Kerry sheep would be a lot better than the poor old sheep we have in Mayo and Connemara.  The costing for the hill sheep was written into the agreement.</p><p> The more the destocking fits into the first pillar, the less justification there can be for such a measure in a new REP scheme.  Therefore, there is a slight contradiction when we come to the core issue of the greening in the first pillar.  We cannot then say that despite that, there should be a huge REP  scheme.  When it comes to REPS, Europe is fairly hard-headed and it will demand that the REPS money is justified by the taking of some extra environmental action.</p></speech>

Under the current CAP, what sort of funding has Ireland received to support forestry and diversification through forestry?  In terms of the new CAP and the second pillar, is there any evidence that Ireland is gearing up to avail of what may be improved measures?  If not, what should we be doing now to ensure we can maximise income and support for farmers who want to diversify into forestry?</p></speech>

We all agree we need to protect and support the second pillar and whatever money comes into Ireland from the European Union.</p><p>  The representatives of The Environmental Pillar present say they want to support the environmental burden on farmers or land populations.  West of the Shannon we had the corncrake scheme, which was working to try to get the corncrake back, but that scheme has not been a success.  How are we to promote all farmland birds if we could not make a success of that scheme?</p><p>  I must disagree with the representatives with regard to the slide on page 3 of their presentation which relates to the move to flat rate payments.  That is at odds with the views of the majority of farm organisations and with farmers.  It seems The Environmental Pillar is trying to promote more extensive farming.  There is a moral issue here with regard to the views of the Government and those of the previous Government on Food Harvest 2020 and increasing production.  That would not be achieved under flat rate payments.  The moral issue is that within 20 years we expect to have an extra 6 billion people in the world and we will need to produce 50% more food.  How will we achieve this if what is proposed goes ahead?</p><p>  A comment was made on water quality.  The Government and the previous Government have introduced schemes and legislation, such as the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, which deals with septic tanks.  Farm improvement and farm modernisation schemes have helped to make the agriculture sector one of the best protectors of water.  It is well known that the biggest polluters of our ground water and our water in general are local authorities.  The agri-sector has done its part in improving what was a problem here.</p><p>  I mentioned the issue of the growth in world population and how sufficient food will be provided for these people.  What are the views of The Environmental Pillar with regard to the use of land for the production of food versus energy?  Perhaps that is a debate for another day, but it is a question we must face because of the expected growth in population in the next 20 years and because of the need for energy, whether bio-diverse or from fossil fuels.  A balance must be struck with regard to the use of lands, such as rainforests, for food or energy crops.  Where should that balance be struck?</p></speech>

I expect this debate will continue until we agree the budget.  It is important we set and agree a budget that is as near as possible to what we have in both the first and second pillars.  I understand The Environmental Pillar focuses more on the second pillar.  The witnesses have said that the funding for 50% of the measures in the second pillar returns to the farmers.  I agree.  What percentage of the second pillar goes to farmers currently and how much goes to communities for community projects?  Do the witnesses feel more should go to the farmer?</p><p>  I agree with many of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We worked together in the past through Comhairle na Tuaithe and on destocking.  We are now at a stage where we must try to get sheep back on the hills.  This will take some time because they must be bred there.  We had a problem in Louth when we had foot and mouth disease there and the sheep were taken off the land.  Many of the farmers involved then have got older - as has happened in the west - and are no longer able to go back farming on the hills.  The commonage debate is opening up again and, in that context, yesterday morning I received a phone call from a farmer in Mayo who took sheep from the hills when destocking was being promoted and invested in sheds and lowland green land.  Now he is being asked to put sheep back on the hills but he is a lot older now.  There are not many younger people who would be willing to do that without some incentive or help from a good scheme, like the REP scheme.</p><p>  The REP scheme was a very good scheme, but the AEOS does not offer enough.  If we had a scheme somewhere in between the two, that would encourage our younger farmers.  Now that there is not as much work available in construction, such a scheme might encourage them.  This issue will arise again in the debate on the commonages.  We must try to encourage younger people to get involved.  There is no point in depending on the farming population as the average age is increasing.  We need to encourage younger people to start farming, whether with their parents on a hill farm or with older bachelor farmers.  We must come up with a scheme that will allow this.</p><p>  I am aware The Environmental Pillar has a great interest in the bird population; so do we.  I visited Boleybrack grouse project recently with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.  That interesting project is introducing the wild grouse there.  Perhaps funding could be provided for such projects under the second pillar to encourage the use of the hills.  The suckler welfare scheme is suspended currently and any payments left to be made will be very small.  That scheme encouraged birds to come around feeders because there was always some meal lost around the feeder.</p> <p>When the farmer returned to fill it up, he always found some pheasants or other birds hanging around.  It was not intended to work in that way but it was working indirectly.  There is much food for thought.  The coming months will be interesting for all of us.  I hope we will finish up with good schemes in future that will encourage people to farm the hills in the west as well as reaching our 2020 targets, as Senator O'Neill noted, and that we will have the right balance in future.</p></speech>

We agree on most issues and points.  He referred to unsustainablility at system level and the relationship with funding.  That is an important point with regard to maintaining the overall Common Agricultural Policy budget and how important it is to justify that budget.  Another issue relates to food security and food production.  Food is a traditional tradeable commodity which the market rewards whereas the other issues of water quality or the health of the natural environment are not tradeable commodities.  The logic is that the CAP budget and public money should go to support the non-tradeable commodities.  It is important that we show we are delivering on the non-tradeable commodities if we are to justify the spending on CAP.  This is the message coming back strongly again and again from European taxpayers.</p><p>  We agree with many of the criticisms of the efficacy of prescription farming and the points about not consulting people locally.  There have been considerable problems.  We are looking to replace the prescription-based approach with an objective-led approach as per the Commission's proposals.  No one is suggesting that we will achieve the objectives we have set out or that we hope will be set out under the proposals unless there is a partnership approach.  I referred to training and advisory issues.  It is important that sufficient environmental expertise goes into designing how we achieve these objectives and into the partnership approach referred to in the paper.  That is altogether crucial.  I heard a senior person from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine say at a Teagasc conference, and someone from the Commission echoed the point, that we have set several objectives for the CAP and if we do not achieve those objectives, it will be an altogether different story when it comes to securing the funding allocation come 2020.  Achieving the objectives laid out requires participation from farming communities and local farmers who know the land as well as from those with environmental expertise.</p><p>  None of this will take place if we do not have a second pillar budget.  If the dreadful scenario - which is a real possibility - of a cut of up to 25% in the second pillar budget materialises, none of this will happen and we will not have the budget for any of this.  We will have no budget for partnership approaches or developing decent objective-led measures.  This is why we really need to defend that budget.  It is already a tiny proportion of the overall budget in the second pillar and it is being cut disproportionately.  That is really unacceptable.</p><p>  It was suggested that the rural environment protection scheme was not so good.  There were significant problems with the delivery of REPS.  When we refer to agri-environment schemes under the second pillar and putting 50% of funding towards agri-environment schemes, we have in mind the best case examples we have seen from other member states.  These are objective-led schemes that are especially targeted for specific objectives and locations.  Dr. Copland will discuss these in more detail presently.</p><p>  Reference was made to the contradiction in the paper about marginal farming, land abandonment, upping the ask in the first pillar and greening, and that there would be less need for REPS or the second pillar.  Greening is largely about ensuring that the supports go to farming in a way that is not environmentally damaging.  The second pillar is over and above that threshold for objective-led delivery of specific objectives.  There is no problem in justifying the extra payment.  There will be no issue.  There are so many issues throughout Europe and in Ireland which we know we need to address.  At the moment the budget is simply not available to address them.  We know there will not be a problem in the design and implementation of these schemes and there will be no problem in justifying that to the Commission either.  Dr. Copland has a good deal of experience in designing, implementing and monitoring various rural development measures.  He may wish to discuss the agri-environment and objective-led schemes and the justifications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alex Copland" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800010#O00500"><p>I will reply to some of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's remarks.  I was introduced as a member of various committees and it sounded as if I never actually do any work.  I was reared on a hill sheep farm in Scotland.  That is my background so I am aware of some of the issues of destocking, commonage and the lack of a hefted sheep stock.  We faced this on our farms following the foot and mouth outbreak ten years ago.  There were no sheep left that knew their way around to go back on the hills.  It is a major issue and something of which our family have had first-hand experience.  It is a serious problem.  There have been well-acknowledged issues about the destocking of commonages and the fact that there is now a requirement to re-stock areas.</p><p>  There is an issue with farming where there is a broad blanket application of these prescriptions.  This is not the way to go about delivering for the environment.  It can work in certain instances but it has been shown in the commonages that such a broad brush approach is simply not sensitive enough to deal with these specific issues.  It should be considered at least on a commonage by commonage basis and possibly even at a finer scale.  I agree with the concerns raised in that regard.</p><p>  Reference was made to how REPS encourages simplified farming.  I was interested to hear that.  There is a significant issue in the west.  We know many of our farm bird populations have declined because of a loss of small-scale tillage and the fact that there is grass all the way from Donegal to Kerry, whereas before there would have been an occasional acre of oats or potatoes.  For example, in the Aran Islands there is still some rye and there are many small birds associated with the little plots of tillage and other small crops, and they are remarkably important.  I have examined bird populations in Ireland, in particular the maps of the distribution.  Recently we completed a bird atlas and one can see that many of these small seed-eating birds have vanished from the west.  They are still in the south, the east and through the midlands where there is still some tillage.  However, the impact has been remarkable and in only 20 years one can see significant changes, never mind the 60 year timespan to which Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred.</p><p>  Reference was made to the environmental baseline and the agri-environment.  When there is an increased baseline through cross-compliance, good agricultural environmental conditions and the greening in the first pillar, there will have to be an increase within the second pillar to justify the level of payment.   However, I do not see there being an issue of the fact that there is nothing a farmer can do to get that money through the second pillar.</p><p>  Far more can be done.  There was a criticism of REPS to the effect that it was good for tidy farming but that it did not deliver too much.  I dispute that.  Certainly, it struggled to deliver for bio-diversity but I maintain it delivered substantially for water quality and it probably delivered for soils, simply because there were fewer pesticides and chemicals going onto the land.  As a result, water quality is bound to have improved.  The problem is that the monitoring, evaluation and the examination of the impact of the measures was poor.  Had there been good environmental monitoring of some parts of REPS, we would have seen substantial benefits to the environment.  The problem is that we will never know and it is a shame.  It would have been great to have presented the success of REPS in terms of delivering good water quality and in terms of benefiting the landscape.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to REPS being tidy and getting rid of the mattresses from gates, but it did far more.  It maintained hedgerows and a green and pleasant-looking countryside, which is important for people visiting Ireland for tourism.  The maintenance and character of the Irish landscape is important and REPS delivered in that sense, but these things are remarkably difficult to measure.  Unfortunately, we know it struggled to deliver when it came to bio-diversity, and that was a shame.  Nevertheless, in terms of designing agri-environment in future, there is much we can do and many ways we can improve the agri-environment schemes in place at the moment and deliver with them.  Many farmers, from the most intensive farmer in the Golden Vale to the most extensive farmer in the west, can deliver for the environment.  Whatever the level they happen to be geared towards, they can make a contribution to the environment.  That is why second pillar funding is remarkably important, not only for the extensive farmers in the west but for all farmers, because they can all deliver something.</p></speech>

Ireland stopped funding its forestry programme through the rural development programme.  It has been exclusively funded with Exchequer funding over recent years.  The Environmental Pillar has strong views in this regard.  We have many views on the fact that afforestation in Ireland should be funded through the RDP, that Exchequer funding should not be used.  We have a number of concerns about some aspects of afforestation and forestry.  We would like to see more opportunities for different kinds of forestry such as agroforestry or continuous cover forest system, with more flexibility in those grant systems.  The forestry being carried out using the system of clear fell and replant monoculture systems are not necessarily good for the environment.  We want the programme to be funded under RDP and we want to see it being more flexible in its approach.</p></speech>

I am a small farmer from east Clare.  I have a small amount of land with an agroforestry project on the land as well as some species-rich grassland.  The agroforestry measures were contained in the last RDP under the heading of access two, which was the first establishment of agroforestry systems.  We did not avail of it.  Agroforestry systems may come in under access one of the RDP in the next round of CAP.  They were contained in the draft regulation.  Agroforestry systems can possibly provide solutions to the greening aspects and can help with some of the issues raised regarding mixing land use for fuel.  In the agroforestry system it is possible to have fuel and food production side by side.  The agroforestry systems use a mixed native woodland species.  They have deeper, more beneficial rooting systems than monoculture conifers.  Those rooting systems can help with the run-off buffering for rivers and streams, and the filtering of water which cleans rivers and streams.  The leaf litter can provide nitrogen for the soil, thus helping farmers to reduce output on fertilisers.  There are multiple benefits from agroforestry systems.  I ask the committee to consider the many benefits.</p></speech>

The measure in the Shannon Callows has failed.  The reason it has failed is because Ireland has flooded ten times in the last 12 years.  This summer the callows were under a couple of metres of water.  Not just the corncrakes but everything has done badly there simply because of the summer flooding.  The farmers there are actually doing more than necessary to try to preserve the corncrakes.  It is a really unfortunate circumstance that the corncrake population has gone from the Shannon Callows.  There are also corncrake programmes in Donegal and Mayo and Connemara.  In the west, principally in Mayo and Connemara, there were 14 corncrakes when I came to Ireland and now there are more than 60.  The scheme in the west has done very well.  In Donegal the population has maintained at around 100 for many years.  The corncrake scheme in Donegal is holding on to the numbers while the scheme in the west has done a lot of work to benefit the corncrake population.  We also have a very good baseline knowledge about many of the species which need to be conserved.  We know why they are declining.  In the UK and throughout Europe many measures have been put in place to help such bird populations.  Targeted measures are the most successful.</p></speech>

We do not wish to increase extensive farming but rather to ensure that those farmers operating extensive farming systems are supported to maintain those farming systems because they deliver benefits for rural communities and for biodiversity.  Many ecosystems depend on the maintenance of extensive farming.  We do not want to see land abandonment in extensive farming systems, because this is becoming a significant problem.</p><p>  On the question about increasing productivity, there is enough food in the world to feed everybody.  The problem is to do with people's ability to access those food resources.  Ireland or Europe increasing the production of food is not going to address the problems of people who do not have enough food.  Another issue is the productive base for sustaining productivity in the future.  This is dependent on the quality of the natural environment such as soil fertility, pollinators and such issues.  These factors are not rewarded by the market; they have to be rewarded by incentives.  We need to incentivise to ensure that the productive base for agricultural productivity is maintained.  This is much more of an issue for food security than merely increasing production.  The problem now is about access to food resources and much less about not having enough food.  There are significant issues with food waste.  Increasing productivity in Europe will not address those problems.</p><p>  Senator O'Neill noted that local authorities are big contributors to ground water pollution.  There has been a significant problem with water quality in Ireland over the past 50 years.  The Common Agricultural Policy has driven intensification of productivity with the consequent decline in water quality in Ireland.  Local authority municipal sewage treatment-----</p></speech>

The water framework directive management plans for catchment areas states that each sector contributing to the problem needs to ensure that they cease contributing to the problem.  It is a very logical step to have CAP measures helping the agriculture sector to make sure that those problems do not persist.  It is the same for all the different sectors.  It might be a bigger problem in terms of ground water reserves but in terms of surface water problems, agriculture has contributed.  The CAP can do a lot to help to incentivise an improvement in water quality which is in line with other objectives in any case.</p><p>  We agree that energy production is a significant issue.  We do not have an Environmental Pillar position on that.  There is competition for land resources for the production of food or the production of energy.</p><p>  Senator Comiskey asked about a budget agreement and about REPS and AEOS.  There is great potential to deliver.  We need targeted schemes rather than a broad-based scheme.</p> <p>We are looking at working with the IFA and other stakeholders to develop something very specifically for the uplands.  This will form part of our set of targeted schemes to suit different landscape types and farming systems.</p><p> Reference was made to the benefit of having a simpler system.  That is very difficult to achieve, however, when we have a broad range of different schemes addressing different issues.  A person working in Europe with lot of expertise in this area once said to me that the system is like an iPhone.  The internal workings are complicated but one does not have to be a genius to use it.  When it comes to the various schemes, what is happening behind the scenes might be complex, but the operating system and user interface that is presented to the farmer should be relatively simple.</p><p> Regarding funding under the second pillar for the Boleybrack Mountain project, the bottom line is that if the proposed cuts of up to 25% are actually implemented, none of those types of initiatives will be possible.  We would very much appreciate some support from the committee on this issue in whatever form members consider appropriate.  The debate in this regard is ongoing, with major decisions due to be taken in the coming months.  The disproportionate cuts to second pillar funding jeopardise the entire future of the CAP and should be reversed.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily a choice between the environment and feeding the world.  If anything, the long-term viability of the farming sector is dependent, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v observed, on the maintenance of a healthy environment.  It is in this context that we are seeking a reversal of the cuts in second pillar funding.  We will have no agricultural system unless we have clean land with healthy, biodiverse soil.  That is the system which underpins everything.  When we talk about sustainability and green issues, this is the context in which we are making our case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012121800012#Q00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their contributions.  Before adjourning the meeting, I will take the opportunity to make some general remarks.  First, I am not sure it makes sense to describe a presentation as both concise and comprehensive, but it does seem a fitting description of the engagement we have had today between committee members and delegates.  I expect the latter are relieved to discover there is a great deal in common in terms of what they and the committee are trying to achieve.  Several members of the committee, and numerous Members of the Oireachtas, are active farmers.  I participated in the REP scheme and had some land designated as being invested in nature, with natural eco-tillage and as a linnet, habitat.  We worked with the local gun club to preserve bird species, with some success.  The habitat was located on marginal land on my own property.  As people who have grown up for generations on the land, we understand the need to have a healthy environment in order to produce quality food.  Without a clean environment, there will be no economic future for our families.</p><p>  The Commissioner has justified the maintenance of the CAP budget on three key principles, namely, to produce as much food as possible within the EU, to do so sustainably and to protect and preserve rural communities.  When the Irish MEPs attended a previous meeting of this committee, they referred to the greening and other measures as a public good for which people should be rewarded.  In other words, that language and mindset is already in the mix at European Parliament level and is being promoted at Commission level.  If we get a buy-in to that concept, then there is a realisation that there must be some acknowledgement.  European taxpayers have more of a discretionary spend than their counterparts in many other parts of the world.  The delegates might disagree with us on this, but the point about producing more food from within the EU is not that we would seek to deny a Third World country in so doing.  There are provisions in various agreements and protocols to protect against that.  It is not about denying a Third World country access to the EU market but rather ensuring we do not pull from the food supply in that Third World country, wherever it is on the planet.</p><p>  We are all united in our concern that second pillar funding is only now being discussed and that the discussion is in the context of a proposed significant cut.  I am not as concerned about the modulation issue because it is optional.  It should, however, be the same for every country.  There is provision for modulation in both directions within the principle of the provision.  It is not as significant an issue as we might have feared.  The major concern is that the budget is being undermined to such an extent.</p><p>  In the previous D&aacute;il I was rapporteur to the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security which produced a document on land use changes.  The document set out a formula for calculating carbon sequestration for forestry within the broader context of our greenhouse emissions obligations, whereby credit would be given for post-1990 plantations of forestry.  I have a small such plantation myself.  The formula was devised in conjunction with members of the industry and Coillte.  The delegates mentioned agroforestry.  It is my view that we need to look at a total land use policy, incorporating food, forestry, energy, biodiversity and recreation.  The CAP will play a part in all of this, and there are aspects of the greening measure and of the second pillar which can contribute to it.</p><p>  It may have been a surprise to discover today that we are agreed on the importance of preserving the CAP budget and, moreover, that we would justify it on many of the same grounds as those cited by The Environmental Pillar.  It has taken ten months to complete our discussion on the CAP, but we have also dealt with other issues in the meantime.  In fact, matters relating to communications and natural resources were within the committee's remit for a period, offering us such diversions as the hearings on the controversial episode of "Prime Time Investigates" and discussions regarding North-South interconnectors.</p></speech>

In addition, we produced a report on oil and gas, the contents of which secured all-party agreement.  The delegates might find it an interesting read.</p><p>  It is good to know that we are in agreement on more issues than we might have expected.  I assure the delegates that there was no deliberate attempt to delay their presentation or anything of that sort.  We have thus far engaged mainly with the farming organisations, the Department and the MEPs.  We are hoping to produce another document on the matter which will, of course, take account of the contributions today.  The delegates might be interested to know that I received notice today that the IFA will hold a sustainability and carbon information day in January called Growing the Agrifood Sector Sustainably.  Everybody is tuned into the importance of these issues.</p><p>  I thank the delegates once again for their contributions.  I hope they found the meeting as useful as I did.  Members seem likewise to have found it very useful judging by the degree of their engagement.  The meeting is now concluded.  We will meet again on Thursday in private session to discuss the report.</p></speech>

Before commencing my presentation I would like to inform the committee that if the answers were easy and simple we would have had them long since.  As members will be aware, many people have been grappling with the problems of audit reform.  This means there are no probably no right or easy solutions.  We are here today to tease out this issue with members and to help them understand the process.  As I said, there are no right or easy solutions or guarantees that what is decided will work.  There are almost as many different views on this as there are people working on it.  As such, we can only do our best.</p><p>  The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, has a short- and long-term solution to audit reform.  During my presentation I will explain, albeit briefly, how IAASA operates and the current model to which it operates.  I will then speak a little about quality assurance, which is what we can work to probably within a year.  I will then move on to speak about the draft directive and regulation.</p><p>  As requested, we focused our presentation on audit reform.  We can get back to the committee about questions that arise today which we may not be able to answer.  Members will be aware that there are a number of different sets of proceedings and reviews under way.  As such, another difficulty that arises is that off-the-cuff remarks by us in response to a question could put some of those processes in jeopardy.  We may have to refrain from answering some questions for this reason.  However, we will come to the committee at a later stage with an answer to them.</p><p>  IAASA had its origin in the DIRT inquiry.  Subsequent to that, an auditing review group in 2000 recommended the establishment of an oversight body under a supervised self-regulation model.  I will come back to that issue later.  IAASA was established by statute in December 2005.  In terms of size, our resources in 2013 are &euro;2.69 million, of which &euro;1.38 million is provided by the Exchequer and &euro;1.31 million is provided by the profession.  We have a total staff of 13, of whom five are in the regulation area.  Members will see from the organogram where those five people sit.  They will also note from the organogram that the head of regulatory and monitoring supervision is Ms Helen Hall.  As of 8.30 a.m. today, Ms Hall is the chief executive of IAASA and will be moving upwards, leaving us to appoint a new person to her position.</p><p>  Our current regulatory model is one of delegated regulation.  Approximately 31,000 accountants are members of prescribed accountancy bodies, of which there are approximately nine.  Some of those accountants are also auditors and are members of some of those nine prescribed accountancy bodies, which regulate those individuals.  We do not have any direct regulation function over auditors or accountants.  The prescribed accountancy bodies do the regulating.  Each of those bodies has its own separate rules, regulations, disciplinary codes of ethics and so on.</p> <p>Our role is to supervise those nine bodies.  We do not have direct regulation of either accountants or auditors.  I think it is important that members understand that is the way the Act prescribes how we behave.  We do not have direct regulation.</p><p> On the next slide, we have listed the recognised accountancy bodies and I am honing in on audit.  If one is an auditor, one must be a member of one of these recognised accountancy bodies.  That body will govern you as an auditor.  We will supervise those recognised accountancy bodies, known as RABs.</p><p> One of the important aspects of regulation is the inspection of auditors of public interest entities, PIEs.  I think members will have heard Mr. Pat Houlihan explain to the committee on 16 October what a public interest entity is - it is a company or other body corporate whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, a credit institution or an insurance undertaking.  There were approximately 1,200 of those entities in October 2011.  There are eight audit firms in Ireland responsible for audits of public interest entities, PIEs.  When we are looking at risk, the big risk is what the public interest entity will do and so that risk is scoped down to eight auditing firms.  All eight auditing firms are members of the same recognised accountancy body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, ICAI.  ICAI has its own regulatory arm, which is known as CARB.  One of the things I found when I took office as Chairperson was that one has to be an absolute expert at acronyms.  I do apologise but that is just the way it falls out.  The direct inspections of these eight audit firms who audit the public interest entities are carried out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  We do not have a role in direct inspection.</p><p> In May 2008, the European Commission recommended that there would be direct inspection, which is known as quality assurance of the PIE audit firms.  That suited the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASO, because we believe the best way to regulate is by direct regulation.  We were fortunate in that a decision was taken by the Department in July 2010 to implement that recommendation, that is, that we would directly regulate the auditors of the PIEs.  As a result, and we can come back to this in detail later, we submitted a detailed implementation plan in 2011.  We understand that its implementation is under active consideration by the Department.  When I said that there is a short-term solution or difference in approach that could come up, if direct inspection, that is the quality assurance were to go ahead now, probably within a year, we could actually implement direct inspection of auditors of public interest entities, PIEs.  That is something we can do in the short term.  Even if there is still a debate on the European audit reform, we could implement direct inspection.  Of course, it will come as no surprise that if we do that we will need resources.  We can answer questions on it but we think we will need an additional 11 staff because we will be taking over the function from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.</p><p> I hope members did not get a fright when they saw these endless lines of powerpoint slides.  I do not intend to go through them in detail at this point, but we felt it might be helpful to members to have them front and centre for the later question and answer session.  We have been working at European level with the European Commission on the Green Paper and with the Department on audit reforms.  The scope of the proposals is contained on slide 12.  The problems identified by the European Commission have been set out before.</p><p> We have 13 different strategies to address the problem of audit reform proposals.  We are happy to talk through any of them with members.</p><p> In slide 16, we have taken the proposals and given a broad outline at to whether we support them or not.  Let me give one example on the mandatory rotation of audit firms, IAASO. is supportive of that rotation after eight to ten years.  We are not supportive of joint audits, but are supportive of regular tendering.  Rather than reading out the information, I think we can come to it in the question and answer session.</p></speech>

We believe there should be mandatory rotation of firms every eight to ten years.  We are not supportive of mandatory joint audits but are supportive of regular mandatory tendering.  We are supportive of the proposal to ban Big Four clauses, which require auditors to be from the Big Four firms only.  I am assuming that members know the names of the Big Four firms.</p><p>  In relation to non-audit services, we are not supportive of an outright ban on the basis that it has implications for audit quality and the cost of audit.  We are supportive of the current APB model.  We are supportive of raising capital from external sources, subject of course to the safeguarding of auditor's independence, that is in relation to the voting rights in firms.  In relation to transparency reporting, we are supportive of proposals on transparency reporting from a public interest perspective but note that the current system of transparency reporting still needs to be assessed.  On the European passport, we are not supportive of the European passport in the context that the success of the recently introduced existing system should be assessed before making changes.  In relation to the international standards, we are supportive of the introduction of international standards across Europe.  These are already in use in Ireland.</p><p>  In relation to the proportionate application of standards for SMEs, we are not supportive of the concept of limited audits the ISAs already allow for scalability.  The expectation gap could be widened if limited audits were implemented.  It was suggested that it may be preferable to increase audit exemption limits.</p><p>  We are supportive of an expanded audit report.  The view is that additional detail on audit methodology employed could narrow the expectation gap.  It is suggested that auditors provide more detail on aspects of the audit where professional judgment was central and the considerations in arriving at such key judgments.</p><p>  If these proposals go through, it will have an impact on IAASO as it will be the potential end of self-regulation by the profession.  As I said earlier, that may end anyway if the quality assurance comes in.  There will be immediate applicability of measures if the regulation comes in.  There will be a broader definition of PIEs and the definition of PIEs will expand.  We can talk about that later.  There will be significant powers given to the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, and we will not be sitting on ESMA, as a person from the Central Bank sits on that board and we are not represented on it.</p> <p>It would give significantly increased responsibilities because then we would be directly responsible for not just audits of PIEs but of all audits and that would hugely increase our remit.  </p><p> We will continue to provide support and assistance to the Department during the Presidency and the EU audit reform dossier.  We will continue to engage with our European counterparts and maintain a watching brief on the proposals as they develop in the European Union.  We see what is happening now, what can happen in a year's time and what can happen dependent on the results of everybody's deliberations.  That concludes my presentation.  </p></speech>

We were very pleased with the nature of that discussion.</p><p>  As these are extensive proposals it was agreed that we would meet again and go through the issues we did not get around to look at on the first occasion.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Houlihan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012121800005#F00500"><p>Yes, but of a pleasant nature.  At the last meeting much of what we said was the genesis of the proposals, a depiction of the broad outline, the Council negotiations, the current state of play generally in terms of the Council and the European Parliament and providing a flavour of where they were and where they may be going, an idea of where Ireland stood in general on them but we did not get into the details of specific aspects as time did not allow.  Many of the contributions made at the last meeting reflected real and genuine concern at the financial crisis, the aftermath and the extent to which audit may have been a contributory factor in that financial crisis.</p><p>  In a discussion paper of 2011 the UK Financial Reporting Council, FRC, has interesting observations to make on the crisis.  One of its comments is that many argued that the crisis demonstrates the need for reform, others point out that companies in the non-financial sectors came through the global recession better than expected, given its speed and depth.  That introduces another perspective on the issue.  One of the key questions that arose on the last occasion and probably will arise today - IAASA may have a have a useful contribution to make on it - is the expectation gap which the average person would expect an audit to do.  One of our colleagues from the other side of the table provided useful and helpful clarity on the role and function of an auditor.  Mr. John Moynihan, an accountant, who unfortunately cannot be present, contributed on the legal obligations of an auditor.  The expectation gap is one that surfaces periodically.  It is not something that happened now.  It is a cyclical thing and arises in the wake of an economic crisis where people are trying to understand what happened and at the same time trying to find a scapegoat.  </p><p>  The recessions in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s and the dot.com bubble all ended up in surfacing the idea of what is the audit doing and why did not the auditor warn people.  There were recriminations and so on.  The manifestation of the expectation gap is cyclical because when things settle down and there is normality people do not wonder about what auditors do but they do when a crisis occurs.  The result of these crisis points had been that the auditors have been put on the back foot from time to time and have been obliged to point out that an audit is neither a guarantee against fraud or a future business success.  It is neither one thing nor the other.  The recent crisis has certainly put it back centre stage and certainly the committee is interested in it and, I hope, we will have time to go into it in greater detail later.  In May 2009, the UK Treasury Select Committee inquiry into the banking crisis questioned whether the audit function examines the right issues.  It stated:. <blockquote>The fact that some banks failed soon after receiving unqualified audits does not necessarily mean that these audits were deficient.  But the fact that the audit process failed to highlight developing problems in the banking sector does cause us to question exactly how useful audit currently is.  We are perturbed that the process results in 'tunnel vision', where the big picture that shareholders want to see is lost in a sea of detail and regulatory disclosures. </blockquote>The nuance there is that there is much information but it must be asked if much of it crucial and germane.</p><p>  The FRC document to which I referred earlier goes on to state that while we found that audit work could have been more effective if auditors had shown more scepticism.  We have established no circumstances where financial statements were materially misstated, rather corporate and financial reporting was overtaken by exceptional market conditions.  During the financial crisis the analyses that were considered reasonable at the time of the report and accounts were finalised became rapidly obsolete as markets deteriorated and the requirements of the listing regime that were intended to ensure that markets were kept properly informed of which development proved inadequate to address the exceptional developments that arose.  Audit, by itself, according to this contention, could not have prevented the collapse of the credit markets.  That could only have been achieved if action had been taken by those responsible for macro-economic affairs and prudential regulation.  </p><p>  Therefore, the theme pervading those observations is that audit is not the exclusive theatre of blame for the financial crisis and if repetitions are to be so guarded against, or avoided, that other elements in the overall mosaic need to be considered and thought seriously about.  This is part of our of our cogitations today.</p><p>  Other issues raised at the session on 16 October included the need to strengthen the audit function, the need for independence of the auditor or audit firm from the entity being audited, competition issues, whether the EU audit proposals provide for sanctions and whether it is more appropriate to address issues by means of domestic or EU legislation.  These are issues we can provide answers to as we proceed.  In my view the audit proposals address the issues I have listed.  </p><p>  To give a brief general update on the progress of the EU audit negotiations in Brussels, the debate is continuing in the European Parliament.  Various political groups and committees of the European Parliament are attempting to finalise their positions and the various elements of the audit package.  It is difficult to see how the Parliament can arrive at a common view on all of these matters before February, or more than likely, March.</p><p>  Ireland, in its capacity as Presidency of the European Council, which is also looking at these issues in parallel has provided for a significant number of meetings to try to progress matters, the first of which will take place in the second week in January.  We are serious about trying to move that agenda forward and trying to get it to some kind of completion.  We are scheduled to have a general approach, which is a title for a Council agreement on this issue, at the competitiveness Council in May.  We hope to reach that target and, perhaps, exceed it.  Recently the European Parliament was in contact with the people from our representation and were hoping we might make such spectacular progress that we could finish our work in the Council in the first couple of months of the year and move on to the next stage of proceedings which are so-called trialogs with the Council and the European Parliament.  If we got an advantageous wind behind us we must just do it but as it is an important dossier we will be striving to bring it to fruition or as far as we can possibly bring it in our six months.</p><p>  A specific matter was raised by the Chairman at the last meeting.  I can suspend my reading of it, if you wish, but I would be happy to read the clarification into the record that you sought at the previous meeting.  It is in regard to companies which operate as charities, such as sporting organisations and so on, and the cost of having to carry out an annual audit.  The Chairman requested clarification on the petition going forward in regard to charities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> this exact audit obligation and the following is the situation.</p> <p>I will read from a note prepared on it which states:  <blockquote><br />The Company Law Review Group ... 2009 Report examined this issue of extending audit exemption to companies limited by guarantee [CLGs].  It made the following recommendations: <br /><br /> (i) Subject in each case to consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the charities regulator, the audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to such class or classes of CLG which are charitable organisations (within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009) so as to bring them into alignment with charitable organisations that are not companies, provided by 10% of the members with voting rights should be able to require an audit.  [That the safety mechanism built in].<br /><br /> (ii) The audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to all CLGs which are not charitable organisations, subject to a veto right, by any one member of the company, and further subject to the requirement that audit exemption in respect of the following year, shall be an item on the agenda of the annual general meeting.</blockquote>Consideration is being given as to how these issues will be addressed in the context of the companies Bill which is in the process of publication and hopefully it will appear before the end of the year.</p><p> I would like to clarify one issue arising from what the chairperson of IAASA said which may have caused some minor confusion.  To paraphrase her opening remark, she said that IAASA does not directly regulate auditors.  In case an impression may have been created in some quarters that this means that IAASA is at a remove from the process of regulation, it is not.  It is not directly hands on involved, but it is not at a remove from the process.  The 2003 Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act requires IAASA to supervise how the PABS, the six audit bodies and the three non-audit bodies, regulate their members.  That is a key obligation IAASA has under the legislation.</p><p> Moving downwards from IAASA to the next layer, the bodies of which it supervises the regulation, those bodies supervise their members by means of by-laws, rules and regulations and under the 2003 Act all of those are required to be approved by IAASA.  In a sense IAASA has, in a slightly indirect fashion, a reach down to the individual auditors being regulated by their bodies because the rules and regulations the bodies apply must be approved by IAASA.  Therefore, reaching down to the individual auditors the obligation flows downwards, in a cascade effect, to them to obey those rules, regulations and requirements the bodies have and if they do not the bodies can take them to task and IAASA has powers under the Act to intervene.  In case discussions may have got off on a slightly wrong footing, I thought it might be sensible to clarify the position.</p></speech>

In response to a point made by Mr. Houlihan, it is probably the job of Government to make sure that the worst excesses of the cyclical nature of the economy are reduced and that it uses all the financial tools necessary to reduce those swings in the cyclical nature.  This is possibly one of the tools that can be used.  It is an understatement to say that there is reputational damage done to the auditing industry with regard to what has happened in the past number of years.  There seems to be a conflict between the job of working for a client and being the guarantor of the accounts.  There is an expectation in terms of the giving of a true and fair view of a company's accounts and it is our job to work on behalf of the citizen to reduce the gap in terms of that expectation.  To do that, we need to find a way for auditors to give a clear view of the health of a company and to be able to provide a forecast service by saying this is the health of a company and if X, Y and Z economic circumstances were to arise on the horizon, this is how the company would be able to deal with those.  That did not happen during this crisis because banks got certain guarantees and six months later those banks collapsed.</p><p>  The issue of accountability is important.  Many of the professions in Irish society would have direct accountability.  For example, when I worked as a management consultant such consultants would have taken out professional indemnity because if their advice were in some way to have had a negative effect on their clients, they would have been accountable for that.  At the last meeting John Moynihan said that auditors could be sued by shareholders but that it was not easy to do so.  It is important there is not only accountability to society in general but to shareholders, creditors and the public purse.  We probably would have dealt with businesses which gave credit to other businesses which they believed were fully healthy and would be able to deal with the economic turmoil in that regard.  What can be done to bridge that expectational gap to ensure there is full direct accountability and even to make it easier for shareholders to sue auditors in the future?  How would direct regulation contrast with the system currently in operation where there is slightly indirect regulation?  Ms Erwin mentioned that there would be a broader definition of what is meant by PIEs and she might give some detail on that.</p></speech>

An rud at&aacute; ann n&aacute; nach f&eacute;idir linn freagra a thabhairt faoi gach ceann de na ceisteanna sin.  Looking back on the transcript of the last meeting, Deputy Collins dealt with the question of the expectation gap and the role of the auditor.  The one thing we cannot do is change the role of the auditor.  The quality assurance can change that but that will be politically driven and then we can implement it.  However, there are things that can be done.</p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question on the difference between direct and indirect regulation, this all began with the establishment of the DIRT inquiry in 2000.  At the end of the DIRT inquiry what astonished the world was that directors did not appear to know what was going on in their companies.  The recommendation in the report of the DIRT inquiry from the Committee of Public Accounts was that this should never be allowed happen again.  At that time an audit review committee was set up to examine recommendations.  I chaired that committee in 2000.  On foot of that report the question of direct rather than indirect regulation arose.  In terms of direct regulation, it means being established politically and professionally and the rules being set up in a country or perhaps in Europe and then implemented by the auditors on the ground.  The auditors body, the accountancy body, checks if those rules are being implemented properly and we check that the accountancy body is doing it correctly.</p><p>  As the Deputy will know from the role he had previously, an auditor is presented to us as being a watchdog rather than a bloodhound and it is in that respect there is an expectation gap - it is between whether auditors look under stones or take what they get.  They work on the basis of the information given to them by the company directors.</p><p>  I will cover one of the key recommendations from the audit review group and from the DIRT inquiry by taking the Deputy through ten years of this sad story.  Directors would issue a compliance statement at the end of each year which, in simple terms, meant as far as we knew that they were complying with the laws of the land and with all their responsibilities, that they had put structures in place to do that and they presented that to their auditors.  A provision covering that appeared in section 45 of the 2003 Act.  When it appeared in the Act, great pressure was put on the then Minister, Mary Harney, to soften it.  Pressure was also put on the Department and on all sides and it was softened, but it passed through in a way which IAASA said at least it operates.  It is now ten years later and that section of the Act was never commenced.  That is a political issue that I would like people to examine.  Following that the Company Law Review Group was established.  It took a similar line but the Director of Corporate Enforcement in a minority report asked that the compliance statement be commenced.  A few years later in 2009 I introduced an amendment to the Companies Act. </p> <p>I took exactly the proposal of the Director of Corporate Enforcement about directors saying that they are running a company and that one can have trust and confidence in it and that this is the reason.  That has never been introduced.  Pages 44, 47, 48 and 49 of the Honohan report deal with directors&rsquo; compliance statements that have never been implemented.  It also shows that the Financial Regulator tried to get them implemented.  That is one strand that has come through ten years where no matter what we do with auditors we still have to get company directors to take a particular line.  That requires a political decision and regulation.  The approach was supported by all parties at various times.  I use it to point out how the expectation gap arises.</p><p> Most people assume limited liability was introduced to finance and economics 150 or 200 years ago in order that people would be civilised.  The payback was that directors would act honestly and earnestly and prudentially.  That was a requirement that has come through from the DIRT inquiry, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, from IAASA on three occasions, and the audit review group.  However, although it is in the legislation it has never been commenced.</p><p> It is an example of how difficult it will be to do the things that Mr. Houlihan and Ms Erwin have outlined.  They are issues that have not been grappled with.  It would be great to think that the matter could be done and dusted by May during the Irish Presidency but I cannot see it happening because I am not sure that people will act politically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012121800007#H00200"><p>I will return to a couple of questions which Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked.  The first related to the expectation gap and what the proposals contain that might improve things.  It is important to clarify the role of auditors so that everyone is clear on it but also to put it formally in the public domain.  There is talk of expanding the audit report, of which we are supportive, and giving the reader of the audit report information about certain judgments made by the auditor because up to now it is a binary report.  It is a case of either pass or fail, whereas what is being proposed in the recommendations is that more information would be included such as on materiality and the level of testing which would force an auditor to make comments about a going concern.  It will never be an auditor&rsquo;s job to give a guarantee on viability.  That is just the way commerce works but there is a recognition in the proposals before the committee that something needs to change and that there must be an expansion, in terms of communication at least.  Again, we are very supportive of that.  With public companies we must also be careful about the information that gets out in the public domain from the point of view of competition and the secrecy of the company&rsquo;s business.  One of the other good proposals that we see which should help shareholders and directors is the expanded communication that will be demanded of auditors.  They will have to give detailed information to the audit committee.</p><p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole alluded to the difference with direct regulation.  We have been advocating that for some time.  The current situation in this country is that eight firms audit the current definition of listed companies - public interest entities.  The direct regulation of those is done by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  Like Mr. Houlihan, I am fully supportive of that.  It is under IAASA supervision and we take the role seriously.  However, the firms the institute regulates are its members.  Our European counterparts have moved on from that and they have audit regulators such as IAASA doing the role directly.  It would be a case of enhanced independence as we do not have a relationship with any firm.  It would also enhance public perception.  I do not say by any means that the Institute of Chartered Accountants is not doing a good job.  I am just saying that if one removes the supervisory role to an independent authority it would have a significant benefit as it would add credibility to the process.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n also inquired about the expanded role of public interest entities.  Currently, we are talking about listed entities on the regulated market plus banks and insurance companies.  What is involved in the reform proposals before the committee today is a much wider definition.  Mr. Houlihan and I have teased that out on a number of occasions.  A wider definition would have significant implications for this country.  It is not necessarily that we are afraid of it but it would bring in many investment firms, investment funds and payment institutions and there are concerns that this may impact on the likes of this country more than other countries in that one might be introducing a regulatory process that might not be proportionate in size.  We do not have the answer to that question but it is one Mr. Houlihan has raised with the Commission and on which we await a reply.</p></speech>

A technical sub-group of the Department&rsquo;s main consultation group has been examining the proposals in detail and we are about to make a submission to the Commission.  We are questioning what the bag contains and also the subtle undertones.  I hope they are still subtle after this meeting.  We will seek clarification on exactly what is contained and why certain issues were included.</p><p>  As Ms Hall has said, in one sense it is unfortunate that we are in a minority position because of the undue proportion of companies in the financial services centre.  Only a few other member states have similar concerns.  The United Kingdom is one, and Malta and Luxembourg are others that would have raised their heads above the parapet on this particular issue.</p><p>  To demonstrate what is being done in the proposals on the expectation gap, in essence, almost all of the good features of the regulation put bricks in the place of the big hole that currently exists that constitutes the expectation gap.  There are good initiatives on the independence and conflict of interest area, the performance of the statutory audit and audit reporting.  Ms Hall has touched on that and on the appointment of the statutory auditors.  There is much good material in the proposals, which is being taken seriously at all levels in Brussels, both in the Council and in the Parliament.  Nobody is saying that it does not do enough or that we should have something more.  The Commission has the right of initiative and in some sense we must consume the helping that we are given.  Other than within reason we cannot amend what was put before us.  By and large, there is close to unanimity in the Council that this is a useful set of proposals.  Some people think it goes too far which is a sign that it is getting something right and is biting somewhere.  A similar good discussion is ongoing in the Parliament on all the key aspects of the proposal.  I hope we will end up with a decent proposal once we have winnowed out all the elements that do not need to be there.</p></speech>

The jury is spectacularly out on that question at the moment.  We would have difficulty in answering that question although we might have views on it.  In terms of what could be done, the laws must be passed.  The expectation gap will be filled in, as Mr. Houlihan has just said, by the building blocks of changes made politically.</p> <p>They will then be implemented on the ground.  If the audit is not carried out along the lines required by agreed international regulations and legislation, then they are at fault.  The question was whether somebody did not do their audit properly last time around, but we do not yet know the answer to that. </p></speech>

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question is an interesting one.  When a crisis happens we have to do two things: we look back and potentially take action and then look forward at what needs to change.  I will give the committee a snapshot of what is still ongoing.  I have to be careful about certain ongoing cases, but I am looking at the actions under our remit.  A few days after it happened in late 2008, a certain number of individuals who were members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants - I am not saying anything that is not in the public domain - were involved in the Anglo affair, to take that as an example.  In our supervisory role we were in contact with the Institute of Chartered Accountants and strongly encouraged it to appoint a special investigator.  To be fair, an independent special investigator was appointed by early February 2009.  That investigator was a previous Comptroller and Auditor General.  It was a facility under the by-laws that IAASA, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, approved to ensure that for a public interest case like this it is not just done internally, but that there is an external special investigator.</p><p>  The investigation phase happened and <i>prima facie</i> cases were found against a number of individuals and the auditor involved there.  However, because there are ongoing criminal investigations, the DPP requested that those cases be pended.  We would all agree that a criminal case must take precedence over a professional body's regulation.  Action was taken, however, on whether there was any wrongdoing.</p><p>  One may say that it is not just that.  We had seven covered institutions where issues arose.  Questions arose in the public mind and in our own minds as to what should and could have been done.  I do not know the answers to those questions yet.  We looked at our remit, however, and at what we should be doing as a supervisory authority.  We engaged with the Institute of Chartered Accountants which has commissioned a banking review to examine key aspects of the audits of all seven covered institutions.  That quality assurance review is still ongoing.</p><p>  The looking forward aspect, which is equally important, is what is before us today.  First, we must judge whether everyone did what they were supposed to do.  If not, sanctions should go into place.  Equally, however, we must ask whether what they were asked to do was wide enough and appropriate.  That is what is before the committee today for its consideration.</p></speech>

The witness said she supported the proposal for a rotation of auditors.  There may be a danger of a loss of expertise in some difficult technical areas if firms have developed a relationship with individual companies.  Have representations been made to the IAASA about this?  Multinational companies based here may have different auditors to the parent firm.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Erwin" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012121800008#J00400"><p>These are issues that we have looked at and Ms Hall might discuss them in some detail.  In essence, taking a pragmatic view and looking at the expectation gap and perceived conflict, any professional firm that is too long associated with the body it is auditing could bring about a suspicion - it may be completely unfounded - that it is getting a bit lazy and relaxed.  Therefore, we felt it was better that in time there would be a mandatory rotation.  Everybody would know it was there so they would  be gearing up to it.  A new person on the block would go in and would not really be fettered by previous judgments made either by themselves last year or by the previous audit partner.  One would feel almost obliged to support such judgments because one had started down that track.  It would, therefore, be a very useful thing to have a brand new, fresh pair of eyes looking at it, and maybe being able to ask what I would describe as a stupid question.  They would not take anything for granted but would go in <i>de novo</i> asking &quot;Why do you do that?&quot;  That is one side of the equation.</p><p>  The other side of the equation is the significant experience and expertise that auditors build up by virtue of having audited over a period of time and having built up the relationship with management.  If one has new auditors going in too often, one then has an very large quantity of management and audit committee time devoted to the learning curve.</p><p>  We tried to balance both aspects saying that while change is good, it should be proportionate.  We came to a view that there was a three-year learning period and a period of five years where one could use that expertise, but knowing that someone else would be coming in to look over one's shoulder.  As a professional person, I know there is nothing that concentrates my mind more than thinking that somebody else will be coming in to examine what I have been doing.  We said eight to ten years, therefore, although we are not wedded to either eight or ten.</p><p>  It is interesting to note that in the Netherlands they have just brought in an agreement for mandatory reporting and have picked eight years.  It could have been longer or shorter but we have a sense that it is a good thing, and it is seen to be so.  Does Ms Hall want to add to that?</p></speech>

I think Ms Erwin has covered it quite well.  I have a couple of comments nonetheless.  This is one of the questions that has probably caused most debate.  We acknowledge that there are advantages to auditor rotation but there are also disadvantages such as the ones that Ms Erwin mentioned.  When we balanced the two up, we felt that the perception of long-term closeness of that relationship probably weighed us down on the side of being in favour of it.</p></speech>

For example, the United States is considering it at the moment.  A lot of questions arose in the US about the disadvantages of auditor rotation.  There is certainly a danger that if Europe moves in one direction and we have a global situation it is going to cause difficulties.  Sometimes, however, the difficult path can be worked out if it is worthwhile.</p></speech>

The topic is live in a number of other jurisdictions, such as the United States and Canada.  We have factored in the potential dislocation if a multinational has to take on a different auditor here.  I have explored it with a number of people who know these matters a lot better than I do.  They say that while it is a bit of an issue, it is not an insuperable one.</p><p>  The topic is high up on the list in Canada and the United States.  It is eminently possible that if the EU gives a lead on this matter they may follow us.  Therefore, some people's philosophy is to dip a toe in the water and see what happens.  The debate, both at the European Council and the European Parliament, is finely balanced.  The parliament would possibly be more in favour of providing for rotation but with a significantly longer timeline involved.  As Ms Hall has just said, however, that is the key tie-breaker question in all of these proposals.</p></speech>

I have a number of points.  There is no trust with the auditing companies and accountancy firms.  The Nyborg report clarified that the auditors had a major role to play in the banking crisis here.</p> <p>When one looks at the responsibility in the food chain, IAASA is at the top and, therefore, it has responsibility for its failure.  I acknowledge it came into being in 2006 but there must be an admission somewhere along the road that the authority's regulatory role makes it in some way culpable.  Mr. O'Toole mentioned that the authority's current funding is &euro;2.69 million of which &euro;1.38 million comes from the Exchequer.  Does the balance come from member companies?</p></speech>

The ICAI was mentioned.  The institute has a view, which depends on its members who pay a levy.  The organisation is dictated to by the membership.  I am nervous about where the funding will come from as IASA seeks to increase in size.  I would rather it came from the Exchequer, which is independent.  We might not be able to afford it at the moment but this would ensure independence rather than having the money come from bodies the authority is supposed to be regulating.  That is my criticism of the current set up.</p><p>  Mr. Houlihan referred to the issue of reform.  If we analyse this properly, we will recognise that all the building blocks were in place to make sure what happened could not happen but they were not implemented properly.  I am sceptical about reform for the sake of it.  We have gone over the top in the context of regulation from a position where nothing was regulated, examined and checked to everything being checked, which is stifling companies.  The happy medium is in the centre where everyone can get on board.  As Mr. O'Toole said, the regulations relating to the responsibilities of directors need to be implemented more quickly than is being suggested because they have responsibilities.  I am a director of a charitable company and I have significant responsibilities to make sure the audited accounts are furnished.  If one wants to take on the role of director, drink red wine and quaff quail's eggs, there are responsibilities.  That happened in the banking sector.</p><p>  The IASA said it is not happy with joint audits and it does not recommend them.  Joint audits provide a double check within a company and if legislation is implemented that provides that companies must change their auditor after eight years, such audits might ease the transition from one auditor to another.</p><p>  Interested parties were invited to respond with proposals relating to the proposed directive.  What role do the big four companies have in making submissions?  What role do they have in influencing the Commission's thinking?</p><p>  The Chairman referred to an issue that also affects charitable organisations, which we hope to address in legislation.  Many SMEs are legally required to undergo audits and this puts a financial strain on them.  Will the Department include anything in its submission on the directive to protect these companies in order that they can be excluded based on size?</p></speech>

The Government is enthusiastic about a European wide initiative under which the regulated pay for being regulated.  The fact that the cost is split 60:40 will never happen again.  The Oireachtas is about to pass legislation which will require credit unions to pay completely for all their regulation and there is a strong argument that should not be case.  They feel the regulation should be paid for by the Government.  It is similar to audit rotation.  It is one of these imperfect arguments.  One can argue up and down on both sides of it but the current view is that the people who are being regulated should pay for it.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to the expectation gap.  As he said, if somebody did their job incorrectly and we overlooked that, should we not have to take responsibility?  That is a fair point but we have to find out where everything went wrong.  He outlined our annual budget and he has the list of the number of companies we work for.  The largest bodies around the world such as Fitch Ratings and others gave banks the highest rating through their own devices and not based on what we were telling them over the previous few years.  That gives some idea about how hard it is to get to the bottom of these issues but the most important issue is that no matter what legislation we bring in or what level of regulation we apply or inspections we provide for, that will never eradicate criminal activity.  Where this becomes important is that the auditor will only do what he or she is required to do under the regulations and he or she can only deal with the information given to him or her.  The Deputy makes a reasonable point about whether he or she should be able to find stuff under the carpet and asked whether stuff that should be obvious is not obvious.   He also asked whether there is stuff that we as regulators need to know and that is what this meeting is about.  We think that to fill the expectation gap, the position can be improved but nobody here will say that an international company, no matter how good their auditors are, will root out somebody in a back office in Johannesburg who is not playing the game fairly.  Trust and confidence is the most important element.  If there is not trust and confidence in the system, it cannot and will not work.  We agree with the Deputy that this is what auditors, accountants and IASA have to do.  We have to win trust.  We are rightly being questioned about what went wrong.  There is a system of regulation.  Why it did not root these problems is the question we are trying to answer.  We are as uncomfortable about aspects of this as the Deputy.</p></speech>

We have an independent non-Irish person looking at this.  We were due to meet him tomorrow but that meeting had to be cancelled.  He has gone back into the files of the accountants and the auditors and it is only when that is done that one can being to wonder about what happened, what might have happened and what should have happened and whether there was a gap in what was supposed to be done or not.  At the minute, we do not have that information.  We do not have direct access to those files.  The review will take place and we hope it will finish early in 2013.  We will then have a look at that and see what are the results.</p> <p>We do not have detailed results which show that an audit was carried out incorrectly.  </p><p> Deputy Anthony Lawlor has asked why we do not support joint audits.  The main reason is the cost involved in having two people audit the same company.  There is potential for a lack of clarity about responsibilities whereby two audits might fail to dovetail fully, creating a crack through which something might fall through.  There is also potential for a duplication of work.  The expense of having two sets of auditors would be borne by the company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Houlihan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012121800010#L00200"><p>Ms Hall has said that when there is a crisis, one looks back to see what happened and forward to prevent a recurrence.  We are at that juncture in the present case.  The proposals before us raise the bar significantly in terms of the requirements of the auditor.  If, as we hope will never happen, there are problems, we will review and look forward.  In any review we will ask whether the auditors complied with the new level of expectations provided for in the proposed legislation.  If an auditor complied, there will be no need for action.  If an auditor did not, we will ascertain how he or she failed and ask if such a failure contributed to the difficulty.  </p><p>  A member of the joint committee asked at a previous meeting if sanctions were proposed.  Sanctions are proposed in Article 62 of the directive which sets out swingeing penalties for breaches of the regulation.  A fine of &euro;5 million is provided for, as is flexibility, whereby a member state can increase it.  There is a significant disincentive for those on whom responsibility is thrust to fail to meet their obligations.  That may provide Deputy Anthony Lawlor with some solace.</p><p>  The question has been asked what legislation will be introduced on foot of the measures constituted, on the one hand, as a directive and, on the other, as a regulation.  If it is done in the usual way, the directive will be transposed by way of regulations, that is, secondary legislation, under the 1972 Act.  I suspect it will be.  It may be that the provisions will be implemented by way of amendment or insertions in SI 220 of 2010.  The regulation will have direct effect from the day of its implementation, which will be two years from the date on which it is adopted.  Where domestic legislation is in conflict with the regulation, we will have to amend it, but where there are lacunae, the regulation will have direct effect and it may be that we will not have to enact our own provisions.</p><p>  It was suggested it would be desirable to increase the audit exemption thresholds, which are at the maximum permissible under EU legislation of &euro;8.8 million in respect of turnover and &euro;4.4 million in respect of the balance sheet.  The good news is that a further increase in the thresholds is proposed in the audit directive up to &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million, respectively.  This is being negotiated and likely to be concluded under the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  Questions were raised about the response of the big four to the Green Paper and their influence on the legislation.  The big four are entitled to respond in a consultation process which is open to everybody.  There were a record number of 520 responses to the Commission's Green Paper.  It was an astronomical figure.  Even if the big four had their aunts and uncles responding on their behalf, it would have been difficult for them to reach a majority.  Nevertheless, it would be an understatement to use the word "consternation" to describe the reaction of the big four and the audit community to the Commission's proposals.  There is no evidence of undue influence on the Commissioner and they are not at all happy.  If they sought to influence the outcome by way of responses in the consultation process, the end product demonstrates that they did not succeed.</p><p>  Joint audits would be a wonderful device if they could be guaranteed to be joint audits of two of the big four companies.  In that scenario, one would have the perfect hand-over mechanism whereby one company would come on board at a particular time and subsequently hand the baton to a second.  It would be an orderly approach in a situation which was deemed to require a big four audit.  There is no indication I have come across of enthusiasm on the part of the big four to participate in such an arrangement.  A Danish colleague talked at a meeting I attended in Brussels about the experience of joint audits in Denmark and I will never forget his summary which was that with joint audit one got one audit for the price of two.  Joint audit might also be an impediment to auditor rotation and muddy the waters with too many parties coming on board.  A further difficulty is that joint audits are often not really that; there will often be a dominant partner, which would perforce be the case where a big four company was one of auditors.  A certain element of an audit would be farmed out to the junior partner, but a senior partner might still not be happy at having to underwrite that element.  While joint audits sound attractive, they lose some of their lustre following an in-depth examination.  At a minimum, there are complications.</p><p>  Legitimate concerns were expressed about the risk of the ICAI having undue influence over the IAASA, but that is not the case.  A colleague went to a meeting with the IAASA when he was new to the relevant part of the Department and wondered if there was a risk of regulatory capture.  The room literally exploded in laughter.  There is no such risk or possibility.  It will never happen.  They contribute to the funding process in the IAASA and the IAASA's powers are set out in law.  It is obliged to wield them without fear or influence, which is exactly what it does.  All players in the game accept this.  The ICAI would be the largest contributor and I have never heard it complain about providing money for the IAASA which, in turn, makes it do things it does not want to.  It is a settled system and not one I would want to vary.  It works very well.  There is a certain degree of minority representation on the board, but those two or three members cannot influence the actions of the IAASA.  I was on the board for a number of years and found those members to be very helpful and have contributed greatly to the process of understanding issues.  I have seen no difficulties in the past and see no prospect of difficulties arising now.</p> <p>As Mr. O'Toole said more articulately than I can, we are in exceptionally financially inclement circumstances.  It is very difficult to get resources or money from anybody and the prospect of switching from a situation where 60% of IAASA funding comes from the bodies to one where the State pays 100% is exceptionally remote to say the least.</p></speech>

The IAASA has not been trammelled in any sense.  If money can be obtained from external sources in a climate like this, we should continue to avail of it and be happy that it is available from these sources.  It is particularly important at a time when it is quite likely that the responsibilities, functions and duties being thrust on the IAASA will increase, as is more than likely arising from the current proposals.  In that situation I would be reluctant to mention the word "funding" to the bodies in case they get the bright idea that they should attempt to renegotiate the deal and pay less.  The Deputy's point is well founded in principle, but in a practical sense there is no issue with the funding and how it is structured.  This is not the best of times to be seeking to change a system that is working when there is no money around to fund it.</p></speech>

I am a member of one of the professional bodies and was a registered auditor for many years.  I am trying to decide whether I am better trusted as a politician than as an auditor.  I wonder about my own choices in life.  Having been an auditor, I know that auditors take their job very seriously.  The amount of regulations brought forward in the past ten or 15 years, even since I trained, has been good and everybody is happy to respond to them.  By their nature, auditors and accountants like to be regulated, know that they are doing a good job and make sure there is regulation.  We are happy to pay the levies we are paying to bodies such as the IAASA because it reassures us, which is very important.  </p><p>  In respect of the banking issue, we should wait until the report is published before we pass judgment on many people who do good work every day to keep Irish commerce going and around the world because there is so much investment abroad.  It is important that we wait and not make the remarks that others here have made.</p><p>  It is good to have this discussion.  A big issue is the rotation of audit firms, which is good.  I do not agree with joint audits because auditors would compete with one another which would not be of benefit to the client.  There is a code of ethics between auditors and professional firms whereby obtaining information from a previous auditor is never a problem.  Most people respect this and all audit firms will co-operate.  If there is a need for information gathered or a question arising, an auditor has only to write to the previous auditor who will be more than happy to give the information and clarify the matter.  The only issue about which I have concerns and on which I would be open to further discussion is whether eight years is too long.  That is a long time in any cycle of commerce.</p></speech>

There are almost 31,000 accountants and auditors in Ireland who are members of the prescribed bodies that we supervise.  We received 22 complaints during the year which amounts to 0.8% of that population.  We considered all nine professional bodies and during the year they received 320 complaints.  That is a high number and action is required, but it is a little over 1% of the population.</p><p>  There will be a requirement for hand-over rotation in the audit reform packages and the ESMA will set the standards for what must be put in, which will give us some comfort.  There will be a steep learning curve for any new auditor, but at least the law will state what must be handed over.  Whether eight years is too long is a very contentious issue and there are pluses and minuses.  The current proposal suggests a period six years but another before the legal affairs committee in the parliament is for 25 years.  There will be a great deal of discussion at European level on this issue which seem to be firmly on the table at the parliament.</p></speech>

One prophecy I can make that is likely to be fulfilled is that the duration agreed to may not be the most congenial or the one supported by the strongest argument.  It will be a huge issue among lobbies and between the Council and the parliament.  The compromise period will probably be longer than most prudential people such as the Deputy would consider appropriate.  If it does happen, it can be varied.</p></speech>

The proposals on the table will expand the current definition.  As soon as an entity is expanded within that definition, it will come under our direct supervision.  In some cases this may have unintended consequences, for example, we estimate that if we were to take over the quality assurance of auditors of public interest entities immediately, there would be eight firms involved.  That is the basis on which we would have submitted our plan to Mr. Houlihan.  If, for example, credit unions were deemed to be public interest entities, one could add at least another 100 firms.  That was the figure I received when I last spoke to people in the Central Bank about credit unions.  That is one example of how the scope of our work will change.  Do we risk the unintended consequences of perhaps applying a higher level of regulation to firms that in Ireland are perhaps not of public interest?  The other interesting part of the proposals is that in the current eighth directive there is an option to add to it, which is very important for each jurisdiction.  In our jurisdiction we might be concerned about an entity on which we want to impose regulation but that option is no more.  The question being debated in the European Union is whether we should leave member states with the ability to add public interest entities.</p></speech>

It has picked this blueprint and will stick with it.</p> <p>The crucial issue is that mentioned by Ms Hall, namely, the discretion for member states to decide matters themselves.  The previous Eighth Directive included a core definition for public interest entities, to which members states could add if they so wished.  What is happening now is that there is an enormous expansion in the core list and member states can do nothing about it.  As stated by Ms Hall, it would be reasonable to provide for a smaller core list to which members states can add, depending on the importance of the entity in their jurisdiction.  Unfortunately, the Commission, on a point of principle, believes that the previous eighth directive was not uniformly implemented throughout the Community and wants to eliminate, as much as possible, discrepancies in how this is done.  Unfortunately, Ireland as of now may be the victim of that particular philosophical approach by the Commission.  It is a serious issue for us in terms of the consequences for IAASA - that is, a plethora of work that is not really necessary but which somebody has to pay for, and a jeopardising of those public interest entities that do not need to be described or treated as such in terms of their competitiveness in the marketplace.  As I said earlier, only a handful of member states have a concentration of these firms.  Unfortunately, unless something else happens, Ireland may suffer.  As I mentioned earlier, we are making a submission to the Commission on the justification for their inclusion.  We are doing our best to address this issue.</p></speech>

The current list of public interest entities includes investment funds, of which we have many in this jurisdiction, captive insurance companies and reinsurance, which are tiny but will now be required to have an audit committee and non-executive directors, the cost of which will be enormous.  As mentioned earlier by Mr. Houlihan, the jurisdictions most concerned are, unsurprisingly, Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK, because of the markets in which we operate.  Although we term these proposals audit reform, there are impacts therein for entities, companies and investment funds.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be considered for the position of chairman of IAASA.  I have learned a great deal about the authority since 1.30 p.m.  Needless to say, as an outsider to the authority and accounting profession, I am not that familiar with the work of the authority.</p><p>  I understand the authority has an important role to play in rebuilding the public's confidence in the processes of financial reporting and statutory auditing and is doing so in the context of major changes in the European regulatory framework and supervisory structures following the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority and publication by the EU Commission of a Green Paper on reforms of the audit market, which were discussed at some length earlier by the committee.  </p><p>  As discussed, the authority is also facing a major expansion of its functions as it assumes responsibility for quality assurance of certain firms.  These demands are on top of the authority's existing role of supervising the financial reporting of equity issuers and the regulatory and disciplinary activities of the prescribed accounting bodies.  As mentioned during the earlier part of this meeting, this increase in the authority's workload comes at a time when resources available to public bodies are shrinking.  Securing adequate resources commensurate with the increased responsibilities will be crucial to the authority's success in performing its expanding role.  The statement of the outgoing chairman and review of the outgoing chief executive underline the commitment and professionalism of the authority's staff and provide me with great reassurance that IAASA will be able to meet the challenges its faces in effectively supervising the Irish financial reporting system.  I believe it will receive the support of the Oireachtas in discharging this duty.</p><p>  As I said, I come to the role of chairman as an outsider to the accounting and audit profession but as one who has had a lengthy involvement with this profession as a customer, particularly in the context of pensions funds and fund management industries where the role of auditing is crucial.</p> <p>It is equally important in the very turbulent financial period since 2008.  The expectations gap that was mentioned in the previous debate became very apparent to me as a member of a number of boards dealing with very large sums of money that suddenly became smaller in the course of 2008 and 2009 with grave implications for investors, members of pension funds and people looking forward to a retirement with some financial security.  The debate that took place here was enlightening to me in regard to the expectations gap not just between the general public and the profession but also in regard to directors of companies, who rely on auditors to give them comfort and assurance that the accounts have been kept honestly in accordance with the law.  Directors of companies can take reassurance from this.  The expectations gap, as mentioned by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n among others, is that we as directors cannot rely on this to discharge ourselves of responsibility for prudence and for the decisions that ultimately determine the performance of pension and investment funds.</p><p> I have an appreciation of the key role played by the auditing profession in maintaining confidence in the stability of the financial system, but I also have an awareness of the limitations that are placed on that by the way in which the systems in the accounting and the auditing profession operate.  I am conscious of the need to strive for maximum transparency in areas that are often highly technical and obscure to the general public.  It is also vital to maintain public confidence in the integrity and independence of the regulatory and disciplinary process.  We had an extensive discussion in this regard earlier this afternoon and I have certainly obtained great clarification of the role of the authority with regard to indirect supervision but also with regard to direct supervision, as was clarified by some of the contributions.</p><p> The present system of self-regulation in the accounting and auditing profession gives increased significance to the supervisory role of IAASA.  I am coming to this as an economist.  Some people say that accountants are economists who could not stand the excitement and retired to the accounting profession.  I am doing it the other way around.  I thought of this in the context of the professional insights an economist should bring to the role of the supervisory authority.  I am happy to say that most of the ideas I would suggest were mentioned in the previous discussion.</p><p> One of the areas in which economists have been sceptical about regulation and regulatory authorities is with regard to the concept, mentioned by Mr. Pat Houlihan, of regulatory capture - the idea that a regulator provides an opportunity for the people being regulated to enforce structures and rules that they themselves favour rather than acting as a genuinely independent supervisor of the profession.  Regulatory capture has been a big concept in economics and a Nobel prize was awarded to the person who threw this idea out in the United States.  It has given rise to a certain scepticism about supervisory and regulatory authorities.  I have taken consolation from the earlier remarks that the way in which IAASA works has avoided any taint of regulatory capture.  It is my ambition that this should continue to be the case during the years I am associated with it.</p><p> What an economist can bring to any role such as this is the opportunity to consider the incentives that people in the profession face.  Economists believe that people are ultimately driven by the incentives and the rewards they can reap from certain types of behaviour.  It is important in the medical profession that the providers of medical care are driven by concern for their patients rather than by a concern for increasing the size of the profession or increasing their own incomes.  In the same way, in this area, it is important that the incentives faced by auditors and accountants in regard to the firms in which they have an audit role are not tainted by any other incentives in regard to the firms with which they are dealing.  The existence of a secondary motivation for going along with practices in a firm because of another relationship the auditor has with the firm is perilous and must be avoided at all costs.  The incentives facing the profession have to be such as to minimise any conflict of interest that could arise, such as a conflict between the interests of the auditing bodies and the interests of the public and the shareholders of the companies.</p><p> A final concern that economists have in this regard - which needs to be mentioned, not just in the Irish context but also in the European context - is the question of cost.  Excessive regulation, intervention and burdens of compliance on firms, including audit requirements, do ultimately  make firms less competitive with jurisdictions in which these regulations and requirements are less onerous.  This is an issue faced by Europe as a whole and to some extent by the United States in the wake of the crisis we have come through.  We must be conscious that at the end of the day, firms are in business in order to meet consumers' wants.  They must do this in a transparent and honest manner.  They must comply with accounting regulations and with the law in this area but they also should not be burdened with excessive costs.  I think there is a balancing act to be performed between the goals we have been emphasising - transparency, credit and trust and confidence in the auditing function - on the one hand and the danger, on the other hand, that firms will become choked by regulations that are onerous and costly.</p></speech>

I welcome Professor Walsh and wish him the best of luck in his new role.  I was privileged to study national economics under Professor Walsh, because prior to his return in 1980 the standard was not brilliant.</p><p>  The ordinary man and woman cannot believe the state the country is in, and the austerity programme that has resulted from this is a consequence of the behaviour of the banks.  Many people, including me, find it difficult to accept that auditors could charge large fees to the then Anglo Irish Bank.  How will we recreate credibility in companies?</p><p>  In the United States, Enron, a company that was audited by Arthur Andersen, is an example of accountability.  I know the legislation in the United States is different from Irish law.  We must look at this.  In the United States people are accountable.  The system is transparent and one can finger a person and say that he or she did not do his or her work properly.  I know there are investigations and that we must be circumspect.  Day in, day out, the question is asked: why has no banker been held to account for what happened to the country?</p> <p>Our recession is far more complex than that of any other country.  What are we going to do?  The witness mentioned that the council is in the process of financial reporting and statutory auditing and regulation.  How is that going to be enforced?  We appear to be useless in that regard.  We are great at making laws - that is what I have learned here - but useless at implementing them.  What will the witness do?</p></speech>

There was a discussion on that issue earlier where it was stated that there are proceedings that are not yet complete and it would be premature for the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority to comment on them.  Some of these have shifted into the area of possible criminal prosecutions and one cannot prejudice those.  Going back to the Senator's broader question, I think these things go in cycles to a certain extent.  Just like the bubble in the housing market or in the stock market there tends to be a crash after which there is a period of soul searching and rebuilding of confidence slowly, perhaps, for five or ten years, and gradually the lessons of the past are forgotten and the same pressures build up again.  To some extent, in this area, there were periods when standards were lax and crises developed that should have been averted and they have been followed by periods of reform.  For example, in the US in the 1930s an immense amount of legislation was introduced, some of which was gradually relaxed in respect of ordinary banks getting involved in investment activity.  After a while the lessons and the pain of the 1920s or early 1930s wore off, and some of the regulations were relaxed, the same tragedy was reiterated and we got into another crisis in the 1990s and the last decade partly through having forgotten what was learned during the previous crisis.  To some extent there is a cycle and I think I know where we are in regard to that in this situation.</p><p>  We have come through the worst financial crisis in our history as an independent country.  We are still suffering the consequences of that in economic terms in terms of austerity, hardship and budgetary pain and we are desperately trying to prevent a recurrence.  We are aided by the EU measures that have been discussed in which we will play an important role in trying to implement during the Irish Presidency.  I see ourselves as moving back into a more cautious reformist period in regard to the substance of what this authority deals with.  As outlined in the presentation by the outgoing-----</p></speech>

A reassuring statistic was given about how few of the 30,000 plus professionals in the field have had complaints made against them over the years.  The problem may have been that some of the outrageous faults were in very prominent companies and in very prominent situations.  They also involved a certain amount of innovation on the part of the people involved which probably took regulators and the general public unawares.  There is need for continuing vigilance on behalf of financial positions in companies to innovate to their own benefit and to the detriment of the public good and of the shareholders in the company.  That is a very general statement but I have confidence in the professionalism of the body and its vigilance.  It is a co-operative venture between the prescribed accounting bodies and this authority - the authority making sure that the prescribed accounting bodies are following their procedures as stated - the authority also having powers to vet, comment and, if necessary, to change the rules of those prescribed accounting bodies.  I see it as a process that will bear fruit over the difficult period that we are going through and that this authority has come through.</p></speech>

As he has worked as a professor in national economics for many years he would have witnessed some of the peaks and troughs in the past.  That is why I was anxious to get the point across that we need to use an institution that is structured to ensure the next trough is reduced.  He made the point that most of this has happened previously.  While this is probably the biggest financial crisis in almost 100 years the main determinants are not all that new.  It is the lack of institutional memory that is available to the system which is at fault.  From my perspective one of the major problems was the clear over-exposure of the property market and the over-exposure of access of cheap credit which led to the weaknesses within these institutions and that was not captured as such at the time.  The Regling Watson report said this was a homemade disaster and a disaster which focused on the weakness in supervision.</p><p>  For citizens this is the biggest catastrophe that has happened to their generation.  We are a number of years away from it now.  I understand six years is the statutory time span for individuals to be brought before the courts.  We are clear on the generalities of the problem but not on the specific issues of who did wrong and what exactly they did wrong.  It is a major concern for Irish society that four years on we are still in that position.   How can we use the system as a tool to prevent this happening again?  How can we create an institutional memory, if that is possible?  How can we identify expeditiously the individuals and the actions they did or did not take as soon as possible?</p></speech>

To some extent he has echoed the issues raised by Senator Mary White.  I will make one comment.  There is a certain danger in seeking to identify particular individuals who acted recklessly or even in a criminal manner.  Unfortunately, these crises recur with depressing regularity but, in fact, we have had relatively few of them in Ireland.  However, it is clear from the history of financial institutions in the past 200 years that housing bubbles followed by reinforced by banking bubbles have recurred, perhaps, every ten or 15 years across the world and as the title of one recent authoritative study put it, This Time is Different.  In each of these crises there are journalists, professionals, economists who gives reasons.  They said Ireland was different because it had a young and dynamic growing population and an inflow of foreign direct investment, it needed all this extra housing and it was justified to advance loans on very small margins because of the buoyancy of the economy.  That was the particular argument in Ireland.  In America it was about sub-prime mortgages being extended to tranches of the population that could not otherwise afford housing.</p> <p>There was a certain dressing this up as if it was altruism to bring lower income people into the housing market.</p><p> There will always be some rationalisation and some specious argument put forward on which to a certain extent it is the duty of the sceptical economist and journalist to throw cold water.  It is difficult to do that.  The Honohan report places a fair amount of emphasis on the psychology that develops, the psychological momentum behind these bubbles and how difficult it is for any one individual to buck the trend, to stand out and say the emperor has no clothes, that these arguments are invalid, that this time it is not different and that it will all end in tears the way it has the previous 120 times.  It is difficult to do that.</p><p> I am not answering the Deputy's question immediately but digressing to say we must be aware that unfortunately there are forces in complex capitalist economies like ours that lead to these disasters periodically and we must try to restrain them in every way we can.  Laws, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, were introduced in the United States to try to put the reins on investment banking but when things had settled down and people said profit opportunities could be availed of if the Act was relaxed, it was abolished and we know the consequences of that were disastrous.  We must frame good laws for our banking structures to make sure that even though we operate within a European framework we still have some autonomy in regard to, for instance, the margins in which mortgages are advanced.  We could have acted in that area earlier and more decisively than we did.  I would emphasise the putting in place of institutional legislative constraints rather than necessarily identifying the people who were culprits.  There were people who acted possibly illegally and I hope they will be brought to book, but I step back a little from that and point to there being a psychology here, a momentum that builds up and we must try to try to build institutions, which is not necessarily the role of the supervisory authority rather it is the role of the Oireachtas generally in terms of  the framework within which the financial system and the banking system operate.</p><p> I think we have learned lessons.  At European level, the move last week towards a European system of banking supervision is a very important step in that direction.  Hopefully we will have learned lessons from this Irish and Europe-wide catastrophe that has hit us and we will be able to postpone the next crisis beyond the ten year cycle that, unfortunately, has been the pattern in many countries in the past.</p></speech>

I wish to advise them that by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise that the opening statement and other documents submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before Mr. Nugent makes his presentation, I wish to make a few comments.  After 25 years of application, the environmental impact assessment directive has not changed significantly whereas the policy, legal and technical contexts have evolved considerably.  A number of shortcomings have been outlined in respect of the directive and the Commission's proposal has been drafted on foot of these.  I wish to ask the officials from the Department if this proposal achieves an appropriate balance between protecting the environment and imposing burdens on developers and the competent national authorities.  Will significant cost and time burdens be imposed on those authorities?  In the current economy climate, are such costs necessary?  The Department's information note, which was circulated to members, states that the proposal may give rise to issues around the principle of subsidiarity.  As the officials are aware, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann each have an opportunity to submit reasoned opinions to the President of the European Parliament, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission if it is considered that there is a breach of subsidiarity.  Accordingly, I ask the officials to elaborate on any issues which may give rise to such a breach.</p></speech>

My name is Philip Nugent and I am the principal officer in the planning section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am accompanied by Mr. Marian O'Driscoll, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Sullivan, higher executive officer.</p><p>  Environmental impact assessment, EIA, is a critical tool in managing and clarifying the complex interrelationships between development and the environment.  It is a process that provides for an examination of the environmental consequences of development actions in a systematic, holistic and multidisciplinary way.  As such, it is a critical aid to the decision-making process.  The EIA directive was designed to ensure that projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are subject to a comprehensive assessment of environmental effects prior to consent being given.  Since the first iteration of the directive in 1985, there have been changes to the legislation itself and to the practice of carrying out EIA both in Ireland and throughout the European Union.  The policy and operational context for all stakeholders &ndash; whether they are consent authorities, project sponsors or developers, local communities or third parties - has become significantly more complex as a result.  The European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1989 formally incorporated the requirements of the 1985 directive into planning and other project consent systems.  Since that time, the amendments to the directive have also been transposed into the various project consent codes.</p><p>  In so far as planning is concerned, the Planning and Development Act 2000 consolidated Irish planning legislation.  Part X of the 2000 Act contains the relevant provisions in relation to the requirements of the EU EIA directive in so far as the planning consent system is concerned.  Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, contains more detailed provisions in relation to Part X of the Act.  The latter has been amended on a number of occasions recently in order to elaborate on the definition of environmental impact assessment, following a European Court of Justice, ECJ, ruling against Ireland in case No. C-50/09.</p><p>  An EIA must identify, describe and assess in an appropriate manner, in light of each individual case and in accordance with articles 4 to 11 of the EIA directive, the direct and indirect effects of a proposed development on the following: human beings, flora and fauna; soil, water, air, climate and the landscape; material assets and the cultural heritage; and the interaction between these various factors.  Part X of the Planning Act requires that an EIA must be carried out by the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the case may be, in respect of an application for consent for development which comes within the scope of the directive, either by exceeding a quantity, area or other limit specified or because it does not exceed a specified limit but is deemed by the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la as having potentially significant effects on the environment.</p><p>  The new draft EIA directive is aimed at strengthening existing provisions concerning the quality of the EIA, with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection.  It is also intended to enhance policy coherence and synergies with other EU law instruments and to simplify procedures with a view to reducing unnecessary administrative burdens.  Some of the main features include a requirement that projects which require assessment of environmental impacts under both the EIA directive and the IPPC directive would have to be assessed in an integrated or co-ordinated manner, including the appointment of one competent or facilitating authority; mandatory provision of a large amount of screening information by the applicant for all Annex II type projects; mandatory, and reasonably elaborate, screening decisions to be made by consent authorities for all Annex II projects; mandatory scoping of all environmental impact statements, which will now be called environmental reports, by the consenting authority in all cases where an EIA is required; accreditation of persons deemed competent to compile environmental reports; and all environmental impact assessments to be completed by the competent authority within six months of receipt of all relevant information.</p><p>  The proposals were published by the European Commission on 26 October and discussed by the EU Working Party on the Environment for the first time on 31 October.  The Cyprus Presidency has given over three meetings of the working party for discussion on the proposals.  Parallel discussions also took place at a meeting of EIA experts from EU member states in Larnaca in November.  A further meeting of this group is taking place today in Brussels.</p><p>  As set out in our note, the draft directive is based on Article 192(1) of the treaty, on qualified majority voting and on the basis of co-decision with the European Parliament.  The proposed changes contained in the draft directive will give rise to an increased need for additional administrative and professional or technical resources for the processing and carrying out of EIA by the competent authority.  The requirements to issue detailed screening decisions and, in particular, to scope all environmental reports will add to the cost of dealing with consent applications in these cases.  The requirement to align the EIA development consent with IPPC consent may give rise to substantial reorganisation of consent systems and a significant amount of amending legislation.  It is considered that the proposed accreditation system and the time limit for delivering an environmental impact assessment consent will give rise to difficulties.  In the context of time limits, it would appear that where a competent authority, for example, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, is unable to complete the environmental impact assessment for a major project within six months - as required under the draft directive - consent in respect of that project would have to be refused.</p> <p>The carrying out of an environmental impact assessment is complex in terms both of process and the underpinning legislation. The proposals were published just over six weeks ago we are still examining the content of the directive in consultation with other stakeholders.  After the limited consultation that has taken place, there is a view that the proposed directive may give rise to issues around the principle of subsidiarity by failing to allow for sufficient flexibility to member states as regards the choice of measures for compliance and their detailed implementation.  I hope this brief overview has provided a useful background for questions or comments from members relating to the new environmental impact assessment directive.</p></speech>

The sense I have of it is that as things stand, without imposing any stricter or more onerous conditions on any development or doing anything anywhere - I am not saying this in a populist way but on the basis of what I see on the ground - we are heading towards not being able to do anything.  It has come to the point where somebody from the National Parks and Wildlife Service or some other enforcer is nearly standing over my bed in the morning telling me not to get out of it.  I am serious about this.  I am sure they are only doing their job because they have been handed a set of rules to carry out and they have to carry them out.</p><p>  I understand this issue came up at the European Parliament yesterday and I would cite an example of what I am talking about.  Laois County Council paid for a bird survey and &euro;4,000 for drainage work on the River Goul.  The survey was completed and because it is now a year or a year and a half old, the council has been told that it will have commission another one.  The survey could have cost anything up to between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000.  The cost involved of a few thousand euro worth of work to take a few buckets of silt out of the river, to remove a silt bank - I am just citing this as an example to set the context - is mad.</p><p>  What is happening under these regulations is mad.  I want to protect the environment and the generations before us protected the environment.  I saw slag heaps in England higher than the tallest part of this building.  There is no problem in having environmental impact assessments and I do not want to see slag heaps of that height throughout rural Ireland, but I make the point that rules and regulations are crazy.  The civil servants in Brussels do not realise, and neither might the civil servants here, what one has to do to drain a section of wetland or to clean out a drain.  One has to clean one side first and then clean the other side, even if the drain is only a few feet wide.  One has to perform a Houdini act with a Hymac.  It is crazy what is being passed down to us.  Any members from rural Ireland who are present will verify what I am saying.  I come from an environmental background and I want to protect the environment, but what I see being done is lunacy.  To compare it with the Taliban, the only thing that is missing is there is no violence involved in enforcing it - not yet anyway.  It is crazy.</p><p>  What impact is this proposal likely to have on special areas of conservation, natural heritage areas and particularly on the bogs incorporated in the lists?  Mr. Nugent might give us an overview of Part X of the Planning and Development Act.</p><p>  I made a point regarding the wetlands.  There is a huge contradiction in that the Minister and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is trying to move us towards Food Harvest 2020.  This type of proposal has the potential to drive rural Ireland back 100 years before there was ever a mechanical digger to carry out drainage or to reclaim land.  I drive through rural areas and pass lands where I saw people cut turf as a child and those lands are now reclaimed.  That has happened in my lifetime and there are cattle grazing on it and, in some cases, crops growing on it.  I do not want to see the destruction of everything but we cannot have bogs overgrown and flooding farmlands on the edge of them because a group of people in Brussels decide to impose this proposal on us.  In broad terms, we have to make a stand on this and we should test it to the limits.</p><p>  Mr. Nugent mentioned the cost of the administration of this proposal.  I hope the witnesses will not take offence at my saying that civil servants do not normally complain too much about the extra administration work or cost involved in a measure.  I do not mean that in a negative sense but they operate in a different way from politicians.  However, the fact that they are concerned about this makes me very concerned about it.  The amount of paperwork that is required to be completed to do anything in this area is crazy.  I outlined the situation regarding the River Goul and county councils, which are stretched to limit, are being told they have to get new surveys done because the ones they have are out of date, even though they will contain the same findings as the new one.  I hope in those cases that they go ahead with the works.</p><p>  One member of the panel might respond to the issues regarding the NHAs and the SACs.  We should test the issue of subsidiarity in this context.  We might as well take down the tricolour over this House.  I am not saying we should get involved in environmental destruction but if we are going to allow ourselves to be trampled on with more regulation and impositions from Brussels, we should call it a day.  We should tell the people that this is being run under the direct control of Brussels.</p></speech>

It might be useful if we prepared a note because it quite complex legislation.  It might be best dealt with through a note giving detail on how the regulations fall underneath it.

Other areas that have been identified as potential breaches of subsidiarity would be around the issue of scoping.  Under the existing directive, scoping and EIA are discretionary and by that I mean a developer can ask a competent authority to scope what should go into the environmental impact statement, which will now be an environmental report.  Under the new proposals, that will become mandatory.  Even where somebody is quite satisfied that they know what needs to go into an environmental impact statement, the competent authority will none the less in all cases have to provide that scoping.  That will add potentially to the costs of competent authorities or, more likely, to those of project sponsors because those costs would have to be passed on.  It has been argued so far that is an unnecessary cost and it goes beyond the requirement of the directive because the Commission has not shown how that would lead to improved protection of the environment.  Those are a couple of the areas the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

What is his understanding of the impact of the initial directive on turf cutting and the way it is at present and, in practical terms, what will this mean for turf cutters afterwards?  The reason I ask this is that Mr. Nugent talked about projects and private people doing X, Y and Z.  In many cases that would be people like my father.  The project he would be undertaking would be to try and keep his house warm.  When he decides in future to engage in that project of keeping his house warm, how much will it end up costing him?  Will it cost him so much that it will no longer be practical for him to do it?  What will be the impact?</p> <p> For years I and an organisation called the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association have warned that in terms of what was coming down the line from Europe, after initially designating special areas of conservation and criminalising people for cutting turf, we would see a series of wetlands directives, including this directive, put into Irish law which would end the tradition and culture of cutting turf in this country forever at a practical level, unless one was so rich that one did it for the craic.</p></speech>

If it is within the Natura sites, that is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service and this proposal will not affect that because it is only to do with the broader environmental impact.</p><p>  This measure will not have any particular impact on turf cutting no more than it will have on any other project.  The current position on turf cutting is that there is a mandatory threshold of 30 hectares for an environmental impact assessment and therefore for turf cutting in excess of 30 hectares an EIA must be carried out.  Under that hectarage an environmental impact assessment should be carried out to determine if it would have a significant effect on the environment.  We do not see those thresholds changing in any way but as we have explained, if this directive comes in it will have impacts on mandatory scoping and screening.  Somebody applying to cut turf on a large site may have some extra bureaucracy to go through in the same way anybody else would, but other than that we do not see it having a major effect on turf cutting.</p><p>  We are engaged in an exercise with Bord na M&oacute;na and various people because the Commission has asked us to establish the extent of large-scale industrial turf cutting throughout the country.  We have been talking to Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, and Bord na M&oacute;na with a view to doing some mapping in that area but we do not have any proposals for any particular changes in regard to turf cutting.</p></speech>

If someone was carrying out turf cutting on 20 hectares, they would have to apply for planning permission and it would then be a matter for the planning authority to decide whether an EIA was needed.  It would decide in accordance with annex 3 of the directive - the impact it is having on the environment.  That could be an area on which we could issue further guidance.  Generally, it is accepted that most of the bogs in the Natura sites here are protected.  In terms of other bogs there should not be a major impact on the environment given that the ones considered of value are protected under the habitats directive.</p></speech>

However, I know otherwise.  When the Government puts serious effort into relocating people into new bogs, they will run into that problem because they will need that amount of bog and environmental studies will need to be done on it.  Those studies will not allow people to cut turf on them.  They will be told they are destroying the planet or something along those lines.</p></speech>

In other words, a project might still have significant adverse effects on the environment but when a planning authority or the competent authority weighs up all the considerations, including the socioeconomic and other aspects it considers, it may still decide that notwithstanding those impacts, the project should still go ahead.  The EIA process does not give one a "Yes" or a "No".  It says that these are the effects on the environment.</p></speech>

I note that the witnesses have some concerns but they are mostly monetary and not environmental.  Correct me if I am wrong but they referred to the need for additional administrative and professional technical resources for the processing and carrying out of the EIAs by the competent authority.  Some time ago there was some debate in the European Union on making processes easier for local authorities in general.  If that is going through a process in the EU, why would that result in extra administrative work?</p><p>  We are at a time in this country where there is less development going on than was the case in the boom.  In terms of staffing arrangements and so on, some staff who were required in the planning section some years ago might be diverted to dealing with EIAs.  The witnesses may not have it with them but they might provide us with a detailed note on the reason the administrative burden will cost more when there is less planning and development taking place.  If there is to be more environmental impact scrutiny, where will the cost come into that?</p><p>  On the timescale, Mr. Nugent referred to a six-month period, but how does that affect the fast-tracking of planning projects and so on?</p><p>  I ask the witnesses to comment on the simplifying procedures to which the European Union referred.  It was linked in with this.  I read about that somewhere but how will the changes affect Ireland?  We hate to see regulations coming from Europe about, say, cheese makers and yet in France they seem to be able to make cheese in various localities or they can sell eggs in certain localities.  Perhaps there are stricter regulations in Ireland.  There should be commonality among all European Union states on EIA directives.  I am aware other countries have raised questions about that.</p><p>  Scoping was always necessary, and local authorities gave guidance on that, but mandatory scoping is necessary now.  There is also more of an onus on the developers not simply to include any information and hope for the best.  There are competent people who can ensure the people the developers employ are competent in what they write down and that they can stand over that.  That is welcome.</p><p>  In terms of the negative aspects, the witnesses pointed out the cost, administration and so on and hopefully that can be dealt with, but what else should we object to?  We want development but we also want to ensure the environment is protected.</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is concerned about the environmental impacts of the environmental impact assessment directive.</p> <p>We are concerned about proportionality.  We are not yet sure that the Commission has demonstrated how the new proposals significantly lead to enhanced protection of the environment, bearing in mind the administrative burden that will arise for competent authorities and project sponsors.  There is little gain for a considerable administrative burden.</p><p> I am not sure how this proposal squares with other communications from the European Commission over recent years to try to simplify procedures.  I do not mean to be glib but the Senator would probably have to ask the European Commission.  It is telling that it took the environment side of the Commission longer than anticipated to get the draft proposals through its internal assessment board.  That is an important issue.</p><p> Our main concerns relate to the mandatory scoping.  We do not understand why the arrangement should be mandatory and we do not yet see the benefit.  This concern is shared by two thirds of member states.  We are also concerned about the extent to which the accreditation system that is to be introduced will lead to an improvement in the protection of the environment.  It could be extremely complicated.  Does one seek a planning qualification or an environmental engineering qualification?  What are the different standards of qualifications among member states and states outside the Union?  How does one ensure that people entering from outside the Union will have the requisite skills to become accredited?  These questions concern pretty much all member states.</p><p> There are requirements associated with new factors that must be assessed.  Planning authorities would not have the in-house expertise to assess the implications in all cases.  An example relates to issues associated with climate change and biodiversity.  This would be complicated.  It would be very costly to the public system to ensure all local authorities and planning authorities had the expertise in-house.</p></speech>

It is opportune and important that everyone would have an opportunity to reflect on the measures and the centrality in decision making and on achieving consent.  I refer also to the likely impact.</p><p>  Reference was made to cost, which obviously is important.  There appears to be an infringement of the subsidiarity principle and an imposition of total bureaucratic entanglement.  The latter includes mandatory scoping, which is well beyond the original objectives of the directive.  The directive should and probably will be amended substantially.</p><p>  Directive 2011/92/EU contains a legal requirement to carry out an environmental impact assessment on public and private projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment prior to their authorisation.  Proposal 628 is to strengthen the provisions concerning the quality of the environmental impact assessment with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection.  However, if it infringes on the achievement of other objectives, the Department should subject it to significant amendment.  It should seek the backing of other concerned countries.</p><p>  The European Commission's proposal states its suggested changes to the environmental impact assessment directive are partly intended to take account of decisions of the European Court of Justice on the directive.  As stated, the Commission referred to one of the cases brought against Ireland, namely, C50/09, decided in March 2011.  The court said Ireland failed to implement Article 3 of the environmental impact assessment directive, which, as Mr. Nugent and his officials well know, requires the planning authorities to prepare an independent assessment of the environmental impact statements prepared by developers.  The independent assessment is supposed to take account of the effect of the development according to the specific criteria in Article 3 of the environmental impact assessment directive.  These pertain to human beings, fauna and flora, soil, water, air, climate and the landscape, material assets, cultural heritage, and the interaction between these factors.  I believe Mr. Nugent referred to this.</p><p>  The European Commission followed up on the court's decision and required us to implement fully Article 3 of the directive.  This was achieved by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on 31 October when he signed the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Planning and Development Act 2000) Regulations 2012.  To date, planning authorities have given planning permission for major developments, such as wind farms.  I have an interest in the latter, not only in terms of their impact on the environment but also their impact on people.  I am concerned about proximity to houses and the lack of statutory criteria to ensure the protection of people, particularly their health.  There can be flickering and noise.  That is why my Bill is very important.</p><p>  The required approach is set out under sections 171A and 172 of the Planning and Development Act but it was just abandoned.  My Bill, whenever it is before the House, will ensure protections for people and their houses, including against diminutions in value.</p><p>  The European Court of Justice signalled clearly in its decision in March 2011 that permissions do not comply with European law.  Can we now be assured that the planning permissions are legally sound?  Will we be left open to claims for compensation from those who must live in close proximity to developments, including some wind farms, on the basis that there is a failure to comply with Article 3 of the environmental impact assessment directive?  Is there advice available to assure taxpayers they will not be left carrying the can?  If such advice is available, I am sure it could be shared with this committee.  In a time of scarce resources, the last thing we need is another drain on resources.</p><p>  I am concerned about this matter and that is why I brought forward the Environment and Public Health (Wind Turbines) Bill.  It is gaining a lot of notice from many people who are deeply concerned, most of whom are major contractors and developers.  I fully support sustainable energy proposals and a reduction in the use of fossil fuels.  I am delighted to see that Bord na M&oacute;na has taken on board a proposal that I fully support on Mount Lucas.  The project is far away from where people are living.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely correct that we have a chequered history on the implementation of the environmental impact assessment directive.  There is more than one ECJ decision against Ireland.  A specific development constituted part of the C50/09 case.  The decision of the court did not call into question the validity of consents given for any other projects.  There is no question mark over any of those.  Many of the other projects would have been the subject of appeals and judicial reviews.  Part of the challenge would have been on the grounds that Ireland had not properly transposed Article 3.  Those cases have wended their way through various courts.  The ECJ decision did not call into question the validity of consents already given.</p></speech>

They literally and directly transposed all the wording of Article 3 and went a bit further.  They were developed in consultation with the European Commission to ensure the commission was happy enough.  The European Commission had referred Ireland for non-transposition.  At this stage we are satisfied that we have to go no further to ensure absolute and proper transposition of Article 3.</p></speech>

As regards the accreditation system, I have watched a lot of planning permissions over the years, including ones where an environmental impact assessment is required.  They are required to be independent but I found it strange that in all those years I never saw one arguing against the proposal.  I would have thought there would be something that would not make it through that kind of rigorous assessment.  How is it intended to proceed with the accreditation and will there be reviews to examine some of the assessments?</p><p>  The second point I wanted to draw attention to is that of in-house expertise.  A lot of the people who worked in local authority planning departments in recent years were employed on temporary contracts, so they were the first out the door.  Quite a lot of expertise was lost as a result.  It is not just a question of having the resources within local authorities.  There is also an implicit cost in this.  In an environment where there is a public service recruitment embargo and a reduction in available funding, how is it intended to compensate local authorities that must take on an additional work load without extra resources?</p><p>  Food will play a much bigger economic role in future.  Will Food Harvest 2020 require an environmental impact assessment?  If so, how will it play out and who will administer it?</p></speech>

As to why a project would not have been rejected, does the Deputy mean that a consultant would have said it was a bad project?</p></speech>

One would have thought that some of them would have been neutral at least on the proposal that was being made.</p></speech>

Part of the EIA is that alternatives have to be examined and mitigation measures must be included.  It may well be that is why only the positives are coming through, because concerns are being addressed throughout the process.  I am not sure, however, and I do not know about the specific case.</p></speech>

We are still very much getting to grips with it and trying to think about how we would do it.  We have never done it before.  Some member states seem to have accreditation systems of sorts, so the usual approach would be to begin looking at examples in other jurisdictions.  At this stage we have not really thought about how an accreditation system might work, or what the qualification standards would be.</p><p>  As regards in-house expertise, it is the case that the volume of planning applications coming into planning authorities has dropped off significantly.  The number of staff in planning departments has also dropped off to reflect that.  There is a big difference, however, between the qualifications and expertise of a general planner who examines normal planning applications and the highly specialised and detailed scientific qualifications that would be required to have such a person in-house for each local authority.</p><p>  As regards how local authorities will be resourced to take on these experts, we would not be looking at 32 or 34 experts in each field, that is, one in each planning authority.  We would probably be looking more at a shared service model, as I told Senator Keane earlier.  Inevitably, however, the cost of providing that expertise would have to be passed on to the industry or the developers.</p><p>  I am not familiar with Food Harvest 2020 but it sounds to me more like a plan than a project.  If it is a plan, it would be subject to strategic environmental assessment rather than an environmental impact assessment, which is more about a project.</p></speech>

We sometimes feel here that we are overburdened with compliance requirements, rules and regulations.  Has Mr. Nugent had any feedback on how this directive is going down in other member states?</p><p>  My second question concerns the alignment that appears to be required between the EIA development consents and the integrated pollution prevent control consents.  How does Mr. Nugent see that working out?  It seems to me that it will be very challenging.  This will be discussed during our EU Presidency, so can Mr. Nugent see any difficulties for us in that respect?</p></speech>

It will be dealt with during our EU Presidency.  We do not have a fixed number of working party meetings but we have listed it in the draft agendas for the two Councils in March and June.  Our level of ambition will be coloured by the discussions at the working party and the positions of member states.</p><p>  This takes me back to the first question on the feedback we have received so far.  It is a proposal that is giving rise to significant concerns in other member states.  I would draw a distinction between some of the newer member states who joined post-2000 and the older ones.  Some of the newer member states seem to have brought their environmental law into line with existing EU legislation.  Therefore some of the newer member states seem to have a dedicated stand-alone EIA consent process, whereas the older member states, including ourselves, have a requirement for EIA arising under a number of different legislative codes, for example, foreshore and arterial drainage planning.  It seems to be giving rise to greater complexity in member states that do not have dedicated stand-alone EIA systems.</p><p>  The feedback so far has been mixed.  I would say that two thirds have quite significant concerns.  All member states have scrutiny reservations but that is a standard with any draft proposal at this early stage.</p><p>  As regards the alignment between IPPC and planning, we would not be particularly concerned that there are too many difficulties there.  That is because we have gone a long way to ensure that they are very closely aligned anyway.  One issue that would give us some concern in terms of that alignment, though, is the designation of a competent authority or a facilitating authority.</p> <p>Other consent systems may also interact with IPPC.  It may not be so straightforward but from a planning and IPPC point of view, we are satisfied it will not give rise to additional complexity.  The Commission has given us an assurance on this but we are still consulting other Departments responsible for other consent systems to see how it might square for them</p></speech>

We are delighted to have them visit the joint committee.  They met with the Minister of State for European Affairs earlier and will meet the T&aacute;naiste after this meeting.  I hope our visitors' short trip to Ireland is productive and informative.  While I have visited Turkey three times, my pronunciation of the names of our visitors may offend.  I apologise.  I welcome Mr. Egemen Bagis, Turkish Minister for Europe and the principal EU negotiator.  The Minister is accompanied by Alaattin B&uuml;y&uuml;kkaya, Deputy Minister for European affairs, Haluk Ilicak, under-secretary of the Ministry for European Affairs,  Burak Erdenir, deputy under-secretary, and Altay Cengizer.  Though I needed help with that last name, it should have been the most straight-forward to pronounce as I recognise Mr. Cengizer and his name.  He is the Turkish ambassador.</p><p>  I understand that among the reasons for this visit to Ireland is to examine the position on the Turkish accession process.  I hope that as Ireland takes over the EU Presidency during the next six months we will see a re-energising of our accession negotiations.  Following the contribution from the Turkish Minister, my committee colleagues will be allowed to put any question or make any comments.  The Minister may then respond.</p></speech>

I arrived with my delegation yesterday and spent a day in Drogheda.  It is a lovely town that symbolises the friendship between our two great nations.  Our history with Ireland is deep and built on mutual respect and solidarity.</p><p>  The Turkish-EU relationship is not new.  It is historical.  Our first application to join the Community was in 1959.  We have been trying to become members of the club for 53 years.  It took 45 years just to get a date to start accession negotiations, which commenced in 2004.  It has been eight years since the process began.  We opened the first chapter in 2005 and since then have opened 13 more.  There are 20 more chapters to be opened, of which 17 are politically blocked.  We cannot open them but hope during the Irish Presidency to unblock some.  The three which can technically be opened are the ones every accession country left to the end of their process because of the economic hardship they represent to candidate nation economies.  I have had extensive talks with the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, my good friend Deputy Creighton.  We understand that Turkey will not become a member during the Irish Presidency, but it is an opportunity to put our relationship with the EU back on track.  We understand that it will take some time and that at the end of the process Turkey may decide to become a member state, notwithstanding certain shortcomings.  Turkey might be vetoed by certain countries as happened with the UK, Spain and Portugal previously.  It may be the case that, like Norway, Turkey chooses not to become a member.  As of now, we must continue a process which is good for both sides.</p><p>  As Turkey approves and implements more EU reforms and the<i> acquis communautaire</i>, it becomes a dependable ally, important market and a bridge to other nations.  Turkey is currently playing a crucial role geographically and historically.  I am very happy to see that we have friends in Ireland who understand that Turkey can carry some of Europe's burdens and does not represent, as is wrongly believed by some, a burden to it.  I am happy to see that Ireland is on the right track and look forward to its Presidency.</p></speech>

I am heartened by the fact that the Turkish issue is back on the agenda.  I have long been a supporter of Turkish negotiations with the EU, which are good for both parties.  The process is good for Turkey in that certain requirements of the <i>acquis communautaire</i> must be complied with.  I do not doubt the importance of that in negotiations and to the future Turkish access to Europe and the speed with which it can become a member state.  Hopefully, more negotiations will take place in contrast to the recent period of abeyance.  That lull was not good.  If accession discussions drag on too long, the credibility of the process is called into question, which benefits no one.</p><p>  Among the issues which come to mind is the ongoing Kurdish problem.  It represents a problem for the EU, Turkey and the Kurds.  The question is the extent to which an accommodation can be reached in the context of the negotiations now taking place which is sufficient to reassure the EU, accommodate the Kurds and permit Turkey to proceed to the next stage.  Turkey has an important role to play in the current circumstances pertaining in the Middle East and western Balkans.  The EU must recognise and encourage that.  The EU must draw on the influence and peaceful, positive resources Turkey has at its disposal to ensure progress in that part of the world.  Cyprus represents another issue which has been in abeyance for some time.  We have some experience of problems which appear to be insoluble in Ireland.  They have to be dealt with eventually.  It is only natural that the Cyprus issue should be examined more closely in the context of negotiations.  Hopefully, an accommodation will be arrived at which benefits and satisfies everyone.</p></speech>

I am a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy.  While our party is not ideologically opposed to Turkish accession, we are aware that many in Europe are for reasons ranging from economic concerns to pure racism.  There are others who have strategic concerns about whether the EU wishes to have a border with Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>Some people share strategic concerns about whether the EU wants to have a border with countries such as Syria and Iraq because of their difficulties.  Our position is that Turkey should have the right to join if it meets the criteria on human rights, rule of law and so on.  Cyprus and the situation of the Kurds is a key area of concern.  I presume this is part of the discussions and difficulties that Turkey will encounter in its application process.  As Mr. Bagis said, it is a long time to wait for accession.  I have no difficulty with the idea that the Irish Government would examine many of the difficulties facing his country.</p><p> Turkey still occupies the north of Cyprus.  It is the only state in the world to recognise the Turkish republic of northern Cyprus.  For many countries and parties within the EU, recognition of the rights of the Cypriot nation would be a precondition for Turkish entry into the EU.  I am aware that direct talks between the two communities there began in 2008.  Does Mr. Bagis expect those talks to continue from the point where President Christofias and Mr. Talat left them?  Many would see the occupation and colonisation of the country as a war crime.  Does Mr. Bagis not think that withdrawing his country's troops and settlers would contribute to peace and stability in this turbulent region?  There is a similar situation in Palestine where settlers are coming in and creating difficulties.  Does he not accept that Turkey must withdraw its forces from Cypriot soil before it can realistically be considered as a candidate country for the EU?  Does Turkey recognise the right of the Cypriot people to exploit their own natural resources, including those that may be found at sea?  These issues represent some of the difficulties Turkey will face.</p><p> Legacy issues arise from past conflicts.  We in Ireland share these in respect of similar difficulties.  I was pleased to see that the committee on missing persons in Cyprus is proceeding with a humanitarian task and is exemplary in the communal project to alleviate the pain and sorrow that people are experiencing in that part of the world.  Does Turkey intend to give Cyprus full access to military zones and the war archives, where the records of clearing the battlefields are kept, to facilitate the location, exhumation and identification through DNA of the 2,000 missing persons in Cyprus?  Would Mr. Bagis regard that as a positive step in trying to resolve that issue?</p><p> Another speaker mentioned Kurdistan and the difficulties there.  Will Turkey move swiftly to engage with Kurdish representatives?  I am aware that there were negotiations during the recent hunger strike in many of the jails and there was hope that initiatives would be taken in respect of various NGOs and the BDP to find a solution because many lives have been lost.  This instability and difficulties are issues being raised in connection with Turkey's access to the EU.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that there is a certain amount of concern in Europe about a country of Turkey's size coming into the Union and its impact on migration.  Would Mr. Bagis say something about the current economic situation in Turkey and the levels of employment and industry there because the last record we have for the population is 74 million?  I share some of the concerns expressed about Greece and Cyprus.  Would Mr. Bagis say something about Turkey's relations with those countries?  How do Turkey's neighbours view its membership of the EU?  Turkey has come out against the Assad regime in Syria which is welcome and has taken a strong stance on the upheavals in Libya, Egypt and other countries.</p></speech>

It is important that Turkey advances its application for membership of the Union.  Never before has it been so important that a country such as Turkey becomes a member of the EU.

I struck a good chord there.  He acquitted himself extraordinarily well in the Council of Europe while continuing to work.  He made a very good impression on Turkey's behalf.</p><p>  I share the concerns about Cyprus.  I have never stood in northern Cyprus and do not intend to do so unless there is a free northern Cyprus or at least a united Cyprus.  Too many British and Irish people have bought properties in northern Cyprus whose title is questionable.  In most cases they are not entitled to it because it was taken from the residents during the war.  I am amazed at the status of Famagusta.  It was one of the most beautiful cities in Europe in the 1960s and now it is a ghost town.  Through goodwill on both sides, this issue must be resolved.  As Deputy Crowe said, our difficulties were as extreme as those in Cyprus and I have no doubt that with the support of the Greek and Turkish Governments there will be an agreement there.  I hope that will be pushed forward and I recommend that Turkey move in that direction as part of its application.  It is a barrier to full membership of the EU.  Most Irish people would be of that opinion.  That aside, I welcome the Minister and his delegation and support the Turkish application for membership of the EU but there is a great deal of work to be done in the meantime.  Turkey had acquitted itself very well in respect of Syria.  Its support for humanitarian aid there is much respected.  The situation is very difficult and tense.  I commend the Turkish Government on the way it has handled that issue.</p></speech>

Like many of my colleagues, I have visited his country on several occasions.  Speaking personally, I am very supportive of Turkey's membership of the EU.  I would like to see the process in which it is engaged start again, be re-energised and move forward.  Turkish membership of the EU would benefit the union, Turkey and the broader region.  Like some of my colleagues, I urge the minister to do all he can in respect of the concerns we have all articulated about Cyprus.</p> <p>It is a country towards which many Irish people have an affinity.  We would very much want to see progress made in this area to reflect the journey we went on as a country.  I also hope to see one day in the future that Turkey would be given the choice to fully join the European Union.  I hope that decision will be a positive one.</p></speech>

I really enjoyed this frank and sincere chat.  I will be as a frank and sincere myself.</p><p>  One needs to understand and, at least, have a vision for what the European Union stands.  Is it an economic or political union or something else?  The European Union, as far as I am concerned, is the grandest peace project of the history of mankind.  It has ensured sustainable peace, solidarity and stability on the Continent.  Many nations that have fought for centuries with their neighbours, including Ireland, have come to a permanent peaceful resolution because of the Union.  As it is the greatest peace project of mankind, it is still a very continental project.  Unfortunately, it does not cover the whole Continent either.  I agree with Deputy Durkan about the Balkans.  This continental project cannot leave any black holes or black mountains in the heart of Europe.  We have to enlarge this message of peace and that is where Turkey's membership comes in.  The day Turkey joins the European Union, we will help transform this continental project into a global peace project.  Turkey's messages, combined with the messages of peace, democracy and human rights, will have a much greater geographical effect.</p><p>  Today, Turkey is the most eastern part of the west and the most western part of the east.  I do not believe the Cyprus problem, which was not a prerequisite for EU membership for Cyprus, should turn into one for Turkey's membership.  It is a relevant problem but was not relevant enough to stop Cyprus from becoming a member.  It should not be an obstacle to Turkey's membership.</p><p>  We are willing to deal with the Cyprus problem in a peaceful manner.  When my party came to power in 2002, for the past 40 years no Greek Cypriots had been allowed into Turkey.  One of our first actions was to change that.  We asked the Turkish Cypriots to do the same and we opened the way for the exchange of travel between Northern Cyprus and Southern Cyprus.  In the past nine years, nearly all Greek Cypriots have been to the north and nearly all Turkish Cypriots have been to the south.  Thankfully, there have been no disagreements, fights or casualties.  These two peoples on the same island get along and live together.</p><p>  However, one fact we must accept is that when the sun shines on that beautiful island, it shines on two different states with two different elected presidents, parliaments, school systems and so forth.  My Government recognises one of these two while the Irish Government recognises the other when in reality there are two states and governments on the island.  The idea should be to merge these states into one, which we have been attempting to do since 2002.  This was the whole idea behind the United Nations peace plan formulated by the then UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan.</p><p>  The Turkish Cypriots supported the plan, despite the resistance of their own president at the time.  However, the Greek Cypriots rejected it as did their president.  While we want to unite the two states, it is up to the people of Cyprus to decide.  Turkey will support and bless any solution that is accepted by Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, as long as it is based on political equality.  Political equality will ensure that once we take away all our troops from the island, we will not end up in a situation like 1974 when we had to send the troops in.  We do not enjoy keeping our troops on the island as it is a significant cost to us.  The presence of Turkish troops has been enjoyed by the Greek Cypriots as well as they voted to keep the troops on the island.  If the Annan plan had been accepted, the number of Turkish troops would be down to 650 while Greek troops would have been down to 900.  The plan proposed that after 2010 there would be no more troops left on the island except for British troops.  The Greek Cypriots voted to keep Turkish troops on the island because they know it has ensured peace and sustainable development.  I guess what these soldiers eat and buy has been good for the economy.</p><p>  After the 2004 referendum on the Annan plan, there was a unanimous Council decision to lift the blockade against Northern Cyprus.  It would have been just like Ireland trading with Taiwan without recognising it.  However, it was blocked by the Greek Cypriot Government.  If the embargo were lifted, that would be enough for us to open airports and seaports to Greek Cypriot planes and vessels.  The Greek Cypriot economy has one of the largest commercial fleets in the world.  It is a shame it does not have access to the largest ports of the Mediterranean because of this attitude.  If Aer Lingus were to fly to Ercan Airport, not only would it be a profitable route, it would give us the leverage to open our airspace to Greek Cypriot planes.  As they are forced to fly around Turkish airspace, they spend an extra &euro;20 million on fuel.  Access to Turkish seaports would give Greek Cypriot goods access to a market of 75 million Turks.</p><p>  We recognise the Greek Cypriot nation but Ireland has to recognise the other one as well.  We have always encouraged the Turkish Cypriots to continue talks with their Cypriot neighbours.  Deputy Crowe referred to the talks between the Northern Cyprus President, Mehmet Ali Talat, and the Cypriot President, Demetris Christofias.  The only reason Mehmet Ali Talat lost the presidential election was because his people thought he was too soft on the Greek Cypriots.  His opponent, Derviş Eroğlu, took over and through Turkey's intervention and motivation, he had more than three years of talks with Demetris Christofias.  The Turkish Cypriots did continue their talks.  It was Demetris Christofias who announced he wanted to stop the talks because he does not want to run for re-election.  We are now focused on the choice of the Greek Cypriot people for their next president.  Whoever it is, we will still encourage the Turkish Cypriots to continue the talks.</p> <p>However, let us agree on one fact.  If there was a solution on the island, both sides would profit economically so much that the benefits of the solution would outweigh by many multiples the deficits of there being no solution.  President Christofias has announced that his country is on the brink of bankruptcy during the Cypriot Presidency which casts much doubt on the credibility of the European Union.  We all should be worried about this and we should not let any member state fall into bankruptcy.  If it was not for his attitude of no solution, then the whole island, including the beautiful city of Famagusta mentioned earlier, would be a haven of prosperity.</p><p> The reason Famagusta is a mislaid ghost town is because of their attitude.  We are willing to move.  I agree that if the Annan plan had been approved, Famagusta would be one of the most attractive tourism destinations in Europe right now but it is not my country's fault that the city is a ghost town.  Who rejected the solution to the problem?</p><p> As far as Deputy Kyne's issue of migration is concerned, Turkey is a country of 75 million.  Our unemployment rate is the best in Europe today.  Our median age is 29.  We have a young population.  Some 65% of my nation is below the age of 34.  I happen to be one of the youngest Ministers in the Government, but 75% of my nation is younger than I am.</p><p> Our people are no longer migrating.  The number of Turkish immigrants to Europe last year was much less than the total number of European emigrants to Turkey.  There are ever more Irish, Germans, French and Dutch who choose Turkey as their place of retirement.  They buy homes or rent property, and the enjoy the beautiful Mediterranean climate.  In Antalya, for example, there is sunlight 300 days of the year and the cost of living is much cheaper.</p></speech>

Alanya is the home town of my friend, Mr. Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avuşoğlu, who Senator Leyden mentioned and who became the Speaker of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly.  In Alanya, there are more than 50,000 Germans alone.  They have their own church, NGOs, associations, clubs, gatherings and schools.  Alanya is now a German city with a Turkish minority.  It is becoming ever more popular.</p><p>  My countrymen are not migrating to Europe because they know there are many more opportunities in Turkey than there are in Europe.  In the past four years, as European Union member states were growing the rate of 1.5%, my country has been moving with an economic growth rate of 8% per year.  According to the OECD, we will continue to be the fastest growing economy in Europe until 2020.  Also according to OECD, by 2050, Turkey will be the second largest economy of Europe; it is now the sixth.  There is no migration threat.</p><p>  If there is anyone in the members constituencies who feels like making a change in their life, my country would be very much interested in opening its arms to them.  We are not afraid of migration.</p></speech>

There are approximately 7,000 Irish who live in Turkey and there are fewer than 1,500 Turks who live in Ireland.</p><p>  As far as the economic situation is concerned, we are moving ahead but we never saw the European Union as an economic union.  Economically, it would not make that much sense for us to join the European Union but, as far as it being the greatest peace project is concerned, Turkey must be there because we want to be able to carry on this message.</p><p>  Earlier today I mentioned in a speech that when people in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia look at Turkey, they say, &quot;Look at these Turks.  They have a similar tradition, culture, religion, geography and agricultural policies and they are very much like us, but yet they are so much more advanced because they have a Government and an opposition, labour unions, a free-market economy, better schools, much better hospitals, great roads, airports and so forth, and the question is: how come we do not have what they have?&quot;  Many risk their own lives to be like Turkey and to turn their country into what Turkey represents for them, but the real strength of Turkey, the real reason Turkey is different despite so many similarities, is that it is a democracy which has been strengthened by our determination to become a member of the European Union.  Most of these reforms which we have conducted in Turkey and which made Turkey what it is today were made in line with our European Union reforms.  That is why this process itself is much more important than the end result.  That is why we know we will not become a member tomorrow and by the way, looking at the current scene, we prefer not to become a member tomorrow.</p><p>  Keeping the process alive is very important and blocking the chapters is Europe shooting itself in the foot.  Let the process move.  Let Turkey achieve the standards, become an important market for member states' products and services and an ally partner in international fora, and then when the time comes for the question of membership, every member state will have the right to veto any potential candidate country.  I hope that the Irish Presidency will give this new vision to the European Union.  Right now, Ireland's trade with Turkey is greater than its trade with Russia, Brazil and India, all of which are BRIC countries.  Ireland has much more in common with us than with all of these emerging powers.</p><p>  It is inconvenient for the European Union if Turkey starts to apply EU legislation by opening chapters.  This relationship must be understood, that it is based on a win-win platform.  We are becoming much more democratic, thanks to the European Union.  We are applying the European Union's rules.  We are becoming much more transparent and we are becoming much more prosperous, thanks to the European Union.  However, we need not follow the European Union's guidelines.  We can do it on our own too, but we would rather do it with the European Union than on our own.  It is important that Turkey moves on.</p><p>  We have not opened any chapters in the negotiation process in the past five Presidencies.  All members present are politicians.  They understand how public opinion functions.  Ours cannot continue with the <i>status quo</i>.  I am losing public opinion.  Support for European Union membership is down from 78% to 35% or 40%, but if Turkey decides to withdraw its application one day, then there will be a finger-pointing game on who lost Turkey in Brussels.  It is not in the interests of anyone, including Cyprus.</p><p>  Many of the committee members mentioned Cyprus and I note the ambassador of the Greek Cypriot Administration is in the Gallery.  It would be the biggest nightmare for Cyprus if Turkey was to decide that it was no longer interested in European Union membership.  The committee should not forget that Turkey is not only one of the largest economies in Europe, but also one of the largest military powers of Europe, and the second largest in NATO.  Keeping Turkey in the same club is the cheapest insurance policy for Cyprus and pushing Turkey away is, in the simplest terms, silly.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to meet him.  He is very eloquent and captures the sorts of areas that are important in a prospective member of the EU.  Turkey is a country of 75 million people with a very big landmass.  It is the pivotal point between East and West and the landmasses of Europe and Asia.  It has long traditions and has had great democratic developments in recent times.  It has enormous patience - some 53 years represents two generations in family terms.  It has an interesting economy.  There is now a net inflow of migration rather than the outflows of the 1960s to Germany and other countries.</p><p>  That shows an evolution towards enlargement of the population of the family of Europe within a peacetime resonance.  It is a task to be addressed by us in Europe and following the distractions and tensions of what has been at play for the past three or four years since the financial crisis and the eurozone's problems, it could bring a new energy.  I liked the way the Minister spoke about the neighbourhood of Cyprus because that is what it is.  It is two communities of different traditions in the neighbourhood of the islands of Greece and the large landmass of Turkey.  I encourage the Minister to continue the work.  I say to my European colleagues that they should warm the invitation and get down to the practicalities of creating the framework for an enlarged family.  I wish the Turkish delegation well in their visit here and their work on the mainland of Europe.</p></speech>

I have debated in my own head as to whether Turkey should reside within the EU or elsewhere.  It is very much a pivotal country and plays a very important role in the world because of its geographical positioning.  Therefore, from our selfish viewpoint in the EU, it is much better to have it with us rather than against us or even in an ambiguous place.  In that sense a movement in the direction of membership would be very worthwhile.  I will not go through the issues others have raised, some of which I share.  Clearly there are cultural differences, but there are also cultural similarities.</p><p>  I wish to record my appreciation of some of the work Turkey has done on the Syrian civil war.  I appreciate Turkey is in a very difficult position there and it has worked with great sensitivity on the issue so as not to get involved directly while at the same time helping those who needed help at its border.</p><p>  One of the possible concerns about Turkey being part of the EU is that it would bring us directly in touch with areas of the world where there is very considerable trouble.  Turkey has borders with Syria, Iraq, Iran and the Caucuses region.  If Turkey became a member of the EU, would it have any impact on the politics in those bordering countries?  If so, would that impact be positive or negative?</p></speech>

To what extent has the economic crisis in Europe influenced the views of Turkish citizens regarding membership of the European Union?  When we attend COSAC meetings, the Minister's colleagues from the Turkish Parliament often make the point that the Turkish economy already meets the criteria for the fiscal compact and met all the criteria for the Stability and Growth Pact.  What impact has the economic crisis in Europe had on attitudes in Turkey?  I hope the process can move forward because I believe there is far more in common between Turkey and the European Union than there are differences.  I hope Turkey's application can be reactivated and progressed under our Presidency.  I again thank the Minister for attending and I ask him to respond to those final questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-18a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Egemen Bagis" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012121800007#F00600"><p>I thank the members for their constructive comments and questions.  Regarding the economic crisis, no crisis lasts forever and every crisis eventually comes to an end.  In 1999 and 2001, Turkey had 8,000% interest rates between banks overnight.  We had a single day in our history when the country's president and prime minister had a major argument where the president threw a printed copy of the constitution at the face of the prime minister.  That night our stock market plunged and the banks started charging each other 8,000% interest rates overnight.  However, for the past five years Turkey has been the most stable and fastest-growing economy in Europe.  Things change.  It takes fiscal discipline, commitment and confidence, but it changes.  Despite the economic crisis, <i>per capita</i> prosperity in Europe is higher than in anywhere else in the world.</p><p>  While I accept Ireland has 14% or 15% unemployment, at least people still have hope.  Ireland's food hygiene standards are better than most of the world.  People are not afraid getting sick as a result of eating something in a restaurant.  Ireland's school system functions very well and the health system functions.  Ireland has some set policies in terms of its citizens' access to public services.  It has what it takes to turn this around.  It will take some time but it will happen.  That is why we are so committed.  We feel that we are part of Europe.  Some 50% of our foreign trade is with the EU.</p> <p>Some 85% of all international investments and 92% of new technology in my country comes from the EU.  Turkey is a full member of every European organisation, including EUFOR, the European Investment Bank, European security and defence policies and participates in the Eurovision but it is still only a negotiating member of the EU.  Two Turkish princes were called "Europe" and "Paris".  </p><p> What unites us is much greater than that which divides us.  Historically, it was believed that Turkey was too large.  Now being a big country presents a great opportunity for a European economy because big markets are needed to deal with the current status.  It is no longer accurate to say Turkey is too poor because it is now one of the most dynamic economies.  The argument that Turkey is a Muslim country is now advantageous because of the need to send out a clear message to the 1.5 billion Muslims around the world that the EU is not anti-Islam, in particular to the 35 million Muslims who live in today's EU as rightful citizens.  More than 10% of the population of France are Muslim.  The ratio of Muslims in Germany is approximately the same and is growing in many other countries not only through migration but by choice.  I believe Turkey can play an important role in this regard.  For more than 200 years we have successfully coexisted the culture of Islam with the culture of democracy.  </p><p> On the point made by Deputy Dowds in regard to Turkey's neighbours, no country gets to choose its neighbours.  As problematic as they are, we would be willing to change neighbours with Ireland if we had the choice.  However, we cannot.  I wish Switzerland was a neighbour of Turkey.  Peace, prosperity and democracy can be also contagious.  I believe that Turkish economic development and its success story is a part of the foundation of the Arab spring-awakening.  Without giving in on our values we changed things, which people in our neighbourhood saw.  The Turkish Prime Minister can pray with the local people in Libya and can, on coming out of the mosque, tell them not to be afraid of secularism.  Being secular does not necessarily mean one has abandoned one's religion.  Being secular ensures everyone has the right to practise his or her religion of choice.  If the European Union really represents peace and understanding among different nations, ethnicities, religions and cultures this message is very much needed in today's Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and so on.  Turkey is trying to deliver that message. </p><p> The Syrian people were mentioned.  More than 150,000 Syrians have found shelter in Turkey.  We have spent more than &euro;400 million in the past year trying to meet the expenses of these people.  This is not an issue which we can address on our own.  We need to work together on this and to convince our Russian colleagues not to support a dictator who is killing his own people and bombing his own cities.  When it comes to Syria, the Turkish government has prioritised humanitarian values over its national interest.  Turkey was the first Muslim country to call on Mubarak to leave office, as it did in respect of Gadaffi.  Our national interest could have diverted us to look the other way and continue with our trade but the problem would then have become only more complicated and would have hurt us all.  </p><p> The economic crisis will not last forever.  Does this affect our public opinion?  It does not affect us as much as hearing people like Sarkozy insult us.  My countrymen are much more influenced by the negative attitude from Europe towards Turkey's membership aspirations.  We know the economic crisis will one day be over and that to achieve this we will have to work together.  However, the feeling of indifference and the insulting attitude are more relevant.  We want fair treatment.  The fact that Turkey is a great nation should not be a reason for it to receive any special favours from Europe but it should also not receive any special burdens from it.  We want to be dealt with like all other candidate countries were dealt with.  That 17 of 20 chapters are being politically blocked does not make sense.  The Turkish people are the only citizens of any candidate country who need to apply for visas before visiting the Schengen region, which also does not make sense.  As a Minister of the Turkish Government I had to apply for a visa to come to Dublin, which is not right.  I can go to the United Kingdom without a visa and can visit all of the other 26 countries with a diplomatic passport.  Ireland should not be the only sore thumb.  I would welcome the committee's support in this regard.</p></speech>
