    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#A00500"><p>I welcome the Chairman and members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to set out the State Claims Agency's approach to managing claims against the 146 State bodies that fall within the remit given to it by the Oireachtas.  I am joined by my colleague, Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and we will be happy to answers members' questions shortly.</p> <p>  It is important that I set out the details of the agency's role in the Vicky Phelan case.  This is clearly a tragic case that has had dreadful consequences for Ms Phelan and her family.  I assure the committee that at every stage of our involvement in this case, we have been acutely aware of the consequences, trauma and pain Ms Phelan and her family have suffered and continue to suffer.  In carrying out our statutory role in managing this case, we have been mindful of the need to ensure that, wherever possible, nothing that we did would add to the suffering of Ms Phelan and her family.</p> <p>  In managing personal injury litigation taken by persons against the State, we never forget that our work frequently involves the management of difficult, complex and traumatic cases taken by persons who have suffered injury, sometimes of a catastrophic nature.  We have a duty, when managing personal injury claims, to manage any individual claim in a humane, ethical, professional and sensitive manner.</p> <p>  Our role in Ms Phelan's case arose because one of the parties she took a case against was the Health Service Executive, HSE, which is one of our clients.  The HSE was not the only party.  Ms Phelan's case was also against the United States laboratory that had carried out her smear test.  It was called Clinical Pathology Laboratories.  In every case with multiple parties, each party conducts its own defence independently of the other parties.  We managed the case on behalf of the HSE but the US laboratory had separate legal representation and a separate legal strategy.</p> <p>  The primary legal issue in this case centred on the alleged misreading of Ms Phelan's original smear test.  The US laboratory accepted that legal liability for that issue rested with it alone and that the HSE was not legally responsible for the misreading.  As part of the US laboratory's defence of this issue, its lawyers sought a confidentiality clause that would have restricted Ms Phelan from disclosing details of the settlement or the case.  The State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and no such request was made by our agency.  The request by the US laboratory was not supported by the agency.  Our view is that the US laboratory's insistence on a confidentiality clause was a significant factor in the failure to resolve the claim through mediation.  Mediation is our preferred route for resolving cases of this nature as it would have eliminated the need for court hearings or a contested court action.  A settlement, consequent upon mediation, would have made it unnecessary for Ms Phelan to go to court, personally give evidence and experience all the stress and anxiety that a court hearing entails.</p> <p>  A total of 98% of all cases managed by our agency are resolved without the need for a contested court hearing.  It was not possible to resolve this case through mediation, but that was for reasons outside our control, and I have referred to those reasons.</p> <p>  I would like to make a number of points about the way we manage cases.  I am conscious that the committee asked us here today specifically to discuss this issue.  In Ms Phelan's case, it has not been reported by the media generally that the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Cross, praised the manner in which the case was managed by the State Claims Agency and the other parties.  While some cases can take up to between two to three years to be concluded, Ms Phelan's case was settled within ten weeks of the summons being lodged.  The judge said the case was handled in an efficient and humane manner, with all sides pulling out the stops to get the matter ready for hearing quickly.</p> <p>  We have heard commentary from some observers in recent days suggesting that the State was in some way trying to place obstacles in the way of settling this case.  The judge's comments, being those of an independent party, demonstrate that the opposite was the case.</p> <p>  I will now update the committee on the current number of cases we are managing which are similar to Ms Phelan's case.  In addition to Ms Phelan's now concluded case, we are managing nine other similar cases, and we are aware of one additional case where a formal claim has not yet been made.  We have received an indemnity from the independent laboratories in three of the nine cases to date and we have sought indemnities in all others.  We will manage all of these cases in the same way we managed Ms Phelan's case, namely, carrying out our statutory role by placing a high priority on treating the people who have made the claims, and their families, with the dignity and compassion they deserve.</p><p>We have no intention of mounting a full defence in any case of this nature where responsibility is substantially or completely that of the State.  In any such case, we will pursue other options, including mediation or settlement.</p><p> We have a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the taxpayer.  We also have a duty, however, towards injured persons who have suffered a medical negligence related injury, including following a misdiagnosis, and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies.  We never lose sight of the fact that in many cases the injured parties, together with the families, have suffered significant trauma and pain.  Recognising this, the agency aims always to act fairly, ethically and with compassion in its dealings with these people and their families as well as in the management of all cases which fall within our remit.</p><p> In cases of medical negligence, our policy is to admit liability as soon as the expert medical evidence becomes available to indicate there has been a breach of duty.  The agency takes every step it can to ensure that litigation is handled sensitively to ensure no additional distress is caused to the person who has made the claim or to his or her family.  The agency is required, however, to operate in accordance with its statutory mandate to investigate claims thoroughly and to manage litigation in a professional manner.  I am not suggesting to the committee that it is an easy task to get this balance right when carrying out our statutory role, knowing the often devastating personal consequences for persons who have suffered injury, nor would I suggest that we always get this balance right to the satisfaction of all the parties in the case.  However, we make every effort to do so.  I hope the facts, such as those put on the court record by Mr. Justice Kevin Cross in Ms Phelan's case and by the same judge in two other cases last week bear this out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Breen and Ms Foley to the committee.</p> <p>  Vicky Phelan is a neighbour of mine.  I know the type of person she is and what she has gone through.  The briefing note given to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 16 April states the State Claims Agency had advised it believed the issue of non-disclosure would fall or be dismissed and, therefore, there was no exposure for the State.  Why did the agency give that advice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00400"><p>We did not state that we felt it would fail.  We acknowledged in our defence that there had been a breach of duty by the HSE's cervical screening and the HSE via the consultant in not telling Ms Phelan.  The only point that we put into that note for the Minister was an issue of exemplary damages which might accrue to the State in respect of that.  We indicated that in the absence of malice, the claim would not be made out.  One of the reasons we said that was because, when it was put to Ms Phelan's expert whether he thought there was malice on the part of the State in the delay in notifying Ms Phelan, he said there was not.  It was just a legal point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00500"><p>With due respect, this is about life or death.  When it became known that there was an incorrect reading of a smear test in 2014 and which was not given to Ms Phelan until 2017, three years later, surely at best it was gross incompetence.  Mr. Breen is speaking about the whole issue of intent.  Surely, as the officer charged with legally advising the HSE, Mr. Breen should have said on the issue of non-disclosure - that is the key issue here - a wrong was done.  At that stage Mr. Breen should have been advising the State to accept liability.  Furthermore, he should have ensured the State Claims Agency and the laboratory in America, CPL, Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc., accepted liability, offered a settlement to the Vicky Phelan and not have dragged her through court for four days.  Instead, she was dragged through the court and had to put her condition in the public domain.  It was offensive to the public and grossly unfair to Vicky Phelan and her family.  As the chief legal officer advising the State, Mr. Breen should have said on non-disclosure that we accepted legal liability.  It should not have happened.  Instead, it resulted in Vicky Phelan being told at the end of 2017 of the difficulty she has with her health.  This would not have arisen if she had been told of the incorrect smear in 2014.</p> <p>  When I read this opening statement, the State Claims Agency still does not appear to be admitting that the issue of non-disclosure was culpability on the part of the HSE.  Vicky Phelan is an incredible woman.  She came out when she was not well and stood up for women and the truth.  We still have the situation, however, whereby Mr. Breen is advising the State, the HSE and the Minister for Health, that the issue of non-disclosure was something for which the State should not accept liability.  If the State had accepted liability for it, Vicky Phelan would not have ended up having to go to court.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

I deplore the fact that Vicky Phelan was not told.  The Senator is absolutely right that she should have been told.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00700"><p>Mr. Breen, that is great.  However, actions speak louder than words.  Mr. Breen could have advised the State to accept liability.  Both the State Claims Agency and CPL could have come together.  However, no offer was made to Vicky Phelan prior to the court case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00800"><p>If I could take the Senator through the sequence, he might find where my logic is coming from on this.  What happened was we did acknowledge and admit liability in respect of the non-disclosure.  That was in our defence.  As a matter of record and as a matter of law, we admitted liability.  That was wrong and we said so.</p> <p>  The issue in the case was whether that failure to disclose affected Vicky Phelan's clinical outcome.  There was a separate issue in the case whereby the US laboratory, during the short period before the case went to trial, had admitted liability, had offered the State an indemnity and would deal with her settlement.  What happened in the particular case was the solicitors firm acting on behalf of the US laboratory had some difficulty getting instructions from its insurance company.  We were, at all times, pushing towards making sure that Vicky Phelan got a settlement.  That is always what we wanted to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B00900"><p>The settlement was based on an incorrect reading of the smear test on day one by the laboratory in the US.  It was not about non-disclosure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B01000"><p>No.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#B01100"><p>That is the key point I want to make.  This needs to come out.  When Vicky Phelan brought this court case, there were two defendants, CPL and the HSE.  The State Claims Agency was advising the HSE.  As the senior officer, Mr. Breen was responsible for this advice.  If disclosure had been made back in 2014, Vicky Phelan would be in a different position today.  That is the key point here.  The smear test reading was a major error.  It was realised in 2014 that there was an incorrect reading in 2011.  If she had been told at that time, medical action could have been taken and Vicky Phelan would be in a different position today.</p><p>If the State Claims Agency had accepted non-disclosure early on and it had discussed the case with Clinical Pathology Laboratories, CPL, it could have made an offer to Vicky Phelan, on the basis of the acceptance of non-disclosure, and she would not have had to be dragged publicly through the courts for four days, having had to reveal parts of her life that no one should be asked to reveal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00200"><p>I agree.  Vicky Phelan should never have been before the courts.  That should have been prevented.  We, the agency, did everything in our power to prevent that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00300"><p>Did the State Claims Agency discuss with CPL about coming up with an offer?  Why was no offer made jointly by the HSE and CPL to Vicky Phelan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00400"><p>I would return to the point, and I must make it to the Senator again, that our expert evidence and Vicky Phelan's expert evidence was that the non-disclosure point, albeit a terrible point and I deplore the fact that she was not told, did not change her clinical outcome.  That was agreed by her expert and by our expert.  I deplore the fact that she was not told.  We, as an agency, do not have any control over that.  We have for a very long time told all of our agencies and hospitals that they should practice full open disclosure.</p> <p>  If I could return to the issue of why her case went to trial, the only reason it went to trial was because the solicitors for the US laboratory could not get sufficient instructions at a point in time, and then they did and they made the offer in the case.  The Senator might recall that this case, which we supported being settled via mediation, which would have prevented Vicky Phelan from giving any evidence, collapsed because of the confidentiality clause provision which was insisted upon by the US laboratory.  We went on record at that time to say that this is wrong, this should not be done, and that there should not be a confidentiality clause.  We did everything we possibly could to try to get the case settled, but we had a letter of indemnity, a complete indemnity, for everything from the US laboratory.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00600"><p>I keep coming back to that point.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I make the point but I have to make it to the Senator in terms of the legalities of the case.  Vicky's expert and our expert agreed that failure to disclose, albeit one that should never have happened, did not change her clinical outcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00700"><p>One final point, the State Claims Agency has ten cases before it.  The Taoiseach, through the Attorney General, has gone directly to Mr. Breen to ask that they would look at dealing with these cases on a more compassionate basis than what happened with Vicky Phelan.  Has the agency taken that on board?  Of those ten cases, are any of the women deceased?  If Mr. Breen had Vicky Phelan's case to deal with again, would he deal with it differently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#C00800"><p>In regard to the other cases, I have very carefully noted what the Taoiseach said and, obviously, we would take his remarks very seriously and do everything we possibly can to ensure that other families who are involved in these ten cases do not suffer the same trauma.  None of these cases should go to trial.  That is the reality.  In three of the cases, the US laboratory has indemnified the agency.</p> <p>  On the Senator's last point, I understand that some of the women have died between the original smear and now.</p></speech>

Cervical screening immediately issues a letter to the relevant laboratory, whether it is one of other of the laboratories, stating: "This letter has arrived and under the contract that you have with us, you are obliged, in the event that this is a misread smear, to provide an indemnity".  In some of the cases, the US laboratory has immediately indemnified the HSE on the basis that it is the laboratory's mistake.  If that happens and the laboratory takes over the indemnity, then the matter is live only between the injured woman and the laboratory and the lawyers on both sides.  The HSE is not involved.  If the laboratory, for whatever reason, does not give an indemnity, we will be a co-defendant in the case and we will be looking at why it is that the relevant indemnity has not been given to the State, or whether it should be given to the State or what other issues there are in the case.</p></speech>

This is separate to the non-disclosure agreements with women whose smear tests returned false negatives.  Where a sum is agreed and the State Claims Agency is the representative of the State, will Mr. Breen give us a sense of or data on how common it is for the State to insist on confidentiality clauses governing settlements and payouts, particularly in cases of medical negligence and other clinical cases?</p></speech>

I will take the committee through them.</p> <p>  First is mediation, a process to which both parties must agree.  Independent of the State Claims Agency and the plaintiff, an intrinsic part of the process is that all that happens at the mediation is confidential so that when the parties of the mediation fail and they must go to court, they will not use anything that happened at the mediation.  It is not imposed by us.  Rather, it is imposed on us and the other party by the mediator.  However, if a settlement is reached at mediation in cases that we are involved in, we never insist on confidentiality regarding the settlement amount or anything like that.</p></speech>

Where that information has been disclosed, we have never taken any action within the confidentiality provisions.  Confidentiality might arise in other circumstances.  In some instances where we had a line of similar cases in a class action-type scenario, we were admitting or settling a particular case amidst that group for reasons other than the substantial reasons that gave rise to the cases and we wanted to delineate that case, we might sometimes have requested a confidentiality clause about the settlement.  In the overall scheme of the approximately 8,500 cases that we have settled since inception, though, it has rarely occurred, but it has occurred.  Sometimes, plaintiffs ask us for a confidentiality clause.  Where they do, we always offer it.</p></speech>

There are many shameful aspects to this case but one of the most shameful is the fact that Vicky Phelan was asked to gag herself.  We must be thankful for her courage in refusing and continuing to fight in difficult circumstances.  It is why we now know about this national scandal.  Mr. Breen outlined that the State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and that no such request had been made by the agency.  Can Mr. Breen explain what the agency did to oppose the request for a confidentiality clause by the US lab?</p></speech>

As the mediation was being set up, the mediator spoke to the parties independently.  He indicated that the US laboratory was seeking such a confidentiality clause.  In such situations, mediators ask the other defendant for its view on such a proposal.  When we replied, we were in no doubt that we did not believe such a clause was right or proper.  We indicated separately to our co-defendant that we did not believe that asking Vicky Phelan to abide by such a clause was the right thing to do.  I want to be clear about that - we opposed it all the way.</p></speech>

As has been the case with many defendants over the years, up to when we started to espouse open disclosure as the proper thing to do, there were probably occasions where confidentiality clauses were put into settlements.  Without going back over individual cases, I am guessing that, of the 8,500 clinical cases we have resolved, no more than a dozen and a half or perhaps two dozen were in that category over all those years.</p></speech>

The circumstances might been such that the plaintiff sought the clause.  They would not have been cases where we unilaterally sought the clauses.

The State Claims Agency's role is to represent the interests of the State in these cases.  However, the State is not just concerned with pounds, shillings and pence; it should also be concerned with what kind of society we have.  It is obvious in this case, and the State Claims Agency agrees, that if there had been a confidentiality agreement, it would have been to the detriment of the State, or society as a whole or the public.  In similar cases, it is in the interest of the public and State to know where something has gone wrong, or is at least perceived to have gone wrong, and the State Claims Agency either admits liability or offers some sort of redress or payment.</p></speech>

He argued against mandatory open disclosure.  Why did he do that?  We could be in different circumstances here if mandatory disclosure had been in place.</p></speech>

I appeared before the joint committee at the time.  My recollection is that I said I was not indifferent about whether there should be voluntary disclosure or mandatory disclosure.  I said that if I were asked to choose, I would definitely prefer voluntary disclosure.  My worry was - my advices were entirely guided by this - that I did not want it to become a box-ticking exercise by people making disclosures.  I believed that a voluntary system would have much greater buy-in and that people would proceed in an atmosphere in which they did not simply feel compelled to disclose.  My thinking was that it would result in a better system.</p></speech>

After that, the lawyers send out a letter of claim and a summons.  It is at that point we enter the process to examine the claim.  We receive the claim and we begin to examine it.</p></speech>

We think most medical negligence cases should be resolved through a mediation process.  Any of the parties could ask for this.</p></speech>

The facts were bad at the beginning of the case, and of grave consequence for Ms Phelan, but it was not until later that we understood the significance of that case in terms of its sensitivity for other women in particular.  I want the committee to understand that while the State Claims Agency was conducting Ms Phelan's case, its understanding was that all the women affected by the audit had been told.  We had no other impression but that they had been told.</p></speech>

We did not know until a very late point in that case that there were women who were similarly affected.  In fact, we found that out through the media.</p></speech>

It is presented along with the sensitive case list of the Attorney General.  It was agreed in 2007 that that list would not include medical negligence cases because almost all medical negligence cases are sensitive, involving particular trauma.  We had to consider how many such cases should appear on such a sensitive list.  Sometimes we do not know when a case involves the kind of sensitivity that Ms Phelan's case had.  It is not always immediately apparent to us.</p></speech>

In Mr. Breen's opening statement, he talked about nine other similar cases.  Tony O'Brien appeared before a committee of this House last Wednesday and he talked about a list he had received from the State Claims Agency and stated there were ten cases on that list.  He said:</p><blockquote>There are ten on this list that I can see in front of me, but I cannot share it with the committee because it is a State Claims Agency list.  Ten cases are listed as active which means, in essence, that they are either in legal proceedings or they are in pre-legal proceedings and there is a further one which is described as &quot;potential&quot;.</blockquote> <p>Were there ten cases last Wednesday and it is down to nine now?</p></speech>

By operating as Pontius Pilate the agency is ensuring that there will be legal cases because the laboratory in America will pursue this.  Is it not the case that these women were let down by the State?  They were completely and utterly failed by the State because of misdiagnosis.</p> <p>  The State Claims Agency should be settling with every one of them.  Then the agency should sue the laboratory in America.  Instead, the agency is asking people who now have a cancer diagnosis to pursue the State.  The same applies in certain circumstances involving people who lost loved ones - they are grieving families.  The State Claims Agency is washing its hands and suggesting people sort it out with the laboratory in America.  Why can the agency not settle with these individuals?  Why can the agency not do what the Taoiseach has said?  Even if there is no legal responsibility, there is a moral responsibility.  The agency should settle with these women.  Then, if the laboratory in America failed in its duties - clearly it has - then the agency should sue the laboratory and get the money back.  Why make the individual victims go through this arrangement?</p></speech>

That would involve taking the matter entirely out of our hands and into a redress scheme.  We are constrained by what we can do.</p> <p>  I understand the point Deputy Doherty is making well.

He stated:</p><blockquote>The legal team said it had an issue around the delay in informing the affected woman. That element of the case was struck out; it was not that we did not tell the patient, it was noted that the information was late and took a long time. That was the basis.  After that, any engagement largely centred on legal teams and we were asked if a settlement was proposed during mediation prior to a court appearance. The State Claims Agency advised that we should be supportive of any such moves. We took the agency's advice and said &quot;Yes&quot;.</blockquote> <p>Was there consideration whereby the State should settle with Vicky Phelan in mediation?  Did that conversation between the State Claims Agency and CervicalCheck take place as represented by Mr. John Gleeson?</p></speech>

I am simply reading into what Deputy Doherty has put before me.  I would say that was a discussion with the State Claims Agency.  When the agency was talking to its co-defendant obviously we would have been supporting the idea that there should be a settlement with Vicky Phelan by the US laboratory.</p></speech>

It contributed a sum of &euro;25,000.  I will explain the only reason we made the contribution.  The circumstances were that the US laboratory delayed and was prepared to go into another day's hearing with Vicky Phelan.  To prevent that we put up a figure of &euro;25,000 as a contribution.</p></speech>

We are aware that earlier this year Vicky Phelan was fundraising for treatment.  We are aware that if some of the women who are now unfortunately deceased had been aware in 2014 that there was a misdiagnosis and had been informed at the time that they had options for treatment, then the outcomes could have been different.  They could have taken part in clinical experiments and so on.  Does Mr. Breen not think that has value in itself?  If these women knew this information earlier, it would not have changed their diagnosis of cervical cancer but it would have allowed them to look at other types of treatment, drugs or clinical trials.  Those options were delayed.  In three cases in which proceedings against the State are under way the options were not only delayed but those involved never had the opportunity to take them up in the first place.  How can Mr. Breen say that there is no liability on the State?</p></speech>

Statutorily, that is what I am told to do: I must operate within that system.  If the system said that material non-disclosure affected the clinical outcome, then we would definitely have got involved and would have compensated for it.  That is absolutely definite.</p></speech>

This was a failure of a number of different agencies within the State.</p> <p>  In most of the commentary today there is talk about the 98% of clinical negligence cases that are settled without the necessity for a contested court hearing.  That is not all of the work the agency covers, as there are other cases outside of that involving all the various agencies that are represented.  I was struck by the figure of 98% because I am aware of a number of cases that went to court outside of the HSE, and cases that were then settled where a gagging order was put in place.  I have come across that a lot in the context of my term on the Committee of Public Accounts.  The reference to 98% of cases would lead one to believe that there is nothing to worry about given that 98% of the cases are dealt with, but if I were to examine some of the cases, without naming them, that have come before the State Claims Agency, they are reported to the agency through the solicitor that served the summons-----</p></speech>

As to whether there are times when we are accompanied by people from the HSE or a hospital, yes they would be there, but purely in the capacity of, for example, being a medical expert or adviser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018050800002#L02900"><p>So senior people within the HSE and within the State Claims Agency are aware of cases but before a case gets to that stage everyone seems to be unaware of what is going on.  That is the point.  All due attention is given after the summons is served but prior to that, for example in asking for information from the HSE, not all the files are provided.  In fact, I heard a solicitor say on the radio the other day that it is only when a legal firm representing the client goes to the HSE that the full disclosure will be made.  I find that quite shocking, and it annoys me that it would be the case.  In other cases the HSE was asked for the reports and files and it was provided with pages missing and then when it came to the stage leading to the court case the missing pages miraculously appeared on the files of the other side.  The impression I get from talking to a number of people who have been through the system with the SCA is that they find it frustrating and hugely costly.</p> <p>  One individual told me he had to put up &euro;100,000 to be able to take part in the game, and to fight for his case, and that it dragged on for years.  The messages that are going out from here are mixed.  Mr. Breen said the agency shows compassion and humanity, yet people on the other side tell us that the State Claims Agency appoints solicitors to represent it and that they find it difficult to deal with the State Claims Agency and those who take cases find it hugely difficult and the process takes years.  In fact, one individual told me that he felt that there was no honesty in the system, that people do not meet face to face and that there is a wall of silence within the HSE, in particular, in relation to these matters.</p> <p>  I am just pointing this out because some of the commentary would lead one to believe that everything is hunky dory but it is far from it.  My first question is what Mr. Breen has to say in response to that.  My second question is what he says to the HSE, that has failed to report this and whose own system has failed to flag this.  Will he stand with those affected who will be going through the courts with the American company?  It would seem to me that the original contract was flawed; that it was the case that the Department put it in place to wash its hands of it so that it would not affect it.  I believe the HSE and the State Claims Agency have a role to play.  What assistance will they give to people affected?</p></speech>

That is why, over the years, we have done different things to try to make that better.  One of the things that we did on our own initiative entirely was to bring forward the periodic payment orders, PPO, that we are making for catastrophically injured victims.  We are allowing them to be paid for a period of time so that there will be absolute certainty and that families to not have to worry about money running out.  That was one of the things we did.</p> <p>  I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPO legislation.  We advocated the pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow my colleague, Ms Foley, and I believe it would transform the behaviour and the way we handle these cases.</p><p>It has been in the UK for a very long time and it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings.  They simply issue a letter of claim and we would issue a letter in response to that.  The idea is that we narrow down the issues to those that are really between the two parties and then mediate them.  I have advocated for this position for a very long time and despite the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into play, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have that even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had that tomorrow.</p><p> To come back to the HSE, medical records and the supply of same, when a patient looks for records from a hospital obviously we are not involved.  Therefore, the experience of the patient in that context is one that is beyond the State Claims Agency.  Clearly, if we were asked to furnish a copy of medical records to a plaintiff we would make sure that we are furnishing all of the relevant records.  Plaintiffs' solicitors will say that we are difficult to deal with and I understand that.  They will say that we delay but the one thing that they will not say is that very often, when we try to settle cases at pre-defence stage or prior to a trial, the sums of money they are looking for in settlement of their clients' claims are so overstated that we have no choice in many instances but to go to the steps of the court and sometimes, to trial.  I am reminded of one example where we were asked in a catastrophic injury case to pay &euro;26 million in damages and we ended up paying &euro;13 million after three days of trial.  Clearly we could not pay out &euro;26 million and the plaintiff's solicitor in the circumstances understood that &euro;13 million was the value of the case ultimately.  That is what we face.  It is not that we want to be in court with medical negligence victims.  In fact, as I said previously, if we had the pre-action protocol in place, much of what the Chairman has described in terms of frustrations would be relieved.  We share those frustrations because it makes us sound bad when people say things like we are difficult but actually it is the system.  It is the system that does not promote good management.  I have been saying for a very long time publicly and at previous meetings of various Oireachtas committees that the tort system as it applies to medical negligence cases that we have now is not fit for the management of those cases.  </p></speech>

What Mr. Breen has just told us is very informative in that context.

I was watching a lot of the proceedings.  The meeting has been very helpful.  We will have a debate on health tonight, a meeting of the Committee on Health, on which I sit, tomorrow and a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which I will chair and before which Mr. Breen will appear, on Thursday.  Gradually, piece by piece, this jigsaw is coming together, and the information the witnesses have given has been helpful.  As some of my colleagues, through questioning, have said, tort law is just not suitable when it comes to these cases.  Mr. Breen has been very open about this, which is very useful.  In a scenario in which the laboratories do not indemnify, it is almost like the State Claims Agency cannot dislodge itself.  Is that fair to say?  It is almost like, because of the statutory remit of the State Claims Agency and tort law, to which Mr. Breen has referred, the agency cannot dislodge itself from almost being a party to pursuing these very unfortunate people.</p></speech>

Effectively, there needs to be a change or an alteration, for want of a better to word, to its statutory remit to allow it more flexibility when it comes to these kinds of cases.  Whether Mr. Breen likes it or not, if something does not change and if the laboratories do not indemnify, the State Claims Agency is left in a scenario in which it is still party to a case against these other ten women.</p></speech>

They would not look for a gagging clause.  The problem is that it has been subcontracted.  I suspect that within the original contract that was signed by the CervicalCheck and the HSE with the American laboratory, they subcontracted the legal responsibility for the smear as well.  We now know that the ten cases involved American laboratories.  We now have a situation where the women are effectively being told that they are dealing with faceless American laboratories whose employers are the HSE, not the individual women.  Based on what has now happened and the fact that there are ten cases, does Mr. Breen believe that settlements will be made out of court?  Alternatively, does he believe that they will drag these women into court, or drag their families, three of the women having lost their lives?</p> <p>  The witness mentioned non-disclosure. On reflection, does Mr Breen believe that he is taking a purely legal reading of it rather than looking at it on a moral level?  Take the instance of a case of someone like Vicky Phelan.  If Vicky Phelan had known in 2014, she may have gone on the drug she is on now.  We have to go back to the source.  Will Mr. Breen, before he appears before the Joint Committee on Health, look at the contracts that were concluded between the HSE, CervicalCheck and the laboratories themselves?</p></speech>

What it boils down to is the role that the HSE can play in suing the laboratory and not putting the women through all of the court cases that will emerge out of this.  It is to examine the documentation, the agreements between the HSE and the laboratories, the State Claims Agency's role in all of this, and to try to find a way of protecting the women and getting their rights at the same time rather than have them go to court.  I know this may not be Mr. Breen's area, but it is a point that was made, and I think it is worth considering.  Every effort must now be made by the State to work with the women and ensure that they get what they are entitled to, and not to have protracted court cases with this American company making life difficult and adding further cost in human terms to the individuals and the families concerned.  I would urge the State Claims Agency, the Government and whoever else is involved to take on board, please, what the members are saying.</p></speech>

I will not go through all the various reports.  I reiterate the point made in our earlier Committee Stage discussion.  We are in an ecological crisis with the loss of biodiversity across the country and across the world which requires urgent action.  In effect maintaining the <i>status quo</i>is not a viable option; we need to engage in a range of new initiatives to protect wildlife which is being lost at a frightening rate.  I wish we had a Bill before us where all the stakeholders were brought in to consider how we develop our hedgerows, how we make them safe definitely for road users, but also how we use them in a way that promotes good farming practice that protects wildlife, improves tourism amenities and provides structural supports around a field.</p><p>Instead we have this very simple and confusing freeing up of the regulations to allow for cutting on the basis of a judgment of someone who owns a field.  We think it will add to further confusion and further threat and stress to Irish wildlife, particularly certain bird species which are still nesting in the hedges in August.  We do not believe that the provision that someone cutting the hedgerow would see if there is a nest would work.  We do not believe the National Parks and Wildlife Service has the resources to police this in any effective way.  The approach is completely wrong.  It should look at a new management strategy for hedgerows rather than weakening existing regulations and adding further confusion to what is a very uncertain system of protecting that ecosystem.</p><p>Our amendment is simple in that it replaces the key section in page 12 of the Bill with allowance for regulations giving the local authorities real control.  They would decide if a hedge needed to be cut back for road-safety reasons and would set out the regulations and approach, rather than having a free-for-all which is the direction the Bill proposes.  I ask the Minister to change tack even at this late stage.  We need to be proactive in protecting wildlife, not loosening regulations and allowing for more widespread destruction of habitat, which is the last thing we need to be doing.</p></speech>

We are probably entering a period where awareness is increasing radically throughout society with regard to what is actually happening to the ecosystem which we all share.  Programmes such as "Blue Planet" have really brought to people's attention that the range of species throughout the world is collapsing at a radical rate.  We even see that in our country.  The Minister has mentioned that the objective of the State is the protection of our natural heritage.  However, the protection of our national heritage has not been successful so far.  It is not just me who is saying so.  With every generation the range of species is collapsing and is in freefall.  There is no doubt that we are on the wrong course currently.  We are not passive observers; the Government has a role in this.</p> <p>  By reducing the habitat in which species live throughout their lifecycle, we then reduce the opportunity for that species to live.  People have major problems with the Government giving the go-ahead for the physical habitat to be reduced at key periods for these different species.</p> <p>  I understand the logic to part of the objective the Government is trying to achieve and I grant that the Government is not doing this out of recklessness.  The Government has regard to road safety concerns and other Deputies will also have road safety issues.  About three months after the Bill had been published I contacted the Road Safety Authority and asked if the Department had contacted it with regard to this road safety issue and was told that had not happened.  I then contacted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - one would figure that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would be partners on this matter - but it had not been contacted about the Bill.  In other words the drafting of the Bill as published had not been done in partnership with the Road Safety Authority, whatever about any contact after that.</p> <p>  I believe we can achieve both objectives - the objective of road safety and the objective of ensuring we do not reduce the habitat in which species already under threat exist.  One way to do that is to balance the two objectives, which is what I have sought to do in amendment No. 21.  I have sought to balance the agricultural needs and the safety needs with the environmental needs.</p> <p>  I know that some Members who have tabled amendments, including Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, cannot attend this particular meeting.  Would it be possible for amendment No. 23 to be discussed on Report Stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12018050800002#B00700"><p>I take this opportunity to fundamentally disagree with the two previous speakers.  I was brought up on a farm and was brought up to love animals and love nature, as I do.  No one can ever say otherwise.</p><p>I was brought up not to leave animals go hungry and to treat them right at all times.</p><p> Some Deputies are complaining that roadside hedges should not be cut because to do so would destroy habitats for nesting birds and so on.  I do not believe that birds are so foolish as to make their nests on the side of a busy road or any road.  They have the entire countryside.  I will not say anything about when hedges inside roadside ditches should be cut.  I have no view on that and have nothing against any proposal on it, but I must make it known that there are narrow roads along which hedges are not being cut.  People cannot walk or cycle safely.  Lives are being put at risk.  Roadside hedges should be kept cut all year round for the safety of people using those roads.  Look at what the prohibition is doing.  It is moving people out past the yellow line on roads that are only 3 m wide.  A number of pedestrians and cyclists are being killed each year.  This is why.  That is the truth.  The other side of the issue is that, because bushes and briars are out on the road, drains are getting blocked and water is flowing down and tearing roads.</p><p> I have nothing against birds or the like.  As I stated at our previous meeting, much more damage is being done to ground-nesting birds by animals and birds of prey, for example, magpies, mink and foxes, yet no word at all is being said by members about that or how we might protect those birds.  There is a type of hawk that cleans out every nest.  If, like me, members are interested in and serious about nature, including birds, then that is the route we should be taking.  We could save many more birds.  To claim that our roadside hedges should not be cut is preposterous, though.  I cannot agree with it.  These roads are a part of the infrastructure people need to access their homes, and it is the last inch that makes the difference when an accident happens and someone is killed or seriously hurt while out walking or cycling on a road.  People in cars cannot see as far around bends and accidents occur.  Many farmers cannot get up and down their roads now.  I know of milk lorries and school buses that are having severe difficulties getting around.  That is not fair.  Those people are paying their motor and property taxes, most have their own water supplies and they are costing no one anything.  They only want a road to their doors.  Each and every one of them is entitled to as good a road as people in Dublin 4 have.</p><p> Regarding gorse burning, I agree with the extra month that is being added in March.  In some cases, the North allows burning up to 15 April.  Ours is a small country and we should have the same facility.  If gorse is not burned for one or two years, which has happened previously due to bad weather lasting until February, someone somewhere will set it alight anyway.  I am not saying that farmers do that.  In fact, I am trying to support farmers and to have payments returned to them that were wrongfully taken because their lands were burned by fires that started elsewhere.  Neither God nor man could have stopped those fires.  These farmers rang the fire brigade and put their own lives in danger, but they have been left without any payment or the greater part of their payments even though they did not start the fires.  When there is too much gorse, it cannot be controlled.</p><p> I plead with members not to undermine what is being done by the Minister.  I support these two aspects of the Bill.  I would like my amendment on cutting roadside hedges all year round to be agreed.  Deputy Ryan referred to how local authorities had the facility to cut hedges all year round where they deemed them unsafe.  I was a member of Kerry County Council for a long time and I highlighted the situation on many roads, but for one reason or another, those dangerous hedges were never cut.  The council barely cut a few junctions.  It may be doing so again shortly.  The dangerous spots on narrow roads are left alone.  The council has the facility to do this, but I cannot explain why it does not.  It does not happen.</p></speech>

I will then address the specific points raised by the Deputies.  I thank them for their contributions.</p> <p>  I will not accept amendment No. 20, as there already exist provisions under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 requiring landowners to manage their hedgerows in the interests of road safety.  Local authorities also have power under section 70 to serve notices in writing on landowners requiring the cutting or trimming of hedges if they are considering a road safety hazard.  As these provisions under the Act apply for 12 months of the year, I see no reason for the amendment.</p> <p>  This morning, I launched the county biodiversity plans.  In 2018, there will be &euro;250,000 available for this scheme, amounting to &euro;2.5 million over ten years.  It will continue for the duration of the national plan.</p> <p>  I am not weakening regulations on hedges.  For the first time, we will have regulations as well as National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, guidelines.  This is not a free-for-all.  On the contrary, it brings order, regulation and guidelines.</p> <p>  I will not accept amendment No. 21, as the proposals in section 7(2) provide for managed hedge cutting to be allowed on roadsides only under strict criteria during August to help ensure that issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  Regarding the establishment of a task force, as part of the review of section 40 of the 1976 Act, a consultation process was initiated in order to gauge options on that section.</p></speech>

The working group established within my Department considered the issues raised in the submissions and its own experience of the implementation of section 40.</p> <p>  To clarify for Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, there is no question of reducing hedges in August.  This provision only allows for the trimming of road-facing hedges.  I should also correct the Deputy on another point.</p><p>Not only was the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport contacted, it agreed with section 8.

There are provisions under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 which oblige landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.  In addition, there is a provision which allows a local authority to serve notice on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  These provisions apply all year round.  Accordingly, I cannot consider the Deputy's amendment to be necessary, but I understand his concern about road safety and the difficulties faced by farmers.  However, I am happy that the scenario he describes is covered by section 8.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 23 was tabled by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, but she is not present.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 33 in the name of Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n contains three proposals, each of which I will deal with separately.  He proposes to insert a provision into section 40(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976 to make the notice made by a local authority to a landowner on the cutting of hedges under the Roads Act an exempted activity.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the harmonisation of the Wildlife Acts with the Roads Acts in that the provision contained in section 70(2) of the Roads Act 1993 which obliges landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety, as I mentioned, will be an exempted activity, as will the provision in section 70(2) which allows a local authority to serve notices on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  I must, therefore, oppose that part of the amendment as it is unnecessary.</p> <p>  The second part of amendment No. 33 provides that public bodies would have to notify me, as Minister, of all exempted works undertaken during the period from March to August.  I do not consider that it should be mandatory for public bodies to notify me of all such works as that would be an onerous task which could delay the carrying out of urgent work on health and safety grounds.  I have existing powers under section 40(3) of the Act to request details of such works from public bodies with a statement of the public health and safety factors involved.  These powers have been used on several occasions in recent years.  For that reason, I believe my existing powers are sufficient and request that the committee reject the amendment.</p> <p>  The third part of the amendment relates to a proposed amendment to the Roads Act 1993 relating to the placement of structures which may interfere with public roads.  These are matters outside the remit of the Bill and more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  Accordingly, it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-08a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12018050800002#D00400"><p>There is a fundamental difference.No one disagrees that we must be attentive to the need for road safety.  In that regard there are existing provisions in the Roads Act that allow us to attend to situations which involve a safety problem.  The provisions in amendments Nos. 20, 23 and 27 that we have put forward aim to give clarity to and strengthen such powers and make it clear that it is the responsibility of the local authority to address a road safety issue or direct a landowner to do so.  That is needed as part of a wider range of measures aimed at good hedgerow management.  In many instances, people do not cut hedgerows during the preferred period from September to March when there is a need for their proper management in that way.  However, central to the legislation brought forward by the Minister is that landowners are left to make that decision and decide whether to cut hedges in August in a way that we believe will be deeply damaging to wildlife and impossible to police in comparison with the approach we suggest, where it would properly be done by the local authority.  The Minister stated this would only apply to roadside hedges.  They do not make up a minute fraction of hedgerows, as was suggested in previous discussions on the Bill but rather I understand, approximately 19%, according to the latest or best hedgerow studies.  We are talking about giving landowners <i>carte blanch</i>e to decide if one fifth of hedgerows should be cut.  It would be fanciful for us to believe they will be able to assess ecological risk in dealing with issues such as whether there is a nest in a hedgerow.</p><p>The Bill will lead to a loosening of regulations when we should be tightening and clarifying the existing regulations which are not being applied.  If road safety is the real issue, as it is in some instances, we want there to be the cutting of hedgerows but it to be done under the control of local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, rather than handing control over to landowners such that it would be impossible to police, which is what the Minister is doing.</p></speech>

I also live down a very narrow country road.  Two years ago, with others, I was involved in a very serious collision on that road in which a car hit us full-on at speed.  Our car was shunted back ten feet, leaving it stuck in the ditch.  All those in the car were injured, with some of the injuries lasting for approximately six months.  I am acutely aware of the necessity for road safety on minor roads.  The individual who was driving the other car was still over the limit having been drinking the previous night.  The policing of roads to prevent drink-driving is one of the key tools we can use to ensure roads will be safer for everybody.</p> <p>  I am glad that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae admitted that there is a tool to fix some of the problems we face.  He has rightly stated section 70 is not used enough, but that issue could be resolved and we could use the section to achieve his objectives in that regard.  Interestingly, in responding to his amendment the Minister stated it was unnecessary as we already had section 70 to resolve the question with which we were dealing.  She is using my argument against the Deputy, but it does not apply solely to certain months but to the entire year, including the months about which we are speaking.  If it is valid in April and May, it is valid in March and August.  It cannot be invalid in those months if it is valid in others.  It is a matter of achieving the objectives for farmers and road safety and this becoming the generation that will put a line under the retreat of nature in our society, but that will not be the case if we eradicate habitats for animals in certain months of the year.</p></speech>

It is the same crowd that is supposed to be interested in safety.  It is the same group that is pulling in new lorries on the side of the road and taking them to test centres, even though they are only a few months old.  That is what the RSA is doing.  It has no interest at all in what is happening on the roads in terms of overgrowth and hedges and people having their eyes picked out or being killed.  As I stated, although local authorities may have the power, as I believe they have, to cut dangerous hedges that pose a health and safety risk, it has not been happening in Kerry or any neighbouring county in which I travel, including west and north west Cork and parts of Limerick.</p><p>People's lives are important and if someone is killed, there is no return.  Many people are killed while walking and cycling along our roads.  Considerable pressure is being applied by cyclists to have their safety improved.  To be honest, they are being pushed out among cars travelling behind them.  If two cars meet, cyclists are shoved into a ditch because the drivers are coming around a turn or the like and cannot see in time that another vehicle is coming.  That is how accidents and fatalities happen.</p><p> It was not out of malice but for every good reason that I tabled my amendment on allowing roadside hedges to be cut all year round.  It has not been happening.  The Minister stated she was not in support of my amendment.  It hurts me greatly that we cannot get my provision into this Bill, since we have been waiting for so long.  I have been vocal on this issue since 2004.  I had to fight to save my council seat because another councillor made a serious remark that I sought to get hedges cut because I wanted to get that work for myself.  I had to fight like I had never fought before to hold my seat in that election.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  I wanted to get hedges cut to allow school buses to bring children to schools.  The hedge cutting tender process was open to everyone else as well and the hedges in question were miles away from me.  It was in September 2004 and it cost me a great deal of money to save my seat.  I paid people to help represent me, yet it was not them who helped but another poor, honest man who put the matter in perspective and allowed me to defend my seat rightfully.  That is what I have gone through where cutting hedges is concerned.  I almost lost my seat trying to get them cut.</p><p> This is a serious matter.  I would have liked to succeed but I now realise that I will not.  I do not have the support of this room.  When the Bill returns to the Seanad, I am sure I will not have the support there either.  As such, I will not press my amendment even though it breaks my heart.  I honestly feel-----</p></speech>

They are not using their facility to cut dangerous hedges.  What they have stated several times is that it is landowners&rsquo; responsibility to cut hedges and that they do not have the funding to cut.  I do not know whether the Minister can make funding available but funding is probably the real reason dangerous hedges have not been cut.  I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s Department or another Department will make funding available to local authorities to cut these hedges, which are not being cut year after year and cause injuries and fatalities on our roads.</p></speech>

Landowners must have clarity and we cannot allow a situation to stand in which a person complying with an obligation under the Roads Act is in contravention of the Wildlife Act.  That is not right or fair.</p><p>The Roads Act is absolutely clear.  A landowner is obliged to deal with vegetation that is a hazard.  He or she has no option, in fact.  We cannot have a situation where they are forbidden to do so under the wildlife legislation.</p><p>I wish to say to Deputy Eamon Ryan that this is not <i>carte blanche </i>legislation and it is not a loosening of regulation.  I will have regulations governing hedgerow management in August, for the first time.  I noted his suggestion that farmers are not good custodians of nature.  I vehemently disagree with him because I think farmers are the primary custodians of nature.  </p><p>I can tell Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that there has been no retreat from nature in this legislation.  I am putting almost &euro;300 million into our heritage over the next ten years.  That is a statement of advancing the cause of nature and biodiversity and is not one of retreat.  </p><p>In response to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, this Bill ultimately is about safety on the road, security for users and the husbandry of roadside hedgerows.  I will engage with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the matter.  I disagree with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae about the drink driving limits but agree with his comments about cyclists and pedestrians.  </p></speech>

I disagree with her view on that aspect, as I have done with many other people before now.  Let us discuss what happens if a landowner tries to do anything outside his ditch but on the side of the road.  He is not even allowed to erect a small sign that directs people to his business, property or whatever because the land outside his property is deemed to be council property.  I disagree with the Minister and strongly believe that local authorities should cut roadside hedges.  If anyone dares to work outside of their ditch on the side of a public road, he or she will be brought to task very quickly by the local authority.  However, at the same time the local authority will not cut the hedge that is offending people who use the road.</p></speech>

I do not believe that I have said at any stage that farmers were not custodians of nature, which she has cited to me as a quote.  I do not think it makes her argument to play party politics.  We are here to tease out the details of the legislation and I argue that political insults will not help.  I believe that farmers are and should be the custodians of nature.  I have the highest regard and respect for them.  I want to help and support them in that task but this legislation is unhelpful.</p> <p>  I want to discuss the key point and, to a certain extent, there is confusion.  The Minister has said that nothing in the Wildlife Acts should restrict the ability of the Roads Act to apply, and that we have to apply road safety.  I agree but I am uncertain about amending the Wildlife Act to exclude the month of August from the provisions of section 40.  Why has the month of August been selected?  As the Minister has said that the Roads Act must apply, why not carry that through to all of the legislation?  What is the rationale for omitting the month of August alone?  Where is the impetus for doing so?  What is the strategic reason for same given the fact that we have section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, as she has said, which compels people to consider road safety when managing the landscape?  </p></speech>

Compliance with regulations should never involve the use of heavy flails.  This will mean that any birds' nests that might still be active in August would not be at risk.  There is another important fact that must be remembered, and it is a fact that can be lost sometimes.  It is an offence under the Wildlife Acts, under section 22, to wilfully destroy, injure or mutilate the eggs or nests of any bird species.  I wish to advise that there will be regulations and we will have a public consultation process, including consultation with the relevant stakeholders, when finalising any regulations that we come to.</p></speech>

My understanding is there is good data for the UK but the Irish environment is, by nature, different.  We do not have much information on when birds leave nests or when they are nesting.  How can the Minister argue that she has introduce this to allow widespread hedge-cutting in August and not to have the Wildlife Act applied because birds are not nesting in that period when the analysis from Birdwatch Ireland and others is that birds such as the yellowhammer species, which is under real threat, are in nests in August?  How will we ensure we protect that one species, given the more lax regulations that the Minister is introducing when we know those birds are nesting in August in Irish hedgerows?</p></speech>

I was on Galway County Council for 12 years and every year we had a problem with trying to cut not so much the hedges but the verges, to make the roads safe.  There was always a contradiction in that coming up to race week in Galway, they would cut all the roads leading in to the races which I would argue did not need to be cut at all but could not cut the grass along the local roads that I know about, which are dangerous where we have spent money on setting back boundaries.</p> <p>  It is important we realise that it is about safety on these narrow rural roads.  It is not about cutting hedgerows as much as cutting the verges, which need to be done for safety.  It is important we realise that in August, the bird nesting is complete and it can be done safely.</p> <p>  As Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Minister will agree, the best people to advise one about nature are the farmers because they need it more than anybody else.  Consequently, by trusting the farmers, we are not running away from anything.</p> <p>  If we cannot cut the verges earlier we are spending a lot of money and letting grass grow up and people cannot see around the corners after setting back the boundaries.  It is a contradiction if we cannot maintain them.</p></speech>

It is the end of the growing season.</p> <p>  We have done the review.  As I stated, this is a highly regulated managed two-year pilot period, the impact of which will be measured.  Our experts will overview it.  In August 2018, because of the snow, hedges will not have been cut for seven months.  We need to bear that in mind as well.  If one thinks about it, birds' nests will not be supported by this current year's growth because the nests are built in the spring when the current year's growth has not occurred.</p></speech>

The purpose is to give the Minister the ability, where there is no other satisfactory solution, to deviate from the restrictions in section 40(1) of the 1976 Act to permit the management of vegetation referred to in section 1(a) or (b).  The amendment focuses on the interests of public health and safety and air safety to prevent serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water to ensure the protection of flora and fauna.  It states the regulations must specify the species of wild flora and fauna that are subject to derogations, the conditions of risk and the circumstances of time and place under which derogations may be granted and the authority empowered to declare that the required conditions obtain and to decide what means and arrangements of methods may be used.  The amendment looks to empower the Minister in this area.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 looks at the birds directive.  We had this discussion at an earlier stage, but the point is that the amendment would make sure the birds directive was front and centre of the Bill and that the Minister would also be able to protect historical, ecological and archaeological landscapes.  </p><p>They are the objectives of the two amendments.</p></speech>

He is proposing to delete section 40(2) and replace it with new provisions.  The existing section 40(2) sets out the exemptions referred to in section 40(1) prohibiting the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation from 1 March to 31 August.  The exemptions include works carried out in the ordinary course of agricultural work undertaken by Departments and public bodies for public health and safety reasons, clearance work involving road or other construction projects and fisheries development works undertaken by Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Deputy would be highly prescriptive and involve me in making regulations under a number of headings, including, curiously, for air safety reasons, to allow exemptions under section 40(1).</p><p>The exemption provisions in the existing section 40(2) are considered reasonable and I do not see any need for a change in the exemptions.  As the Deputy is aware, an amendment to section 40(2) of the 1976 Act is proposed in section 8 of the Bill and will be discussed later in the debate.  For the reasons I have given, I ask the committee to reject amendment No. 24.</p></speech>

What is the problem the Minister is seeking to address in this section and the Bill as a whole?  That is what I am trying to tease out.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that her intention is to address road safety issues.  This is a proposal to improve road safety.  I do not understand.  I do not believe the Minister would say this is a proposal to improve the protection of wildlife.  It is being introduced to address road safety issues.  The argument being made in amendment No. 27 is that if that is the Minister's intention, the best approach is to ensure the local authority can act to direct a landowner to address a road safety issue or take action itself.  Section 70(2)(b) of the Roads Act 1993 allows a local authority to issue a direction to a landowner.  Section 70(9) of the same Act allows a local authority to take action.  I mention this as a means of outlining the purpose of the amendment.  I return to the question that is at the centre of my argument: why are we giving people the freehold ability to cut hedgerows in August?  It is being done to address a road safety issue when it could be addressed by the local authority directing the landowner to take action or taking action itself in circumstances where there is a clear road safety issue.

In essence, section 8 is trying to harmonise the Wildlife Acts and the Roads Acts to eliminate the confusion that has been caused during the years on this issue.  I have already addressed the issues related to hedgecutting in the month of August.  I have explained the reasons and rationale for that decision.  I do not propose to go into them again.  It is important to say that under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, hedgecutting cannot be engaged in by individual landowners during the closed season from March to the end of August.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that works to be undertaken by landowners along public roads under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 for safety purposes will be considered to be an exempted activity under section 40 of the 1976 Act, as amended.  The Deputy's proposal would align the Wildlife Acts with a specific subsection of section 70 of the 1993 Act.  If it were to be accepted, the Wildlife Acts would continue to contradict the remainder of section 70.  That is really the reason for this provision.  It is also important to note that it is being introduced on the advice of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The nesting season now occurs earlier, as reflected in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 which provided for an earlier start to the closed season.  That Act should also have provided for the closed season to end on 31 July in line with nesting patterns.  As Deputies will be aware, August is a busy farming month.  As many farmers harvest crops, spread soil nutrients and transport livestock in August, they need access to the roads.  Therefore, the decision to allow them to cut hedges during August is a practical one from the perspective of the safety of road users.  August is also the peak month for tourism, with many tourists travelling in cars on unfamiliar regional and secondary roads or walking on such roads.  For road safety reasons, it is sensible to allow hedges to be cut during August.  In recent years the unpredictable winter weather has typically resulted in the hedge cutting season being reduced by one third.  The agricultural machinery involved in hedgerow trimming is very expensive.  Many operators work long hours during the open season to ensure work is completed.  August is a month during which we have between 12 and 14 hours of daylight.  The amount of daylight continues to reduce when August is over.  In the interests of the safety of machinery operators and motorists, hedge cutting should be allowed in the month of August.  Fly-tipping which is a growing problem in the countryside is another issue that should be taken into account.  Community groups that voluntarily clean roadside ditches have noticed that ditches which are regularly cut and maintained are less likely to be used as a dumping ground.  The earlier opening of the hedge cutting season will facilitate earlier cutting and maintenance of hedges.  In addition, the closed period should not apply where local authorities and landowners identify road safety issues such as the need to improve sight lines.</p></speech>

I never met a tourist who did not like hedgerows and did not feel a slight sense of loss when we were taking them out.  It seems from what the Minister has said that the main argument in favour of this measure is to facilitate contractors to get the work done.  The Minister has mentioned that another of the reasons for making this change is the fact that the nesting season is starting earlier each year.  Will she provide me with that analysis?  Where can I find evidence of the change in nesting patterns?  I would like to understand the logic behind the argument that this is a reason to allow hedgerows to be cut in the month of August.</p></speech>

It is becoming increasingly difficult to define exactly the behavioural patterns of certain species.  This year is an outlier because of the snow and the arrested growth in nature.  Growth and nesting periods deviate radically from year to year.  Fly-tipping is a national disaster.  Anyone who lives in the countryside will agree that it has become radically polluted in recent times.  This is not good for tourism or the ecosystem.  The causes of fly-tipping include bin charges, the cost of recycling and our inability to provide for bottles to be returned in exchange for 10 cent a bottle.  Reducing the functional habitat of animals is probably not one of the raft of positive actions could be taken to reduce the level of fly-tipping.</p></speech>

This section limits it to roadside hedge-cutting but many fields do not come to the roadside.  Any fields that do come to the roadside also have three sides of hedges that do not come to the roadside.  In fact, on the narrow roads and especially on the boreens into houses, the tourists constantly complain about visibility, particularly those tourists who would normally drive on the opposite side of the roads.  There are constant complaints about lack of visibility on rural roads over the summer and specifically in August when we get the most visitors.  It is a problem.  I do not see wholesale cutting of roadside hedges but to be able to do it without having to go through a very convoluted process of getting permission from the local authority in August is a proportionate proposal.</p> <p>  There is a need to look at what is causing the decrease in our bird population.  It is a lot more complicated than the possibility of being able to cut a few hedges in August.  There is another problem when verges overgrow with grass that technically one can cut anyway.  The local authorities are highly adverse to doing even that, although we get major problems because of it.</p> <p>  I happened to be travelling on very narrow roads on Friday in a certain part of the world that does not have a lot of hedgerows but with very high walls along the narrow roads.  I said to the driver to keep 1 m out from the cyclists, but if he had done so we would have been in the ditch on the other side of the road or would have knocked against the walls.  It must be recognised that a lot of the boreens of rural Ireland - not the regional roads - are exceptionally narrow.</p> <p>  There are many heavy goods vehicles, milk trucks, timber trucks and every kind of vehicle going down very small roads.  I have often travelled from Mallow to west Cork taking the byways and they are very twisted with a lot of hedges.  It is fine until one comes around a corner and is up against a 40 ft articulated truck, whose driver might have seen one but one will not have seen the truck.  If the car is driven by a tourist it is an absolutely extraordinary situation.  I believe that what is proposed in the amendment is very proportionate and limited.  It is much more limited than original proposals for the wholesale cutting of hedges by professional contractors in August.  I believe this proposal is proportionate.</p></speech>

As we have already discussed, these provisions detail the regulations for the trimming of the current year's growth.  There is a balance of consideration here.  I have been advised by the experts in the National Parks and Wildlife Service in this regard.  The consultation has been public with 188 submissions received ranging from detailed submissions to individual brief points of view.  Stakeholder groups such as BirdWatch Ireland, An Taisce, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Departments and local authorities also made submissions.  There were 102 submissions from members of the public, 44 submissions from representative bodies, 29 submissions from other Departments and local authorities, eight submissions from elected representatives and five submissions from businesses and consultancies.</p> <p>  Ireland has some 300,000 km of hedgerows.  When we speak of roadside hedges as the subject of the provisions of this Bill, it is actually a fraction of the entirety of the total hedgerow resource we are so lucky to have.  It is actually just 2%.  I noted also the contributions from the other Deputies on this subject.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister will clarify a point I raised during my speech on Second Stage.  Some persons came to me who believed this amendment would allow for wholesale cutting of hedges at any time of the year.  I believed that all it did was provide for the existing section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, which allows - with the permission of the local authority - the trimming of hedges, the removal of trees that might fall and so on.  Will the Minister confirm that section 8 in its present form does exactly that, no more and no less? Does it put back the <i>status quo</i>for whenever there is a need to cut a hedge for safety purposes at any time of the year - in the view of the local authority and not just in the farmer's view or the landholder's view - so that the local authority can give its permission or an order to do so?</p></speech>

I have been told, and I believe the research was done by the national hedgerow database, that 19% of randomly selected hedgerows were found to be roadside hedges, not 2%.  Having spoken with people involved in the preservation of our hedgerow system, which is under threat for a variety of reasons, there is recognition that roadside hedgerows tend to be some of the most important.  They are the oldest, they are the boundary hedges, they have the most diverse wildlife within them and they are the most sensitive to disruption.  This is not an insignificant 2%.  These most important hedges are, from 1 August, under attack regardless of whether the local authority gives a direction and just because somebody considers that it is so.  This is not an insignificant change.</p></speech>

On the other hand the wildlife legislation states that if this is during the closed period, the hedge cannot be touched.  Section 8 merely addresses the exceptional circumstance wherever it is hazardous and in order to ensure road safety.  I am not talking about cutting back the entire hedge.  It is about certain exceptional circumstances and cutting back that part of the hedge on the roadside that is a safety issue.</p></speech>

I may not have mentioned it, but I should stress that this is being done on a pilot basis.  The provisions of the Bill are restrictive and would allow for regulated cutting, so this will apply in respect of one month only and will have a limited lifespan of two years.  We will then be able to assess the situation.</p></speech>

As such, one twelfth of the hedges are road-facing.  There are also fields that do not touch any roadside, so the figure drops further.  When I was at school, one twelfth of 100% equated to approximately 8%.  I don not believe it would be even that in this case, though.  Where I live, unless the corners are very bad, it is normally the local authority that undertakes hedge cutting, so the figure is probably one tenth of that again.  As such, fewer than 1% of hedges will be trimmed on the outside.  What is more likely to happen is something that happens all of the time anyway.  In the autumn, farmers trim 50 m on each side to allow for better access to fields for tractors and better visibility for road users.</p> <p>  This is the same issue that is being debated in the Road Traffic Bill, namely, human safety, and human safety has to trump all.  Therefore, I will not press my amendment.</p></speech>
