We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is the permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Andrew Harkness, director of audit.  There will be two parts to our consideration of this report.  In the first part we will discuss the findings of the report with representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and as they come in for particular mention in the report, we will meet representatives of the Central Bank for the second part.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who is accompanied today by Mr. Frank Griffin and Mr. Kevin Coman, both of whom work in the remuneration, industrial relations and pensions division, and Ms Helen Codd from the corporate support unit.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement on his report on the management of severance payments in public sector bodies.  I should point out that the Comptroller and Auditor General is also accompanied by Ms Patricia Devlin.  Apologies, that was my mistake.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016092100002#A00500"><p>There were obviously crossed lines in our communications.  Ms Patricia Devlin is the senior auditor who carried out the work on this special report and she is accompanying me today.</p> <p>  The report before the committee was undertaken as a result of financial audit work in a number of public bodies that identified large one-off severance payments.  I had a concern that there seemed to be variation in public bodies as to how these should be managed.  The examination did not include an assessment of the circumstances giving rise to individual termination agreements and severance payments.  The findings in the report are intentionally presented at a level of detail that does not identify individuals.  The emphasis is on how cases were handled and not on who received what payments and why.</p> <p>  I might also point out here that severance agreements can include cash amounts or non-cash elements, for example, added years for pension purposes or both.  Some schemes of employment include specific provision for severance payments, often reflecting the nature of the employment contract or the expected duration of the work.  Outside those formal schemes, severance payments may also arise in a number of situations.  For example, there may be cases where an employee's capacity to perform the role becomes limited or where, for whatever reason, the employment relationship has broken down irreconcilably.</p><p>In such cases, severance payments may be in the best interests both of the employer and employee.  A characteristic of such discretionary severance payments is that the amount paid is over and above what the employee is contractually or statutorily entitled to.</p><p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for policy on public sector pay and employment terms and conditions.  Apart from the rules set out on specified approved severance schemes, the Department had not issued any general guidance to public sector entities on severance payments.</p><p> I am glad to note that in publishing a revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies in August of this year, the Department included additional guidance relating to termination agreements and severance payments which I expect will clarify matters for public bodies and ensure more consistency of practice in the future.</p><p> My examination looked at awards made between 2011 and 2013 under six public service schemes that provide for severance payments.  The examination found broad compliance with scheme rules in most cases, with the exception of a scheme for chief executives of State bodies.  Two State bodies made severance payments in the form of pension enhancements amounting to more than &euro;1 million in total, without the required prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Other key findings included that three of the schemes did not provide for maximum amounts payable, severance payments were generally not disclosed in financial statements, and there were deficiencies in documentary evidence on one scheme.</p><p> The examination also looked at a number of high-value discretionary severance payments where no formal scheme was in place.  We identified 14 such payments made by six public sector bodies in the period 2011 to 2013, amounting to almost &euro;1.5 million.  Six of those payments, amounting to more than &euro;540,000, including legal costs, were made by the Central Bank.</p><p> In the report, we have set out a good practice framework for public sector bodies making such discretionary severance payments.  This was adapted from a framework developed by the office of my New Zealand counterpart.  We used the framework to assess how each identified discretionary payment was handled.  The assessment resulted in recommendations regarding supporting documentation, the need for external sanction, the use of confidentiality clauses and disclosure requirements.  I welcome that the Department&rsquo;s revised code of practice has addressed these issues.</p><p> The Central Bank is in a different position from other public bodies in that, due to its statutory independence, it does not require external sanction for termination agreements and severance payments.  I found that the bank had not adopted a standard approach for assessing and determining cases or for approval of the severance awards.  In response to the report findings, the bank has implemented a formal procedure on discretionary severance payments which incorporates the good practice outlined in the report.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and wish him all the best in his new role.  There are some familiar faces on the new committee, but some new ones also.  I wish members all the best with their work.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for giving me the opportunity to make this opening statement.  I am pleased to appear before the committee to discuss these issues.  I will give a brief synopsis of the findings of the report and its context and will then set out the response of our Department.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform very much welcomes the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is timely and informs the ongoing development of policy in the Department and for the public service more widely.  The Department regards seriously compliance with procedures governing payments.  This report found that there was broad compliance with procedures in most cases, which is a welcome finding for us.</p> <p>  The report raises a number of issues which we have taken on board and to which we are responding.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined some of the responses we have undertaken since the report was published.  The report proposes a good practice framework for public sector bodies making discretionary severance payments.  This framework is a particularly useful input, which we support and intend to advance.</p> <p>  The report points out that confidentiality clauses, which were widely used, should acknowledge statutory override of confidentiality terms and should not interfere with employees' rights or prevent an employer from fulfilling his or her accountability obligations.  We have referred specifically to this matter in recent guidance and we expect to deal with this further in a circular to be issued in the near future.</p> <p>  The report recognises that severance arrangements play an important role in recruiting and, when necessary, exiting people from the public service.  Candidates are aware that circumstances can change and that they may not be able to remain in their post as long as had been hoped or intended initially.  Against that background, the availability of a severance arrangement is likely to be viewed as an important element of their overall remuneration package.</p> <p>  The public service also needs to provide for severance arrangements to address key risks, for example, where the employment relationship has broken down or where a new and fresh approach needs to be introduced.  The public service needs to have the tools to manage all these situations.</p> <p>  There is also a need to provide for early retirement or severance to deal with situations where individuals wish to exit the public service rather than be redeployed or where there is a need to be able to deal with the consequences, for example, of an economic downturn.  These situations are dealt with currently through the collective agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on voluntary severance terms within the public service.</p> <p>  We should be clear about the relative position of severance payments in the overall context of public service pay and pensions policy.  In the period under examination, when the total cash value of public service pensions amounted to &euro;8.8 billion, the cash value of severance payments reported on was less than &euro;7 million.  On expenditure, for which I am accountable, under Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, expenditure in the period was &euro;1.4 billion while the cash value of severance payments was &euro;1.149 million.</p> <p>  There have been a number of changes in severance arrangements in recent years which are set out in the brief we supplied to the committee.  Recently, text has been included in the revised code of practice for State bodies requiring disclosure of the aggregate value of severance payments and agreements in excess of &euro;10,000.  The text also calls on State bodies not to enter into confidentiality agreements which preclude them from disclosing details of settlements other than in exceptional circumstances and on foot of legal advice.  The Department is currently considering what further elaboration on the existing guidance on severance may be necessary.</p> <p>  I welcome the report and look forward to discussing it with the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and in particular Ms Devlin for her work.  I also thank Mr. Watt for his opening remarks.  I am slightly puzzled that the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which was published in August 2016, is not yet available to me as far as I am aware.  We are now eight years on from the financial collapse and the knock-on effects in terms of public service numbers.  Given the discrepancies between severance arrangements across the public sector, I find it a little puzzling that in this climate such a document is only being put together now.  Perhaps Mr. Watt can address that at a later stage.</p> <p>  I am conscious I have 20 minutes, if I am not mistaken, and therefore I will try to be as efficient as possible if Mr. Watt could be as well.  I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

I refer in particular to the chart concerning the various schemes.  One particular civil servant received a total severance package of &euro;1.12 million.  I would like to know the answers to a couple of questions.  I appreciate the anonymous nature of the report, which is fine, and I have no intention of deviating from that or naming any names.  From my perspective, however, I have a fundamental question.  How would a person employed in the Civil Service amass such a payment?  How much did it cost for that person to purchase additional years, or were they purchased on their behalf by the agency for which they worked?  For how long was that person in the employment of the State to accrue a severance package of &euro;1.12 million?</p></speech>

I said at the beginning that there are cash and non-cash elements.  On reflection, it might have been better to have said "total severance value" there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016092100002#C00100"><p>Okay.</p></speech>

I just wanted to make that clarification.</p></speech>

It was a question of what the person had already accrued in terms of pension entitlement.  Added benefits were given which meant that the person went on their pension earlier and started to receive their pension earlier than otherwise would have been the case.  It was also a question of the value of the pension.  It is not the case that someone was written a cheque for &euro;1.19 million.  The person started to receive their pension.  The value of that pension over the years in which the person will draw it is &euro;1.19 million.  I am sorry but I wanted to make that clarification.</p></speech>

We made an exception by referring to the Central Bank because a considerable number of these payments were made in respect of that body.  We identified them because we felt the system was big enough to ensure the identities of those individuals was not obvious.  I would be concerned that if I were to talk about the circumstances of this case in that period, the individual would be identifiable.</p></speech>

Chapter 2, which relates to severance schemes, mentions that two State bodies made payments in the form of pension enhancements between 2011 and 2013 without the required approval, or prior approval, of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Has the Department conducted a review of those two instances?</p></speech>

When we issued clarification on this issue in February 2010, we made it clear that any contract arrangements involving severance payments, added years or enhanced pension entitlements on exiting for CEOs would have to receive prior approval when the contract was being signed.  We also said that when the payments were being made, we would have to check that they were appropriate in the context of the terms of the contract.  The contracts in these two instances were entered into in the late 1990s.  We were informed about these deals when the payments were being made.  The payments were based on the contractual arrangements into which people had been signed, so there was no leeway for the State at that stage.  It had no choice other than to make the payments.  We have tightened up the rules to ensure all contracts have to be cleared and approved by us in advance.  That allows us to approve the actual termination of payments at the time of the signing of the contract.  We have addressed the gap that existed.  The case mentioned by the Deputy is a historical one that goes back to contracts signed in the late 1990s.</p></speech>

We could try to challenge it, but we would lose the case.  I am not sure if there are other cases which have not yet come to our attention.  As six years have passed since we issued the clarification, and given that most of the people in question have moved on or retired, it is unlikely that more cases of this nature will arise.  The Deputy is absolutely correct when he says that if contracts were entered into prior to the issuing of the circular, and we are not aware of their termination, it is possible that we will have to make payments.</p></speech>

I think the code of practice has been in place since 2001.  It was updated in 2009 and again this year.  It covers a broad spectrum of issues in relation to the governance and oversight of public bodies.  I am sorry if I gave the impression that the code is totally new, because that is not the case.  There are new provisions in the revised code.  I think many issues have been updated in the code.  It is very much extended relative to what it was.  I think it might be of use and value to the committee at some stage to be taken through it and to look at certain elements of it.</p></speech>

It was reviewed in 2009.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has identified several instances where it was not adhered to.  While I accept Mr. Watt's point that it was broadly adhered to, significant sums of money are being paid out on behalf of several Departments and agencies that did not adhere to the rules set out by the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

Those would be the key things.  The bodies were making the decisions and making the payments without reference to any outside agency, but they were making them within the terms of the schemes that were in place, by and large.  The individual circumstances of each payment should have been explained to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that it was aware that the payment was being made and was able to satisfy itself that those circumstances were appropriate.  I am not trying to suggest that there is complete laxity in the scheme around this.  The difficulty we had with the code of practice as it stood in 2009 was that it was relatively unspecific about how severance payments should be dealt with.  One category of payment, across a very broad spectrum, was dealt with in the code.  We felt agencies were having to make these decisions without having enough guidance to ensure that there would be consistency in the approach in all Departments and agencies.</p></speech>

If a board is unsure, or if it interprets it in one way only for a different board to interpret it in another, that is a problem.  When we come to look at these payments and identify that different bodies have treated severance payments in different ways, we are in a position to identify the source of that difficulty.  That was what gave rise to the report.  We have to figure out why people are doing things differently in different places.  When we came back and talked to the Department about it, we said that the bodies needed more guidance.  We have tried to provide such guidance in our report.</p></speech>

The issues experienced in the particular timeframe analysed by this report have been highlighted in the code of practice and, indeed, in the report.  What actions have been taken to ensure that each Department and agency has the supporting documentation to prove and illustrate it has adhered to existing arrangements, both on foot of this report and in light of the updated code of practice?</p><p>Is the Comptroller and Auditor General satisfied or has he been provided with information to assure him that is now the case?</p></speech>

We now have clarity as well about how the Department expects them to be reported and handled, and the level of sanction required before such payments are made.  If I find in the future that a significant payment has been made that is not compliant I will point that out, depending on the amount and the level of the oversight, to the management and board of a public body but I might also refer to it in my audit certificate on their financial statements.  We have done that in other instances.</p> <p>  We have used this as an exercise to be clear about how we will test severance payments that we come across and examine.  Any significant severance payment that we would identify will go through the tests that we expect to see for the procedure.  We will be looking for the supporting documentation, for the advice, the signed agreement and so on.</p> <p>  In Chapter 3, in respect of some payments made, we asked a public body to show us the signed agreements.  It had draft agreements but it did not have signed agreements in place. That is not acceptable to us. </p></speech>

I think because I have brought attention to it public bodies have already started putting proper systems in place and completing the record.  Payments will continue to be made.  Public bodies now know that they must disclose the fact that they are making the payments and the aggregate value of those payments.  If that is done it is in the financial statements.  Members of the public can see that.</p> <p>  It is also important, and this is one of the key reasons for the disclosure, that the overseeing Department that relies on the financial statements will see that these payments have been made.  It can check its records to see whether we gave sanction for those payments to be made.  It happens regularly that expenditure requires the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not just in respect of severance payments.  If we find during the course of audit that we do not see the sanction what very often happens is the body then has to go the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and say it forgot to go to it with this and ask is it alright with it.  It receives retrospective sanction.  A similar process happens in the third level sector where the sanction of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is required for particular lines of expenditure or transactions.  If the sanction is missing we say it has to go back to the body that was supposed to give the sanction and fix the thing and then put systems in place to ensure it does not happen again.</p></speech>

In respect of the public oversight available to the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General and indeed this committee, while it is perfectly reasonable to withhold names and in this instance withhold agency and departmental names, I have a fundamental difficulty with it.  We are talking about taxpayers&rsquo; money and a State agency with a confidentiality agreement that I think has no place in the public sector, most especially if the information is withheld from the person responsible for auditing and, in Mr. Watt&rsquo;s case, a person responsible for an element of its governance.</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has set out in the report, the details are there and the public can see the value of the total award, not the total cash payment because most of the value is early pensions and added years as opposed to an upfront payment.  That has been our longstanding view and we set that out in the code of practice where we made it very clear that for payments above &euro;10,000 bodies should include that material in their annual accounts and in the appropriation accounts and for the 2015 appropriation accounts we have that line where we include those payments that are material.</p> <p>  This is not the practice in all countries.  Some countries take the view that it is possible to get a better deal for the State in difficult employment circumstances if the details are kept confidential.  Our view is that the imperative that the taxpayer needs to see how the money is being spent overrides those considerations but that is not the view elsewhere.  For example, in the United Kingdom, UK, permanent secretaries, human resources managers, legal people in Departments can negotiate, reach severance deals with people and keep those amounts confidential.  They have to produce aggregate figures for Departments or agencies but they do not give the individual amounts.  I think that is being reconsidered.</p> <p>  There is a debate but our view is that the imperative of this committee, of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the taxpayer overrides any other considerations.  The debate in the UK is that the value of the payments and the severance arrangements is lower and the time it takes for somebody to exit is faster and there is less trouble for the organisation if a confidential deal can be done.  There is a trade-off but for the moment we have set out a clear view.  We can debate the rights and wrongs of this but it is not absolutely clear cut. </p></speech>

The Deputy is aware there is a requirement of the Department that the total remuneration package of a chief executive in a year is disclosed in the annual financial statements.  We check that all those details are given.  Where a departing chief executive receives an additional non-contractual payment or even one within the terms of an existing scheme my view is that should be disclosed.  It would be known that the chief executive is leaving and the package is disclosed.  A different view might be taken within an organisation where several people at a lower level may have got a package because they became ill and are no longer able to do the work and so on.</p> <p>  There is something in the framework, which is on page 32 of the report, around confidentiality that the committee might like to discuss.</p><p>It is important that any agreement that is made does not contain confidentiality clauses that create a perception that the employee cannot speak about what has gone on or about poor practice within the body.  The whistleblower legislation specifically precludes any kind of contractual arrangement where there is an exchange of money to an employee.  One cannot gag them with a confidentiality clause.  It is a tricky space.  There is, maybe, a concern around the private details of an individual employee and that those should not be brought into the public domain.  There is also this other side that one cannot pay off an employee not to speak out against one.</p></speech>

Would there be an issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Committee of Public Accounts or both reviewing such instances in a private manner, as is dealt with in many other committees where private business is transacted, so that there is a public oversight and an auditing oversight of such arrangements?  This committee, for instance, is subject regularly to confidentiality, as I am sure is the Department and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I understand using aggregated sums, as Mr. Watt has mentioned, and that is not a bad idea.  However, there are other means to ensure the oversight function of this authority and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is adhered to in all instances.</p></speech>

Their issues relate to one case, but there are no names and the Comptroller and Auditor General does not talk about the names of the bodies.  However, of course, there is also the freedom of information legislation, FOI, which has separate legal provisions, which in terms of making information available would be probably far more open than is revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  That is another consideration.  We are dealing with FOI requests on these matters.</p> <p>  I know a lot of the issues have been dealt with in the to and fro.  I make the point again about the way in which the value of severance payments is set out in the report.  The majority of the value relates to early pensions and added years as opposed to upfront payments.  When it is set out, there is a tendency to say that an individual received &euro;1.1 million last week, which of course they did not.  In that particular case it was all related to early payment of pension.  I am not suggesting for one minute that it is not significant.  Of course it is and it is absolutely correct to discount it, as the report does, but in most cases the benefit relates to early retirement.</p> <p>  In all these cases we just look at the cost of the terminations - the cost of the exiting.  We do not look at the benefits for the organisations.  That is something, of course, which neither the Comptroller and Auditor General nor any of us here can talk about.  The benefits for the organisations in many cases could be multiples of the cost.  If it is a situation in an organisation where the relationship between a very senior person and the Minister or other colleagues has broken down, there could be damage to the organisation which may be looking after hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  When we are looking at the costs, particularly when it relates to the discretionary payments, and there are 14 cases over the period, we need to have in the back of our minds that these are done for very good reasons and there is a benefit.  With the best will in the world, unless we want to spend our time sitting down with the relevant, manager, HR manager and legal adviser, we will not really get a sense of the basis for the agreement.  To an extent we have ultimately to trust people who are closer to the challenges they face.  That is very important, but I-----</p></speech>

I think we have seen a lot of that in recent years.  I accept the point.  The only matter that concerns me is that agencies adhere to the rules and do most, if not all, of their business in the public domain in order that it is available to both the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee.  What is most important is that we should have an opportunity to review that to ensure the previous two points are adhered to.  If we are in that position, regardless of the figures involved, even if it does not sit well with some, the bottom line is that rules be adhered to, as Mr. Watt highlighted with my first point about a payment of in excess of &euro;1 million to one individual.</p> <p>  I accept the point that a contract is a contract.  While these can be challenged and renegotiated, the bottom line is that if agreements are in place, adhered to, accessible and reported, that in itself is adequate in terms of public service oversight on expenditure by this committee.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has highlighted certain parts of various schemes, or one scheme in particular where rules were bent or ignored.  In other instances, contractual agreements have been challenged with money thrown at legal costs to ensure the matter is dealt with, which means ultimately the taxpayer is footing the bill.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlights one particular instance in the Central Bank where a contractor was treated as an employee, I presume following a legal challenge.  While neither he nor I has the legal advice available, it presents a difficulty because as a report from the Central Bank is subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is subject to this committee.  As such there are questions there that, I am sure, my colleagues will cover.  I thank Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Watts.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016092100002#E00800"><p>That is me told.  I have only one observation or question.  I am not sure if it should be directed to Mr. McCarthy or Mr. Watt.  I thank them for their helpful presentations.</p> <p>  When we look at anything like this, we have to learn from past mistakes.  Although there was general compliance with the Department guidelines, obviously there was a notable exception when we look at the chief executives of some State bodies.  Even if we had more stringent guidelines as the report has recommended, I believe the witness referred to retrospective sanction which is like retention planning permission or something.  I always like to look at prevention rather than the cure, which goes without saying.</p> <p>  My question is on policing or enforcement.  We can have more stringent guidelines, which we want people to adhere to, but how do we enforce and police that?  Does it require some kind of review process?  Is that in the scheme or the code of practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016092100002#E00900"><p>In terms of the CEOs of State bodies, we changed the guidelines as far back as 2010.  We responded to the situation that arose where, in effect, contracts were signed with terms which we subsequently thought were overly generous or we did not approve of.  We tried to address that as far back as 2010.  The revised code sets out very clear enhanced obligations on bodies to adhere to the sorts of suggestions set out in the report to ensure details are published and that we do not enter into confidentiality agreements that make it difficult to look exactly at the costs for the taxpayer.  However, ultimately one has to trust, in this case, the boards of those bodies to meet the guidelines and I am sure their governance arrangements do that.  One has to ensure the Department is calling those bodies to account.</p> <p>  In our Department there are 310,000 public servants.  There are thousands of bodies, despite our efforts to reduce them over recent years, which I have discussed many times here.  There are still many bodies and always will be many bodies, offices and Departments, and we cannot police everything.  Of course, it would be foolish to try to do that and it would be very wasteful and counterproductive.  The committee would have me in complaining that our Department was too powerful and we were trying to control everything.  We have to set out guidelines - delegated guidelines - and ensure boards have proper governance in order that they adhere to those guidelines.</p><p>Good governance really comes down to having chairpersons of boards, individuals on boards and systems in place.  We have issued the code of conduct, which is very detailed and complex.  One could argue that it may be too detailed and too complex but we have set it out.  We will see how we get on in managing it.  At departmental level in the Civil Service, we have issued a new code of conduct for the governance of Departments, which is also very detailed.  It is really about getting the policy right, but then it is about governance.</p><p> One of the big changes over recent years that does not receive that much attention is the way in which we now appoint people to State boards.  We are going out of our way to set out clearly the types of skills, capacities and competence that we need to fill the gaps that may exist, and we advertising for people who may have those skills.  We hope that, over time, this will improve the performance of boards of governance.  That is really the issue.  Of course, there is a role for periodic reviews of the nature of that produced by the Controller and Auditor General.  There are reviews that we carry out in our own Department-----</p></speech>

It arises in regard to the cases of the two chief executives.  The termination benefit they received was bigger payments of pension earlier.  It might be helpful for public bodies and the Department, when making decisions about the value of the agreement being made, to put a valuation on the added years.  There is a very well-established methodology for looking forward and saying we expect to pay the pension for so many years into the future and for outlining the income of the person is getting and what it is worth today.  If on the termination of a chief executive's contract in the future, a public body disclosed that he or she was given added years for pension purposes and the value of that based on actuarial advice, it would be helpful from a public accountability point of view in knowing what was happening in terms of the termination of a contract with an individual.</p></speech>

The fact that the Department has embraced the Controller and Auditor General's report and welcomed his recommendations is very good and positive in view of external developments in this country at the moment in regard to other reports he has produced.  I welcome that.  The Department has clearly put its hands up.  It has clearly been put in context that there has been good compliance, by and large.  It has to be said that there has been good compliance.  In regard to other matters, the Department has put its hands up.  However, I would not be totally reassured by the delegates' responses here today or their written report.  In fact, they have gone some way towards justifying their stance, which I do not believe is helpful.  It would be helpful to come in and say that there has been good compliance in general and to outline what needs to be changed.  The delegates are telling me there is a code of practice in place now.  This is good.  I will come back to this.</p> <p>  The delegates also tell me there is a debate on disclosure.  Mr. Watt should note that may be a debate we should have some day but I get a little nervous when I hear about a debate about keeping things confidential.  It is a question of attracting good people.  Everything Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann do is open and accountable.  My severance pay as a councillor has been in every paper in the country.  My salary and that of every Deputy are made known throughout the country.  Presumably, we are attracting good Deputies to the D&aacute;il.  The process is open and accountable.  The delegates should bear that in mind when having their debate on how to attract good people.</p></speech>

The delegation accepts all these but it is noteworthy that disclosure in accounts was the problem.  "Civil servants", "Secretaries general", "Chief executives of State bodies" and "Ministerial appointments" all received a mark for no disclosure in accounts.  Is Mr. Watt telling the committee that will not happen again?</p></speech>

To suggest they were not available beforehand is incorrect.  If the Deputy makes a freedom of information request or asks us in a parliamentary question, we will provide her with the details on any termination or severance arrangement.</p></speech>

That is happening and will continue.  The point I am making is that just because the Controller and Auditor General has placed an X beside "Disclosure in accounts", we should not imply the information was not available before.  It was available, and it was available in response to parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests.  It was available in evidence I have given at this committee in the past.  That has now been formalised in terms of the appropriation accounts for Departments.  Within the code of conduct, we have made it clear to agencies and bodies that it should be set out in their annual accounts.  I refer to the reports as well as the appropriation accounts.</p> <p>  In effect, we are responding to the report by saying we can do more, make it clear and set it out.  That is what we are doing.  We are 100% behind the recommendations.  These are the sorts of recommendations our Department pushes independently of reports by the Controller and Auditor General.  This is the sort of work we have been doing in recent years.  We have moved to a much more open approach to all these matters.  As members know, the details on the pay of civil servants and their expenses and diaries are available to the public.  This is the same as for Deputies, members will be happy to hear.</p></speech>

We will be coming back to that separately with the Central Bank.  When we read about the education sector, referred to on page 38, we note there was a substantial amount of money in respect of which no approval was given by the Department.  Three severance payments were made by two third level institutions, presumably colleges or universities.  The delegates should correct me if I am wrong.  In one case, a third level institution paid an employee just over &euro;183,000.  The legal costs brought it up to almost &euro;250,000.  Paragraph 3.30 of the Controller and Auditor General's report outlines what I really find amazing.  It states the governing body of the institution was made aware of the case and was informed that it was a matter for the president of the institution to decide.  The settlement terms and amount paid were agreed and approved by the president on his own.  He went back and told the governing body of the outcome.  That surprises me in itself.  One wonders why there is a governing body if the president is going to make the decision.  The question for the delegation concerns the fact that this was done without any sanction from the Department.  Is that not correct?  The institution did not believe it needed sanction.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It is up to the relevant body to ensure that any payments are appropriate and that the parent Department, in this case the Department of Education and Skills, would be informed and that it would receive sanction.  However, there is a bigger issue here around governance.  Our education institutions have budgets of hundreds of million of euro, amounting to &euro;400 million, &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million.  I am not here to defend the Department of Education and Skills but it cannot decide everything; it cannot be there standing behind the president of a governing body.  The ultimate responsibility for doing the right thing rests with the leadership and the governance structures within these bodies.  That is the real challenge for us in this situation.  We need to set the right policy which, we hopefully will do, but it is then up to the relevant bodies to ensure it is being implemented appropriately, or else the system will not function.  If we say the Department of Education and Skills will sanction this payment, and that is what we are saying now, where do we draw the line?  Do we want the Department of Education and Skills to run third level institutions?  No, we do not want that.  Therefore, there is a balance to be struck.  As we pursue the new policy, it will be interesting to see the extent to which it will operate.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that the body actually handled it well.  It got legal advice.  It made an assessment as to whether this was the best thing to do.  We must finish this situation, as the Secretary General has said.  Damage can be done to a body and development does not happen if there is a difficulty with an individual.  The specific place where it fell down was that it should have gone to the Department and said: "We have a problem, here is how we are dealing with it, it has been fully considered by the governing body, it understands the principle and we have agreement for the deal and is the Department comfortable with this?"  That is the thing it did not do.</p></speech>

I am not happy with Mr. Watt coming back telling me the Department of Education and Skills cannot micro-manage.  I am asking how we improve it.  I am putting my hands up welcoming the Comptroller and Auditor General saying there has been generally good compliance but on the specific issues that have been raised, I am not leaving here today confident in the belief that this could not happen again tomorrow in those third level institutions.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  On the second page of the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General comments on the second institution.  There is some confusion here with respect to the Health Service Executive, HSE, in that there is reference to the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE.  The only point I want to make about it is that they were significantly at variance-----</p></speech>

In other words, they picked out a scheme to say that is what they were following yet there was significant non-compliance or they were at variance with that scheme.  How can that be avoided in the future?  I am not asking for an answer that says this is only a small amount; I am asking how can these issues that have been highlighted be avoided in the future?  I will conclude because I am conscious of time but I would like that question answered.</p> <p>  The second issue that jumped out at me related to confidentiality.  The final institution highlighted is the health sector.   It had a gagging clause in one of its severance provisions.  The clause does not acknowledge any statutory obligation override.

That has been addressed.  Whether it was not legally the case, it seems inappropriate to have such an order and would not be good practice.</p> <p>  With respect to the third level institution, table 3.9 of the reports shows compliance with good practice.  Where the body fell down was not informing the Department.  We have made that clear within the code and within the guidance we have issued.  The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted these issues will now have an impact across the system so people will appreciate it.  Also, with respect to discretionary severance payments, and this relates to those, we are going to build on the proposal, which is the New Zealand model, that is set out in the report, and draft a circular, which will remind the system again about discretionary severance.  The scheme we eventually decide upon will be very similar to what is set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It covers these elements.  We hope those different elements that we have moved on since the report will help to reduce the risk of that happening again, but nobody sitting in this position can ever tell a Deputy that this will not happen again.  Nobody can ever give that assurance because we know about the system; we know that mistakes are made and that there can be governance failures, but we are hopeful that in response to the report, which we will be working on, we will definitely reduce the likelihood of that happening again.  We will continue to monitor and continue to work with colleagues across the system to ensure that the guidelines set out are met.</p></speech>

Two interesting matters arise in the education sector.  I mentioned institution C, which did everything very well.  It got a UK framework and followed the guidance that was in that framework.  The other institution had a reference to the HSE, and when we asked how it arrived at the figure, it said it looked at the terms that were in place in a voluntary redundancy scheme in the Health Service Executive and followed the conditions that were set down there.  When we tested it we found that was not the case.  If it had started out to do that, it did not achieve it.  What is interesting, and particularly taking account of the surprise of the Department of Education and Skills when we brought its attention to these matters, is that neither body thought to go to the Department.  That is what is surprising about this.  Two major third level institutions did not turn to their Department and say that they had a problem, what did the Department think about it and how did it think they might best address it.  If there is a thread in this, that is possibly the one.</p> <p>  In relation to gagging orders - and it is not only in regard to severance it could also relate to settlements where there is a legal dispute, a settlement is reached and there is a confidentiality clause in it - under no circumstances will we accept that we cannot see the contract or the deal; no matter what is written in it, we must see it.  The day I do not get an agreement that I am looking for, I will come and tell the committee that I did not get the explanations and information I required.  Usually we do not have that difficulty, but the point we always make is that one cannot contract one's way out of a statutory obligation.  That is not the way the law works.  If the law says that I must be provided with the document, then nobody can enter into an agreement somewhere that says I cannot be provided with it, and that usually ends the argument.</p></speech>

This is my first time to meet Mr. Watt and I thank him for his presence here today, for his frankness and positive approach with respect to his statement and the answers provided.  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General's confidence in that he stated that he views the situation as we move forward in a much more positive light.  Mr. Watt referred to an overall context in his opening statement.  In my brief time as a member of this committee I have heard that phrase an unbelievable number of times, especially from the representatives of the HSE when they have appeared before the committee.  That phrase "overall context" seems to permeate every debate we have had.  I want to speak about context.  With respect to a report such as this in the build up to the budget in October, there is a political context because we have conflicting demands and requests.</p><p> Deputy Connolly touched on the education sector and I want to discuss it as well because one of the biggest demands we face is in the third level sector.  The expert report on third level education prepared by Peter Cassells showed that a minimum of &euro;120 million per annum will be needed over the next five years.  As a party, we discussed the report in depth on Monday and one of the greatest concerns we have relates to that money going into the correct spheres within the sector.  One can see the report, and the fears expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General, that three payments were made from two bodies at a cost of nearly &euro;750,000 without prior sanction from the Department.  I ask that when we are talking about context there is an appreciation of the fear and frustration of not only elected Members but also members of the public.  Whether it is the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Health - which always uses this phrase - there is a very good fear that when payments are made, they are not always made in the correct manner.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General concluded in his report that in the case he looked at we were broadly compliant.  There are some issues there which we will be debating this afternoon and which are highlighted in the report.  We share those concerns and we have responded to them by making changes in terms of the code of conduct and guidance and we will work on a circular on discretionary payments, which will hopefully address some of the concerns.  We are not complacent or blas&eacute; about it.  The money, in the overall scheme of things, is small.  We know that but that is not to in any way suggest it is not important.  Every euro is important.  We take this very seriously.  In the short period since the report was published we have responded to it.  We have been energetic in terms of trying to learn from this and ensure that the rules of the formal scheme are properly adhered to and, in the context of discretionary payments, that any payments made are proportionate, that the relevant bodies are informed and that there is appropriate disclosure.   We are very conscious that we need to improve here.  We have set out a range of steps which we hope will improve the situation and that in the future we will look at this and it will be improved.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt spoke earlier about the benefits.  Can he give me a flavour of those?  I have a concern about the safeguards in place for the recruitment process.  Mr. Watt said the benefits would far outweigh the negatives where somebody is in charge of hundreds if not thousands of people.  Will Mr. Watt give me a flavour of that?  What is the frequency of this and the reasoning behind it?  These are very senior people.  The public would have questions about the frequency of this in respect of people in such high-powered jobs and whether it is better to dispose of them or to see a mutual parting of ways rather than working through whatever difficulties or challenges there are.  Perhaps it would be interesting for us to hear the challenges and difficulties that people are supposedly facing.</p></speech>

There is the issue of senior positions in the Civil Service, where we now have fixed contracts.  As a result of the changes introduced in November 2011, we do not provide added years or early pension without actuarial reduction.  As a result of that, severance payments are made.  Then there is the old scheme which included severance payments.  Those payments were put in place because we did not want people to stay in jobs for 15 or 20 years.  They were given fixed contracts.  If there is somebody who has a permanent job at a certain level and one wants them to go for the top job, it was felt back then that in order for them to take a job with a seven-year contract or a fixed contract, there had to be some benefits at the end and some severance payments.  This is not unusual.  It is certainly not unusual in the private sector but it is very rare in the public sector, where we use it, but it is sometimes a feature of what is required to attract people to do jobs.  There is a variety of different reasons why the formal schemes are there and a variety of different schemes are set out.  Then there are the discretionary payments which arise when the relationship has broken down, when we have somebody in a position who is not contributing or a relationship has broken down with the board of an organisation, with the president of an institution or maybe with the Minister and where it is seen - by all concerned - that the best way to address the problem is to provide an exit payment.  There are two alternatives.  One is to work through which was probably pursued before it reached the point where a payment was made and a resolution found.  The other is to go through the formal disciplinary process of trying to remove somebody which, as the Deputy would know, whether it is the public or private sector, is very difficult and time consuming and can be unsuccessful and problematic at the end.  Where the relationship involving a senior person has broken down, going through that process can be very damaging for the organisation involved so pragmatic decisions have to be made.  The number of these payments is small and one could argue that, given the scale of our system, it should be higher.  One could look at this in a different way and say that perhaps we are not addressing this appropriately and that we should have more recourse to termination payments where exits occur because there are probably an awful lot more problem situations that we do not address in this way which we try to sweep under the carpet.  That is the-----</p></speech>

When we see a large severance payment, what we also want to see is some documentation of the risks, costs and benefits.  What is the nature of the problem?  How did it come about?  What options do we have for everybody's benefit - for the organisation, the individual and so on?  There needs to be a clear understanding of what the risks are in cases where, for example, somebody in charge of an operations area in a hospital or something of that nature is are not able to do the job.  One cannot just throw them out on the street without looking to their welfare.  It may be through no fault of their own that they are not able to do it anymore.  One wants to try to find a way of arriving at that but one does not want to overpay for it either.  That assessment of the risks, costs and benefits is where we would look to see that there had been due consideration of it.  What we would not try to do is second-guess it.  If the right people with the responsibility in the organisation have made the decision, then I am not going to say their judgment is right or wrong.  That was part of the reason why I did not want to get into looking at the individual circumstances of individual cases.  Sometimes one would need the wisdom of Solomon to make a call on it but it must be documented.</p></speech>

When we are recruiting, we have an enhanced process whereby we engage in very detailed testing of people.  We have several interviews.  We invest an awful lot more in the recruitment process now than perhaps was the case in the past.  We have a much more professional HR within and outside Government Departments.  We try to address problems early and we have more professional HR people who intervene.  We have a more developed performance management system which we identify at the start.  We are actively managing probation more than we used to in the past.  It really is around HR and we have put in a great deal of effort in recent years to try to become more effective at HR.</p></speech>

Overall, there is some reassurance from the presentations.  I wish to make a suggestion without getting into the entire HR issue.  Clearly, there must be discretion and the ability to use the full toolkit.  My suggestion is that matters of sanction and disclosure ought to be hardwired into the rules for severance and discretionary payments rather than having them running in parallel as a type of second thought and a box that might be ticked.  It seems sensible that some of the core operative rules would be about sanction and disclosure.  That is my proposition.  The framework set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is extremely helpful.  It also tallies with common sense and good practice.  However, hardwiring it into the rules might result in a little more clarity of thought.</p> <p>  On the issue of ministerial appointments, these were all cash severance payments.  I understand from the report that there was a total of 41 of them between 2011 and 2013.  Will the witness explain how there were 41?  Did that tally with the change in Government?</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is well made about hardwiring certain things into it.  It might be useful to add to that a definition of a severance payment.  Where an employment breaks down and somebody leaves and then decides to take an unfair dismissal action, we are into a legal situation.  That is a grey area where, perhaps, somebody leaves this week and is back the following week saying he or she should not have left.  That is a very complicated situation.  From our point of view, if there is a rule that the value of a severance payment must be disclosed, I do not wish to be in situations where I am arguing with public bodies about whether a settlement is a severance payment.  If it is in the space of being related to the termination of an employment contract, we must be clear about what is in and what is out for disclosure purposes.  That is my suggestion on the hardwiring proposal.</p></speech>

We spoke in the first part of the meeting with representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to our consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report No. 91 on the management of severance payments in public sector bodies.  The report notes that the Central Bank had more frequent recourse to termination agreements and severance payments during the report's review period than any other public body examined.  We have therefore invited representatives of the Central Bank to discuss this matter with the committee today.  We are joined by Mr. Gerry Quinn, chief operations officer, and Ms Liz Joyce, director of human resources.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Mr. Quinn to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

The Central Bank of Ireland welcomes the report and, as acknowledged by the former Governor in the report, we agree fully with the recommendations that pertain to the bank.  In this context, the bank has undertaken a number of actions to implement the recommendations in full.  These include the introduction of clear guidelines and robust risk management procedures for individual discretionary severance payments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report recognises that in certain cases termination agreements providing for such payments may be in the best interests of both the employer and the employee.  The Central Bank agrees with this statement and believes that this is reflected in each of the highlighted cases given the specific circumstances involved.  In my short introductory remarks, I will briefly address the procedures surrounding severance payments within the bank, the number and cost of the cases and, finally, touch upon the circumstances of the cases which were highlighted in the report.</p> <p>  Looking at procedures, the report assesses compliance with good practice and, for the bank, finds some discrepancies with regard to the documentation of the options, rationale and legal advice for the decisions.  It also found issues surrounding the formal delegation of authority in relation to the approval of severance payments.  The bank now has a clear, documented and formal policy that has been in place since July 2015 when it was approved by the Central Bank Commission's budget and remuneration committee.  It is also published on our website.  The policy includes procedures to ensure adequate control and oversight over, first, the decision to enter into negotiations; second, the severance amount to apply in particular circumstances; and, finally, the written terms of the severance agreement.  Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis is always required and this must be supported by detailed written legal and/or employee relations advice.  However, I note that while this formal policy post-dates the severance arrangements referenced in the report, all arrangements detailed in the report were made in the full knowledge of the appropriate senior level management within the bank.  This was either myself as chief operations officer or the director of human resources.  Furthermore, all arrangements were negotiated by or with the assistance of legal advice.</p> <p>  Turning to the number and cost of the severance payments, the report notes that the bank had more frequent recourse to termination agreements and severance payments during the period under review than the other public bodies examined.  This refers to six cases over the period 2011 to 2013 totalling &euro;384,000 with associated legal costs of &euro;157,000.  As highlighted in the former Governor&rsquo;s response, the cases occurred in a period of unprecedented growth where bank staff increased by approximately a third between 2009 and 2013 as a result of the bank&rsquo;s increased mandate and its more intrusive supervisory approach following the financial crisis.  In fact, by 2013, the bank had more than 1,400 employees compared to approximately 1,000 in 2009.  The arrangements examined in the report amounted to an average of two cases per year and &euro;64,000 per settlement and represented 0.11% of the bank's total payroll expenditure over the 2011 to 2013 period.  The individual settlements were entered into with a view to avoiding alternative outcomes which could have proved far more costly in the long run.  In the view of the bank, the agreed outcomes represented the most cost-efficient solution in the particular circumstances of each case.</p> <p>  Turning finally to the specifics, the report draws attention to four cases: a long-term contractor who had never formally been an employee of the bank; a case where the individual had not yet commenced employment with the bank; and, two cases where employees had less than two years' service.  It is important to state that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not make any assessment of the individual cases.  Rather, the report focused on the procedures and processes used to deal with them.  I will, however, briefly address each of the cases in turn but only in a general manner.  As members will appreciate, for data protection and confidentiality reasons, the bank, like the Comptroller and Auditor General, can only disclose details to a level that will not identify or give rise to the identification of any individual involved.  Of these cases, two related to settlements arising from pending court proceedings.  The first of those related to a contractor who claimed to have been an employee.  This settlement was agreed in advance of the hearing of High Court proceedings which were taken by the individual.  This settlement was agreed following the consideration of legal advice and in view of the likely cost of the High Court proceedings.  In the second case, a candidate was awarded a role and resigned an existing position.  The individual alleged that the bank's pre-employment processes did not make sufficiently clear the conditions of employment prior to the resignation.  The individual was unwilling to take up the role on the basis of these conditions of employment and took High Court proceedings on a number of grounds.  A settlement of &euro;32,000 plus legal costs of &euro;25,000 was agreed following legal advice.  In two other separate cases of fixed-term employment, the employment relationship broke down for differing reasons.  Settlements were agreed which were acceptable to both parties and which represented the most cost-efficient solution from the bank's perspective.</p> <p>  In conclusion, the bank believes that the outcomes in the six cases highlighted were the best possible in the circumstances.  The bank accepts the deficiencies identified in the report in relation to our policies and processes.  A range of improvements has been implemented, including a formal discretionary severance policy, a written delegation of authority, a revised probation policy, revisions to our code of ethics, measures to clearly distinguish between independent contractors and employees and revisions to our pre-employment processes.  I hope the above gives the committee a picture of the context behind the payments at the time and the changes made by the bank since then to improve our processes and implement the recommendations of the report in full.  We welcome and will do our best to answer the members' questions.</p></speech>

The Central Bank adheres to proper governance and a code of practice and implements the Government's pay policies, which is very important.  However, the report's findings do not always agree with that.  I have highlighted some of them.  While significant legal costs were incurred, details of the legal advice received were not documented on file in some cases.  The bank had no written policy or guidelines for dealing with termination agreements and severance payments.  In three of the six cases, there was no evidence that a review of all the options, risks and costs involved had been undertaken before the decision to pay severance.</p><p>The report also states, "While each case had an agreement on file that was signed by a representative of the Bank, it was not clear if the terms and amount of the settlement were approved at an appropriate level".  It also states there was "no close correlation between the level at which agreements were signed and the value of the settlements" and no evidence "of any formal delegated authority in place in relation to the approval of severance agreements".  The report assessed the bank's overall performance on severance payments against six good practice benchmarks and found the bank to be non-compliant in respect of half of these, which is a rate of 50%.  I have a number of questions.  Should I ask them together or one at a time?</p></speech>

This implies there are deficiencies in the bank's procedures for managing employee performance and its general management of human resource issues, including recruitment.  Is this the case or are there other reasons for the bank's relatively high recourse to severance payments?</p></speech>

The bank grew in an unprecedented fashion following the crisis.  It grew from having approximately 1,000 employees in 2009 to approximately 1,600 people at present.  On average over the course of the past six years we recruited approximately 120 people per year so we have had significant growth in the organisation.  In this context it is not surprising that certain cases arose regarding employment issues.  Not every employment and recruitment measure taken is as effective as one would like it to be.  As the Secretary General indicated earlier, sometimes employment relationships can break down.  We sought to address these at the earliest possible time.  We have dealt with a number of historical issues that existed at the time and we have put in place and adopted the full best practice framework outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Without referring to the particular individual, what were the general circumstances which gave rise to costs of more than &euro;73,000 being incurred in respect of an individual who did not commence employment in the bank?  This is serious.  This person was not part of the bank but received &euro;73,000 compensation.</p></speech>

The circumstances were as I outlined in my opening statement.  An individual was offered a role and resigned an existing position but then made a claim based on not being made fully aware, or not being made aware in sufficient time, of all the various elements associated with the terms and conditions of the Central Bank of Ireland.  Clearly, there was a deficiency in our process of offering the particular job.  The individual took a case on the basis of resigning a particular job and not being willing to take up the role in our organisation, which was still open and available if the person wished to do so.  The person decided not to do so and took a case to the High Court for a variety of reasons.  We looked at the circumstances of the case and took legal advice.  We examined the potential costs of High Court proceedings and the likelihood of succeeding.  On this basis a negotiated settlement was arrived at using the legal advice.</p></speech>

The contractor had been with the bank for approximately eight years and worked in the institution.  The role ceased and no more work was required of the individual.  The individual was told the contract would cease.  The individual had never been on the payroll of bank.  There was never an employee file for the individual.  As far as we were concerned the person was a contractor and was employed as a contractor for services in bank.  The individual made a claim on the basis of being an employee of the bank.  I must be careful about getting into too much detail in case there is a danger of identifying the individual.  This went through a number of fora before it arrived, once again, at the High Court.  The issue was much the same.  We weighed up the risks of going through and the cost of the High Court hearing.  It is clear there were some deficiencies regarding the explicit nature by which we identified a contractor and we decided to settle on this basis.  Since then, we have implemented certain measures, for example, different identification badges and different e-mail addresses for contractors.  Contractors pay more for coffee in the canteen.  This is the measure of explicit difference we are required to have in place so we never enter such a situation again where there is any doubt about the role of a contractor versus that of an employee.  In 30 years' experience, having worked with many contractors in many organisations, this was the first time I saw this particular circumstance emerge.</p></speech>

When something gets to the end of such a process, there can be quite an amount of legal involvement if the individual decides to take legal representation.  We must also recognise that all these cases involved negotiated settlements.  There is no rulebook to be taken down which outlines the amount of money that applies in particular circumstances.  These arrangements were negotiated by our legal advisers with the legal advisers of the individuals involved.  I accept the legal costs were high, but they are the legal costs associated with settlements of these nature, particularly if one gets to the steps of the High Court.</p></speech>

It is the standard the Comptroller and Auditor General expects us to have in place and the standard we have now defined in our new procedures.  It is not that there was an absence or complete lack of documentation, far from it.  There was documentation but it should have been put in a single file.  Something else to bear in mind is these are relatively infrequent events.  As outlined earlier, no general policy was in place in respect of the public service.  The procedures and processes one would expect to have in place were not there.  We have now put them in place.</p></speech>

It occurs to me that there was an unprecedented level of recruitment, but it is precisely because of this that the policy should have been looked at, perhaps, before a recruitment process was put in place.  It is done now, but I would have thought it would have happened and that it would have triggered a check in the ordinary course when the bank was expanding.</p> <p>  Mr. Quinn has said guidelines are now in place that the bank accepts and also that the bank accepts the report.  How do we know there are not other internal processes?  Will those responsible carry out another internal review of the Central Bank and how it looks at these processes?  The relevant people were not aware of this until it was highlighted.  How can we safeguard this not happening again with other issues in the bank?</p></speech>

Yes, in hindsight, clearly it should have been in place.  In the same way, it was not that we ignored an existing policy from the Department because no policy existed.  The other thing is that we have to frame it in the timeframe that this was happening.  We all know the context in which this was happening, the context of the bank and everything that was going on.  In terms of prioritisation and identification, when we are looking back on this, it probably should have been highlighted at an earlier point.  These are not things we anticipated, clearly.  Certainly, we would not have anticipated this type of contractor case or the other issues arising from someone not taking up a role.</p></speech>

However, I should point out some of the other elements that we put in place at the time because we were expanding.  We put in place a formal performance management system throughout the bank.  Our concentration in respect of the management of performance is to try to ensure we get the best out of the people we have.  Let us consider the organisation and the number of people that have been recruited in recent years.  The vast majority of them operate very effectively, are committed to the public service and are dedicated and professional in the things they do.  We need to support them in terms of our human resources processes and learning and development.  We focus considerable attention on those.  These are the cases that did not work out and take a good deal of time to manage through.  The Secretary General, Mr. Watt, referred earlier to the value proposition if we do not deal with these.  We put the procedures in place.  Ms Joyce may wish to add some comments on the other investments that we continue to make in human resources.</p></speech>

We have had a number of human resources policy reviews as well as policy reviews in other parts of the bank.  All our policies have been updated in recent years.  One of the early steps we took was to improve our probation policy.  The policy had been for a 12-month probation period.  Often issues were not arising until the end of that period.  That made it difficult to deal with.  The period was reduced to six months with the option to extend the probation period, if that was helpful to the situation.  Obviously, our desire is to help people to be successful in their jobs.  It is only the occasional situation in which that does not succeed.</p> <p>  The performance management system that Mr. Quinn referred to is now in its sixth cycle.  We provide extensive training to managers in supporting people to implement that in the best way possible.  The purpose is to ensure we have clear objectives for people and that they get good feedback as well as to ensure good career development conversations come out of that.  As I have mentioned, we have provided a good deal of training for managers on various aspects of managing people as part of their people management responsibilities.  We have also improved our recruitment and selection procedures.  We have clearer role profiles.  There are very focused interviews and assessment methods associated with the roles we are trying to fill.  We have training for interviewers and we have consistency assessment methods.  Those are some examples.</p></speech>

They should, perhaps, take some solace from the fact that they have given the answers thus far to every question I had written down.  That is a good thing for our guests.  I have some follow-up questions, specifically in respect of the legal advice the Central Bank received.  Does the bank use the same legal adviser or panel of legal advisers for corporate business and financial advice the bank might require as it uses for human resources advice in these particular circumstances?</p></speech>

On the negative side, my reading of this in respect of the Central Bank is that the lack of compliance was quite shocking.  I appreciate the nature of operational risk and that there are no 100% guarantees.  I appreciate the level of growth in terms of the staffing numbers.  However, Mr. Quinn referred to issues with fairly rudimentary things like a formal discretionary severance policy.  In all fairness, it should not take the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to have to come in for the Central Bank to recognise this.  This is the Central Bank, not the corner shop.  Do the representatives understand me?  The bank is a central pillar of the entire system of the State.  Other issues included delegation of authority, a revised probation policy etc.  I am glad the bank representatives accept the findings, but I am concerned by the lack of compliance the report reflects.  This is something we will have to keep an eye on, if that is the case.  I almost work on an assumption, God bless my naivety, when it comes to big institutions such as Central Bank in which there is a large staff.

Again, within the framework that we set out, the standard is that use is made of experienced advisers, legal advice is obtained in writing to develop appropriate terms for a negotiated exit and the basis for a severance payment is documented.

In hindsight, we all would have liked to have that in place in order that we could have come before the committee today and said that everything was pristine in terms of the documentation, etc.  What I and Ms Joyce are saying is that, notwithstanding the issue in respect of documentation - which we have fully accepted and addressed - in each of the cases involved, we believe the outcomes achieved were the best possible outcomes that could be realised in the circumstances.</p></speech>

I will not second-guess Mr. Quinn on that.  I will conclude with more of a remark than a question.  I am troubled by the fact that Mr. Quinn is playing down as an unfortunate oversight something that I would regard as nothing but common sense, which is that one would have one's documentation in a coherent fashion and filed appropriately so that not just the Comptroller and Attorney General but also anyone else - for any purpose - could put their hands on it.  When one goes to the trouble of obtaining legal advice, it is for a good purpose.  It is not just to pad out a file.  It is important information.</p></speech>

I wish to make one final remark.  Mr. Quinn, quite correctly, I am sure, stated that the settlements we are dealing with represent 0.11% of the bank's total payroll expenditure in the period concerned.  Again, that is fair enough but I wish to make the general observation that it is not the issue.  If this is, in Mr. Quinn and others' heads and in his presentation, a way of kind of minimising the fact that serious non-compliance issues were found, that is the wrong head space, in my respectful opinion, for Mr. Quinn and the Central Bank to be in.</p></speech>

Obviously, in the future, if we see a significant severance payment, we will be examining it and looking to see if the controls that are now in place were applied to it.

I welcome that change.  However, reference to best practice not being there at the time sets off memories of poor regulation in Ireland and what led to the downfall in the first instance.  Unfortunately, the Central Bank has a particular onus on it to lead.  It is there to regulate and in its mission statement - I am not here to preach - there is an extra onus on it to lead and to follow best practice.  The bank aims to ensure that regulated firms are financially sound, safely managed and so on.  If the bank has that role, there is an extra burden on it to do it 100% right.  If the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was not before us, what internal mechanisms did the Central Bank have in place to highlight problems and address them?</p></speech>

If there are deficiencies in a particular business area, we expect them to be picked up by our risk management processes or, ultimately, our audit processes.  However, the primary aim is to ensure that the standard outlined by Deputy Connolly is the standard to which we aspire, and that is what we are working towards.  This is a process of ongoing renewal within the organisation.  We recognise our role.  We recognise that we have to have standards that match the role that we perform generally in the regulated sector.</p></speech>

We put a full performance management system in place, as I outlined earlier, in the very early days in terms of 2011 in order to ensure that we had a methodology and a structured way of assessing performance within the organisation.  It is not that we do not look at how we operate.  It is not that we do not look at the risks involved and put improvements in place.  We do.  In these particular circumstances, I acknowledge that, when one looks at them now in the context of the issue of <i>ad hoc</i>individual severance payments arising - each of which, in its own right, is unique and complex - and the fact that there were no central guidelines issued from the Department, we did not have the best practice guidelines in place.  We have them now and we will operate to them.</p></speech>

I refer to retention payments, which are almost the reverse of severance payments.  This matter is not specifically dealt with in the report.  Remarkably, the Central Bank has a system in place for what it calls retention of staff in strategically critical roles, so it is the opposite.  Instead of having a settlement when someone is leaving, there is a system in place for someone who is in a job and possibly threatens to leave.  The Central Bank offers him money over and above his salary to remain in the job.  This matter was mentioned at a meeting of the committee last autumn.  Mr. Quinn would not have been present but officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were here and they did not seem to know the position.  I think Mr. Watt perhaps indicated he did not have personal knowledge of the issue.  However, I have received correspondence in the meantime between senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Mr. Quinn's organisation on this issue.  It shows that in the period 2013 to 2014 five people listed on the schedule I was given received retention payments to remain in their jobs.  Most of the payments were in the amount of &euro;48,000.</p><p>One was &euro;48,000, another was &euro;17,000, another was &euro;48,000, another was &euro;8,000, and another was for &euro;48,000.  Total payments to people to persuade them to remain in their jobs added up to &euro;169,000.  The bank probably tied them into a period and they were offered and had to sign new contracts.  It could almost be interpreted as giving somebody an increase.</p><p> The witnesses might explain that because it seems a very unusual practice.  I have not encountered it before.  I know the bank is separate legally and is responsible for its own activities.  It is not subject to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform public sector rules because under European bank rules it must be independent of Government Departments in the performance of its duties, but it would be governed by the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  In the correspondence to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the bank says that it is satisfied that these extra payments are in line with FEMPI.  Perhaps the witnesses do not have the full information in front of them today, but could they explain to the public how the bank can pay people working in a public body like the Central Bank sums of &euro;48,000 over a two-year period when everybody else is taking cuts under FEMPI and the bank is saying these additional payments are in line with FEMPI?  If the witnesses are not fully comfortable with answering the question now, because it is a difficult question, I would be happy to receive a written submission.  However, could the witnesses give me their general position?</p></speech>

We faced a situation where we could have lost a significant number of people who were vital to ensuring we fulfilled our mandate in this regard.  We analysed the options open to us.  These were particular individuals with particular skills who had accumulated knowledge in these areas.  We considered the options that were available and discussed them with the banks' budget and remuneration committee.  We assessed that the best option available to us at the time was putting retention payments in place such that we would aspire to keep those individuals to cover that particular period of exposure.</p> <p>  We took legal advice in respect of FEMPI because we are covered by the FEMPI legislation, as the Chairman noted.  Our staff have taken all the cuts associated with FEMPI and the pension levy, even though we are independent.  The legal advice suggested to us that in these particular circumstances - a very limited fashion with a very limited number of people - it was possible to pay those retention payments and be FEMPI compliant.  That is the basis on which we operated.  I accept that it is challenging for people to understand and reflect on but I assure the committee that this was not taken without a lot of consideration and a full understanding of the impact of failure on the particular projects with which we were dealing.  We have a policy relating to that, which is called the interim retention policy.  It is available on our website so it is publicly available.  Nobody else has been admitted to that policy since the cases to which the committee has access on the basis that the circumstances that would give rise to that situation have not arisen and might not be likely to arise again.</p></speech>

I wish to confirm that we will be examining the report, as we are obliged to do, and that at our meeting on Thursday next, 29 September, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be our first witness and we will have a question-and-answer session with him.  After that, we will move on to meet with the chairman and chief executive of NAMA.  The latter will take up a considerable amount of time on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>  On the following Thursday, 6 October, we will meet the Minister for Finance in the afternoon.  It has been proposed to put arrangements in place to invite the other members of the board of NAMA to appear, as a group, and Mr. Brian Rowntree, who was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory board of the agency.  We will also invite those who were party to the phone call with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in early January 2014.  The participants in that phone call were the Minister for Finance, Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of NAMA, Mr. Declan Reid from the Department of Finance, Mr. Ronnie Hanna, a NAMA staff member, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Mr. Frank Daly have already been confirmed as attendees.  We will be asking Mr. Reid to attend.  We will not be inviting Mr. Hanna at this stage because of other issues.  We will also invite Mr. Robinson and Mr. McGuinness to attend a meeting.  In addition, we will be inviting officials from NAMA and from the Department of Finance and, in particular, the officials who were liaising with each other in 2013 and 2014, including not just the current Secretary General of the Department of Finance but also the person who held that post at that time.  </p> <p>  Following those few meetings, we will review the situation and determine where we go next with our examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The second item is matters arising out of those minutes not already covered in the rest of our documentation.  I do not believe there are any matters requiring further consideration.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received since our previous meeting.  No. 69A is a briefing document from Mr. Gerry Quinn from the Central Bank which we dealt with at our earlier session.  No. 73A, from the Central Bank, also relates to our earlier session.  The briefing document we received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was also discussed at our earlier session, as was the opening statement from the Department.</p> <p>  Nos. 17B, 18B, 19B, 20B and 21B are responses from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform arising from reports produced by the previous Committee of Public Accounts on the Bytel project, wards of court, fishery harbour centres, costs associated with undelivered capital projects and the Dublin Docklands Authority.  At this point, I suggest that we dispose of the responses from the Minister on the Bytel project regarding fishery harbour centres, costs associated with undelivered capital projects and the Dublin Docklands Authority but that we hold open the one on the wards of court because we are still receiving correspondence on that.  We will move on with the rest.</p> <p>  No. 47B is a follow-up letter from the HSE arising from our meeting on 15 July and providing information that the committee requested.  That is noted.</p> <p>  No. 48B is correspondence from Professor Brian Norton, President of Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, providing information requested by the committee regarding the non-competitive procurement and advance payment for library services by the DIT.  We all know that the company concerned went into receivership or administration and that approximately &euro;700,000 had been paid upfront for a service that was not delivered.  We received a very extensive report, over 100 pages long, on that so we will hold the matter over until members have had a chance to look at the report.  We will not dispose of it yet.</p> <p>  No. 49B is a letter from the Minister for Finance providing up to date information on the NTMA and the remuneration of its director, which was requested in July.  That is noted.</p> <p>  No. 52B is a follow-up letter from the Office of Public Works providing information arising from the strategic planning and flood risk meeting we had in July and that is also noted.</p> <p>  Item No. 57B is a follow-up letter from the HSE, arising from our meeting in July, providing further information regarding the oversight of section 38 and section 39 agencies.  We will note that and hold it over because we will be returning to that topic in due course.</p> <p>  No. 64B is an e-mail from Ms Orla Kenny of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation relating to the late payments legislation and how it is being interpreted differently by Government Departments and agencies.  Ms Kenny points out that the Department is taking steps to address this issue and that a memorandum for Government is being prepared.  She has expressed the wish that we delay writing more formally to the Department until this memorandum has been finalised.  It appears the matter is progressing well and we will await the finalisation and approval of the memorandum to Government and look forward to receiving a copy of it.</p> <p>  No. 66B is a letter from Mr. Fred McBride, chief executive officer at Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, regarding contracts awarded without a competitive tendering process in 2015.  We asked for that at our meeting in July and have received a very comprehensive response, which we will note.</p> <p>  Category C correspondence is from private individuals who wrote to the committee.  Nos. 14C, 44C and 45C relate to the wards of court issue.</p><p>We will hold them over for further consideration.  These items were referred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the clerk informs me a response was received this morning.  Can we agree to note these items and, when the Department's response is circulated, decide at the next meeting what further action needs to be taken?  I have not yet read the response.</p><p> No. 46E is correspondence from an individual concerning his relocation from his home by the HSE and mental disability services.  It is a handwritten letter concerning Meath disability services.  I propose that we write to the HSE for a response and, when we get one, decide what to do then.  I would not like to dismiss the correspondence if it concerns mental health services.</p><p> No. 50C is a letter from Mr. Gerard O'Leary, director of the office of environmental enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency.  He provides an update on the matter raised by an individual, namely, dumping on his land in County Meath.  I propose that we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual and if he reverts to us, we will deal with it.</p><p> No. 51C is a copy of a letter that was sent to the Minister for Health regarding the promotion of private health care and the wastage of public moneys by the HSE.  The letter was circulated to most Oireachtas Members and we will note it.</p><p> Correspondence has been received from an individual concerning the alleged misuse of public funds within the National Ambulance Service.  I propose that we forward the correspondence to the HSE for a response.  When we receive a response, we will consider the matter.</p><p> No. 54C is a copy of correspondence sent to all D&aacute;il clerks and Deputies regarding the Central Remedial Clinic pension fund.  A copy of the independent actuarial report is attached.  We will note the correspondence.  I am sure the issue has been dealt with directly by the health committee.</p><p> Nos. 55C.1 and 55C.2 are a letter and a briefing note from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE regarding abuse at a Brothers of Charity facility in Glanmire, Cork.</p></speech>

Is it agreed that we send a copy of the correspondence to the individual who contacted us about the matter?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 58C is an e-mail from Deputy Josepha Madigan asking us to invite the Olympic Council of Ireland to appear before us in the light of the public funds it receives from the Irish Sports Council.  I understand she wants to withdraw the letter, but we will hold it over and let her formally do so at the next meeting.</p> <p>  No. 59C is a letter from the operations manager of a translation company.  The person concerned raises an issue with the evaluation process for mini-tenders under the Office of Government Procurement framework.  I propose that we write to the Office of Government Procurement for a response, at which stage we will deal with the matter.</p> <p>  No. 60C is a letter from a group called Active Members of Bord na gCon Employee Benefits Plan.  Enclosed are three items of correspondence to Bord na gCon's CEO and a copy of the public statement made by Bord na gCon on a newspaper article.  While the letter requests the committee to put certain questions to the Minister, it deals primarily with policy issues.  Given our role, we should ask the clerk to refer a copy of the letter to the relevant Oireachtas committee, namely, the agriculture committee, as this is a Bord na gCon issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 61C is a letter from Freight Transport Association Ireland concerning the rising cost of motor insurance.  This is a matter for the Oireachtas finance committee which held meetings on the issue last week.  We will note the letter.</p> <p>  No. 62C is a letter from IBEC drawing the committee's attention to priorities in the context of Brexit.  It has been sent to other committees also.  We will note the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 63C is a letter from the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies, with a number of attachments, notifying the committee of the fourth annual public accounts committees symposium in London on 17 and 18 October.  It was probably directed to me as Chairman, but I am not in a position to attend.  If any member would like to represent the committee at the symposium, will he or she, please, contact the clerk and we will make an estimate of the cost of the travel proposal.  I would be interested in attending, but am not in a position to travel.  Someone can deputise for me, if he or she so wishes.</p> <p>  No. 65C is an e-mail from Deputy David Cullinane in which he refers to the issues raised in the "Spotlight" programme on Project Eagle.  This issue has been well discussed and we will deal with it in the context of our examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p> <p>  No. 66C is a letter, with various newspaper articles attached, from an individual regarding Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  The individual concerned has been in regular contact with other committee members about the matter.  I am unsure as to how we might progress it.  I propose that we return to it.  Deputy Bobby Aylward wishes to make a point.</p></speech>

I will be up front, in that we all received the letters.  I spoke to the Minister.  There were issues about the man's contract, but he has been appointed for a third term.  That is unusual, but there were reasons for it which might have been good or bad.  We will ask the Minister to respond to us on the issue.</p></speech>

Can the Comptroller and Auditor General become involved?  The issue has been kicked to touch each time.  Either we deal with it and remove it from the agenda or we do not, but we need to examine it at some stage.  We need guidance on where to go.  What are the issues involved?  It sounds like there may be a history, but I do not know.  We have been snowed under.  I have spoken to the person concerned.  I make no apologies, as we are dealing with as much as we can deal with, but at some stage we must make a decision on how to proceed.

The same applies to Bord na gCon.  It is included in specific legislation and the clerk might need to look at it.  There are some activities in respect of which the agencies are accountable to the agriculture committee.</p><p>Some matters come to be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.

There has been protracted correspondence with many organisations.  As Deputy Connolly states, we need to bring it to a conclusion at some stage.  We are not in a position today to do that, but we will come back to it.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is a letter from an individual in respect of Meath County Council and previous correspondence to the PAC.  The person involved has contacted the clerk to the committee and asked that we defer consideration until next week, which we have agreed to.</p> <p>  Finally we received a protected disclosure before the recess and have been contacted again by the individual.  I would like it noted that we will return to this.  We are getting legal advice on that disclosure.  We did not get to deal with it before the recess but we will come back to it.  That is the biggest item on the agenda.</p> <p>  Other items are the financial statements and accounts received since our meeting on Thursday, 21 July.  Members can view the schedule on their screens.  We can address these quite quickly.  I have looked at them and some of them do not present a problem.  No. 4.1 is the accounts of Pobal, which has received a clear audit opinion but the statement on internal financial control discloses that an audit, by Pobal, of a child care organisation funded by it identified irregular payments estimated at &euro;500,000 in relation to the community child care subvention and early childhood care and education programmes.</p></speech>

We are safe for the moment.  No. 4.4 is the accounts of the Pensions Authority, which has received a clear audit opinion.  No. 4.5, Teilifis na Gaeilge received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to note 5, which sets out that the director general operated without a contract since March 2014.  The appointment of a director general requires Government approval.  Government consent was not obtained for the director general's previous contract which covered the period 2010 to 2014.

No. 4.8 is the Heath Insurance Authority which has received a clear audit opinion.  No. 4.9 is the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which received a clear audit opinion for the accounting period 2014.

The assets and liabilities will be transferring to Dublin City Council, but in the meantime the authority continues to exist.  Effectively, the staff have mostly gone.  The management and the accounting and financial control is being exercised by a contractor.  They are continuing with the same contract on the basis that the authority is not in a position to put it out to tender.  It is a roll-over of contract.</p></speech>

The Government and I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, are very supportive of, and appreciate the need for, the Oireachtas having an enhanced input into discussions on budgetary priorities.  It was in this context that I published the mid-year expenditure report in July to provide a starting point for all Members of the Oireachtas on budget priorities and to highlight issues for discussion.</p> <p>  I know the committee has had the benefit of meeting a number of experts to discuss the current fiscal position, and I look forward to hearing from the members and discussing with them the main priorities for budget 2017.  I know that yesterday the committee discussed revenue matters with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the broader macroeconomic environment.  Allow me to highlight some of the main points of the spending figures for budget 2017.</p> <p>  As members are aware, the summer economic statement envisages that day-to-day departmental spending on delivering public services will increase by &euro;1.3 billion to &euro;53.1 billion.  It also foresees capital investment increasing by &euro;400 million to give a total capital envelope of &euro;4.4 billion.  This will provide for continued investment in our schools, health care facilities and transport network among other things.  It also allows us to invest more in housing to address the very serious pressures that exist there.  This combined increase of &euro;1.7 billion means total spending will rise from just under &euro;56 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;57.5 billion next year.  As set out in the mid-year expenditure report, this compares with a figure of &euro;53.1 billion in 2014.  That reflects the expenditure reductions required to repair our public finances due to the terrible economic circumstances we found ourselves in.  This is not to say that we can return to the old ways of previous Governments.  A key approach has to be to target investment in front-line staff with a laser-like focus on reform and value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p> <p>  While I am always aware of how much more investment is needed in this area, I am glad to say the State now employs more than 66,000 teachers, 10,000 doctors and 41,000 nurses in our education and health sectors alone, all up very significantly on 2013.  This increased investment has come hand in hand with more reform and a focus on excellence in public service delivery.  For example, the allocation this year of &euro;500 million to the Department of Health to deal with its funding needs and issues was associated with an accountability framework for the acute hospital sector to help ensure sustainability for our health system in future years.  Similarly, the publication last week of the Action Plan for Education and the plans to raise pupil retention rates in DEIS schools to the national norm show how reform and targeted improvement is key to our approach.</p> <p>  My primary focus in the approaching budget is to ensure public services can be delivered in a sustainable manner that is compatible with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.  As I referenced earlier on, the total expenditure for next year will be almost &euro;56 billion.  As well as focusing on enhancements to services brought about by incremental increases, we need to continue to focus on how we can get more out of what we are spending.  As the committee will be aware, budget discussions are under way with all of my colleagues in Government.  There are many issues and matters that are still open for discussion and that will be resolved in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  There are numerous competing demands for resources across our public services where genuine need exists for additional funding and resources.  For example, I note that the committee in a number of its previous meetings has discussed investment in capital expenditure.  The key focus in this area should be in identifying and supporting the projects that give the best value to the taxpayer and that can contribute to the development of a truly cohesive and fair society.  It will be a challenging climate in the coming weeks in which to formulate a budget and, of course, difficult decisions will always be required.</p> <p>  In my short opening statement - I understand the Chairman wants more time for questions and answers - I have laid out the key figures in expenditure as I see them.  I am here to answer the questions of the committee on any matters I have raised.</p></speech>

While the increase in expenditure is to be warmly welcomed, the key thing about it is looking at it in the context of demographics.  In terms of demographics, how much additional expenditure, both on the capital side and the other side, will be available on top of the expenditure for what we really need to address?  How much will be available to grow services in real terms on top of matching what we expect will be needed to remain on a stable basis?  Will the Minister break down the figures that relate to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#B00400"><p>Of the expenditure increase that is planned for next year, &euro;900 million is set to honour the commitments we have in continuing to provide our existing services.  For example, the contribution of that is in demographics, the Lansdowne Road agreement and capital investment.  The breakdown varies by Government Department, and that was all laid out in the summer economic statement by Department.  For example, for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, it is approximately &euro;80 million.  For the Department of Education, it is approximately &euro;100 million.  They are the figures we need to account for in demographics.  In the space available for new policy initiatives, there is &euro;610 million allocated in current spending.  There is &euro;250 million allocated for it in capital spending.  In terms of choices that have already been made, out of that &euro;600 million to &euro;610 million of current spending, approximately &euro;60 to &euro;70 million has been allocated for the increased cost of housing assistance payment, HAP, and the higher level of rent supplement.  Out of the capital figure of &euro;250 million, &euro;150 million has been allocated for accelerated delivery of the housing action plan by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney.</p></speech>

To follow on from Deputy Brophy's question, when we talk about a laser-like focus on reform and value for taxpayers' money, what I am conscious of in this committee is that we have the same amount of money from last year, that it does the same work and that we add more to it.  I assume what we are talking about are efficiencies within the spend that we have already allocated.  Will the Minister give me some examples of what this laser-like focus on reform and value is doing?</p></speech>

We now have an organisation of economists within my Department whose job it is to look at our capital expenditure to ensure it is meeting the requirements we have for it and that we are putting it into the forms of infrastructure that will get us the best bang for our buck.</p><p>More broadly, we must measure output from all areas of current expenditure.  For example, when we meet to discuss where we are with health expenditure, we look at where we are with activity levels in our acute hospital group.  We look at how many patients have been seen, how many operations have been performed and all of that.  In so many different areas, we are seeing that our public servants have done more with less, with activity levels going up in our hospitals.  More is happening in primary schools across a period when teachers had fewer resources than they did a decade ago.</p></speech>

Sometimes that would lead to spending later in the year to ensure that funding was not lost the following year.  We all have some experience of those practices, as many of us are former members of local authorities.  Has that method of doing business changed at local government and other levels?  It is more than ten years since I have been a member of local government.</p></speech>

The simple fact is that in many cases resources have been reduced compared with what we had in previous years.  The road budget is a matter we must address, and the Minister, Deputy Ross, has been raising it with me.  It will be raised in meetings of the transport committee as well.  The investment in our local and regional road network has reduced and because of that, my experience is that people have work they want to finish but they cannot afford to do it.  That is instead of doing work for the sake of having money the following year.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions and I will throw them at him one by one if that is okay.  The fiscal space is estimated as being around the &euro;1 billion mark.  Does the Minister anticipate, similar to last year, that there may be an increase in that space announced on budget day?  With three weeks gone in September, is there a sense as to how the month's figures are looking that may allow an increase?</p></speech>

Assuming we do not change policy in any other area, I do not expect any kind of a significant change in the fiscal space, although it will depend on our September figures as well.</p></speech>

That will not be allowed in 2017, as we are now on the preventative side, unless there are additional revenue-raising measures.  How will the Minister ensure the expenditure plans of Departments will be prepared in a realistic manner?  It has been our contention for some time that health Estimates in particular did not, to put it diplomatically, fit the profile of the Department.  Given that the Government no longer has the parachute of increased Estimates, how will the Minister ensure his colleagues' Estimates and budget allocations are realistic?</p></speech>

We can see how that worked.  It is the reason the health allocation for this year was changed in an early part of the year, as the health Estimate was increased by &euro;500 million.  We also increased the justice Estimate by &euro;40 million because the ability to make such changes without an associated change in our ability to raise revenue will be dramatically reduced in comparison with previous years.  I have flagged very clearly in the mid-term expenditure report that we have some other risks that must be managed.  I have clearly articulated what they are.  There is a particular need to repair our local road network in the aftermath of the flooding earlier in the year and there are also capital costs in the Department of Educations and Skills.</p> <p>  The question was how this would be managed across next year.  That is why the meetings in which I am engaged with all my colleagues are so important.  We need figures for current services that are credible.  A major help in this area has been the introduction of the demographics parcel of funding already recognised in the summer economic statement.  When I sit down with colleagues, we can point out the additional funding needed to allow current services to stand still, allow more pupils come to school or deal with people getting older.  That area has been of major help for the discussions I am having now.  There is still a need to have discussions with colleagues that are realistic.  All my ministerial colleagues and I will have to come to the relevant sectoral committee and state how the money was allocated, including activities that were meant to be delivered, and it will have to be reviewed throughout the year.  That is different from what we saw in previous years.</p></speech>

Currently, after a very substantial allocation this year, there are no home help hours available in many parts of the country, including in Mayo.  The Minister has outlined the policy but do Departments understand the new reality in advance of budget day?  Although the Ministers may understand it, do the Departments understand that the emergency parachute is gone?</p></speech>

They know there must be significant changes in the performance of an economy and it generates big changes in revenue coming in.  They understand why there must be a change in the revenue-raising end of what the Government is doing to create the kind of flexibility that was there in the past.  There is an understanding in that regard.  I am in the middle of all this and with the people I meet there is a very high level of appreciation for the need for the current services to be based on realistic funding Estimates.  That is evident to me now.</p></speech>

The issue last week was uncovered by "Prime Time Investigates" of overcharging to the tune of &euro;12 million in health by one pharmacy group.  What controls has the Department put in place across government in this regard?  Apart from the Comptroller and Auditor General, how many auditors are in place to examine where expenditure is going?</p></speech>

We must have realistic estimates for the expenditure plans of every Department.  It should be possible to produce realistic estimates because the economic environment is much more normal than it was in previous years.  My officials work with all other Departments to ensure their plans are deployed. </p><p> In the specific area of health, we review the performance of each hospital group by examining the funding available to it and comparing that with the output it is expected deliver.  The information is presented by the Health Service Executive and reviewed in detail by Cabinet sub-committees.  We know how much funding is allocated to each sector of the health service and to each hospital group.  We examine the performance of each hospital group by comparing real output with the outputs it is supposed to deliver.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have agreed that, given the additional &euro;500 million I have made available to the Department of Health this year in addition to the many hundreds of millions of euro provided last year, we expect expenditure by the Department to be on budget this year.  We also want to plan for next year on the basis of what I hope will be a normal budget for this year.</p></speech>

The Minister is committed to carrying out a review of the capital programme in 2017.  Will provision be made in the expenditure commitments for 2017 to increase capital expenditure, bearing in mind the pressure the capital infrastructure is under and the potential for capital investment to create employment?  Has the Minister engaged with the European Commission regarding comments by the President of the Commission that governments may have leeway to increase capital expenditure?  The President of the Commission had a few things to say on the issue.</p></speech>

The answer is "No".  I expect the mid-term capital review to affect the figures from 2018 onwards and I would like that to be the case.  In my experience of managing capital in transport, with the exception of local and regional roads, the time lag between making funding available and it being spent can easily exceed 12 months because planning and tendering take time.  For this reason, I do not expect the mid-term capital review to change the 2017 capital expenditure figures.</p> <p>  What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

The main area on which we are working in this regard is housing.</p></speech>

We will be the furthest from meeting our climate targets of any country in Europe.  We are failing completely to develop renewable energy in a way that one would expect from a country that is rich in renewable energy sources.  The cost of this to the State has been estimated at &euro;5.5 billion by a member of the climate advisory committee.  Everything that we are doing is moving us in the wrong direction.</p> <p>  Yesterday, when I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, what he intended to do about this issue, he stated it had nothing to do with him and was a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I agree that the issue is related to a large degree with expenditure.  As I stated yesterday, the scale of change required is such that we need to do what T.K. Whitaker and Se&aacute;n Lemass did when they brought us from a closed country to an open country.  Ireland needs to move from the current completely unsustainable model towards a sustainable model.  This will be important for the economy not only because it would allow us to avoid fines, but because the rest of the European Union, China and the United States are moving in the direction of sustainability.  Our failure to do likewise will damage Ireland in that we will miss out on an economic opportunity and incur moral damage to our reputation.  That is my assessment. </p> <p>  There are three specific areas where we need to respond.  In his previous role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister reversed the terrible mistake made by the previous Administration of not proceeding with plans for a Dublin metro and DART interconnector.  Given that Dublin is about to reach gridlock and 70% of tax revenue is generated within a 30 km radius of the General Post Office, how quickly could construction of a metro commence?  Why are we waiting for the city to grind to a halt instead of proceeding with the project?  Does the Minister intend to allocate money for construction of a metro in next year's budget?  </p> <p>  I have just come from a demonstration to mark the terrible loss of the life of Donna Fox while cycling in Dublin city centre recently.  Less than 1% of the transport budget is spent on walking and cycling, yet according to the Government plans, sustainable modes of transport will account for 10% of journeys by 2020.  We are doing nothing to achieve this target.  The Dodder greenway and Tolka Valley projects have been pulled, as have similar projects all over the country.  Practically no money is being provided for measures to promote sustainability.  Investors, including modern companies setting up in Ireland, want us to make these kinds of investments because they want their employees to be able to cycle to work.  We are not doing anything to facilitate them.  If we are to meet our target, 10% of the transport budget, as opposed to less than 1%, should be spent on sustainable roads.  Given the Minister's knowledge of this area, what ambition does he have to make the necessary radical shift towards sustainability?</p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has indicated that Ireland would need a threefold increase in the budget for retrofitting homes if we are to meet our targets and avoid paying large multi-billion euro fines.  Despite this, the Department that manages the retrofit programme has fewer civil servants than the section that manages the sick pay bill for the public service.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has thousands of civil servants managing single payments and other process issues, yet we do not have public service resources available for understanding the growing digital and clean energy economies, both of which present critical technological and market challenges.  Will the Minister engage in the radical transformation of the entire public service that is required to start taking seriously the environmental crisis we face?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#D01100"><p>On the Dublin metro project, I moved the mid-term capital review forward because I recognise the need to review and increase capital expenditure levels.  The Minister for Finance and I increased capital expenditure for the next few years by &euro;5 billion.  I moved the review forward specifically in recognition of the need to better develop high capacity public transport solutions.  I will not comment on the role of the proposed metro in the review because it has not commenced yet but I want it to be completed early next year.</p> <p>  I fully appreciate the role of public transport in providing a competitive edge for the economy and organising society in a good and decent way.  It has a major contribution to make in achieving climate change targets and presents many opportunities.</p> <p>  If Deputy Eamon Ryan had presented a broader analysis, he would have recognised that, as a result of the Luas cross-city project, an additional 10 million people will be carried on public transport next year.  The project will fundamentally change the configuration of light rail in the capital.  Hundreds of additional buses have also been purchased in recent years to try to improve the frequency and design of public service routes nationwide.</p><p> In respect of the recent decisions by the NTA on greenways and, particularly, cycleways in urban areas, which offer an alternative to private transport, I am engaged with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on this matter because we need to differentiate between greenways and urban cycleways.  Greenways are fantastic.  I have been on them and they deliver an immense set of benefits but urban cycleways such as the one to which the Deputy referred provide a new form of non-private transport through major cities and I will engage with the Minister on this.</p><p> With regard to the organisation of our public service to respond to the climate change challenges and opportunities, I am meeting the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment tomorrow.  One of the matters he has raised with me is investment in, and making progress on, the retrofitting of existing buildings, not to mention building standards for new buildings.  My experience of this sector in terms of how it works across our country is that civil servants in his Department have been successful at harvesting and organising a large number of private sector organisations and companies to deliver work to standards it sets.  If more officials are needed to ensure this is done better in the future, I will talk to the Minister about it but my anticipation is that he will speak to me about the funding for the roll-out of the scheme and for higher quality in the scheme rather than seeking more staff to oversee the roll-out.</p></speech>

Similarly, I recall going into the Department on numerous occasions and having to fight tooth and nail having come from back from the US, Japan and elsewhere with the latest thinking in terms of where the new clean and digital economies were going.  At every turn I was told by some official or other that "We do not think that is right" or "We are not too sure and we are going to wait".  The Department needs to step up to the plate if it is fill the boots of Whitaker, which it should aim to do.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister's assessment that the way to do this is through the review of the capital plan.  This needs not only to be scaled up massively but its focus must also to shift away completely from what is currently unsustainable.  The current plan has no sustainable direction and, therefore, the scale of change I would seek over the next year and a half of the review is an about-turn, which I do not doubt the Department can do.  I do not wish to be too critical of the public service but I am being honest in my assessment.  Other former Ministers might give their views.</p> <p>  This is not just a Dublin issue.  We have to get this right in all our cities.  Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford should come up with their pitches for sustainable investments, particularly in respect of transport, housing, energy and water.  These are they key components we need to get right.  They should be asked to input those projects into the review but they must be sustainable.  If any city thinks that it will be successful over the next 20 or 30 years, which is what we are investing for, by going in an unsustainable direction, which we are doing in every case, then I would question the city authorities and the Departments that are advising them because they are missing out on what is happening in the world.</p></speech>

I understand, from what he is saying, that the Deputy wants the funding to be increased for the reasons he outlined.</p> <p>  With regard to metro, in fairness to my predecessor at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, he had to make choices during a period in which resources were not available to him.</p></speech>

The key for me was the delivery of a high-capacity public transport solution for as much of the city as possible.  I put in place a process that took almost 12 months.  We reviewed everything and worked with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Its officials acknowledged the need for that project and it is back in there.  The Deputy asked about the timeline for it and I am sorry I did not reply to that question earlier.  I anticipate that the planning, procurement and tendering phase of the project could take between two and four years.  However, that is not a reason to defer it or to fail to proceed with it.  Projects of that scale take that long to work their way through the system.  That will be an important theme in the capital expenditure review, which will commence shortly after the budget.</p></speech>

What planning has he and the Department done regarding potential off-balance sheet spending?  I am thinking, in particular, of recent conversations about the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and the NAMA reserve.  The fund has &euro;5.4 billion and the NAMA reserve amounts to &euro;2.4 billion.  There are conflicting opinions as to whether that can be used in the context of the mandate of those organisations.  They have to generate a commercial return and must impact positively on the economy.</p> <p>  There are also conflicting opinions on whether the money can be considered to be off-balance sheet.  The Department of Finance told the housing committee last May that ISIF expenditure impacts on the expenditure benchmark.  The Minister for Finance confirmed that when he addressed the committee as well.  However, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council contradicted this.  Mr. Eddie Casey told the same committee that the ISIF was set up with a statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis and that "investment by ISIF on this basis would not impact the calculation of compliance with the fiscal rules".  We have also had conflicting opinions from Europe.  Mr. Micheal Tutty, former vice-president of the European Investment Bank, said his understanding was that Government expenditure funded from the ISIF or NAMA would count against expenditure but funding from the ISIF for housing development undertaken by entities outside the general government sector would not count.</p> <p>  We are probably all in agreement that we need to do whatever we can to make the argument that those funds can be used for off-balance sheet spending.  What has the Department done to put that argument together given the conflict surrounding this issue?  We cannot seem to decide whether this can be done.  Clearly, there is a large pot of money involved.  As the Minister for Finance said, getting the money is not a problem; the problem is using it for that purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#E00700"><p>This is an area I approach with great caution and it is important to be careful about how we handle it.  One of the key factors in the horrific banking crisis that countries all over the world had to deal with was the establishment of all kinds of entities that were off-balance sheet and ended up having a causal effect on the quality of balance sheets.  That was mostly the case in respect of banks rather than nations.  Just because something is off-balance sheet does not mean it will not have some effect on how the creditworthiness of an entity is evaluated.  That is one of the defining lessons we have had from what happened to banks.</p> <p>  We need to be clear that if something is off-balance sheet, it must be definitively off-balance sheet not just for next year and the year after but for the medium term because large amounts of capital expenditure being reclassified and coming on-balance sheet have a significant effect on the ability of the State to go ahead with plans to which it is committed.  I will not proceed with projects unless we have that absolute certainty because if that were to change, it could cause immense difficulty in the future.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the status of projects on and off-balance sheet and she mentioned a number of funds and what we have done about them.</p><p>I know that many of the organisations to which the Deputy refers have to deliver a commercial rate of return on activities and projects for which they are lending.  I am certain that that is the case, even though they are bodies for which the Minister for Finance has responsibility.  My working assumption is that the activities of many of them will be on balance sheet.  </p><p> Going back to something on which I touched briefly with Deputy Dara Calleary, we are considering using housing projects as pathfinder projects to see if can we secure absolute clarity from bodies such as EUROSTAT and the European Commission on what is on and off balance sheet.  We are doing this and using housing projects not just because of the level of social need that we know that we have to meet but also because many of them generate a rental income which should give more flexibility in how they are accounted for.  I am being very cautious because I do not want to find myself in, or put a future Government in, a situation involving an investment of hundreds of millions of euro that I believe or it believes is off balance sheet and where the position changes, causing great difficulty for the Government of the day.</p></speech>

I know about the difficulties being faced and my question was well answered.  We need to try to do what we can to clarify the position and if the matter can be progressed, it should be because there is a substantial sum of money available to address the problems we face.</p> <p>  The Minister has touched on the issue of spending in the health sector.  My colleague mentioned the additional &euro;500 million allocated.  At one of our previous meetings when representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council briefed us, there was a cautionary tone.  They spoke about the &euro;2.4 billion budget package.  When pressed, they said it was at the upper limit of prudent spending, but they also said clearly that were there to be additional spending in a supplementary budget throughout the year, it would push us over the limit and pose a risk to the economy and the country.  I am sure the Minister is conscious of this.  Can we be guaranteed that there will not be a supplementary budget, in particular, for the health service, that the budget we will pass in October will be realistic and that supplementary funding will not be required throughout the year?</p></speech>

I am well aware of its advice and perspective.  I take seriously the views of such bodies on the need for sustainability in public spending and prudence and care.  I know the council&rsquo;s strong views on the matter.  I am also aware, however, that when we do not have the right levels of investment and do not deliver the public services people need, I will have to deal with the consequences.  I have to try to manage both aspects.  That is what we have tried to do, particularly in the health service in the context of the changes we have made.  The Deputy asked me if I could give a guarantee on the health budget.  Few of us can offer guarantees on anything.  I have been absolutely clear that I expect the health service to come in on budget this year.  I made funding available as early in the year as possible on entering office, as opposed to waiting to see what the potential overrun was and then plugging the gap.  I expect the figures I have laid down to be met.  I am not just saying this to the committee, I have said it beyond here.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have said it.  It is the expectation that has been passed on to those who are running hospitals and all others involved in spending money in the health service.</p></speech>

Following the Cassells report, what is the Department doing in the funding of third level education?  I appreciate that the Government has not taken a decision on which option, if any, of the ones outlined in the report is preferable.  In the interim, however, it is important in the budget to invest in the third level sector.  Trinity College Dublin was once ranked 45th in the university world rankings, but it is no longer ranked.  We have a problem and the matter should not be left until budget 2018 to be dealt with.</p></speech>

The Minister and his officials are responding and engaging with me on their current and capital needs as part of the normal Estimates process.  I am trying to reconcile this with the fact that everybody else is doing the same.</p> <p>  On the Cassells report, the Minister has not yet come forward or identified what he believes is the leading option.  The report poses a challenge for the Oireachtas and the response rests with all of us if we believe the higher and further education sectors will be the engines of future productivity and employment, not to mention the learning from which we all benefit.  How will we pay for it, if other countries are paying in other ways?  I expect the Minister to come forward in due course and identify what he believes is the main option and the best way to do it.  Ultimately, it will require the support of more than the Government to make it happen.  It could be one of the many litmus tests of the new political approach on which people expect the Oireachtas to deliver.</p></speech>

He has stated some of them are realistic.  Does that mean that some of them are unrealistic?  For example, I understand the Minister agreed to a package in the summer for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, to make available more places for children on the autistic spectrum, but there still are huge deficits within the disability sector.  Members have been told that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is introducing a new child care system, given the massive child care costs in Ireland, the second highest in the OECD.  As for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, members have referred to issues at third level.  Moreover, is it not the case that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is responsible for more than one third of total expenditure?</p></speech>

While I am not sure what the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, actually wants to do, he has a programme or an action plan.  I presume the Minister has costed the action plan and indicated that he will provide funding to deal with the issues that are to be delivered on in 2017.  In the case of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, many members believe the previous two Governments imposed savage cutbacks on the most vulnerable Irish citizens.  While some may have claimed to have protected social welfare rates, with the introduction of new charges and so on, people have suffered in real terms.  This year, they are hoping that, at long last, the Government will be able to give a real bonus to those in receipt of social welfare benefits and assistance payments.  Does the Minister categorise other Ministers or is he working with them in a progressive way across the board?  Who is being unrealistic?</p></speech>

Each Minister who comes to me is highly realistic in what he or she seeks for his or her Department.  They all are aware of the issues and social matters to which the Deputy has referred and all of them are doing their very best to try to make progress within the Department for which they are responsible.  While they all are realistic, putting all of it together creates a need for resources any Government would struggle to meet.  I am trying, with the funding available to me, to do my best to make progress on the priorities Ministers raise with me.  That is what I am trying to do.</p></speech>

I have listened to the Minister's comments and the additional money in the health budget was welcome.  However, has he received a proposed budget from the Health Service Executive for next year that will cover some of the territories I mentioned such as the disability sector or matters such as meeting the seasonal upsurge, all of the backlogs identified, waiting lists and so on?  I asked this question of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, but does the Minister have a view on whether the proceeds from future State assets that will be sold off should be hypothecated to feed into the capital budget?  In other words, we could spend additional funding on capital projects if, for example, we were to dispose of any part of the banks we own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#G00900"><p>On the Deputy's first question, from the point of view of process, I do not get the figures directly from the HSE.  While it is the Department of Health that primarily engages with the executive, I note that it has raised with me all of the matters the Deputy has raised.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has raised with me and my Department the different issues raised by the Deputy.  </p> <p>  On the future sale of State assets and hypothecation, I am generally not in favour of the principle of hypothecation because I find that once it occurs one area, there is a wish for it to happen in other areas also and in general one ends up with little flexibility.  That said, if the State receives additional funding in the future to do some of the things to which the Deputy referred, the priority must be to consider how we reduce the debt that allowed the State to own the asset in the first place, particularly if it is a bank.  I also wish to see us continue to rebuild capital investment in Ireland and to do this we need funding.  In the context of the Government's current plan, countries of this size typically spend between 3% and 5% of national income on capital investment.  Our capital spending is at a figure of approximately 3.2% to 3.3%.  By the end of the life cycle of the current capital programme, it will be approximately 3.8% to 3.9% and we will be in the middle.  However, the point of which I am aware and which the Deputy makes is that this is after years of the level of capital investment being reduced and that we are blessed with a young and growing country.  I acknowledge that there is a need and I am trying to make progress in meeting it.  As I stated, it is one reason the Government made available an additional &euro;5 billion for capital investment purposes.</p></speech>

Does he accept that Ireland has one of the lowest ratios of public expenditure to GDP among the 28 member states of the European Union?  In that context and to take up the Minister's previous comments, during the lifetime of the previous Government the story on capital expenditure certainly was that much of it was dictated by demographics and population growth.  Happily, as a country, there are many additional young children, as well as a lot of older people.  While that is really positive for the country, it obviously requires expensive investment in education, social protection measures and a whole set of areas, including the health service.  I am upset to see school programmes in areas set out in the census as having the highest rates of population growth in the country and possibly in western Europe apparently being delayed and long-fingered, albeit, I hasten to add, in the most polite way possible.  Does the Minister have or can he provide members with a list of all the projects now being long-fingered?  I ask because I believe this is the case having contacted quite a lot of people about the matter.  </p> <p>  What is evident in respect of the provision of facilities for older people is that development of the projects is being strung out to such an extent that we may only be at or near planning stage by 2021.  </p> <p>  I wish to refer to a specific issue in the context of the Government making many comments on the need for better resources and facilities for the Garda to fight crime.  I believe the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the lead Minister for the Office of Public Works.  I am shocked and horrified that everything regarding the Garda centre of intelligence operations located in Dublin city, in Harcourt Street, is entirely up in the air.  People working there do not know when they are leaving or staying.  As the Minister is aware, there are long-standing plans to provide a replacement headquarters, but as far as I can discern, it will not happen any time soon.  This is a time of incredible activity on the part of criminal gangs, both armed and unarmed, as well as on the part of ordinary criminals in terms of the use of highly sophisticated methods in carrying out robberies and engaging in fraud.  I ask the Minister to comment on this matter today, if possible, or perhaps later.</p> <p>  Another issue that has not been discussed thus far is the question of our support as a society for endowment of the arts.  There was an endowment of the arts by the previous Government in the commemorations of the 1916 Rising, which was fit and proper.  Will the Minister agree to continue that endowment for the broader arts sector in 2017?  As a country, we are very happy to have achieved such great success with various tourism projects.  Much of the attraction of Ireland for both capital investment and tourists has to do with our strong standing in the arts.</p><p>The committee will have to reach conclusions and I will be asking my fellow committee members to support this because the arts community now supports it.  Will the Minister agree to do that and continue the endowment by the previous Government into this Government, particularly the capital funding for the arts?</p><p> With regard to the Apple tax case, does the Minister or his officials have a figure or an estimate on the likely level of contribution Ireland will have to make to the European Union, without the Apple judgment, as I believe we are about to become a net contributor, and what will be the likely impact of the Apple judgment in relation to that?  I have one further question which I will put to the Minister after he has addressed these questions.</p></speech>

I will begin with the Government expenditure as a percentage of national income and how Ireland stacks up versus peer countries.  I do not accept that Ireland is low in relation to it and this is one of the very reasons I have asked my officials to devote a chapter to this topic in the mid-year expenditure report.  Two different factors emerged from the analysis.  The first is that Ireland is in a different place from many of the peer countries to whom we were compared, most notably in having two characteristics.  First, we are far younger and we do not have the same level of investment in the Army and armed forces as other countries do by virtue of our neutrality and the attitude towards the deployment of our armed forces.  The second point of difference is in how we measure our national income.  There is a chart laid out on page 14 of that report which I will forward to the Deputy which expresses our national expenditure as a percentage of the gross national income of the State.  That analysis shows that Ireland is roughly in the middle of peer countries in how we invest because of the difficulties we have in using GDP as a measurement of national income.  That information is there.  With regard to the point that the Deputy-----</p></speech>

With regard to the facilities for schools, and I acknowledge the Deputy has raised this matter with me on behalf of her constituents, we have a pipeline of projects that are coming through at any point in time for educational facilities and facilities for the elderly.  It is absolutely not the case that any project is being put on the long finger.  However, I am aware of the concerns being raised around a school in the Deputy's constituency.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, has also raised it with me and it is a matter I will look at.  It is not a case of any project being long-fingered.  We have a pipeline of projects coming through and we have to match that with the resources available at any point in time.</p> <p>  With regard to facilities for the Garda, I am aware that facilities and services for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are primarily a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality but, as the Deputy correctly said, this is a facility which is being managed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, for which I am responsible.

It involves a facility and building which, I understand, we do not own.  We are engaged now in negotiation on that matter.  Given the sensitivity of the work that goes on in that building and the personnel involved, I accept the importance of the need for a secure facility to do that work.  I accept that.  If there is a further update I can give to the Deputy or the committee in that regard I will.  I know the matter is being treated seriously by the OPW.  Earlier in 2016 we made an additional &euro;40 million available and across the same time we made funding available for the Department of Health precisely to try to give better support to the Garda to respond to the cycle of murders which occurred earlier in 2016 and to respond to the concerns around burglary.  With regard to equipment, a big focus of the previous Government was on investment in IT and investment in new cars for the Garda.  I can see the effect of that.  I can see the vehicles that are out there-----</p></speech>

Of course the arts community wants the further &euro;50 million made available to it last year to be maintained.  Of course it does.  I understand why it would want that to be maintained.  However, the challenge I have, and I am engaged in this with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, is how we maintain and how we deal with that need versus all the other needs I must manage at the moment.  I am engaged in that matter with the Minister and I, like the Deputy, have a great appreciation for the contribution made by the arts.  I know the funding challenges which face the arts community, but I am dealing with many different needs at the moment, and I am working on trying to come up with a fair settlement.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of our future contribution to the European Union for 2017.  I do not have that figure available to me now, but I will get it today or tomorrow for the Deputy.  It is something which the Department of Finance manages and we will get the figure for the Deputy directly.  I believe I have addressed all the questions.</p></speech>

I was asked to raise this specifically with the Minister, but it is an issue for everybody involved in politics.</p><blockquote>As a new mother who is returning to work in the next six weeks I am looking at the cost of &euro;1,000 a month to pay for child care for my baby.  Add this to my mortgage on a property I bought ten years ago which is at least &euro;150,000 in negative equity for which I paid first time buyer tax at that time of &euro;12,500.  Then there is property tax and water charges ... I agree we have to pay for water, this is just another bill and worry to a very long list.  So I find myself paying large volumes of tax, yet I have no relief on the things I should be getting relief on.  Why should I have to pay tax on the money I need to earn to place my child in care? I can't not work.  I have a mortgage, health insurance, monthly bills, the costs of a new baby - nappies, wipes and formula alone are about &euro;35 a week.  But yet this government insists that I should have to pay tax on money I need to earn to pay for childcare. Childcare is not a luxury.</blockquote> <p>I know the Minister is very sympathetic to this issue but can we have a real conversation about how we progress in relation to child care? For the purpose of information, the Minister said he was progressing discussions with Ministers but has he reached agreement with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on the provision of child care?</p></speech>

I meet constituents of my own every day who are dealing with the kind of real pressure which the Deputy has described.  I absolutely understand the stress and anxiety it causes people as I know the Deputy also understands.  Why do we ask people to pay their taxes? It is because it contributes to the public services that are essential for meeting our citizens' needs.  Of course I understand that child care, the rising cost of child care and issues around the quality of child care matter very much at the moment.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, has very good strategies and plans in that area and she is talking to Government about it.  The Deputy asks if I have reached agreement with the Minister yet on funding for next year.  I have not and I am doing that with everybody at the moment and I would anticipate I have a bit to go yet before that happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#H01100"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  Before I get into some of the aggregate figures, I want to mention four segments for consideration.  The first is the voluntary sector and specifically section 38 organisations.  As the Minister is aware, workers in section 38 and section 39 organisations took the same public sector pay cuts and more, but they have not had any restoration.  The Lansdowne Road agreement provides for the community sector forum which is ICTU and the Minister's Department.  They have written repeatedly to the Minister and his Department and have repeatedly been turned down for the forum that is provided for.  Perhaps the Minister could put this issue onto his agenda.  I really do believe it is something to do.  The voluntary sector workers have taken an extraordinary beating over the years.  They have had no pay restoration and there needs to be a very serious look at the various voluntary organisations having core pay restoration in order that they would at least see some rise in line with public servants.</p><p>That is the first thing.</p><p> I echo what Deputy Burton said on the arts.  We are at one sixth of the European average, which for a country that clearly cares deeply about our arts and our heritage is dreadful.  There is a quote, apocryphally attributed to Churchill, which is brilliant.  It is alleged that when his mandarins came to him during the Second World War suggesting they needed to cut funding for the arts to pay for the war effort, he said, "Then, what are we fighting for?"  While it turns out he did not say that, he should have.  It is a brilliant idea.  While we need to provide housing and there are many very serious things we as legislators and the Minister need to look at, we must not forget our souls while we are doing so.</p><p> The third point is just an idea.  It is to do with Brexit.  I have been talking to many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in Wicklow and throughout the country.  An economist in IBEC told me yesterday that the multinationals account for 90% of our exports.  While indigenous SMEs are, therefore, responsible for 10%, they also account for 50% of export related jobs.  Things are beginning to happen below the surface and I encourage the Minister to look at some funding, probably very small, for Enterprise Ireland, EI, and local enterprise offices, LEOs, to begin to reach out to SMEs to start to prepare them for what may happen.  It would help them to start looking at different markets.</p><p> The fourth matter is a bugbear of mine, which is the privatisation of the broadband network.  It is penny wise and pound foolish.  If additional money is to be found for capital, we should keep it in public ownership.  It is highly likely that what we will see is exactly what happened when we sold Eircom.  We will see monopolistic behaviour, lack of necessary investment and monopolistic pricing throughout the country.</p><p> I will get into the aggregate figures in a second, but I put those four areas to the Minister first.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me about wage restoration.  One of the challenges is that many of these organisations were outside the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In the case of some of them at any rate, wages are raised in other ways.  Future wages in those organisations will in many cases be matters for them rather than me.  I will come back to the Deputy on the forum and how this matter has been dealt with.</p></speech>

I am happy to take more questions then.  My understanding is that the forum has met and is dealing with the matter.  A wide variety of issues are being raised and that is one of them.  One of the challenges in this will be that I am responsible for people who are paid for by the State directly, and for groups which draw funding from many different sources, of which the State is one.  Clearly, responsibility for the wages of their employees is a matter for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#J00700"><p>On that point, we will have to agree to disagree.  It is not credible for the State to say that while it provides 100% of the funding for essential services which are provided by voluntary organisations in the community, the wages have nothing to do with the State because the employees of those organisations are not public sector employees.  They obviously do.  During the recession, serious cuts were taken by public servants and section 39 workers because core State funding to these organisations fell considerably.  The only way they have to increase wages is through increases in core funding from the State.  It is not reasonable, therefore, for the Minister, or anyone in his position, or for us as legislators to say it is not really our problem.  It really is our problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#J00800"><p>It is reasonable to outline what I have said.  I have never said it is not my problem.  What I have simply said is that there is a distinction between the people the State employs and those it does not.  That is a reasonable point of view.  At no point would I wish to wash my hands of any indirect responsibility for those individuals because I am aware of the very good work they do.  I have many such projects in my constituency and I see the very good work they do.  In many cases, they do work which the State either did not do or cannot do as well.  I will come back to the Deputy on the forum because I do not want to mislead him.</p> <p>  On the arts, I am not aware if Winston Churchill said the following, but if he did not I know the Deputy will correct me.  I think he said that the mark of greatness is the ability to hold two mutually incompatible views at the same time.  This is what strikes me when we get into dealing with all of this.  Of course, people want more funding for the arts.  I want to see more funding delivered to many parts of society, but I must reconcile it all.  Of course, the arts community wants to maintain the &euro;50 million.  I understand that completely.  If I were in their shoes, so would I.  However, that was &euro;50 million that was made available for a unique commemorative year in the history of our State.  I have to reconcile that funding with the other things the Deputy is talking to me about.  The following may be something the committee concludes on later in this process.  As I look at all the competing and worthy needs the Deputy has raised, of which there have been many, if guidance can be provided to me regarding how we can maintain that &euro;50 million while delivering all the other things Deputies have raised, that is input I would like to hear.  I understand the need that is there and why the sector wants this, but I have to reconcile it with all the other demands on me.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Donnelly on Brexit.  In particular, I agree with him regarding the effect it will have on small companies.  We are already seeing the signs of this in agriculture in particular.  One of the things that struck me in the aftermath of the Brexit period is that the Government said when it happened that we did not expect the world to change the following day.  However, big things are shifting that are going to affect us in the medium term.  The people who are beginning to experience this are small and medium-sized companies that have to sell to other countries and the UK and which need to be able to plan for the future.  I am aware of this matter.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, is raising it with me.  One of the main themes the Taoiseach has asked me to address is what we can do on budget 2017 to begin to Brexit-proof our economy.  I accept the point Deputy Donnelly raised and that is something we will be able to return to.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly asked me about the privatisation of the broadband network.  I share a different view on this.  This was a decision that was primarily made by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, although I fed into it.  If I look at the future of the network, we are talking about a portion in respect of which this choice has been made.  We are also talking about a portion of that network which will be regulated in a different way, conscious of the learnings we have had on this in the past.  That is one of the reasons that led the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to make this decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1230" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#J01300"><p>The history of regulation from ComReg is atrocious.  It may be that we will learn how to regulate better, but I doubt it.  I move to the next question I have which is around the balance.  There has been a great deal of focus on the &euro;1 billion fiscal space and the &euro;660 million that comes under the Minister's consideration.  Less time is given to the other 99% of public spending, which is the business-as-usual aspect of it.  I have two questions in this regard.  The committee met the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, which provided analysis after our meeting setting out its stand-still forecasts.  In other words, this is the increase in spending required by the State to do nothing new.  Worryingly, the profile IFAC gave the committee matches almost exactly the projected spending increases.  For example, the summer economic statement has projected spending for next year of &euro;54.405 billion.</p><p>IFAC says the standstill figure is &euro;54.255 billion.  That profile matches right out to 2021.  If IFAC is correct - those on the council are a smart bunch who are doing sophisticated analysis - then the entire projected increase in current expenditure for public services, almost down to the last &euro;1,000, for the next five years will be required to do nothing.  As I am sure the Minister knows, his Department's analysis includes payments under the Lansdowne Road agreement and demographics.  IFAC analysis also includes Lansdowne Road and demographics but it includes &euro;700 million more under demographics.  IFAC analysis also includes an index-linking of social protection payments over a five-year period at very modest inflation, which is not an unreasonable assumption to make.  The other item included is public service wage inflation, which is pitched just at the rate of inflation.  The council's standstill position has zero real increases in wages or social protection payments but, almost to the euro, the analysis it presented to this committee indicates that just doing that will require everything we have.</p><p> My second question is related to the first and concerns balance.  My view is that we are not spending enough on the arts.  If we are only spending one sixth of the European average, then clearly that is unreasonable.  The question the Minister posed is reasonable, namely, if we want to give &euro;200 million to the arts or to reach the European average, where do we cut?  Education does not have enough funding.  There has been asset-stripping at third level according to one university president.  Health care is an obvious area where we are not getting value for money.  Our health care system is clearly sick.  We voted through &euro;500 million this year, with very little analysis.  We voted through over &euro;600 million towards the end of last year.  The Minister himself pointed out that we have a very young population.  Depending on which analysis one looks at, we have either the second or fourth highest spend on health care on Earth.  When one adjusts, which departmental officials have done in the expenditure review, for the fact that we are younger and, therefore, healthier, we are completely on our own and outstrip everywhere else, including the US.</p><p> There are clearly areas on which we should spend more money, like the arts, education and the voluntary sector, for example.  There are also clearly areas where we could almost certainly provide the same level of service for a lot less money, the obvious one being health care.  There is always a lot of talk about where more money should be spent.  Where does the Minister think less money needs to be spent in order to improve areas such as housing, education, the arts and the voluntary sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#K00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will start with the first.  We make a provision for demographic expenditure in the outlook for the State.  The clearest example of that is where we are in 2017.  We have a figure laid out of &euro;900 million that Deputy Brophy quizzed me about earlier, a portion of which is for demographics.  That is then laid out in the summer economic statement across the forthcoming years in terms of how we expect that to roll out.</p> <p>  Where there is a point of difference between myself and IFAC is on the role of indexation and the automaticity of future expenditure increases.  I believe that making expenditure increases automatic in terms of income payments or other payments that we make available to people will take us down a path which leads to the kind of difficulties that we are trying to get out of at present.  It must be a political choice, for which the Minister of the day is accountable to the Oireachtas, as to whether we make changes to income payments to citizens.  The moment it becomes automatic, it reduces the ability of a Government to make changes in expenditure based on its political views.  It also creates the kind of sustainability problems that we are doing our best to get out of.  Furthermore, in terms of the reform agenda on which the Deputy has challenged me, if we end up in a place where there is an expectation of expenditure automatically increasing in particular areas, year after year, it becomes more difficult for the government of the day to deliver the kind of reform the Deputy wants.  I take a different view of the concept of indexation and automaticity which has, in turn, influenced the difference between IFAC and myself regarding some of the figures.</p> <p>  I totally accept that we need to budget for demographics in the future, which we have done.  The broad point that the Deputy made at the start of his contribution contains a lot of truth.  The increases in expenditure to which we are referring here, which will be 3% to 3.5% for next year, are a fraction of how much money we are already spending.  Much of the debate tends to be on the increment as opposed to the stock of public expenditure.  That leads on to the next point that the Deputy put to me regarding where I believe too much money is being spent.  Every time I sit down with a Government colleague and every time my officials sit down with their counterparts from other Departments, our approach is to get them to show us how the money they have is delivering a better return.  Every discussion I have with colleagues centres on that point.  Very rarely do the meetings that I have with my colleagues, particularly those I am having at present, begin with me asking them to explain how additional money will deliver additional services.  I begin by asking them to tell me how the funding they have can go further and, in particular, how the demographics and capital allocations that many Departments assume they will get can go further.  All of the discussions begin thus.</p> <p>  On the question of which Departments are spending too much, I believe every Department could do more with the funding available.  That is the attitude I adopt with all of my colleagues because I believe we must have a relentless approach to efficiency.  While great improvements have been made in recent years in that area, we must keep on challenging ourselves to do more. </p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly said that there are areas in the Department of Health in which we could make efficiency savings.  I ask him to give me the detail on that.  If one looks at that area, one will see that the majority of expenditure is on wages.  The money goes to people we employ.  I would be very happy to hear the Deputy's observations on how we could achieve more efficiencies in that area than we are achieving currently.</p></speech>

On the indexation point, I agree with the Minister.  I do not think it should be automatic and that is not the point I was making.  I believe it is a political decision, so we are agreed on that.  The point I was making is that, regardless of whether it is an annual budgetary decision, the figures we have from IFAC clearly show something that we need to understand.  Were we to index payments for the next five years, in other words, increase payments in line with the rate of inflation to avoid any real decreases and keep things in real terms exactly as they are today, IFAC's analysis indicates that we would have to use up everything that is projected for increases in current expenditure.  Does the Minister accept that?</p></speech>

I will have another look at the figures to see if the scale of the gap to which the Deputy refers exists.  So much of the analysis put forward by IFAC is based on the concept that increases in expenditure have to be automatic and I disagree with the council on that.  It is certainly my understanding of the figures I have seen that indexation accounts for much of the gap to which we are referring.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#L00100"><p>I thank the Minister and his team.  In light of everything the Minister has said and some of the discussion we have had here today, are we not heading into a do-nothing, change-nothing budget?  When people shout out on behalf of particular sectors, the Minister acknowledges that in an ideal world we would have greater spending or investment in those sectors but he goes on to say we do not have the money because we are working within the envelope or the fiscal space.  He says we are not going to have the funds to put into everything that should be funded.  I do not think that is a very happy prospect, especially in light of the legitimate claims for extra investment or expenditure under a series of headings.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to this.  I would say that in most cases, such extra spending would actually be good for the State, from a financial perspective, in the medium to long term.  Are we being constrained by fiscal space to the point where we are not capable of doing things which would be good in the medium to long term but which we are not allowed to do because of the short-term cost involved?  To me, that is just bad economics.  It is not good for the future that we are in this straitjacket.</p> <p>  I will give an example.  The Minister and everybody else says that even though we should move towards funding the arts to the tune of 0.6% of GDP, which is the EU average, we cannot afford to do so.  By the way, we were the only people to allocate extra money to the arts in our budget submission last year.  We know from the contribution the arts make that there is a sure-fire return at every level from investment in the arts.  The costs that ultimately arise in all sorts of areas like crime and policing are the knock-on consequences of children and young people not benefitting from investment in areas like the arts in their local communities.  I could also speak about the benefits of such expenditure for our reputation in the arts and for tourism, etc.  It is a sure-fire winner.</p> <p>  I will mention housing as an another example.  The Minister can come back to me on this.  As a result of the constraints on having an upfront, major, direct public programme of building local authority houses, as we used to do once upon a time, the vast majority of the Government's housing plan - between 70% and 80% of it - depends on sourcing social housing from the private sector via the housing assistance payment or leasing arrangements.  The Minister will argue that the Government cannot afford to provide entirely for local authority housing, as we are suggesting, because that would breach the expenditure limits and we do not have the money to pay for it upfront.  I suggest that such an approach will prove to be completely stupid in the medium to long term.  If we do it our way, there will be a greater upfront cost, but the State will end up with an asset and the rental revenue from that asset will come back to the State.  If we do it the Government's way, most of the rental revenue that is going to derive from the State's investment in social housing, but not local authority housing, will go out.</p> <p>  In the end, it is not very good economics.  The rental revenue is not going to go to us.  It is going to go to the vulture funds or private developers from whom we lease stuff, for example, under the Part V arrangements, or the new 30:30:30 arrangements I understand we will have on public land.  That is what the housing plan is saying.  Previously, public land was used for 100% public housing.  Now it is going to be used for 30% public housing and 60% private housing.  We will be leasing it back off the vulture funds and private developers.  Rather than investing in something that will lead to money coming back in the medium to long term, we are providing for a system in which money will be going out every year.  I do not think that is prudent.  I think it is stupid.  This stupidity is being imposed on us by those who are obsessed with staying within the fiscal space.</p> <p>  I would like to mention a few other areas, such as forestry, that I do not have time to go into in detail.  I do not understand why we do not have a massive afforestation programme.  We would get a sure-fire return if we were to upscale our efforts in that area.  The Swiss invest in banks, forests, chocolate and a few other things.  That is seriously what they do.  Banks buy up forests as a sure-fire investment.  When the last Government was considering the sale of our forests, banks were trying to buy them.  We are not able to expand our forest estate.  I would like to comment on this.  As far as I am concerned, it is madness that Coillte is essentially constrained by European rules from expanding our forests.</p> <p>  This country's approach to public transport seems to involve its delivery by means of privatisation.  If we are going to deal with the threat of climate change and get more people to use public transport, surely we need lower fares and a model of public transport that is not driven by profit.  That means a higher level of subvention for public transport and cheaper fares.  This is essential if we are to avoid the penalties about which Deputy Ryan spoke.  That would be a critical start.  We need to invest in the public system.  That means a higher level of subvention.  Instead, we are relying on the privatisation model.</p> <p>  I could go through a whole series of other examples, but I do not have time to do so.  We are told that we spend more than any other country in the area of health.  I want to know how much of that is going to the private sector.  I suggest the amount is very significant.  If the money going to the private sector were stripped out, it would be evident that it is not the case that more money is being invested in this country's public health system than in the health system of any other country in Europe.  In such circumstances, we would probably find that the level of investment here is about the same or possibly even less.  A huge amount of money is being sucked out of the system by private profit-taking.</p> <p>  I will conclude by asking why we cannot expand the fiscal space.  I would say there are many ways of doing this.  I know the Minister will not accept some of my suggestions.  He will not break the fiscal rules.  He will not agree not to pay back several billion in interest on loans next year.  We believe such repayments are odious.  The Minister could look for extra tax revenue from sectors that can afford to pay more.  If we do not take such measures to expand the fiscal space, every one of the key sectors that is being short-changed will not get the investment or expenditure it needs.  That is just a fact.</p></speech>

I suggest we should take a similar approach on grounds that would be more meaningful to the majority of our citizens.</p></speech>

I certainly did not say that.

I do not resile from that point of view in any way now.  My outlook on this matter differs from that of Deputy Boyd Barrett.  We have differing ideologies and political views.

We have a different view on the matter.  I do not believe we can increase taxes to fund the expenditure in the way the Deputy wants without having a negative effect on the lives of many of the people I represent.  He is talking about significant increases in expenditure that would either break the fiscal rules, which will have another negative effect on us, or require taxation increases on which the Deputy would come into this House and criticise me.</p> <p>  The Deputy has couched all this in terms of fiscal rules and so on.  I responded in that space to him, but in terms of where I differ from him further, even if we were in a situation where there were no fiscal rules, and for most of our membership of the eurozone, those rules were either not implemented or not well crafted, we still must live within the tax revenue we have for this year, the tax revenue we believe we are likely to have for the next few years, and what we can afford to borrow.  Leaving aside the fiscal rules, that is the space within which we have to trade and invest.</p></speech>

That was my point.  The Minister is acknowledging that investment in the arts is good and brings a return but that we may not be able to do it.  The same argument could be made about third level education.  Everybody is shouting for it.  The Minister will say that he acknowledges it would be a good move to invest more in our universities and in our schools but that we may not be able to do it.  We certainly have not done it in housing, and it is questionable whether we will be able to do it, but fiscal rules were cited as a reason we could not do the large-scale direct public programme for which some of us have been asking.  We cannot do it on housing, the arts or forestry, which never gets a mention but is very important.  We cannot do it under all those headings, even though there is an acknowledgement that it would be sensible and sound in the medium to long term.  Is there not something wrong with that thinking?  That is my point.</p></speech>

In terms of where we differ, I believe I have to spend money we either have now or are likely to have in the future without imposing a taxation burden on people I represent and am privileged to serve that would be detrimental to their standards of living and our ability to grow and keep jobs in our country.</p> <p>  In terms of each area of expenditure the Deputy spoke about, we should acknowledge the fact that we are planning to increase capital expenditure in the State by a further &euro;5 billion - up to &euro;27 billion or &euro;28 billion.  </p> <p>  The Deputy touched on housing.  Will he acknowledge the fact that under the local authority housing plan, the local authority houses that will be built are Exchequer funded?  They have been built by the State.

If we consider the public housing projects that are under way, it is my view and that of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and of many parties in the House - I believe it is likely to be the view of Dublin City Council - that if we are delivering significant urban regeneration projects, we should have mixed tenure on them.  We should have private and public housing located beside each other.  That is not giving away an asset or something else to the private sector.  It is saying that if we want new communities built that will be vibrant and prosperous in the future, we want public housing tenants and private residents to be living beside each other.

I have listened to many of the points, which I had listed also, so I will not repeat them, but it struck me that people have quickly forgotten that this country was broke in 2011, and it is a miracle that it is where it is today after five short years.  We forget that people marched into the Department of Finance and took over this country.  That jogs memories so that we will not forget what actually took place.  We now have some independence back, but to listen to some contributions one would think we had won the lotto.  I have a list as long as my arm, which I could throw out for discussion, but if we are to be realistic as to the future of this country, we should not engage in auction politics.  Of course, the arts are important, as are all the other good ideas, but everybody in the country should remember that five short years ago we were broke, and there was no Government in control.  The IMF was in control.  Does the Deputy not remember the photographs of people walking into the Department of Finance?  That is the reality.</p> <p>  I will not go over what was said earlier but the Minister made a point about identifying and supporting projects that represent the best possible value for the taxpayer.  We are so narrow in our thinking, in terms of public transport, housing and development, that we see Dublin, but if we move seven or eight miles outside it, it is the country.  There are people travelling over an hour every day to and from work in most cities in Europe.  I can get on a DART in Glenageary and I am in town in 22 minutes.  If I wanted to bring my car in, I would be sitting in traffic and would arrive in here after an hour.  Issues like public transport are essential, and it brings development and potential development into regions.  My point is to ask the Minister if there is a real plan to invest fully in proper public transport so that we will not have to depend on the situation where every house in Dalkey, Glenageary, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Monkstown is sold to cash buyers.  A former local authority house in Dalkey is for sale at &euro;750,000.</p><p>This is reality.  If we want to help young people have homes of their own in the future, we must start looking outside.  In most other capital cities, it is no great deal if one has to travel for 45 minutes or an hour to work on public transport.  Is planning going on to invest in public transport to cover areas 30 miles outside Dublin, so that people can be brought in via bus lanes or by DART?  A person can walk from one side of the city to the other in 20 minutes.  Let us be real when it comes to the limited amount of money we have to invest.  We should consider regular services using bus lanes, so people can get in and out of the city rapidly.  I would like to know if there is any forward planning in that respect.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#N00200"><p>Yes, there is.  The National Transport Authority has published a greater Dublin transport strategy, which outlines various projects it believes need to be delivered to address the matters to which the Deputy referred.  He mentioned in particular how we can introduce shorter travel times between Dublin city, County Dublin and adjacent counties.  The NTA wants to electrify the existing hard-rail network so that rail services going in and out of the city get to DART frequency and speeds.  That is a key part of what it wants to do.</p> <p>  The next part concerns the metro project about which I was asked earlier, and there is also the expansion of bus rapid transit and more bus lanes.  Therefore, the strategy is there and much progress has been made, including what is currently under way with the Luas cross-city scheme.  My understanding is that between 80 to 110 new buses have been purchased for Dublin Bus per year in recent years, so progress has been made in that regard.  I accept, however, that we need to increase investment in that area.  That is why when the budget is completed we will move right into the capital review to examine capital expenditure for 2018 to 2021.  By looking at that, I hope we will be able to make progress on some of the priorities to which the Deputy referred.  I am convinced that a higher quality of public transport is essential to how we will organise not only Dublin, but many other cities also.</p></speech>

I would hope that a proper five-year plan could be published in the near future, outlining the sort of proposals that will bring about confidence.  In that way, people can invest in housing outside areas that are becoming so expensive.  This is probably one of the most serious issues out my way as Deputy Boyd Barrett would confirm.  A deposit for a young couple wishing to buy a home can range from &euro;60,000 to &euro;100,000.  It is just out of control.  We may talk about other priorities, but there is no greater priority than giving young people an opportunity to buy their own home.  I concur with Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about bringing local authorities back into action.  That was the biggest mistake we ever made.</p> <p>  I am a product of a local authority house and a mad sales scheme.  When my parents died, I was the sole survivor because my sister predeceased me.  I sold my house to a girl living in the same villas, but I could have got vast sums of money for it.  We are selling off local authority houses and, by all means, tenants should be given an opportunity to buy the houses.  It is a good idea but if they wish to sell, or the tenant passes on and it is left to children who have their own houses, they should be obliged to sell it back to the local authority at an upgraded value.  It is the simplest thing in the world.  We are building houses and then losing them to the private sector.  It is a daft system but it can be rectified.  We need to start examining that sort of thinking.</p> <p>  It is a good thing for local authorities to help people who are not in a position to help themselves.  Local authorities should not be taken out of the housing situation, but it is wrong to sell off such housing stock to the private sector.  With a bit of proper thinking, that situation could be rectified.  I would like to see people being able to buy their local authority houses, which is a good thing.  However, if they want to sell them on, they should have to offer them to the local authority for an updated value.  </p> <p>  We had a situation in the past when we built hundreds of houses.  I was on Dublin County Council from 1974 and we were building thousands of council houses in Dublin, but they have all gone into the private sector.  This sort of thing is unsustainable.  I know we are currently dealing with the budget, but after the budget this committee should delve into these sort of areas.  We should talk to Ministers and listen to suggestions.  Public transport is vital if one wishes to get away from the rat race with everybody trying to buy in the same area.  It is not a big deal if one has to travel 15 or 20 minutes extra when one has a proper home.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for the Minister and hopefully he can answer them.  What are the outstanding capital investment issues the Minister sees and how can they be addressed?  What is the Government's additional spend on capital this year that is over and above the commitments already given in the five-year plan and how will they be funded?  Is the plan adequate in the Minister's opinion?  What does the Minister think of comments by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the European Commission that Ireland needs to commit more funds to public capital investment and that the current plan does little more than address the depreciation of public capital stock?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#N00800"><p>As regards outstanding capital projects and requirements that need to be met, housing is crucial.  This is why we have already chosen to allocate to housing so many of the resources the State might have available to it over the next five years.  Of the &euro;5 billion in the fiscal space that is available for capital expenditure, we have committed over &euro;2 billion to building homes.  The availability of homes in the right places is of crucial importance.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, we will have to return to the question of integrating that with improved public transport.  As to whether additional capital expenditure will be available for this year as a result of the mid-term review of the capital plan, the answer is "No".  The increased expenditure and funding availability will be from 2018 onwards.  </p> <p>  I was asked if I believe the current plan is adequate.  Given that we are seeking to increase investment in the area, this clearly shows that I believe current investment needs to be increased.  That is what we are trying to do and are doing, but I know that colleagues will want to see that go further.</p><p>With regard to what the European Commission has indicated to us on its views in respect of capital expenditure, we will increase capital expenditure to approximately 4% of our national income, which is roughly in line with what countries comparable to Ireland spend at present, over the lifetime of the plan.  What would be of help to us, and what we are working to obtain, is greater clarity on whether something that is off-balance-sheet now will remain so.  Clarity on this will be of help regarding how we increase investment further.  We are using housing projects as a way to gain this full clarity.</p></speech>

It was reported on the front page of yesterday's edition of the<i>Irish Examiner</i>that the European Commission gave a rather strong rebuttal to the Government on the new first-time buyers initiative and the suspension of water charges.  In light of this, and the evidence the committee has heard from experts who previously came before it to the effect that the housing issue is fundamentally and primarily a matter of supply, what are the views of the Minister and his Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016092100002#O00300"><p>No decision has been reached by the Government on the first-time buyers grant.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will bring forward a proposal on this.  He shares the view that if we bring forward an initiative in the area, it is very important that it contributes to supply because we need more homes to be built.</p> <p>  We know the views of the Commission on water charges.  We know the legal advice and the Commission's view on the legal need for some form of charging mechanism.  If we end up funding water infrastructure from general taxation, it will directly compete with all of the other needs on which colleagues have pressed me this afternoon.  We will have to add it to the list that includes housing, education and so on.</p></speech>

In particular, I am thinking about investment in the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, which the Department operates to help farmers with capital projects they are aiming to construct.  I wish to relate to the Minister the importance of this matter.  Recently, when I was driving home, I heard that the price a farmer received for a litre of milk in 1988 was equivalent to 28 cent per litre but that the price now is 23 cent.  I do not suggest that capital funding should be used to replace a proper price for a product but, for the sake of farmers who have laid out plans for capital investment and are dependent on the funding, I hope the speculation in the media is incorrect.</p> <p>  At the height of the recession, a retirement scheme for farmers was in place, as was an installation scheme for new entrants.  Approximately 70% of farmland in the country is owned by people who are over 65 years of age.  This was not much of an issue at the height of the recession because many people who had been leaving agriculture to go to other sectors were staying at home.  If we are serious about developing agriculture and retaining these young people, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Expenditure and Reform need to reactivate the installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme, which were suspended and not officially scrapped.  A mechanism needs to be put in place to ensure a transfer of ownership from one generation to another, which is now probably from grandparents to grandchildren because our ownership ages are quite out of line with much of the rest of the EU.</p></speech>

I have met the IFA, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has raised these matters with me.  The normal challenges faced by farmers are exacerbated by price and income volatility, the potential early consequences of Brexit and the farmers' needs for new markets.  I understand all of this.  In my earlier contribution, as the Chairman acknowledged, I stated that some of the earliest effects of Brexit on employment are now being seen in the food and horticulture sectors.</p> <p>  With regard to the particular schemes referred to by the Chairman, I cannot give him an answer at present.  I am aware of their importance.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has raised this and other matters with me.  What I will say on capital expenditure is that if we are to respond properly to what Brexit means for our country it cannot be a Dublin response.  It must be a proper national response from the country because the effect will be national.  As such, I understand that agriculture will be crucial.  I am dealing with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister, Deputy Creed, on specific matters.</p> <p>  Some of the matters relating to the ownership of land and transferring land within families were addressed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, through tax measures in recent budgets.  I will take on board what the Chairman has said.</p></speech>

There have been indications on pay restoration for younger teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;.  Will the Minister briefly outline what has been set aside and what impact it will have on the fiscal space?  The issue of retention was brought to prominence for me at a meeting with a group of parents advocating on scoliosis at the Department of Health.  A new multi-million operating theatre in Crumlin, which was completed before the beginning of the year, is still not staffed.  The HSE is recruiting overseas while we have hugely expanded waiting lists, particularly for children with scoliosis, which is a devastating condition.  To use nurses as an example, they are significantly better paid in other jurisdictions, including the UK, which is where the HSE is seeking recruits for the operating theatre.  Does the Minister have any comments on this and on the improvement in pay for younger teachers that has been flagged by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton?</p></speech>

In some areas we are back to where we were pre-crisis and we are beginning to make progress in others.  We expect to need to hire 648 more teachers to deal with the effect of demographics on our schools.  We have the resources in place and the ability to do this.</p> <p>  With regard to the wage levels for public servants and new entrants, we have reached an agreement, through the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, with the INTO and the TUI on the restoration of a degree allowance and integrating this into the salary package for new teachers.</p><p>That matter is subject to ballot and agreement by the members of both unions but, in principle, we have reached agreement.</p><p> In regard to what it means in terms of the pressure we are under in different sectors at the moment, the answer varies by sector.  In many parts of the public service we advertise, many people apply and we are able to hire them and keep them within our country.  Garda&iacute; are a very good example of this.  It is tremendous to go through different Departments and meet new civil servants who have just joined in the past year or two.  While I do not want to in any way denigrate those members of the Civil Service who have been with us a few years longer, it is great to see a mix, which is healthy for everybody.  Since April of last year, we have employed 449 more doctors, 884 more nurses and 2,250 more front-line staff.  Those are front-line improvements that have been made.  We are trying to work with all the unions that are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Where there are particular matters that are affordable for us to reach agreement on, we will work with people to do it.</p></speech>

It was through their interventions that we played a role in resolving those matters.  I expect and believe it will be the same for these issues.

I just want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  My question concerns the public sector pension levy and restoration in that regard.  In my opinion, it is legitimately a very sore point with public sector workers that, as well as everything else that was imposed on everybody - the USC, pay cuts and so on - there was also this public sector pension levy.  I know there has been some restoration for the lowest paid.  The question is whether the Minister envisages lifting the burden of this really punitive austerity levy off the backs of those earning under &euro;70,000.  I am not urging him to do it for the higher paid, but for the low to middle area of the public sector, as the emergency is over, they should not have this punitive levy continuously imposed on them.</p></speech>

They also adversely affect the television coverage.  </p> <p>  I advise the Minister and the Minister of State that any submission or opening statements they have made or submitted to the joint committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p> <p>  I propose that we examine the Vote on a selected programme basis.  Members will be called on to ask questions on the subheads under the relevant programme.  Programmes A, B and C have been chosen for examination.  They have been chosen as they contain information that will be useful in illustrating the link between expenditure and performance.  Following the examination of the programmes, members may wish to address questions to the Minister on the administrative subheads and the appropriations-in-aid.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne.  I note the recent change in the Minister's title.  We may also have to consider changing the title of the committee.  I thank the Minister and his officials for providing the briefing material for the meeting.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am happy to outline my priority areas for expenditure in the three year period 2017 to 2019 and also interested in hearing the views of members on the areas and programmes they would seek to prioritise in that period.  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who has responsibility for the natural resources division in my Department; Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Mr. Martin Finucane, finance officer; Mr. Denis Maher, principal officer, inland fisheries division; and Mr. Jim Whelan, assistant principal officer, finance unit.</p> <p>  The total provision for my Department in 2016 is &euro;111.2 million for capital investment and &euro;318.6 million for current spending, of which &euro;222.1 million represents a pass-through of television licence receipts.  To the end of June, the Department had spent &euro;30.6 million of its capital moneys out of profiled expenditure of &euro;40.7 million, representing a figure of 75% of profiled capital expenditure.  On current expenditure, the Department had spent &euro;147.7 million out of profiled expenditure of &euro;156.7 million, representing a figure of 94% of profiled current expenditure.  Appropriations-in-aid were running at &euro;105 million out of profiled expenditure of &euro;112.5 million, representing a figure of 93% of profiled expenditure.</p> <p>  Funding this year is allowing the Department to progress projects in key areas such as the national broadband plan to ensure all citizens and businesses will have access to high speed broadband, no matter where they live or work; the trading online voucher scheme to support 1,000 more small companies to trade online to help them to grow and create jobs; the benefIT programme that will help approximately 30,000 citizens to access and use online resources and public services; domestic energy efficiency improvements to support increased employment in the construction and energy services sectors; energy efficiency in the business and public sectors; the electric vehicle grants scheme; the Tellus geo-environmental mapping project; and the continuation of rehabilitation works at the former Avoca mine site in County Wicklow.</p> <p>  As I signalled to members when we met on 29 June to discuss the Estimate for 2016, there will be a deferral of some expenditure on the broadband programmes this year.  My Department has since received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to move capital of some &euro;2.5 million from this subhead into the following areas: &euro;500,000 for TG4 to complete the undertaking to carry out  refurbishment works at its headquarters in Baile na hAbhann, County Galway; &euro;500,000 for the Geological Survey of Ireland to fund an airborne LIDAR survey as part of the groundwater 3D mapping programme; &euro;1.3 million for Inland Fisheries Ireland for investment in the recently completed national strategy for angling development to cover increased fisheries development activity, infrastructure improvements and new equipment; and &euro;200,000 for additional work to be carried out this year at the old Avoca mines site.</p> <p>  Looking to the next three years, the investment priorities for my Department are expected to arise in the following areas: climate change and the linked areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy - the effort does not fall to my Department alone and expenditure and policy choices will have to be made in other Departments, in particular, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the delivery of the national broadband plan, with expenditure on the programme to be ramped up significantly from 2018 onwards; continuing initiatives under the national digital strategy, including the expansion of the trading online voucher scheme and the benefit digital skills training programmes; funding of public service broadcasting, an issue which has been the subject of extensive media coverage in the past few weeks; building on the State&rsquo;s cyber security capacity; and investing in a range of programmes in the area of natural resources, including inland fisheries and the remediation of mine sites.  </p> <p>  There are many competing demands across Departments and only a finite amount of money can be allocated across these demands.  We will continue to make our case for increased funding in the next few weeks as part of the Estimates process.  I look forward to engaging with members of the committee on the areas where we could consider prioritising expenditure in the coming years.</p></speech>

I have one question on the national broadband plan.  Some &euro;7.5 million has been allocated in 2016 for next generation broadband services.  By the end of June &euro;2.547 million had been spent under subhead A3, out of a total Estimate allocation of &euro;16.75 million.  What proportion of this figure has been spent under the national broadband plan and why has there been an underspend in that regard?  Will the Minister elaborate on whether the underspend has adversely affected the roll-out of the national broadband plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016092100002#B00600"><p>We raised this issue last June when we appeared before the committee.  The subhead in the Estimate for the Department includes the allocation of &euro;7.5 million for next generation broadband services.  By the end of June &euro;2.547 million had been spent under the subhead.  The total Estimate allocation for the year is &euro;16.7 million.  Approximately &euro;900,000 was spent directly on the national broadband plan.  There has been no impact on the roll-out of the plan.  There is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to make next generation broadband available to every home and business throughout the country by 2020.  It has since transpired that 100% of addresses will not have access to high speed broadband until 2022, even though the overall target of the national broadband plan is to ensure 100% accessibility to next generation broadband by 2020.  The Chairman asked if the underspend had had an impact on the roll-out of the plan.  No, it has not.  The expenditure profile will vary from year to year because we are engaged in the procurement process and most of the money allocated last year and this year was for buying in additional expertise, as and when required.  At different stages of the procurement process we will require additional expertise to be bought in.</p><p> The fact that there is a differential with regard to the spending profile against the amount set out at the start of the year does not impact on the progression of this project.  It depends on when we require the expertise at different phases during the project.  As a result of the fact that there was an underspend in the first half of the year, we indicated early in the Estimates meeting on 29 June that we were reallocating some of that and we outlined how this was being done.</p></speech>

I would like to concentrate on the future rather than the past because he is ahead of profile in terms of his spend.  It almost seems to suggest that he will have very little to do, with up to 90% of his funds spent in certain areas and 75% in others.  That was up to June, so by the look of things it will be a lean enough period until Christmas.</p></speech>

On climate change, I was surprised to hear the Minister say that the effort does not fall to his Department alone.  We accept that with regard to energy efficiency and renewable energy.  Notwithstanding that, his Department has been given a title that includes the phrase "climate action", which sends out a message that he will take a lead on that.  I hope he will not fall into the trap whereby he will say it is not his responsibility and that others need to come to the table as well.  We need a driver with regard to climate action and climate change, and that needs to happen very quickly.  The Minister is well aware of the implications of agreements recently reached and other targets that will be set further out to 2030, so we need a co-ordinated policy from the Minister.  I am sure the battle will be at the Cabinet table, and we expect him to win on that.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, the message that seems to be coming from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is that it requires more taxation in terms of the equalisation of the charges on diesel and petrol and that this would solve its responsibility, but it would not.  We all know that the transport sector is way behind.  In truth, if we are to make some changes in the transport sector, it is not about moving people from using diesel to using petrol.  To that extent, has the Minister any plans to enhance the use of electric vehicles?  I read some material during the summer about what the Norwegians have done.  They expect to have moved away from the use of petrol and diesel for all domestic vehicles and some lighter commercial vehicles by 2025.  That is an ambitious plan, but those are the types of ideas we would need to see coming from the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  It should set out the vision, let the other Departments follow, and have the battle lines drawn in that respect.  The Minister will have to go big and bold in that regard if he is to achieve a shift away from fossil fuels.  We would like to hear some comments on that.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the funding of public service broadcasting and the issue having been bounced around in the media.  That is the case.  Very early on in his tenure, he identified one source of funding-----</p></speech>

I warmly congratulate him on his appointment and express my confidence that he will bring great skills to the role.</p> <p>  The provision of broadband is a priority issue for all of us.  It must be a priority for people who represent areas where large sections are not covered because of topography or relative isolation.  It is very important that we get broadband into every home in the country.  Apart from the &euro;2.5 million the Minister said is being reallocated to other areas, I am anxious to know that the rest of the moneys from this year's surplus would go into next year's programme as additional moneys, in other words, there would be no diminution of moneys.  The Minister might confirm that broadband roll-out would not be affected.</p> <p>  I am anxious to know also how negotiations on procuring a contractor are going, and the timeframe the Minster has put on that.  I reiterate our concern that we expressed at a previous meeting that the Minister would ensure that the contractual situation would be clear, that everything will happen on schedule, with no unnecessary delays, which is important, and that everything will be achieved within cost.</p> <p>  I had wanted to speak about online vouchers, but I understand that comes under another heading.</p></speech>

Does he believe there is an opportunity in Border region in particular to sell into the sterling areas - Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom generally?  Does the Minister believe that online vouchers are working adequately?  They do not seem to have captured the public imagination and there does not seem to be a high level of awareness of them.  That may be my fault but I ask the Minister to elaborate on the online voucher scheme.

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute.</p> <p>  In terms of broadband provision, programme A will be hugely important.  In the past 15 years, I have attended more than enough briefings and announcements on that issue by different organisations and companies.  Anybody who has attended the National Ploughing Championships, and even people who do not attend but who have their eyes and ears open, will know that we still have a huge problem with the roll-out of effective, high-speed broadband, not just in very rural areas but in many towns also.  In County Laois and south Kildare, there are many areas without broadband.  We want to see it rolled out to these areas in a speedy fashion.</p> <p>  My concern is about the amount of money available until the end of June.  I take the Minister's point that the spend does not always reflect the activity.  My party does not advocate throwing money at areas to try to get movement for the sake of it.</p><p>It obviously must be spent properly with proper procurement and everything else.  However, the expenditure figure of &euro;2.5 million for the first six months of the year to the end of June certainly jumped out at me as being very low.  This might indicate this project is not being given the sense of urgency it deserves.</p><p> On the issue of broadband, the briefing acknowledges a point made to members previously to the effect that while it had been hoped that 100% of addresses would be reached, this will not be the case.  The briefing states it has since transpired that 100% of addresses will not have access to next-generation broadband by 2022.  This obviously is a concern on which the Minister might elaborate.  While there are areas such as the Black Valley, County Kerry, which even the rural electrification scheme had difficulty in accessing, the flat ground in the midlands should not be a major problem.  The Minister might elaborate on what will be the percentage with which there will be difficulties.</p><p> On the issue of the roll-out of this plan between now and 2022, it will be necessary for members to be able to measure progress on it.  The plan will be handed over to one of the three bidding companies and I wish to ascertain the current status of that process.  The preferred contractor was meant to have been selected this year but that will not now happen and has been deferred until 2017.  What is the current position in this regard?  What progress is being made and when in 2017 will the preferred bidder be identified?  Will it take place closer to January or to December 2017 because that obviously is important?  As this project must be cranked up rapidly, will the Department set targets on the roll-out?  What is the current status of the bidding process, when will the contractor be selected and when will there be feet on the ground in this regard?  Will there be annual targets to enable members to monitor the roll-out?  My final question on this plan pertains to the 30 Mbps target.  Does the expert advice received by the Minister indicate that by current international standards, 30 Mbps is sufficient for businesses trying to operate in rural areas in particular?  People must download large documents and must send large documents online.  On foot of the expert advice they have received, are the departmental officials and the Minister satisfied that 30 Mbps is adequate?</p><p> The Minister has heard me express concerns previously on the ownership of the infrastructure but I do not wish to labour the point today.  One bidder certainly has a different opinion in this regard from that of the Department to the effect that the core infrastructure should be in public ownership.  Sinn F&eacute;in shares that opinion and the example of the disaster which Telecom-Eircom-Eir turned out to be is there to be seen.  A lot of taxpayers' money was invested in that company during the 1980s and the concern is this project might go the same way.  Members will need to see the roll-out of this project but I note the briefing contained issues of concern.</p></speech>

Earlier, I attended a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  I made a point to him that also applies here, which is that the areas for which the Minister is responsible are of huge significance for the economic development of the State, as well as for social and other progress in areas such as the digital economy and the clean energy economy.  Moreover, that is even before one considers rivers, engineering, geoscience and so on.  If my recollection is correct regarding the core analytical staff available to the Minister to understand and manage the new digital economy and the clean economy, according to the Sunday newspapers, Ireland probably has more civil servants working out sick pay for those public servants who are sick than it has working in the area of digital and energy policy.  I have made the point to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that this requires a quantum change.  As I understand it, 5,000 civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine process payment forms for Europe or whatever.  Why not get 2,000 of them and start them working on this issue?  I have nothing against agriculture but I have a general sense about ambition for this area.</p> <p>  There must be 30,000 people in my constituency of Dublin Bay South who work in the digital industries and we are interested in what the Vice President for the Commission was talking about before this committee regarding privacy issues, copyright issues, spectrum management.  Any one of the issues presented to members by the Vice President would require a team of ten civil servants to understand how Ireland should position itself.  I refer to the copyright issue or, for example, the not insignificant issue of the Max Schrems judgment in the Facebook case.  This is not of no consequence to our economic, social and other future as Ireland must be the best at understanding the ethical rules on the digital economy.  I make the point that while I agree issues such as the national broadband scheme and so on undoubtedly are important, it actually is about the soft stuff, that is, the intellectual understanding of what is happening in the digital economy.  I do not believe the Department has the requisite number of staff and while there is nothing wrong with the staff, the Department needs more resources.  My sense is it requires a fivefold increase and I could make the same point in respect of clean energy.  I am interested to learn how or whether the Minister thinks he might get such an increase.</p> <p>  As a final brief question, who should I contact if I want to know about cyber-security in the Irish State?  If that is a security issue in its own right, the Minister can tell me privately.  However, as one example, can he outline to me the number of people the State has working in the area of cyber-security and where are they based?  What sort of secure interaction can the joint committee have on the issue of cyber-security?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016092100002#D00700"><p>I wish to make a few brief comments on the joint committee's favourite topic of broadband.  In a political sense, the ploughing championships did some good, in that all members are more alert to and aware of the issues facing rural Ireland than may have been the case previously.  In common with many members, I attended the championships yesterday but while speaking to various providers at different stands, one point that struck me about broadband in particular about which I had not been aware previously was on its transformative power.  All members are aware of how high-speed Internet access transforms small businesses and education but a number of farmers were talking about broadband and why it is so important in rural areas in particular.  In the case of a farmer who might be attempting to do another job, to make ends meet elsewhere or to look after a family or meet other commitments, a new technology might enable the deployment of cameras in the field to monitor animals and to keep an eye on what was happening around the farm.  This would be in contrast to the days of old and of being obliged to drive around on a quad bike or to walk across fields and all the rest at 6 a.m. or at 10 p.m.  It is a kind of transformative social experience that changes how people live their lives.  As for the financial struggle seemingly affecting all farmers, the practicalities of trying to participate in the workplace elsewhere while being able to keep an eye on the farm offer a real practical problem that high-speed broadband availability can try to solve.</p> <p>  I refer to an issue of which I had been vaguely aware but of which, on foot of some conversations at the championships, I have become more aware.  I understand the implementation of fibre to the cabinet technology is under way in some cases already and it will bring high-speed broadband to many areas, including many rural locations, some of which are fairly isolated.  However, this introduces another divide concerning those who are not on the particular stretch of line through which the fibre to the cabinet technology is running.  While it is bad enough not having it, it certainly is as bad, if not worse, if one's neighbour does have it.  This will create a kind of digital divide between rural and rural, rather than between urban and rural.  While I am sure everyone present is aware of this point, I wish to stress it.  The introduction of fibre to home technology obviously gets to the next stage and begins to address this issue.</p> <p>  Given the dates under discussion, my understanding is that it is expected the tender will be awarded in April or May 2017.  Without going into detail in this regard, I understand that procurement and tendering processes, etc., are in play.  However, to state the obvious, I note that the sooner the tender is awarded, the sooner the job can be started and the sooner we can get on with it, although I believe it will take a couple of years beyond the target.  I again stress this was another view, of which I had not been aware previously, regarding rural communities and how immediate benefits to quality and standard of life and to how people live their lives can be achieved, as well as the obvious and often-stated small business and educational needs and all the rest of it in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

If he wishes me to shorten the contribution times, I might not let it go for so long.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.558" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016092100002#E00100"><p>I will deal with the broadband issue first because it was raised by a number of members.</p><p>At present, we are at stage 3, commencement of the detailed, technical and financial negotiations with the qualified bidders.  There are three qualified bidders or consortia.  The process started in July.  We have a draft contract of approximately 2.2 million words - it is estimated that there will probably be 2.5 million words in it by the time it is finished - and we are in the process of dialogue with the three consortia on that.  When the stage in question is completed, we will enter the formal tender process based on that contract.  The objective is to have this completed by the middle of next year.  I cannot be definitive on the timing because it is crucially important that the process be robust.  It is important for me, as Minister, that we will have a contract at the end of this process that is as watertight as possible and that we will have been seen to go through this process fairly and transparently.</p><p>Others, including Senator O'Reilly, asked whether this money can be carried over.  It is being carried over.  Any money that is not spent is deferred rather than lost.  However, money is not the issue here.  It is about getting matters right, which is crucial.  This is a 25-year contract so it does not just deal with current needs.  This comes back to a point Deputy Stanley made.  We are saying that the minimum service that must be provided is 30 Mbps download speed for 99.95% of the time.  We believe that in order to ensure that this download speed will be achieved all of the time, the average speeds will have to be significantly higher.</p><p>The upload speed is 6 Mbps.  We have stated from the outset that this speed is insufficient to meet the needs of businesses, particularly those with which I have been in contact.  For the information of Deputy Stanley, it is not so much the download speed but that upload speed specification that is a problem for businesses because they also upload a great deal material and send and receive orders.  As part of the dialogue phase of this process, we have asked each of the three consortia to come back with what they believe are the current needs based on their own expertise in dealing with businesses across the country.  We accept that the requirement is significantly higher than those speeds and we also accept that this is a minimum standard.</p><p>As the committee will be aware, the commission made an announcement last week that it wants to see speeds go up to 100 Mbps and, over time, to 1 GB.  We are satisfied that the contract we will sign will facilitate that as required over the 25-year period.  As I stated previously in the House, this contract is designed in such a way that it is future-proofed so that if the need is for 100 Mbps in ten years' time, the contract will provide for that.  Our difficulty up to now is that we have been catching up once we set the benchmark.  When we started this process, 30 Mbps was seen as more than adequate.  Indeed, I suppose it was considered generous.  As the process goes on, the demands and needs of consumers change and that is why we are ensuring that this contract is future-proofed.</p><p>Deputy Lawless also mentioned the issue of fibre to the cabinet and the roll-out of the scheme.  In the past four years, the telecommunications companies in this country have been spending, on average, &euro;1.4 million every day on mobile broadband, wireless broadband and fixed-line broadband.  That investment is ongoing but, to give an idea of the scale of the challenge in respect of mobile broadband, the recent ComReg report indicates that the data demand on the mobile phone network has increased by 60% in the past 12 months.  The data demand on the mobile phone network across Europe is, on average, doubling every 18 months.  The increase seems to be running probably slightly higher than that trajectory in recent years in Ireland.  On the fixed-line network, it is doubling every 42 months across Europe.  One can see that there is significant investment needed merely to keep going, never mind to jump ahead, in terms of investment.</p><p>Deputy Stanley made the point that the underspend means that this project is not a priority.  That is not the case.  It is the single biggest priority within our Department.  We are determined to deliver on this project.  As I said, funding is not an issue.  In any approaches that we have made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of this matter, we have not found it wanting.</p><p>The Deputy stated that there will not be 100% access by 2022.  That is not the case.  Every home and premises will gain access to high-speed broadband.  That roll-out will happen in every county.  I do not know what document the Deputy has in front of him, but he asked about the differential between the amber and blue areas.  The amber area is the intervention area under the national broadband plan.  The blue areas are those where the private companies have come in and told our Department they will roll out high-speed broadband to every premises by the end of 2016.  As a result, we left them out of the intervention area and we designated that blue on the website <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>.  However, we quickly discovered that there were households which we were being told had already been provided with high-speed broadband but which were not able to access it.  In June, we announced that we estimate, based on the figures available to us, there are 170,000 premises within the blue area that will not have high-speed broadband - which is a minimum of 30 Mbps - by the end of the year.  We are revising our map to include those households.  That is why I called all of the Members of both the D&aacute;il and Seanad into the AV room before the summer recess to explain the position in respect of this project.  I asked Members to make contact with their communities - even via local media - to check whether they are within the blue area.  If Members constituents are not getting access to high-speed broadband or have not received a commitment from a broadband provider that they will have it by the end of this year, then we need to know about it.  I plead with those present to make people aware of what is required and to ask them to log-on to <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>to see whether their properties are located in the blue area and whether they have access to high-speed broadband, or will have by the end of the year.  If they do not have access, they should to e-mail us at <i>www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Broadband/</i>with their names, addresses and Eircodes in order that we can amend the map to ensure they are included on it.</p><p>I was asked about the timeline for the roll-out of the broadband.  My Department is working closely with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and her Department on the roll-out.</p><p>She is engaging with the local authorities to try to deal with potential bottlenecks.  One of the most important things we need to do is appoint a sufficiently highly ranked individual in each authority to make things move, ensure there are no blockages and there is someone to engage with the successful contractor.  The Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht is also working with the local authorities and communities across the country, through local and regional task forces, to determine how the infrastructure might be physically rolled out in each county.  Decisions must be made on whether village A, village B or community centres should benefit first within the restrictions imposed by the contractor.  It is our intention, once we have everything nailed down in this regard, to publish on the website when every single premises in the country will have broadband.  Thus, people will know that they will have it in the five-year roll-out period and the date on which they will have it.  There may be a village in an isolated area such as the Black Valley that is not included in the first or second phase.  In this regard, we must decide whether it is possible to enable a local community centre to give people access to a hot desk from which they can work or avail of services, pending full roll-out of the network?<br/><br/>I am as frustrated about this matter as everyone present.  I come from the county that will require the greatest intervention under the national broadband plan.  Sadly, my county has the worst broadband service in the country.  I am sure Senator Michael McDowell can relate to this.  I was as frustrated as everyone else when the Department announced earlier this year that there would be a delay.  That is why I wrote into the programme for Government that we would establish a specific task force to examine the provision of mobile and wireless broadband as interim solutions and how best to help the businesses in question to deploy the technology far quicker.  We committed in the programme for Government to establish the task force within the first 100 days.  The Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht and I established it within 82 days of the establishment of the Government.  It has met on six occasions and will come forward with constructive, practical ideas to deal with the bottlenecks, one of which is in my constituency.  In County Roscommon the development contribution for a mobile telephone antenna is zero.  The contribution for a mobile telephone antenna across the River Suck in the other part of my constituency in County Galway is &euro;20,000.  This does not encourage companies to invest in mobile telecommunications infrastructure.  There are, therefore, anomalies across the country in this regard.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Transport Infrastructure Ireland has a huge amount of ducting across the country along the national primary road networt but also along the motorway network.  It is cheaper to dig up the road and lay new ducting than it is to gain access to the ducting already in the ground.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the pricing structure in this regard.  There is other public infrastructure that could and should be made available to facilitate the rolling out of existing technologies that would help to ease the pressure on communities in the short term.  Tying in with this, last July we signed the broadband cost directive, which refers to access to infrastructure and sets clear deadlines as to when such a determination must be made on an application for a road opening licence and access to infrastructure.  It must be made within a specified period after submission.  The company eir, in particular, exerted a lot of pressure on me in this regard.  It considered there was a significant bottleneck in rolling out its fibre network.  I am sure it is the same for others.<br/><br/>Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned the mistakes made when we sold Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  There were mistakes made.  The biggest problem at the time was that there was inadequate regulation to deal with the circumstances after the sale.  If we were in the same circumstances again, I would not like to see the infrastructure sold.  I have weighed up the pros and cons.  My preference would have been to see the national broadband plan infrastructure remain in State ownership, but I had to make a call based on the information available to me and the competing demands, not only in my Department but across government, in meeting our climate change, energy efficiency, hospital waiting lists and housing programme targets.  The only issue that will arise will not arise for the next 25 years.  This is a problem we will have to examine in 26 years time.  I agree that we need to get the regulation right in the interim, which is why we have already moved at European Council level to introduce a universal service obligation for broadband for people who do not yet have broadband such as those in an isolated premises and those who will not already have been provided with the service in 26 years.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the universal service obligation in respect of fixed telephone lines does apply and has applied effectively to date.  I have not received a great number of complaints about people not being able to avail of the service up to now.  I do not know of any colleague who has received such complaints.  I have not received correspondence within my Department about the matter either.  The current regulation governing the fixed-line universal service obligation has worked to date.  We will need a similar regulation in 26 years time for customers who will not have received a service before then.<br/><br/>Deputy James Lawless spoke about the National Ploughing Championships and the point he made is correct.  The largest issue I came across at the championships was that of broadband.  As I have always stated, there is massive potential in this regard.  Last week we had a meeting with Science Foundation Ireland.  Its director, Professor Mark Ferguson, was talking about e-farming and referred to a certain farmer who, when herding in the morning, sat down in front of a laptop.  That is an operational note for Senator Tim Lombard.  The farmer in question does everything on the laptop, including strip grazing and dealing with herd health issues.  He does not dirty his shoes at all.  There is considerable potential in that regard.<br/><br/>Senator Joe O'Reilly referred to the trading online voucher scheme.  We need to do more to raise awareness.  As the Senator knows, I contacted each member to encourage him or her to encourage local businesses and sole traders to participate in the trading online voucher scheme.  We set ourselves a challenging target this year of trying to have 1,000 trading online vouchers taken up.  It involves a 50:50 grant of up to a potential &euro;5,000 for businesses with up to ten employees in order that they may set up a website and put in place a back-office payment system.  They can then make purchases online.  We carried out a survey of the businesses that had already signed up to the trading online scheme and noted that they had increased sales by 20%.  They have increased the numbers in employment by one third and two thirds of the companies are now trading internationally.  They include clothing shops, including men's outfitters on the main street in places such as Cashel, and also a bookshop in Abbey Street in Roscommon.  Companies across the country are participting in the scheme and there is also an individual who, as a hobby, is making pottery and selling it as wedding presents internationally, mainly to the United States.  There is considerable potential.  I encourage people who are not now trading online to contact their local enterprise office.  Grants and vouchers are available.  I have also engaged in a series of information meetings.  I am due to travel to the constituency of Deputy Hildegarde Naughton and the Minister of State at the Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, on Friday.  There is to be an initiative with Facebook on Monday week and we are involved with another for seven local enterprise offices in Roscommon.  We are trying to encourage and promote the scheme as much as possible.</p></speech>

A national cyber security centre has been established.  In the next few weeks, it is moving out to a purpose-built facility in UCD.  It includes computer security emergency response functions and is also involved in implementing the EU directive on network and information security.  That places a number of significant responsibilities on the State involving the establishment of binding security obligations on a wide range of critical infrastructure operators, including energy, health care, financial services, transport, water and digital service providers.</p> <p>  We are wrapping up staffing for that across the Department, mainly on a technical level.  Sometimes we have had to second staff from other agencies to provide the necessary technical expertise, particularly for the national broadband plan.  We have also seconded staff from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces for the national cyber security centre.  We bring in expertise as and when we need it, both on a contractual basis and as employed staff.  There has been a significant increase in staffing in the Department.  We would like to have more staff, of course.  We could always do with more staffing but we have been wrapping it up and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Following his appointment, the Minister indicated that he was going to move away from the notion of a broadcasting charge, which was mentioned by a previous Minister, with a view to generating additional revenue for RTE to meet its commitments.  The Minister has indicated a desire to sweat the assets, so to speak, in terms of getting a better return on the existing licence fee.  Is he still of that mind?  Does he still believe that more moneys can be drawn from the licence collection system and, if so, how much?</p> <p>  It has been reported in the media that the Minister has had discussions with RTE which has laid out its commitments in line with various requirements under the Broadcasting Acts.  The Broadcast Authority of Ireland, BAI, has made clear that RTE would need more money if it is to continue in its role.  Will the Minister share with us his thoughts, including the thoughts he shared with RTE's director general and the chairperson of the board, as to how they might meet their funding requirements in the coming months and years?</p></speech>

For those of us who are new to this committee, will the Minister outline where the other 54% goes?</p></speech>

Will the Minister outline briefly where the remaining 54% goes?</p> <p>  The proposal for a broadcasting fee was referred to by the previous speaker.  I am glad that has gone because there are a small number of addresses that do not yet have a television.  I am aware of one.  People may claim they do not have a television, but I am aware of one address in my area where there is no television and will not be for the generation of people living there.  I would therefore not be in favour of a television licence fee.  If the Minister has moved away from that idea, however, how does he intend to replace it?  If no increase in the licence fee is envisaged, we are moving towards enforcing greater compliance.  I think the non-compliance figure - that is, those without a television licence - is currently nearly 12%.  Perhaps the Minister could give us the figure.  Is it about 12%?</p></speech>

I have not had an opportunity to do so in public so far.  The Minister mentioned myself and Roscommon.  It occurred to me that there are many apartment complexes along the Shannon which, generally speaking, are owned by people as second homes.  A television licence costs &euro;145.50 per dwelling, but people with two homes are not millionaires.  I am not talking about myself, by the way, because I do not have a television in my own home down there.  I just want to make that clear, and I am not a millionaire.  I am talking about ordinary Joe and Josephine Soaps who may have one of these holiday apartments in the Minister's constituency.  It would cost &euro;291 to purchase two licence fees, but to gain that sum one would have to earn about &euro;600.  That is after-tax income at the marginal rate, which is a lot of money.  It is all very well talking about further compliance with the law, but it is a huge imposition if the Minister is suggesting chasing people around who have already paid for one licence, yet may spend one month per year in another home which also requires a television licence.  It requires them to earn &euro;600 to pay for both licences.</p> <p>  The committee's policy document refers to alternatives to the licence fee.  The Minister has indicated that he is not in favour of the cave tax, or whatever it was called before, but this is still a serious issue.  If the Minister is going to crack the whip and start prosecuting people, he should remember that we are talking about ordinary people who will have to earn &euro;600 for the privilege of watching television in two locations.</p></speech>

There are caravan sites in Wexford, Donabate and places like that.  We are talking about real people who are not very wealthy.  The system of increasing compliance is all very well, but if the Minister is going to squeeze them, he should remember that it is a huge imposition coming on top of the local property tax, bin charges and everything else.</p></speech>

There was a shortfall in that grant aid in 2014 and 2015, and it looks like that may also be the case in 2016.

No other broadcaster in the world has done that.  We all appreciated the provision of that particular service by RTE.  As such, there was a great deal of additional expense on RTE.  There is a challenge and it is not just one for RTE.  I have met not only with RTE, but with the independent broadcasters and community radio stations.  I am meeting with all the broadcasters across the spectrum to hear their views and issues in this regard.  All of them face huge challenges at the moment because of problems with advertising, which has fallen off.  Some of them have indicated that it has fallen off even further since the Brexit referendum because many advertising budgets are managed from the UK.  That has implications.</p> <p>  To come back to the questions, I might start with my own mobile constituent, Senator McDowell.  My focus is on those who are not paying any television licence, of whom there are many.  My question is very simple.  Do I ask those who are compliant to pay more to subsidise those who pay no licence fee or do we try to ensure that the law that is there is enforced?  It is the law of the land.  I could go for the soft option, as Deputy Stanley said, of a broadcasting charge and apply it to every single home, but it will be the same people who are paying again and cross-subsidising those who want everything but are prepared to pay for nothing.  We are all sick and tired of this happening.  Deputy Stanley has given examples of people who do not have a television.  Should they have to pay for the service if they do not have a television?  The difficulty at the moment is that approximately 8% of homes in Ireland do not have a television or claim they do not.  That is not tenable nor do I believe it is actually the case.  The level of evasion in relation to the television licence here is 14%.  Across the water in the UK, it is actually 7%.  That is money that should be invested in public service broadcasting across the board.  Without it, our broadcasters are facing very significant challenges.</p> <p>  We are looking at a number of areas in relation to this.  It is not just the television licence and compliance with the existing law.  There are opt-out channels in relation to broadcasters coming in from abroad.  There may be an implication on foot of Brexit, which is something we are looking into at the moment.  Back in the 1980s, the legislation allowed for the cable carriers to carry RTE and, subsequently, TG4 and TV3 free of charge.  The idea behind that at the time was to encourage and support the roll-out of the cable network.  Do we need that today in an era where we are bringing fibre to the doors of homes across the country?  Those are the types of thing we are looking at that could bring additional income into the public service broadcasting area.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland made the point in its report that the television licence fee should increase in line with inflation.  As members know, inflation has been at 0% for the past few years, which is why we are not looking at an increase in the licence fee itself.  Deputy Stanley asked me about the other 54% of the television licence fee.  The reference to 46% of the fee was to the percentage of the total amount we project to come in for the year which had come in by the end of June.  It is 46% out of 50% rather than 46% out of 100%.  It is pretty much in line with profile.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016092100002#H00400"><p>I can understand what Senator McDowell is saying in terms of evasion.  We all know that dealing with bills and all the different components of that is horrible.  However, there is a fundamental need for us to have decent public service broadcasting.  I commend what the Minister has said, considering the hundreds of millions of euro which go out of the country to Sky without any regulation, and it may be that the advent of Brexit brings that into a more regulated space without any real contribution from that organisation to Irish public service broadcasting.  The hundreds of millions that probably go to Facebook, Google and other companies which are, in effect, broadcasting here might also have to be considered in the mix.  Hopefully, the committee can look at this in our work programme.  It may be one of those issues where, while there may not be Cabinet agreement on doing something, the Minister's Department needs to start work.  We cannot just leave it hanging.  Even if it is not done in the next year or two, the Department could at least prepare for it to be done in two or three years time.  It must include online, satellite and, as the Minister has suggested, cable.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in that regard and I am quite willing to hear the committee's views if it wants to come back with a proposal and we can explore it.  It is important to remember that the fall in income from the television licence does not just affect RTE.  It affects TG4 and the independent broadcasters through the sound and vision fund and that leads directly to job losses.  People up and down the country are not being employed and there have been job losses over the past number of years because budgets have been tightened.  There is an opportunity to stimulate the sector if there is compliance with the law.</p></speech>

However, if someone has a caravan in Wexford, it is unfair to say he or she must buy two licences.  One does not say to somebody who goes to a hotel room and turns on the television that he or she must pay &euro;150 for the privilege over the fortnight or month he or she is staying there.  I know the hotel pays a licence fee, but it does not hit the individual in anything like the same way.  I ask the Minister and perhaps the committee to consider whether a person who pays the licence fee should get the benefit of a reduced rate for a caravan or secondary home.  It seems to me that the Minister is trying to get the people who are not paying at all.  I am talking about the people who are paying and who are being asked to pay on the double when there are people who are not paying at all.</p></speech>

While they are not following a particular schedule, they are consuming data that is created at a cost by the national broadcaster.  It is about how, as we move to the future, we have a robust system that protects the idea of public sector broadcasting.  We can jockey around about who pays what and where.  I have no issue there, and I take it that there are people who would see the particular line the Minister is taking as unfair.  Of course, there are systems to protect those, but the fundamental thing we need to protect is a national broadcaster and the idea of public sector broadcasting.  While we are fooling around in this space, I have a concern that we are eroding confidence in our national broadcaster and, through the loss of key personnel and staff, its capacity to continue to develop a thriving public sector broadcasting system.  That is happening in the face of the challenges of social media and content aggregated, provided and sourced well outside the State and from an entirely different culture.  While that is good and appropriate, we need a robust system if we are to protect what we have and allow it to develop and compete adequately.  How much does the Minister consider he can gain from within that 14% who are not paying at the minute and taking into account what Senator McDowell has said, which is that some of the properties involved are only inhabited for short periods?  What is the Minister's target?</p><p>The question of compliance is important because if there is no compliance, one must increase fees for those who are paying.  It is very important that there is compliance.  Perhaps the system needs to be changed to deal with a household with a licence that may have a mobile home or an apartment.  The current licence is tied to the address and we need to look carefully at how we manage that.  It is very important that we do not have a fee increase for those people who are paying because a significant number of people are not paying.  I recognise that it would be practically impossible to get 100% compliance for various reasons, particularly in gated developments, but we are talking about a different situation with a household that does not have a licence.  Perhaps the Department would look at that and see whether there is a mechanism that can be put in place where people who have a mobile home or apartment and who might be using a television for a fortnight or three weeks every year do not have to buy a licence to cover that period.  One way around it is to stipulate that if the household can show it has a valid licence tied to an address and that it is its permanent residence, it sorts the matter out.  We need compliance.  I do not want to get into an argument with Senator McDowell about this but it is important that those people who are paying are not carrying a significant percentage who are not paying.  Bills have been already mentioned.  In Portlaoise, where I live, people are paying &euro;80 a month for cable so along with paying the fee, they are paying this as well - &euro;80 multiplied by 12.  Those people are caught because if they have cable, they must have a licence.  Those people are paying for everything.</p></speech>

Does the Minister intend referring the purchase by Independent News &amp;amp; Media of Celtic Media Group to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland?  What is the Minister's role in terms of applying the Competition and Consumer Protection Act to the issue of media ownership?  Does he see that in his work programme in the coming weeks?</p></speech>

Has the Minister considered the asset space of RTE, what it owns, where it owns it and the most suitable location for a national broadcaster to be based?  Has he taken the wage structure in RTE into consideration?  The top ten broadcasters are probably earning twice the amount earned by the Taoiseach so there are issues about the body itself.  We are talking about squeezing the assets, the wage structure and the licence fee.  All these things need to be brought together because when the general public hears what major broadcasters are earning when it might be hit with another licence fee increase, which I am happy the Minister has ruled out, that is a significant issue that needs to be put to bed.</p></speech>

If the committee wants to come forward with a proposal to introduce a broadcasting charge or amend the current legislation, it should come forward with it and we will have a look at it.  The Department will facilitate the committee any way it can in respect of that.  My priority from a legislative point of view is to ensure that content that is currently being given free of charge to other operators who use it as a mechanism to attract business is paid for by those operators.</p> <p>  We are looking at what is happening in the UK regarding needing a television licence number to access content.  Content is being generated by the public service broadcaster.  Should people have free access to it if they are not prepared to pay for it?  We are looking at all options in respect of this.  I will bring a memorandum to Government about where I think I can make progress on this matter in the near future.  If the committee wants to come forward with a newly designed charge, it should bring it forward and we will look at it.  From listening to people, I can see that views across the committee are quite mixed.  If the committee can come up with a consensus, I am quite happy to consider it.  </p> <p>  In respect of Celtic Media Group, a number of mergers are being proposed at the moment.  The proposed acquisition of Wireless Group by News Corps (UK &amp;amp; Ireland) is being processed by my Department.  Unless clarification is sought by me, I must make a determination by 27 September and I will do so.  The proposed acquisition of UTV Ireland by Liberty Global has been cleared by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as of 7 September 2016.  The parties have ten days from the date on which the decision was made to notify me.  To the best of my knowledge, that notification has not come in yet but I am open to clarification.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has received notification from the parties involved in the proposed acquisition by Independent News &amp;amp; Media of the publishing division of Celtic Media Group.  Once the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has completed its assessment of the transaction on competition grounds and has made a determination, the Department and I will then be notified and a phase one assessment will commence.</p></speech>

The electric car grant scheme is very important.  Taking into consideration Drive4Zero, a pilot initiative run in Cork several years ago and the issue arising from that pilot regarding free car parking spaces, banks coming on board, local authorities and joined-up thinking between everyone, has the Minister any plans to extend that pilot and initiate more pilot programmes because it would be very appropriate?</p> <p>  The other area is energy efficiency, particularly relating to local authorities as major drivers and spenders of energy.  I might be overshooting but I think only one local authority in Ireland has been accredited for energy efficiency.  What are we going to do to get the other local authorities as major drivers in the community to come on line?  As leaders in the community, they need to be seen to be upfront.  Cork County Council is ISO 50001-accredited.  Other local authorities and large energy providers owned by the State need to come on line.  What are we proposing to do to get them to do this?</p></speech>

I take it the bulk of that would be for SEAI.  In general the SEAI grant scheme has been good and we can see the benefits of it in communities.  There is one weakness with its roll-out.  Many people with the greatest fuel poverty are living in the oldest houses which are the worst insulated and hardest to heat.  I refer to mass concrete houses in particular, including local authority houses.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il Chamber a number of times with the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, and various other Ministers, including Mr. Phil Hogan before he departed.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, now has responsibility for the environment.  We were at sea for a while and had no Minister with responsibility for the environment.</p> <p>  Some houses built in 2005, which were originally fairly well insulated, have had their insulation improved and their energy rating upgraded.  Some houses in my area that were already fairly well insulated were able to get the grant and in the case of local authority houses, the local authority did them.  Whereas around the corner in another street, houses built in the 1930s or 1920s are far harder to heat.  I am a realist and I know they are more expensive and difficult to do.  However, there is new technology there.</p> <p>  Someone in the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources needs to take a hands-on role in this.  The other Department involved, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, would be interested.  That Department has a big job to do in getting the new ones in place.  We have dodged the issue and it has not been dealt with.  The local authorities have not been able to get to grips with it and we need to address it.</p> <p>  Regarding the &euro;65 million for SEAI, in the recent past questions have been raised about governance at SEAI.  I do not think there was any allegation of deliberate wrongdoing, anybody on the fiddle or anything like that.  The problem arises with reporting and accountancy mechanisms between SEAI and the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources.  As we are dealing with the money and the money is the all-important bit, what has been done to rectify that in the past month or so?</p></speech>

When the Minister was effectively arguing to privatise the national broadband plan, he stated that he could not justify spending taxpayers' money on nationalising the broadband plan when there were more important things, such as climate change, to be dealt with.  Given that we are discussing the Estimates, I ask the Minister to outline how much he is saving from not nationalising the broadband plan and how much he is putting into climate change.  According to the briefing, which I read, there is an underspend in subhead C4 where only 33% has been spent on sustainable energy programmes.  That does not look like a serious attempt by Government to deal with climate change.</p> <p>  Is the Minister concerned about the impact of a third runway in Dublin Airport on our CO2 emissions?  Clearly aviation fuel is one of the more serious offenders in this area and the proposal of a third runway could have a major impact on it.</p> <p>  I ask the Chair a question while I have the floor because I have to leave.  If one wants to ask a question on the work programme, should that happen after this section?</p></speech>

Our Department is the lead Department on climate action.  However, some aspects are directly within my competency as Minister - on the electricity side, on the energy side, and on buildings and energy efficiency.  They come under my remit.  Agriculture and transport do not come under my remit.  We work quite closely and there is a Cabinet sub-committee that works on this.  When Commissioner Arias Ca&ntilde;ete was here in May, representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Marine, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Transport, Tourism and Sport attended those meetings.  We liaise very closely with those Departments, as we do with the Department of the Taoiseach on this.  The Department of the Taoiseach has taken an overarching supervisory role in this for many years prior to my appointment as Minister with responsibility for climate action.</p> <p>  In November we will publish the draft climate mitigation plan.  We will appear before this committee to get its view on it.  That will cover the issues across the various areas, including agriculture, transport, the built environment and energy.  It will explore the options available to us, costs and how we can monitor progress.  We expect to finalise that by the middle of next year.  We have engaged with the other Departments on this and further engagement will take place.  This committee can play a great role feeding into that.  I want the committee's input into all these things.  It is important that that is reflected in the final document.  It is very much a working document.  We are here to hear the committee's views on it.</p> <p>  Coming back to Deputy Dooley's points about transport, it is not just about taxes, which on their own will not make a difference; it is important for people to have alternatives.  Deputy Dooley and others mentioned electric vehicles.  We expect to have a task force on electric vehicles established by the end of October.  We had all expected electric vehicles to have had a far greater uptake at this stage than they have had.  The difficulty is that while it has benefited our economy, it has not benefited our environment in that carbon-based products have come down in price in recent years.  Therefore it has not driven the movement to electric vehicles.  We need to look at this again.</p> <p>  It comes back to what Senator O'Reilly said.  We cannot just look at electric vehicles, but need to move people along that road through the use of VRT, motor tax and so forth.  I suspect that as part of the discussion on electric vehicles between our Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we will investigate other options.  I intend to speak specifically about that issue at next week's OECD climate conference in Paris.  I will outline some ideas we have and where we could get assistance across the OECD.  The Deputy suggested looking at the Scandinavian examples.  There is no point in us trying to reinvent the wheel here.  I would like to explore allowing electric vehicles to use bus lanes.</p><p>It may be a way to incentivise and encourage people to transfer to electric vehicles.  The other problem with them for everybody other than Deputy Smith is the distance they can travel.</p></speech>

Does the Minister think I am a long distance driver?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.614" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CCJ2016092100002#L00300"><p>No, but in our day-to-day business, we travel long distances and trying to find charge points for electric vehicles can be difficult.  People in the Dublin region can charge them when they get to work and again when they get home.  The challenge is slightly different but there have been developments with batteries.  The European Commission is putting significant investment into this and there will be significant progress in the short term.  I am trying to lead by example and that is why I have a hybrid vehicle.  I have been surprised by how comfortable it is.  If someone is thinking about changing their vehicle, I would encourage them to test drive the hybrid vehicles before they made a final decision on which vehicle to purchase.  People who have travelled with me have been surprised by how comfortable and spacious the vehicle is and all I ask is that people try them out before they make a determination on which vehicle to purchase.</p> <p>  Under the biofuels obligation, an additional 2% will kick in from 1 January.  I am in agreement with Deputy Smith regarding her criticisms in this regard.  Electric vehicles are the way forward in respect of personal transport and we need to examine how we can make them more attractive.  This also addresses Senator Lombard's question.  He also asked a question about local authorities setting an example and he is correct about that.  That is why we are working with not only local authorities but with all the public sector bodies to support energy efficiency measures and, under our 2020 targets, the public sector has a 33% energy efficiency target.</p> <p>  We are in discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about this and we are working closely with the local authorities, particularly in respect of public lighting because approximately 50% of their overall electricity bill relates to this.  If we can make significant progress on public lighting usage, we can make significant progress on emissions and energy efficiency.  It would also mean local authorities would have more money to spend on other initiatives in their own communities, be they energy efficiency or other programmes.  A national steering group on public lighting is working with the 31 local authorities.  There is a pricing issue because individual lights are not metered.  That body of work is nearing completion and it should assist local authorities.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about domestic energy efficiency measures, which ties in with Deputy Stanley's question about deep retrofits that are required for older houses.  We are involved in two pilot schemes at the moment, one of which is the warmth and well-being pilot.  We have set aside &euro;20 million over three years to do deep retrofits in Dublin 12 and Dublin 24.  We reckon it will cost &euro;20,000 on average per house to do the retrofit.  We have selected people through the HSE public health nurses and GPs who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  These people frequently attend our health services, including the local hospital in Tallaght and St. James's Hospital.  We are seeking to make their homes more comfortable by improving the air circulation, which is a major problem in many older homes.  This will make the homes healthier, more comfortable and more energy efficient.  Based on research carried out in New Zealand, we believe there will be a reduction in the number of people presenting to GPs, requiring medication and presenting in accident and emergency departments.  Not only will their homes be more comfortable and energy efficient and their energy bills be reduced, the health service will save significant money and resources.  It is our intention to roll out that scheme on a broader level on foot of this pilot.</p> <p>  The other pilot is a bike to work scheme for homes through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  The Department has been working with EPS, a company based in Mallow, County Cork, on this.  It has carried out significant deep retrofits on the homes of its employees.  They pay the company back for this through their wages over a period and that has been a huge success.  We are working with Tipperary Energy and other energy co-operatives throughout the country on other initiatives to ascertain if they will work and, if so, to upscale them.</p> <p>  Coming back to Deputy Smith's question, I am looking for money for this area not just in this budget but in future budgets.  We need to do this from a fuel poverty point of view and from an energy efficiency point of view.  However, I also made a commitment in the election campaign to try to prevent people getting sick in the first place, and this is a simple step to make people more comfortable in their own homes and to prevent them from presenting in accident and emergency departments and in their GPs' surgeries.  We are targeting a specific cohort of people who have poor quality health because we can improve their health outlook dramatically, but the intention is to roll this scheme out.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about governance issues in respect of the SEAI.  There were relatively minor issues.  The most significant governance issue was the lack of a service level agreement or, as it is now called, a performance delivery agreement, with the Department.  This had been identified by the Department as a weakness some time ago.  Officials had been working with the authority to put this in place.  It is important to acknowledge that a team within the Department's internal team audit identified this and flagged it.  Our internal process, therefore, is working well.  Last week, I visited the team in Cavan to compliment them on the work they are doing.  I spoke to some of my staff in my office earlier who had a grilling from the internal audit unit yesterday and they said the unit is doing its job and keeping us all on our toes, which it is supposed to do.</p></speech>

Two hatcheries in Roscrea and Cullion near Mullingar were affected.  The board engaged in a period of public consultation that started on 5 July 2016 and subsequently ceased.  The board has met and agreed to defer indefinitely its proposal to exit trout production.  The board met a delegation from the main trout angling representative bodies in August to discuss the IFI's proposal.  I have visited both facilities and I suggest if there is an issue and an interest in the committee, its members would visit both facilities in Roscrea and Cullion to see them.  They are somewhat antiquated.  They are doing the job they were designed to do but in a different era.  The board has agreed to postpone the closure and exiting of production indefinitely but it recognises there are significant economic and environmental issues that need to be addressed in those facilities.</p></speech>

I have a quick question and if we are wrong we will be happy to have it confirmed.  Perhaps the Minister of State will reassure us.  One hears anecdotally that there are people in the energy area sitting on potential valuable energy resources around the country which are not being realised.  Is the Minister of State satisfied there is a good tracking system and inventory of the potential for gas and oil finds in the country and that it is being followed up?  I am sure there is no basis to it but one hears anecdotally that there are consortia or business interests sitting on finds and holding off on realising them.  It is probably pub talk but is the Minister of State keeping a handle on it?</p></speech>

It involved making all unlicensed acreage within the Atlantic basins available in a single licensing round and also to make data available.  The data were sold commercially to provide the greatest level of information about them to spark interest from interested parties.  Some 43 applications for licensing options were received from 17 companies by the close of the round in September 2015.  A process was gone through and there was an evaluation of applications.  In February 2016, the 14 new licensing options were offered.  A further 14 were offered in June 2016.  There have been reports suggesting there are millions of euro worth of potential oil and gas available but it is only through active exploration that the potential of the Irish offshore can be discovered.  There are costs associated with this.  There has been private investment of &euro;3 billion in recent years to try to strike oil and gas.  Obviously the State does not have the resources and probably should not be involved in it.  That is why there is licensing and private companies involved.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement made by the Minister in recent months that the Whitegate issue has been solved through guarding the oil refinery.  Will this long-term contract or private sale ensure we will have a commercially working oil refinery on this island?  Is the Minister happy that the body will keep the oil refinery going, which is a very important issue?  Are we confident that Kinsale gas field on the southern side of Ireland will be kept going for the next few years or is the pending closure inevitable?</p></speech>

The gasfield sites in Kinsale and Ballycotton are operated by PSE Kinsale Energy off the coast of Cork through annual lease rental fees and royalties payable to the State.  The direct financial return to the State from the Seven Heads gasfield operated off the coast is through annual lease rental fees and corporation tax of 25%.  This is coming to the end of its working life which is why there are options and licences looking at alternatives for exploration.  We will continue to do that.  Some 28 licences were issued this year which is the highest ever.  I hope we will see oil or gas struck from those licences.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, might comment on the Whitegate issue.</p></speech>

I am going down for the official handover which is coming about in the next couple of weeks.  It is a positive development.  The new owners are committed to the site and its operation and we have engaged with them at departmental level.  We will probably get the opportunity to talk directly to them when we go down and visit.  It is important to remember that since 23 June 2016, everything has to be viewed in a very different light.  We are in a very different world now, particularly from an energy and energy security perspective.  We need to look again at issues such as Whitegate and potential liquefied natural gas, LNG, sites in the country in the context of the fact that much of our reserves up to now have been stored offshore and in the UK.  The British exit from the European Union will have implications for us.  We are actively engaged on all those issues and the full implications of Brexit.  We still believe there will be very close co-operation with the UK on the energy portfolio.  Last Saturday I was in Carrington, outside Manchester, where the ESB has made significant investment in a new power station that went live on Monday morning.  It will power 1 million homes in the UK.  There will continue to be close co-operation between both Governments and jurisdictions.  We have to be conscious of the new era we are in.  I look forward to meeting the new owners of Whitegate in the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

A lot also depends on the agreement with the United Kingdom.  For example, Ireland is subject to conditions within the European Union which oblige it to have capacity and storage facilities for oil and gas reserves.  I refer to the obligation to have a 90-day supply.  As some of the available capacity is offshore and some will be in the United Kingdom and outside the European Union, we must either seek a derogation or look at storing onshore some of the reserves.  All of this will be very much dependent on the negotiations that will take place on the implications of Brexit.  It would be wrong of me to rule anything out until we have a clearer idea of exactly what type of agreement will be in place.  In reality, the United Kingdom is, in many cases, an importer of energy and gas supplies which transition through that country into Ireland.  We have to look at the issue of interconnectivity in the supply of electricity and gas.  The French President met the Taoiseach before the summer to discuss a high level agreement to develop the new Celtic interconnector which is back on the agenda because of Brexit which brings it very much to the fore.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Buckley.  </p><p>In considering its work programme the committee identified all primary care services as a key work stream.  It referenced the need to reorient the health service to put the focus on primary and community care services.  The meeting will focus on two aspects of the debate on the role of primary care services in any future health care model.  In our first session we will consider some of the issues faced by GPs working in areas experiencing significant disadvantage.  We will hear evidence from Dr. Edel McGinnity, Professor Susan Smith, Dr. John Delap and Dr. David Gibney who are representing the group Deep End Ireland, a group of GPs working in disadvantaged areas throughout the country.  In our second session we will hear evidence from Dr. Ronan Fawsitt and Professor Garry Courtney who will brief the committee on the Carlow-Kilkenny model of care which has been developed over time and from which we believe we can learn a lot.  Both sessions will I hope allow the committee to explore the barriers to developing primary care services which are vital in managing issues such as chronic disease in the community.  </p><p>I welcome our visitors.  We are delighted to have them and I thank them for coming to represent Deep End Ireland.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

We have called our group Deep End Ireland which has been modelled on a similar project in Scotland that has been running for a number of years and is called General Practice at the Deep End.  We will start by presenting some of the evidence which highlights the poorer health outcomes experienced by patients living in deprived or disadvantaged areas.  We will then present a description of what is called the inverse care law and a related case history example.  We will also offer some potential policy solutions, following which we will be happy to address questions.</p> <p>  Patients living in the most deprived areas have significantly poorer health outcomes than those living in the most affluent areas.  They have lower life expectancy and higher mortality rates at all ages.  When they get cancer, they tend to present later and are twice as likely to die from it.  Not only are they more likely to die prematurely, they also have higher rates of chronic conditions and are more than twice as likely to have heart disease and be at high risk of having a stroke.  They are also more likely to have multiple chronic conditions referred to as multimorbidity which occurs ten to 15 years earlier among the most deprived members of the population.  GPs working in the most deprived areas tend to have approximately 40% more patients with multimorbidity than GPs working in more affluent areas.  This is further complicated by the fact that patients living in deprived areas are more than twice as likely to have a combination of physical and mental health problems, with rates of 113 per 1,000 patients compared to 52 per 1,000 patients in the most affluent areas.  These patients often struggle to manage acute and chronic conditions while facing other social and financial pressures.</p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to a graph we have circulated which highlights the evidence which underpins the difference in health outcomes.  Along the bottom line, one can see No. 1 represents the most affluent populations, down to No. 10 which represents the most deprived.  The red line indicates the level of physical and mental co-morbidity, while the blue line indicates the level of standardised mortality.  The black line is fairly flat right across the different groupings.  It represents the flat distribution of funding, despite the clearly different needs among the most deprived populations.  Complex multimorbidity is much more common in practices in deprived areas and reflected in higher consultation rates, but it does have ramifications throughout the health service.  The 10% of patients with four or more chronic conditions account for 34% of unplanned emergency admissions and 47% of preventable unplanned admissions.</p> <p>  While we acknowledge the impact of wider social inequality on poorer health outcomes, we are going to focus on the challenge and opportunity to provide GP care for the most deprived patients.  This GP care is delivered within the context of what has been referred to as the inverse care law.  Dr. McGinnity will explain this further and present an anonymised case history that illustrates the challenges and lost opportunities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Edel McGinnity" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#B00800"><p>The term "inverse care law" was first coined in the United Kingdom in 1971 by a GP by the name of Julian Tudor Hart.  It describes how the people who are sickest are least likely to receive an appropriate health service.  It is a common expression, but what does it mean in practice?  If members look at the coloured diagram I circulated, it is about what happens when one distributes services according to numbers, not according to need.</p> <p>  The first drawing represents an average or affluent area versus a disadvantaged area with 1,000 people in it.  There is one health service which could be provided by a GP, a public health nurse, an occupational therapist, a hospital and an ultra-sound machine.  Within the 1,000 people a certain number will be chronically ill or are going to die.  With the same distribution of resources in a disadvantaged area, as Professor Smith outlined, the mortality rate is much higher, as is multimorbidity.  Within the 1,000 people one has twice as many sick people and people who are going to die, but one still has only one GP, one public health nurse, one hospital and one ultra-sound machine.  Therefore, one is effectively offering these patients half the service by distributing resources flat according to numbers across the system.</p> <p>  The diagram illustrates an extreme version of this and what happens in certain areas of disadvantage where numbers are not even equally distributed.  The national average for GPs to patients is one to 1,600, but in north-west Dublin where I practise it is one GP to 3,600 patients.  Within a given population, a GP has twice as many patients, twice as many of whom are sick or who are going to die.  That is a really extreme version.</p><p>There are many reasons for it and we are going to outline the nature of practice in these areas which leads to these problems.</p><p> One of the core reasons relates to the way the general medical services, GMS, scheme is funded according to capitation.  This means we get a fixed rate for a patient for the year, regardless of the number visits, regardless of whether it is one, ten or 100 visits a year or whether the visit lasts for five, ten or 50 minutes.  The only variable within the GMS scheme payment structure is age.  Research from the United Kingdom shows that a 50 year old living in one of the most deprived areas will consult at the same rate as a 70 year old living in one of the most affluent, and yet the fees are far lower.  On the periphery of the big cities, the average population is far younger and, as a result, in certain practices the average GMS payment per year is actually far lower than the national average.  In north-west Dublin, for example, it is 74% of the national average but morbidity and mortality is far higher in younger patients in these areas.</p><p> Unfortunately, the inverse care law pervades the system.  It is not only prevalent in primary care - although it is obvious to those of us in primary care - it is also a feature of many other services that our patients need, especially diagnostics.  There is a good deal of variation within the public system in essential tests, such as ultrasound and colonoscopy tests.  We need to carry out these tests for our patients to identify cancers early and so on.  There is extraordinary variation, however.  A great deal of our time is spent trying to access services for patients, especially locally in our communities.  This applies to all primary care services.  Since they are distributed according to number, there are not nearly enough of them for the needs of the population.  Critical support services for vulnerable families include child and adolescent mental health services, child psychology, occupational therapy, child protection and access to social workers.  The supply of these services is much slower in the areas in question, yet the needs are so much higher.  The delays compound the existing problems for patients and this adds to the burden for those of us trying to care for them.  We have to contain them, hold them safe and manage considerable risk while trying to access the services that our patients have such difficulty getting.  Moreover, there is no safety valve.  They cannot go instead and see someone privately or get a private MRI or ultrasound scan.</p><p> I will briefly describe a typical morning in my practice.  It is typical of many practices throughout the country.  The patient I will talk about is a woman called Catherine who is 54 years of age with multi-morbidity.  This is very common.  General practice is all about multi-morbidity now but in these areas it comes far younger and it is complicated by psycho-social problems.  Catherine is 54 years old.  She has a background of chronic lung disease, diabetes and eczema.  She is struggling with a 13 year old daughter who has behavioural problems.  In the background, she is still smoking.  I know her diabetes is not well controlled because I checked her blood levels on her previous visit.  Her smear test has been overdue for a year.  My system reminds me of this, as does my nurse.  Catherine has missed a couple of appointments for the test.  She is down today with a chest infection and a flare-up of her eczema.  She comes in, sits down and we start dealing with it.  As is typical in our practice, unfortunately, the telephone rings.  Normally, we would never take calls during a consultation but this is an urgent call from a child protection social worker who needs me to drop everything because she is going to court later that day for a care order in respect of a vulnerable child.  I am the only professional who has seen the mother of that child in the past week.  They want a letter from me about my opinion on the capacity of the mother to care for her child.  Catherine has to leave then because I have to have that conversation, write the letter, go to reception with the facsimile and then come back.  Then, I call Catherine back in.  She goes on to tell me that she has not been sleeping for the past month because her niece died after an illness.  She then tells me her daughter has just been suspended from school, which is the thing worrying her most today.  She needs a letter for clothing and she has to have it today.  It is urgent because she does not have the money to get runners for her daughter.  Meanwhile, the waiting room is full of many more patients like Catherine, all waiting to come in to have these things dealt with.  In any event, we work our way through the chest infection and eczema.  We look at the diabetes but the diabetes was very much impacted upon by the illness and death of her niece.  It caused her eating to go all over the place.  We agree not to change the medication and to wait to see if things would settle down.  We talk about her bereavement and other bereavements that she has had as well as her lack of sleep.  We talk at length about her 13 year old daughter who has been suspended from school.  She missed her children and adolescent mental health services appointment because of the funeral.  As a result, I have to write a letter later to get her back into that system.  I have to write a letter for the school as well.  We consider talking about her smoking but she is really upset today so I do not think it is a good day for it.  We arrange the prescriptions, her next appointment and the letter for the clothing, which is critical for her.  Then, when we have done all that, we remember that she still has not had her smear test.  I put it to her that we need to do the smear test today but she says she is simply is not in the humour for it.  I am not in the humour for it either because the waiting room is packed and so much has been going on.</p><p> Ironically, these patients are often called "hard to reach" by services.  CervicalCheck is a brilliant cervical screening programme.  The uptake is far lower in our areas even though the mortality rate relating to cervical cancer is higher there.  These people are hard to reach for screening programmes and many other things but they are not hard to reach for us.  They come to our practices every day of the week.  However, their acute mental health, social and physical problems are so overwhelming that we do not get to look after their chronic illnesses or undertake cancer prevention or screening.  These are all the things we could do and they would make such a difference to them now as well as down the track.  They would prevent these patients from getting sick and presenting later on with cancers, like they do.  They do not simply need more GP time, they need more administrative time and a great deal of support time.  Our secretaries spend a good deal of their days telephoning and texting people about their appointments with us and the hospitals.  That is, if we know when those appointments are coming up - we do not always know.  We need a good deal of time to liaise with our primary care colleagues.  Unlike some parts of the country, primary care teams function very well in our areas because we need them and our patients need them.  We need to spend a good deal of time liaising with them.  They are under-resourced and understaffed but they are absolutely fantastic professionals.  Public health nurses in particular are an incredible help.  They are the backbone of the health service.  They do not get much notice but they are very important.  I have tried to explain a typical morning and how it is that acute health and social problems act as a serious barrier to chronic disease management and cancer screening and prevention.  Even when our patients have a general practitioner, they still do not have appropriate access to proper care.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight that there are also great opportunities to improve outcomes throughout the health system.  We have some suggestions based on the experience of GPs in Deep End Ireland, as well as those in countries such as Scotland.  There is an overarching need to target resources where needs are greatest - we want to emphasise that point today.  Within this context we want to highlight four main areas.  First, there is a need for fully-functioning primary care teams in disadvantaged areas in particular, where team-working is such a key part of delivering effective care.  This means ending the recruitment embargo for primary care team front-line workers in these areas and matching personnel to local needs.  Second, we need strong primary care infrastructure in deprived areas to act as local hubs around which local services should develop.  This is related to our third priority area, which is the provision of support to general practitioners and practices in these areas.  GPs need more consultation time to address the complex needs that we have described.  The flat distribution of resources, a feature of the inverse care law, means that the only way GPs can currently deal with the increased demand in deprived areas is to have shorter consultations.  This results in missed opportunities for prevention, cancer screening and chronic disease management.  A change could be facilitated through a deprivation weighted capitation payment in a new GP contract or through other options, such as providing salaried GPs to practices and additional practice staff or additional funding for practice nurses and administrative staff.  The fourth priority area relates to the extraordinary pressure resulting from the lack of access to diagnostics and other speciality care supports.  While this may be a national problem, it is substantially worse in areas where there are greater health needs and where people do not have the option of the resources of private health schemes.</p> <p>  I thank members very much for taking the time to listen to our views and suggestions.  We are happy to clarify any issues they wish to raise and to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Would a deprivation weighted capitation payment be based on the need of the patient, so that a larger payment would be received for a patient with many complex issues, rather than the headage payment normally received for a patient through the General Medical Services, GMS?</p></speech>

I am also a community pharmacist and I am very well aware of the huge difficulties in the GP sector.  Solving and improving primary care will be key to the future of health care provision.  I imagine it will be a huge part of our report.  As it stands, GP care is the one area that deals with people's sickness as opposed to their ability to pay.  Everyone going to a GP practice gets examined and treated regardless of whether people have a medical card or are private patients.  When they go in the door they get looked after.  I imagine the more facilities and services we have, the quicker this will happen.</p> <p>  Is the percentage of referrals to hospital greater in deprived areas than in more affluent areas?  I suspect it might be, which means there is a very strong case to be made for resourcing GP practices properly, which would save on very expensive and sometimes unnecessary hospital stays.  I am interested to hear the comments of the witnesses on this.  To what level is the issue one related to socioeconomic background rather than a medical problem?  If the witnesses had a fully serviced ideal practice set-up, would they still be a good bit ahead of the curve compared with more affluent areas?  How difficult is it for the witnesses to recruit?  I live in a rural area and we had a big problem several years ago recruiting for what I consider to be a very attractive GP practice.  If it is that difficult in rural areas, is it much more difficult for the witnesses?  How might we get over this?</p> <p>  I would like to hear the opinion of the witnesses on the following matter.  I have received many inquiries in my constituency offices about the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine and problems associated with it.  As the issue has been raised by the witnesses, is it something they have heard in their practices from parents?</p></speech>

The report notes that in 2015 there were 21 GMS vacancies.  Do witnesses have the figure for this year?  Given that the report highlights that the benefits of the rural practice allowance remuneration wear off after approximately five years, how do they feel a deprivation allowance would best work?  How can we best implement it in order that it has a long-lasting effect for GPs and that it works?  With regard to GP retention in rural areas, I am interested in the suggestion that trainees are placed in rural GP practices.  Are there examples of where this has worked?  Would it improve the retention rate of GPs in these areas?</p> <p>  On the unequal access to diagnostics of patients in deprived areas, the witnesses referred to a lack of access to private services, but are other diagnostics generally not available in these areas?  Will the witnesses expand on this?  Is it the case that if patients cannot access public services they have to access services privately?  What are the diagnostics that are not available in deprived areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Susan Smith" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#D00900"><p>I will combine the questions on the capitation payment and the practice allowance because they are interconnected.  The idea of a deprivation weighted capitation payment is that it is based on the patient rather than where the practice is, so a practice with higher numbers of very deprived patients would have patients with a higher weighted capitation payment.  This is how it would work.  This is one of the models used in the National Health Service, NHS.  However, as the committee can see from the data from Scotland, it is not enough on its own.  The practices need to be resourced in other ways as well as through weighted capitation payments.  To answer Deputy O'Connell's question, various deprivation indices are used which are developed using CSO data.  It is based on individual patient characteristics, and the deprivation is weighted based on these characteristics.  Technically it is very easy to do.  It is a bit of a challenge at present because we would largely need to use primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, data which need to be explored a little more because we would need to know where the patients live as opposed to where the practices are based.</p></speech>

Some of the most deprived parts of the country are all along the western seaboard.  One of the reasons we are concentrating on urban general practice is because the number of people involved is much higher in cities.  A weighted capitation payment would have the benefit of distributing the deprivation allowance equally everywhere there is deprivation.  Every practice that has patients in these areas would benefit from it.  There are other possibilities.  We could decide that if 60% of the GMS patients of a given practice are in an area of extreme disadvantage, the practice could be entitled to an extra practice nurse or a salaried GP.  There could be different ways to approach it.  The easiest way to do it generally would be with a separate payment attached to each individual patient.</p></speech>

In Ballymun we were lucky enough to have a purpose-built health centre put in place where the primary care team and some secondary care services moved in.  The arrangement has been very successful from the point of view of having everything in one building.  Quite often, the public health nurses are our eyes and ears.  They can tell us that they have been to a particular house and a certain person is not doing well and needs a visit.  A lot of integration of care takes place, which does not happen without co-location.  This is particularly useful in deprived areas.  The problem in Ballymun is that we have now grown so big.</p><p>The whole health centre can only manage to have about 10,000 patients.  The population of Ballymun is bigger so there is a need for another health centre.</p><p> Having an infrastructure and all the services in the one building in deprived areas can make a big difference to the lives of patients.  Unfortunately, they still have chronic diseases but such infrastructure allows us to deal with patients better.  We can deal with patients in the community as opposed to dealing with them in the hospitals.  </p><p> The real problem that we all have is access to diagnostics and secondary care.  In terms of the diagnostics that I would have difficulty accessing, a chest X-ray is fine but it would take six months to access an ultrasound.  A six month wait is the best that one will get.  We do not have access to MRI and CT scans.  If somebody comes to me suffering a persistent headache, and no red flags to indicate he or she must go to hospital, a standard investigation would be either a CT scan or an MRI scan but we would have to refer him or her to a neurology department.  The waiting time for an appointment in a neurology unit ranges between 18 months and two years.  If the person manages to remember to avail of an appointment two years down the line, which I certainly would not, he or she then must wait another year to get an MRI scan.  It means people fall out of the system.  The problem for him or her is uncertainty.  One may have a headache that one thinks is serious.  Unfortunately, one must await an MRI scan but see a neurologist so it is very hard to get rid of and treat that headache.  In other countries there is protocol-driven access to those diagnostics that are useful.  Such a system works.  We are not saying there should be open access to everything but protocol-driven access would be helpful.</p><p> In terms of outpatients, every day we receive letters in the post that are either validation letters or state someone has missed his or her appointment.  The system does not work for our patients.  There is a high level of functioning illiteracy and it is hard to get our patients to make hospital appointments.  Also, their phone numbers change.  One of the questions we ask every time a person comes to our practice is "What is your phone number?" because patients change their phone numbers all the time so one cannot use a phone number to contact hospitals without checking.  Therefore, more time is required to co-ordinate getting people into hospitals.  There is a major barrier to getting people into secondary care so we are left keeping people with more chronic diseases in the community.  That is a real difficulty, but having a building and the primary care team co-located makes a huge difference.</p></speech>

I described a case in which diabetes is a serious health problem.  The management and control of my patient's diabetes is caught up in her social situation so it is impossible to separate the two.  There are many things one can do.  One of the biggest contributors to ill health is smoking.  A women's no smoking group has been set up in the area that I work in by the Irish Cancer Society, the HSE, the primary care team and ourselves, and we are closely linked.</p> <p>  One of the key things about general practice, and why we would like to see it placed at the centre of care in these areas, is that patients trust their GPs.  They will trust us when we refer them to a service or counsellor.  Patients are often slow to access services off their own bat but they will avail of services if we recommend them and tell them that another patient has had a successful outcome.  A women's no smoking group is a primary care initiative that has worked well.  It provides good social support to the women over six weeks.  Many of the participants have stopped smoking and they have all benefited.  Their health will hugely improve.  A couple of these groups have been started and quite a few of my patients have stopped smoking plus their health has improved enormously.  Social and medical backgrounds are intimately connected and general practice is at its fulcrum because we deal with everything, and are accessible every day.</p></speech>

I am sure that we can come up with an average cost per referral.  If we had that, we could calculate how much money would be saved if referrals were reduced.  Savings could be redirected towards general practitioners.  Statistics would help us to make a strong financial case for investment in services that would reduce the number of hospital referrals.  A 1% reduction in referrals amounts to 200,000 people.</p></speech>

The group gave more consultation time to GPs to manage complex patients in deprived areas and carried out an economic analysis.  They found that the intervention was cost effective at a quality adjusted life year rate of &pound;12,000, which is well below any of the funding thresholds that were used for any of our health service interventions.  That relates to reduced hospital utilisation as well as improved well-being and improved health conditions for the individuals involved.  There is evidence that if one targets one's resources effectively at these complex patients living in disadvantaged areas, one will save money for the whole system.</p></speech>

There has been decades of under investment and there are more reasons that people cannot access hospitals.  Is there a role in GP practices in disadvantaged areas, specifically to offset some of the problems created by delays in accessing hospitals, as outlined by Dr. Gibney?</p> <p>  In terms of a higher capitation payment with the deprivation link, would that be reduced if the number of services increased?  If one had more services, one would not necessarily need a higher amount of money.  What would happen if services were linked to the deprivation rate, in terms of the ratios, rather than the money?  If the GP practice had a choice in this matter which would be most beneficial?  </p> <p>  My next question is in terms of the education project, specifically the community-based project to assist women to give up smoking, which is a very worthwhile cause.  Can the GPs identify other projects?  </p> <p>  I apologise for being a bit late arriving but from what I have heard, the amount of time is paramount.  Earlier Dr. McGinnity said that she had to leave one patient to deal with another patient.  Is there scope for taking some of those issues out of the surgery and into the community, and assisting in the management of long-term issues like smoking?  If there is scope, what form would it take?</p></speech>

Of all of the committees that I have sat on, this one has provided more solutions than I have ever heard in terms of any issue that we have tried to tackle.  It is great to hear so many solutions.  We must now work on how to implement the solutions and get them up and running.  It is great to hear positive, concrete, direct, straightforward and logical solutions from GPs who work on the front line of health care.</p> <p>  My first question is on GP provision for children under six years of age.  How have GPs working in disadvantaged areas reacted to the initiative?  Has there been a significant increase in throughput?  The initiative has lead to additional pressures but I would like to hear how the scheme has worked in disadvantaged areas?  Have GPs working in disadvantaged areas had a different experience than other surgeries in terms of the initiative?</p> <p>  Can the delegation comment on the role of practice nurses?  Earlier we heard an interesting take on a consultation with a patient called Catherine.</p><p>It strikes me that much of that could have been done by a practice nurse, as I am sure the witnesses will agree.  How is the role of nurses in surgeries working out and how would Deep End Ireland like to see that enhanced and improved?  I suspect it is a big part of the solution.</p><p> The issue of the shortage of GPs was addressed but I am not sure it was fully answered, although it may have been.  The weighting of deprivation payments is an interesting concept and very worthy.  I suspect that, in practice, it would be more possible in this area than in others.  We tried this in the education area through the allocation of additional resources for children with special learning needs and there was an attempt to have a generic allocation model for all schools targeted at individual students from disadvantaged areas within each school.  However, the schools had a big issue with collecting such data from parents and asking for information on who has what, and so on.  Of course, in this case, the PCRS would have a lot of that data through the application process for the medical card, which applies to many people, so it makes it more possible.</p><p> We talked about referrals to hospitals.  With regard to referrals to emergency departments in particular, is there a significant difference in areas of disadvantage?  I want to hone in on unnecessary referrals to accident and emergency in that, as I understand it, anyone can call an ambulance, even with a pain in a toe, and the ambulance has to take the patient to the hospital's emergency unit, where they enter the triage system.  There are hours of delay and the ambulance is held up at the hospital door and is not released, and all of that.  What are the witnesses' comments on the issue of referrals to emergency departments?</p><p> With regard to diagnostics and X-rays, I had experience of the Spanish model of primary care when one of my children had an accident there on a bank holiday Saturday night.  We could go to the local primary care centre where head injuries were ruled out, the wound was stitched and we were back in the apartment 15 minutes later.  It that had happened at home in west Cork on a bank holiday Saturday night, I would have been in Cork University Hospital for hours, which is crazy.  Will it ever be possible for X-rays to be introduced at primary care level and what is the critical mass of patients required, or will this always be kept in the hospital setting?  I would be interested to know.</p></speech>

It was a very interesting presentation.  I was reminded of the fact that, many years ago, when I was a secondary school student studying history, I was enormously impressed with the story of Dr. Noel Browne.  I have always felt, since that time, that doctors speaking out against the problems which bear down on low income, working class communities provide a powerful voice.  I would also say it is a pity there are not more doctors, in particular GPs, who speak out about the issues and problems that confront communities.  It was a really interesting presentation.</p><p>My understanding of the analysis provided by the witnesses is that there is a double discrimination operating in low income, working class communities, in that there is social disadvantage - low pay, low incomes, poverty and so on - and then a disadvantage and a discrimination in the way the health service itself is set up, and that the witnesses want to concentrate on the second part of that today.  In that regard, there is one issue I would like to clarify and there are two questions I would like to raise.</p><p>The point I want to clarify concerns the principle of what the witnesses described as the inverse care law.  As I understand it, they are saying that if GP resources are distributed according to size of population, then, because more people are likely to present to the GP surgery in a low income, working class community, there is less of a service available for them.  Am I correct that the witnesses feel that, on top of that, it is often the case that GP surgeries in those communities have to serve a greater population?  Am I also correct that, if there is a situation where people are twice as likely to present and the population area is twice that of a more affluent area, the level of health care being provided by the GP, and that can only be provided by the GP in that community, is a quarter of what would be the case in the more affluent community?  If that is the case, it is a stunning statistic, but I am looking for clarification that I have understood the basic idea.</p><p>How much time does someone presenting to a GP in the communities represented by the witnesses have with the GP?  Obviously, there is a huge difference between having a 20 to 25 minute consultation and a ten or 12 minute consultation?  I read a story recently about how GP consultations in the UK are now often less than ten minutes.  What is the position in the experience of the witnesses and can they generalise as to the experience overall?  Do we have that experience of people coming to a GP and having ten minutes or less?  How bad is the problem?</p><p>The Deep End Ireland submission states:</p><blockquote>There is a need for fully functioning primary care teams in disadvantaged areas...  This means ending the recruitment embargo for primary care team front line workers in these areas and also matching personnel to local needs.</blockquote> <p>Will the witnesses give a little more of a flavour of what the recruitment embargo means in practical terms on a week-to-week basis?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.684" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Edel McGinnity" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#F00400"><p>On the final question, I do not think there is an official recruitment embargo but there is a de facto embargo because HSE local areas have to manage their budgets.  Effectively, when somebody leaves for any reason, they are not replaced.  For example, with regard to child psychology in my part of Dublin, one of the child psychologists left and was not replaced, and there is now a 14-month wait for a child psychology appointment there whereas it is about three months in Lucan.  That is what happens across all of those services.</p> <p>  The document refers to matching the numbers.  For example, the public health nurses, who are very much to the forefront of care, are distributed in the same proportion in all areas whereas there needs to be at least 1.5 public health nurses in certain areas compared to one nurse in another area.</p></speech>

The technology is expensive.  If it is a test that is only used infrequently, it is not worth the investment so, by and large, investigations that are provided by a unit that is set up for the investigation, as opposed to the practice, make more sense.</p> <p>  I have two examples of radiology in general practice.  I trained in the UK a very long time ago.  The practice where I trained was established by the Nuffield Trust and a radiology unit was put in place in the mid-1970s.  By the time I was there in the early 1980s, the radiology unit had been closed because it was not effective.  Likewise, the Ballymun health centre had a radiology unit fitted to it when it was built, and that room is still unused.  Bringing radiology out to GP practices is something that has not been successful so far.  However, there have been initiatives to give GPs additional access to imaging in ultrasound and radiology in the past, which has certainly benefited patients.</p></speech>

However, it was never developed like that.  The centre developed as the economy was falling and that aspect was not developed.  Eventually, it was moved to Blanchardstown.</p><p>There was a half-time post for a radiographer to come out to Ballymun who was linked into the Mater Hospital but that then fell by the wayside and they ended up being subsumed into the Mater Hospital.  That is my memory of it.  The machine that was moved out was never used.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is about properly resourcing a diagnostic facility and having the full range of staff.  The critical mass issue also arises.  We need to revisit diagnostic services within primary care and the community and where it makes sense.</p></speech>

As the Deputy notes, it does work in other areas where primary care units are set up and there are minor injury units associated with them.  There would need to be a mass of people to make it a proper minor injuries unit.  That is separate from what we do in primary care.</p></speech>

Dr. Gibney is describing an experience in an emergency setting where that out-of-hours centre is possibly covering 20 or 30 practices so one then gets into economies of scale.  It may be more appropriate to use that rather than using an accident and emergency department.  I certainly think it is worth-----</p></speech>

There are many patients in north-west Dublin who cannot get a GP at all.  They may have a GP in another part of the city where they have lived previously but their care is terrible because they cannot get to that GP and they only go when they are really stuck.  There are more patients per GP list - not twice as many in the sense that a doctor just could not function with that many but patients do not have the GPs and must go all over the place to find their GP.</p></speech>

It is two minutes longer than in the NHS.  It is like that earlier graph I showed the committee about flat funding.  The only way someone can deal with more health needs in sicker people is to reduce consultation length.  If someone has to see more people, they must see them in less time.  That is a real problem.</p></speech>

There are ten-minute appointments with an hour's break in the middle so, realistically, they are 15-minute appointments.  We still run late but we try to keep to that.  Some people would come in just to get their blood results or a prescription for something and they have made an appointment for that.  There are other people who could be there for 30 or 40 minutes and then the doctor is behind.  We do try to give people the time they need as they need it.  The thing about general practice is that we are in the community.  We can say to them "you need to come back to me again because I haven't had enough time to deal with that.  We'll deal with this today and make another appointment to do that."  One does not have to do it all in the one session.</p></speech>

Many services are like that.  Our patients get told many times they are not eligible for this service or they do not fit into that category and we get that on behalf of our patients, most notably with child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  It can be very difficult to get a patient seen there even though one might have a lot of experience with the problems.  Accessibility is key for people.  There are not that many services that people can go to every day.  It is a very precious and good thing but it means that we have no control over the average morning.  One could see ten or 20 patients.  It could be just crazy and then one gets those telephone calls and it is all over the place.</p></speech>

We have been lucky in that we are in a really good building with four different practices.  We pool resources, etc.  I work with three GPs and our practice nurses look after the diabetic clinic.  A link has been developed with Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital and they come out once a month and see difficult patients for us.  We have put in place a programme that works quite well.  It is still very difficult but it works reasonably well.  Our other practice nurse runs chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, clinics and asthma checks.  She does all the smear tests and has become a prescribing nurse practitioner.  She has just finished the course.  There is a huge room and practice nurses have a huge role to play in the development of general practice in these areas.  At the same time, it would be foolish to underestimate the need for oversight as well.  A doctor must oversee it because problems arise.  We work it together and it works quite well.  There is definitely a role and it makes a huge difference when one does that.</p> <p>  I think the Deputy asked about community-based projects.  One of the things having a proper primary care team has allowed us to do is to make links with the community.  This is really important in deprived areas because communities are incredibly resourceful.  They have developed a lot of resources in respect of the needs that have arisen in their communities.  Our physiotherapist has a "back on track" programme whereby a patient with postural back ache can go to the physiotherapist in our centre.  Our physiotherapist is particularly enthusiastic and has organised that the patient can go over to the local leisure centre and do a free six-week course with a trainer and the physiotherapist.  The idea behind it is to demystify going to the gym and to encourage people to get involved.  If they take part in that programme, there is a reduced membership fee for the first year.  It is about using the resources we have in our area.  We would always have been on the board of the youth action project and the drugs task force.  They have funded an addiction counsellor who works in the practices one day a week so there is a linkage.  That linkage between what is going on in the community and what we are doing in general practice has been really useful.  Those things are really important in deprived areas because there is a wealth of experience in the community about what is going on and one can tap into it.  However, it takes time.  </p> <p>  We are talking about recruitment.  We would all be GP trainers and the vast majority of people who train in our practices really like working in the areas they are in.  How does someone set up with a list size that is not viable when they do not have premises?  It is not possible do this in areas like ours.  One needs infrastructure to attract people.  It is not because people are not attracted to working in those areas.  It is because it is not financially possible to do so.</p></speech>

One of the key complicating factors for our patients are their psycho-social problems.  What often happens is that they miss their appointments and in Catherine's case, it was because she was going to the funeral and was then at the school trying to sort out her daughter's problems so she missed booked appointments.  One then has to be flexible enough to catch them when they turn up with what is important to them, which in her case, was her clothing letter and her chest infection.  I needed to create the time to capitalise on that to carry out the smear test but I did not.  We have two fantastic practice nurses who carry out huge amounts of that chronic disease management.  It is difficult for many of our patients who have really complicated lives.  One needs to be flexible with them.</p><p>We have some slight insight into it because we spend a lot of time running clinics and meeting people, realising that one cap does not fit all and that five or ten minutes is not enough when something is complicated.

That has not had such a big impact in our area because most of our under sixes already had medical cards.  The ones who have them definitely take up time.  Parents need to be reassured and so on.  In terms of where that money could have gone, there is a really critical family therapy service that has lost two staff and is now so restricted that it only takes referrals from Tusla.  We could have used that money for the under sixes who are having a lot of problems.</p></speech>

There is always caution, one has to be cautious.</p></speech>

I am a GP for a deprived rural area as opposed to a deprived urban area.  I understand exactly what the witnesses are saying.  I have some points which might help us come to a conclusion about how we can improve our health service.  The inverse care law is well-known.  It did not just appear yesterday.  Tudor Hart was mentioned as an iconic figure in the NHS in general practice, and he has spoken about the inverse care law for many years.  It states that the people who need the care most have the least access to it.  We are still trying to reverse the position.</p> <p>  We have a huge problem recruiting general practitioners in Ireland.  We are educating fantastic GPs but, unfortunately, we are not able to retain them.  Retention and recruitment of GPs is essential to reversing the inverse care law.  Our contract is a big impediment because it is very fixed and inflexible.  That is the first issue to be addressed.  We need also to recruit practice nurses and staff to deal with all other community services.  Perhaps a practice needs a nurse before it needs a second, third or fourth GP.  My practice nurse sees 33% of the patients without any reference to me.  That is a huge resource.  How we go about recruiting and retaining staff is the key.</p> <p>  Primary care teams are a fantastic resource.  Unfortunately, they are not staffed either.  There is great difficulty in retaining staff.  Instead of building 80 new primary care centres, we should fully staff 80 new primary care teams.  Perhaps these primary care centres could be used for diagnostic services, as diagnostic and treatment centres.  It is very difficult to attract GPs into primary care centres throughout the country.  The barriers to joining such facilities can be great.</p> <p>  There is a backlog outside general practice.  If a person is referred, there is a huge problem in getting services.  Communication is a huge problem.  Hospitals are not very good at information technology, IT.  GPs are extremely advanced when it comes to IT.  Communicating with hospitals is very difficult.  We will hear more about the integration of primary and secondary care during our second session.  It is an extremely important matter.  It is vital that we discover how they managed to do that.  I would like the witnesses' views on that and on the huge barriers that exist.</p> <p>  In the context of the inverse care law, information and education are key to preventing illness developing.  That starts in schools and other educational facilities.  That is a problem in deprived urban areas.  There has to be a medical education programme in every school about smoking, drinking, unsafe behaviour and healthy lifestyles.  This will not give a result tomorrow or the next day but it will do so in ten, 20 or 30 years' time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.714" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#H00600"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  We speak of primary care as the bulwark of delivery of health care in the future.  To date, it has been under-resourced, understaffed and under-utilised in many cases.  During the Celtic tiger era we placed much emphasis on the physical structures of primary care, namely, the buildings.  Let us be under no illusion, not every GP in the country embraced primary care teams.  There was quite an amount of resistance.  That was and is a problem because some GPs were not willing to engage with the process.</p> <p>  I have always felt that we are missing a link in the primary care strategy and it relates to diagnostics.  There are primary care teams in some areas and there are primary care centres in others.  Ultimately, all diagnostics have to go to the acute hospitals, through a referral to a consultant.  Is there a link that we should establish?  Rather than obsess about primary care centres in every community, we should have primary care teams and more regionalised centres for diagnostics.  GPs should also have the facility to refer directly to a centre that is a step above a primary care centre where there would be other specialties and resources, as opposed to always referring into the acute setting.  Once the referral is made, access depends on what comes through the emergency department of the hospital.  There can never be a streamlined approach of elective referrals, surgeries, etc.  Almost everybody ends up going to hospital through the referral process.</p> <p>  On the inverse care law and the need for resources in deprived areas, I represent a constituency which is a microcosm of Ireland and which comprises the most affluent and the poorest areas in an urban setting.  I can see in people the differences in quality of health and the impact lifestyle has on health.  There is a huge problem with diabetes, smoking, alcohol and poor housing, which give rise the outcomes we all know - cancer, cardiac problems, stroke and life expectancy issues.  We simply are not investing the requisite resources.  We are also making no effort on the preventative side.  We all know that if people smoke less and have a healthy diet, they will have a better chance of living longer.  The people who most need to hear the preventive advertising campaigns are least likely to hear them.  Do we need to target resources, through the primary care teams, school, educational programmes and local authorities on real preventive efforts, as opposed to ticking boxes for a national campaign, knowing that the people who most need to hear the message will probably not be listening?  There is a huge weakness there.</p> <p>  On the issue of salaried GPs, we are aware of the impact of the inverse care law, namely, that where resources are most needed, they are not in place.  As opposed to weighted deprivation payments, would having salaried GPs in a problem area help?  Would that be possible?</p><p>I am not criticising; I am making an observation.  There is resistance, however, and every profession likes to have professional integrity and professional protection and they do not like the lines of demarcation to be frayed away at the edges.  Prescribing nurses, for example, is something that can be resisted by some GPs.  Are we using nurse specialists, practice nurses and community pharmacists fully as a resource and should there be a lot more emphasis on nurse specialists and practice nurses in primary care settings and in primary care teams?</p><p> If we are to establish primary care teams, I would like to think that there would be a possibility for GPs to specialise in certain areas.  For example, demographic profiling of certain areas will show if there is going to be an ageing profile over time, so GPs would specialise in geriatric care.  Could we be more imaginative in using the resources of the GP, the primary care team, nurses and nurse specialists? I have rolled observations and questions into one.</p></speech>

Perhaps the witness could clarify this.  Is this a case where someone presents to a GP practice with a headache, and in order for them to be seen, one is able to prioritise? Could the witness explain what he means by that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Gibney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#J00300"><p>When I worked in the UK there was a protocol which was, for example, when someone has a headache then one must look for certain red flags.  If there are no red flags one tries analgesia to see if the headache goes.  There are certain steps to go through.  If the steps are gone through and the headache persists and if there are no signs of anything acute, that case needs to go to hospital straight away as there could be some underlying pathology and there would be access to an MRI without having to wait to see a neurologist.  That is what I mean.</p></speech>

With regard to hospital trusts and the hospital at the centre of that, would Dr. Gibney consider that if there were a diagnostic wing which was attached to an acute hospital and not interfered with by an acute accident and emergency department, one could then send people from the community to that facility? It is shocking that a patient who clearly has cancer is waiting eight weeks to find out how bad it is.  The patient in question is a Polish gentleman who has settled in Ireland.  I met him at the weekend and I do not believe I would tolerate that wait if it were me.  I have the luxury of private health insurance but it just seems horrendous that in a civilised country somebody who clearly has cancer would be left eight weeks to be told how bad it is.  Are the witnesses saying if we had this set-up on site, attached to the acute hospitals and with radiologists, radiographers and all of those resources, that is the way to do it?  If it is the way, is that too sparse to deal with the lad down in Clonakilty or wherever?  Is it too little?  Do we need more than that to serve the people in rural areas?  Would the witnesses consider that the way forward, having a wing attached to an acute hospital for primary care referrals?</p></speech>

The truth is that I do not believe there is any one answer to any of this.  Salaried GPs is a great idea but they have to work in a practice, so it is very unlikely that a centre could be set up that was only staffed by salaried GPs.  They would need to have the kind of integration with the rest of the system such as GMS contracts.  They would be working with GPs with GMS contracts.  It is part of the solution but it is not the only solution.  The committee has spoken about barriers and GPs not participating fully in primary care centres.  My colleague, Dr. Gibney, has good experience in addressing those barriers.</p></speech>

It seems that different people pay different amounts moving into primary care centres.  We were in an older health centre which was lucky enough to be under the national agreement, created under the John O'Connell deal, where no rent was to be charged to GPs working in groups who worked in health centres.  We still work under the aegis of that agreement which we had when we started off.  We have heard statistics about one GP for 2,500 in deprived areas compared with 1,600.  My practice size is 2,500 but we can employ 1.6 doctors because the rent is not an issue.  There are ways of attracting people into primary care centres.  In areas of blanket deprivation it is different from areas of more scattered deprivation.  In areas of blanket deprivation it is very useful to have everybody co-located.  It can work differently but that model is useful.</p></speech>

For that to happen there needs to be a slightly different approach to those patients.  In our experience it is true that there is resistance to primary care teams, but not as much in areas of disadvantage because we see the importance of the teams.  General practice is a very broad church.  There are many different models and ways of doing it but there is a lot of evidence to support the argument that GPs are more likely to integrate with primary care teams in these areas.  There should be special measures for these areas, a bit like the DEIS schools system in education, to bring everybody up to the same level.</p> <p>  With regard to the diagnostics, there is a possibility of my local hospital, Connolly Hospital, setting up a diagnostic unit in one of the primary care centres in our area.  I am in favour of anything that increases my patients' access.  However, it does not have to be in a primary care centre.  As Deputy O'Connell has said, if it was ring-fenced, why not just keep it in Connolly Hospital and make sure there are slots dedicated for GPs and an X-ray room that only takes GP referrals. </p></speech>

Communication was mentioned, and on the positive side, GPs, as everybody knows, are outside the system and off doing their own thing a lot of the time.  That has led us to have communications problems within the HSE structures in particular, but Healthmail is a new ICGP promoted e-mail system where we can e-mail about our patients.  Previously it was difficult for GPs to do that.  That system has completely transformed my working life because I can now e-mail all my primary care colleagues and all the Tusla social work system.  Those calls that I was getting in the middle of patient consultations are much reduced because I can now work with this e-mail system.  As Deputy Harty has said, we are well ahead with the IT.  It fascinates me that some of the hospitals spend a fortune with all of these validation letters saying that a patient did not turn up for an appointment.  It is not just validation letters.  Our local hospital now sends us a letter to say that someone is on a waiting list.  I want to know when their appointment is so I can phone them about their appointment.  However, I cannot find that out because the hospital will not deal with me by e-mail, but we are working on it.</p></speech>

That has transformed life for us with regard to handling data.  It has been a marvellous success.</p></speech>

We are more than trained to deal with prevention.</p><p>We spend much of our time doing that work when we are not dealing with their acute problems.  Our practice nurses are fantastic at it.  Had we more time for our patients, we could do much more of it.  It would be targeted at the person in front of us, his or her lifestyle and what would work for him or her in terms of weight loss, stopping smoking and so on.</p></speech>

Having a primary care centre in the middle of a community makes an important statement and allows for many other activities to take place, for example, evening courses to help people to stop smoking.  It facilitates a greater approach to health promotion.</p></speech>

The primary care centre with a primary care team operating within it is the model that works well in deprived urban areas.  The teams that work well tend to be in areas where there are primary care centres and two or three practices.  Organising a primary care team with disparate practices spread across a large area is more difficult.</p> <p>  We do not have the same difficulty in recruiting GPs to our practices because we are relatively well resourced and well organised and people are keen to work with us.  However, I do not have an answer as regards the person who works single-handedly from his or her own premises in a rural area.  I do not know how that circle can be squared.</p></speech>

Only 2% of the health budget goes to general practice, whereas 95% of all health care is provided in the community.  The United Kingdom spends 8% of its health budget on general practice.  The reason GPs will not work in that environment is straightforward - practices are not viable in small rural areas.  There is a fixed rate per patient.  If there are only 500 people in a village, there will not be enough patients to sustain a practice.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

That is why there is such a strong case to be made for having State-funded primary care centres.  A couple of years ago I spoke to a group of trainee GPs who were keen to be at the cutting edge of medicine, but it was not possible for most of them to do so.  What would they do about having premises?  As stated, running a practice does not stack up, even if one has premises.</p></speech>

A committee member mentioned that he or she did not see us often.  We are all in practices where we have the support of colleagues.  It is not possible to work as a GP single-handedly in a disadvantaged area.  One needs considerable support from one's practice and primary care teams.  That is why the old model whereby a GP set up shop in a house on an estate does not work.  It happens often in Blanchardstown, but GPs cannot manage it.  As Professor Smith stated, one cannot pilot a whole team with salaried GPs.  It must be based on existing practices.</p></speech>

I mentioned demographics and the fact that we were all getting older.  There is a further requirement for us to address the issues of nursing home support, geriatric teams in the community and retaining people in the home care setting.  We conducted some research and I have now seen a great deal of evidence when it was just anecdotal until recently.  Locum doctors or out-of-hours GPs are handling out-of-hours calls for many nursing homes.  I am not saying it is happening in every case, but there is a high tendency for the elderly person to be referred to an emergency department.  Can we be imaginative in any way in addressing this issue?  When one speaks to the consultant in the hospital, he or she says the person should not have been there and that he or she needed to be on IV drip and antibiotics and should have been retained where he or she had been.  There seems to be a lack of capacity in the out-of-hours service.  It is fine when the GP calling knows the patient in the nursing home, but is there any way for us to be more imaginative in dealing with this issue?  Being moved from a nursing home to an emergency department where there is a great deal of trundling, unnecessary agitation and so on, only to be kept for a number of days to receive low-level treatment before being sent back, places a major burden on the patient which is causing difficulties.  Hospital managements state it is a significant issue.  I do not know whether it is a significant issue in the delegates' areas, but if an area contains a large number of patients in nursing homes, there must be something more than an out-of-hours service.</p></speech>

In my practice in Inchicore we provide a care service for several nursing homes.  It is also a way for GPs to diversify in their clinical activities in order that they are not always engaged in face-to-face consultations with the same patients.  Some might spend a half day on a ward round in a nursing home.  It is important because conversations about individual patients' choices can be had during the day in order that, if something happens in the middle of the night, a patient has already decided that he or she does not want to sit on a trolley in an emergency department for 12 hours and instead wants to be treated in the nursing home or wherever else.  This requires a resourced, structured care service in order that patients will be a part of a named GP's practice and that the GP will monitor what he or she does with them.  GPs have the skills to do this work.</p></speech>

The first cohort of graduate entry medical students are qualifying as GPs.  They carry a large burden of debt, having put themselves through medical school at a cost of &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000.  Unless that issue is addressed and a system introduced that will allow them to offset that debt by deferring it over a long period or the Government taking it over, we will lose these graduate GPs.  Some 33% of the GP population are over the age of 55 years.  Recruitment is essential if they are to be replaced.  Dr. Delap may not have a difficulty in recruiting into his centre, but if 33% of GPs disappear in the next ten years, from where will their replacements come?</p><p>If universal primary care is to be introduced, we need to double our GP numbers, not lose one third.</p></speech>

However, we cannot recruit any more because we do not have any space.  We are only seeing 9,000 or 10,000 patients and there are more than 20,000 in Ballymun.  There are many who cannot get near our centre.  We are absolutely maxed out from the point of view of using every room.  We are even double-rooming.  We have done everything we can but we do not have any more space.  We need more space.  People like working.  When practices are well-resourced and they are working with primary care teams and good nurses, doctors will be attracted to work in those areas because they feel supported.</p></speech>

In my practice, we insert a lot of Mirena coils.  It costs a fortune to perform such insertions in a hospital setting.  We take referrals from other practices in the area to do it.  We have a GP colleague in Blanchardstown who takes referrals - when he is funded - for minor surgeries such as those involving the removal of skin lesions.

One of our work streams will examine the area of resource allocation.  We propose to do a kind of socioeconomic profile of each of the community health care organisations, CHOs, and then look at where staff are allocated across primary care in order to identify where the big gaps exist.  Ideally, we should be moving towards a situation where we have a transparent and objective resource allocation model that can be established in the Department and used.  The bones of such a model is there.  We should be using that objective resource allocation model when it comes to allocating nurses, physiotherapists or GPs so that we know the facts.

I thank the committee for inviting us today.  We are two front-line clinicians based in Carlow-Kilkenny.  We are not academics or health economists but we have learned what works.  We have also seen what is possible when GPs and hospitals work together.  We are not representing any organisation in this submission today but reflecting our own learning and experience gained over nearly three decades of local engagement.  We support the committee's vision to transform the health service with a ten-year plan that is agreed by stakeholders and the State.  We believe that in this age of digital health new thinking, new care pathways and new relationships between primary and secondary care are needed.  Most of all it requires more joined-up thinking and activity in health.</p> <p>  Throughout the country our hospitals, community services and GPs are struggling with increasing demand, finite resources, reduced capacity, fragmented care, an ageing population and the growing burden of chronic disease and multi-morbidity.  Our manpower crisis compounds the problem and there has been an absence of confidence and direction in our disconnected health service.  Relationships between primary care and secondary care are strained in most areas.  The financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation cuts which took 38% of State funding away from practices over five years were applied disproportionately to general practice leaving it currently unable to take on new commitments without new resources.  While hospital budget cuts were less severe, the combination of bed closures, limited manpower and service cuts have also left our hospitals unable to cope with increasing demand.  It is a perfect storm for the health service and for patient care.  We cannot continue like this.  New thinking is needed. </p> <p>  We come from Carlow&ndash;Kilkenny where we have had new thinking.  We are used to it.  There is a 20-year history of engagement between GPs and hospitals, much involving the ICGP-St Luke&rsquo;s liaison committee.  This led to integrated thinking and improved patient flow in Carlow-Kilkenny.  We call it a hospital without walls as GPs have very strong relationships with the hospital and are involved in all levels of service development and governance.</p> <p>  Over recent years, given all the challenges, we recognised the need to work more closely.  We formalised and then structured this engagement by scheduling monthly business meetings between GPs, consultants, hospital management, CHO partners, mental health, public health and pharmacy colleagues.  These meetings attract 20 to 30 doctors a month.  It is a forum that builds relationships, encourages ideas and agrees change.  It works through contact, respect, trust and innovation.  Everyone may attend and everyone is equal.</p> <p>  The outcomes of this integrated activity in Carlow-Kilkenny has created a culture of GP-hospital-community engagement and has led to many local initiatives that have scaled.  Caredoc, one of the earliest GP co-ops, began in 1999.  The first acute medical assessment unit in Ireland was opened in 2000, which allows direct GP access.  We call it streaming.  The first acute paediatric assessment unit with direct GP access was opened in 2002.  The first acute gynaecology assessment unit with direct GP access opened in 2005.  The first GP-led community intervention team, CIT, which brings hospitals into the home, was formed in 2009.  A new surgical assessment unit with direct GP access opened in 2014.  Other recent service developments include new services in heart failure in 2014, acute arthritis in 2015 and a GP-led gynaecology clinic led by local GP, Dr. Eluned Lawlor, in 2016.  The first purpose-built integrated ambulatory care centre in Ireland using an acute floor was opened fully in 2016, again with direct GP access.  The concept of an acute floor with GP streaming is a proven mechanism that reduces admissions, shortens length of stay, and helps keep patients at home and not in emergency departments, EDs, or on outpatient department, OPD, waiting lists.</p> <p>  The Carlow-Kilkenny model has now been adapted as a local integrated care committee, LICC, by the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Ireland East hospital group and the primary care division of the HSE as a mechanism in other areas for local engagement and integration between primary and secondary care.  The LICC is a bottom-up approach that is supported from the top.  This roll-out is now being supported nationally by the primary care division of the HSE.  There are a number of LICCs now active in the Ireland East hospital group, including Loughlinstown, Mullingar and Wexford.  The Ireland East hospital group has been hugely supportive of this integration with primary care and it considers alignment with GPs and CHOs as a key strategic priority.  The Ireland East hospital group recognises that an important role of effective LICCs in a new health system will be to help shift chronic care incrementally from hospitals to primary care in an agreed manner and with the correct resources to deliver benefits for patients.  This will ease the burden on hospitals and reduce the cost to the State by supporting GP-led primary care.</p><p>We need to take five steps for success on the journey towards GP-led primary care in Ireland.  First, we need a culture change towards more engagement between GPs and hospitals who need to work together locally in partnership with management, hospital and community, as equals in care.  This LICC engagement process should be costed and funded by the State.  Second, we need to move more care out of hospitals and into the community in an agreed and funded manner.  The Primary Care Surgical Association is one successful example.  GP-led primary care, working through enhanced primary care teams and supported by secondary care, can provide other models of community-based care.  Third, we need to resource and strengthen the infrastructure of general practice by increasing the numbers of GPs, practice nurses and other health care staff to deliver these new packages of care.  An end-of-life care package should be among the first.  A new GP contract that deals with chronic disease is also critical.</p><p> Fourth, we need better flow for patients through the health system.  Ambulatory care using an acute floor with GP streaming is the future for acute hospital medicine.  Scheduled care, including OPD and day care, needs a 21st century model using a shared EHR, ICT, virtual clinics and new care pathways, but GPs are central to these developments.  Fifth, we need the political and legislative certainty of ring-fenced funding to allow transformation of health care over an agreed period.  This is critical.  Clinician leadership and innovation should be supported locally and allowed to scale where there is success.  There will be benefits to the State from efficiencies, savings, confidence and a healthier population and workforce.  The transitional funding for development of GP-led primary care should not come from hospital budgets.  The eventual funding model for the new State health system should be determined only when we have the correct care and treatment model agreed by all stakeholders and we are clear on the workload and costs.</p><p> Regardless of the funding model, general practice needs to be at the heart of the new health system.  General practice and GP-led primary care can deliver comprehensive, co-ordinated, quality care that is accessible to patients and close to their homes.  In an age of multi-morbidity and medical complexity, only the "generalist" GP can deliver appropriate care to this group of people in a cost efficient manner.  However, the role of the generalist GP needs to be standardised.  We ask the committee to advocate the Farmleigh principles of GP-led primary care, which I outlined in an earlier submission.  They clarify the role.  These principles were developed by Professor Tom O&rsquo;Dowd of Trinity College Dublin in consensus with all stakeholders in 2015, using the TCD Chatham House Group, now known as Tomorrow&rsquo;s Health.  The principles articulate clearly what work is done in general practice and who is accountable.  It should be central to any new GP contract and a foundation stone for integrated care with our hospital partners.</p><p> Professor Courtney will take over from here.</p></speech>

We believe that the role of our hospitals is to support primary care, not the reverse.  Our current hospital-centric system delivers excellent specialist care but cannot deliver cost-effective care for the tsunami of chronic disease and multi-morbidity that is strangling our health service.  A total of 530,000 people are on waiting lists to see a specialist and up to 500 a day are on trolleys, which highlights the scale of the misalignment between demand and capacity.  Clearly, capacity in our hospitals needs urgent attention.  New thinking on OPD access is also needed, including better use of ICT and virtual clinics in chronic disease.  A great example is the heart failure virtual clinic run by Professor Ken McDonald of St. Vincent's Hospital, which shows an 80% reduction in hospital referrals.  We need to work with the clinical programmes, which are excellent examples of collaborative care pathways, developed between HSE, the royal colleges and GPs.</p> <p>  Our national manpower status is perilous, both in general practice and hospitals.  Many of our young graduates - both doctors and nurses - are leaving.  In secondary care, we are reliant on non-national junior doctors to run our hospitals and, without them, the system would collapse.  There is also a shortage of consultants.  In general practice, some 28% of GPs are aged over 60 and face retirement.  We train only 176 GPs a year, yet require 250 just to stand still, given emigration and retirements.  GP training numbers need to be increased by 100 and work must be done on retention of graduates.  A total of 90% of GP trainees are female and most do not want full-time positions or practice responsibility until their families are older.</p> <p>  The committee&rsquo;s plan for a ten-year consensus in health and a decisive shift towards primary care is welcome but there are specific challenges to be overcome.  Building effective business relationships between secondary and primary care will be the key to success.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, we have a tradition of engagement between GPs, hospital consultants and management, based on dialogue, respect, trust and innovation, which builds an integrated health system that works on solutions.  This model can be scaled up with primary care division and State support.  The emerging LICC process can improve the interface between primary and secondary and should be extended nationally.  Ambulatory care should be supported through an acute floor that integrates horizontally with services in the hospital and vertically with GPs and the community.  GP-led primary care, working in partnership with hospitals and community, is the best future of our health system.  By working together we are stronger and patient care is enhanced.  This is integrated care and this is the Carlow-Kilkenny model.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the importance of direct GP access to different hospital services.  How is that different from what is happening in other areas?  We are all familiar with constituents contacting us where there is an 18-month waiting list to see a specialist.  We refer them back to the GP and get him or her to seek access and to prioritise the case if it is urgent.  GPs in the Dublin area feel there is no point in doing that or they try and it does not make any difference.  What is different about this model?  Are improved resources available through the hospital?  What speeds the process up and reduces the waiting lists?  How is Carlow-Kilkenny different from other acute hospitals?</p> <p>  Dr. Fawsitt said it is important that we move forward with this model while making sure it is fully planned and costed with buy-in from everybody involved.  To what extent has he done that planning work and phasing of the transfer of care?  Is a model in place that could be adapted in other areas?  Is much information available on costing?</p> <p>  My third questions relates to HSE structures.  The committee is concerned that with the six hospitals groups and the nine CHOs, there is a mismatch between those areas and they are not aligned.  Is that a factor for Carlow-Kilkenny in terms of boundaries?  Is it an issue that GPs may send some of their local patients to a hospital group outside the Ireland east group?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Fawsitt" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#P00400"><p>With regard to the Chairman's third question about the structures of the CHO, there seems to be a misalignment at one level but we work on finding solutions to that.  People can be creative.  It is not an ideal start that they are not aligned but, at the end of the day, if there is a willingness to work with people, we can work with different CHOs and hospital groups.  We can get around that if the relationships are right.</p> <p>  What is different about Carlow-Kilkenny is last night we had our LICC meeting, which was attended by 25 doctors, our manager, pharmacist, mental health psychiatrist, hospital manager and the CHO.  We discussed issues such as transport of laboratory samples from a rural practice to the hospital in order that the rural practice can survive, communication, and the increasing number of scopes.</p><p>As a group, we came to share a similar view on many issues and on the fact that change was needed in some areas in respect of which we needed to improve.  When one gets people in a room and breaks bread with them, one begins to trust, get ideas and scale solutions.  That is what we have done over a number of years.  There is no magic to it; it is about getting people together who have a shared vision and who make things happen.  The projects that we mentioned in the submission are real, tangible and actually happening.  When one sees a product like that year after year, one begins to realise that this process works.  If I was looking forward, I would say that we need to develop those kinds of relationships everywhere in Ireland and that every acute hospital and CHO should be involved in this.  It is already supported by the college.</p><p> The third point is about planning and costing.  We are not health economists but what we have done is change things incrementally.  We have come from a situation in which we had beds in corridors 20 years ago.  We had admissions rights to the hospital and we used to admit our patients to the hospital corridor, which was not good.  We sat down and asked, "Look, how do we fix this?".  The idea of the acute medical assessment unit came up, again, from contact, trust and time.  The costing model comes when one gets the work right.  Once we have a sense of the right way to flow the work, it is then a job for a health economist.</p><p> I believe that people should have access to health care as a fundamental right.  There is no question about that and I think we are all agreed on it.</p></speech>

Ours is the 11th busiest hospital in the State and we have the 18th largest funding.  Therefore, we are relatively underfunded.  As a result of that, we work differently.  If a GP in north Dublin sends a patient to the emergency department, ED, the his or her letter is ignored.  Why would a patient in north Dublin go to see a GP?  It does not do them any good.  If a GP in Carlow or Kilkenny sees a patient and writes a letter, the patient goes to the top of the queue.  The patient is registered in the ED - we call it an acute floor now - and goes straight to where the GP asked him or her to go.  There is no middleman, no nurse triage and no quick look by an experienced ED doctor.  The patient goes straight to where the GP asked him or her to go.  If the GP wants the patient to receive medicine, he or she goes to the acute medical assessment unit.  If the GP wants the patient to go to psychiatry, he or she goes to acute psychiatry assessment.  If the GP wants the patient to go to paediatrics, he or she goes to paediatrics.  It is not always right, but there is an astonishingly low number of errors occurring, perhaps one per week.  We have 45,000 ED attendances per year, which is almost the same as St. Vincent's Hospital.  The GP has absolute primacy.</p></speech>

Dr. Fawsitt referred to evidence-based clinical algorithms.  I wonder if he could expand on that, on how patients are identified as being suitable for discharge and on how that works within the system.  Does he have any figures on how many inpatient bed days this care model has saved?  That would be very helpful.  He said that the hospital managed the completion of IV antibiotics in order that patients can be discharged early.  Is it feasible for IVs to be administered out outside of hospitals in the first instance?  I make particular reference to nursing homes and that provision.  Has that been explored or has any work been done in that area?  The same applies to PEG tubing, catheters, etc.  What type of hospital admissions has this service avoided?  Does the witness have any figures on that?  On the more ambitious term "hospital in the home", could one of our guests expand on what this would entail?  It goes back to the community by reducing the number of people entering the hospital setting.  I would be very interested in hearing more about the term "hospital in the home".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.797" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#Q00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  For many years, I have heard of the Carlow-Kilkenny model.  I am glad it is not an urban myth and that it actually exists.  For the committee's work, as the sessions go on, it is becoming clearer that, in the context of a ten-year strategy, we need to start at primary care and get it right.  If we fund it, resource it and replicate the model at St. Luke's Hospital, it will then have effects that will provide solutions more quickly further down the line.  That is certainly something that is becoming very clear.  I hope that is where we will be starting in our conclusions.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions.  A group from Dublin appeared before the committee earlier.  Its members are GPs who are very under-resourced and based in deprived areas.  How difficult was it for the witnesses to roll out this programme?  They started out 20 years ago, I think they said.  No matter what area one is in, there is resistance to change.  People do not like change.  Regardless of what profession one is in, change is almost automatically resisted.  What level of resistance did the witnesses experience and how did they overcome it?  More specifically, if the witnesses were to look at their model and replicate it throughout the country, how long would it take to put in place?  I would hope that a 12 to 24-month target could be set and achieved.  Perhaps it is hypothetical, but I hope it is not.  I hope that, with the right attitude and determination, it can be achieved.  That is what I would like to hear our guests' opinions on.  The St. Luke's Hospital model does not only deal with the primary care, it has also expanded into the hospital.  The link between the GP and the ED and how St. Luke's Hospital has managed to streamline it is where the future is.  As I might have said at the start, the solution might be staring us in the face.  It is just a matter of grasping the nettle and taking it up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.798" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#Q00600"><p>I thank Dr. Fawsitt and Professor Courtney for coming before the committee.  As Deputy Brassil said, the Carlow-Kilkenny model has been whispered about for years.  Unfortunately, it is not being adopted by other hospitals.  The first question I have relates to transitional funding.  Could the witnesses explain it and how it is used to change from the old system to the new system?</p> <p>  My second question is about how the witnesses got started on the system.  I think they are very lucky in Carlow and Kilkenny.  I believe in people being in the right place in the right time.  The two witnesses, all of their colleagues and the management structure of St. Luke's Hospital have come together with new thinking quite uniquely, having been in the right place at the right time.  It is difficult to fit that new thinking into an old-style model.  Our old-style model of GP-hospital interface is disjointed and disconnected.  What St. Luke's Hospital has is the opposite.  How does one convince those operating the old-style model to transition to the new?  We had that difficulty in the mid-west in that just this week we have had the last connection between our GPs and our local hospital broken.  We now cannot communicate with our hospital anymore.  We have to go through an anonymous bed bureau located in the regional hospital in Limerick.  The work that was built up over the past three years in Ennis is now gone in one fell swoop.  How does one get to people to get them to change their thinking?</p> <p>  My final point is that this should be a necessity.  In all hospital groups, this model should be a necessity rather than an option.  That is the message we need to communicate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Fawsitt" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2016092100002#R00100"><p>Deputy Hildegarde Naughten asked for evidence.  While I am not an evidence person, I know the acute medicine programme Professor Courtney started in Carlow-Kilkenny reduced average length of stay in the hospital by 1.6 days within five years.  That is the equivalent of generating 750 beds in the system and this has been documented.</p> <p>  As regards the community intervention teams, CITs, these are music to my ears.  General practitioners need to be involved in the community, providing more services, and community intervention teams are an ideal way of doing so.  The process is currently nurse driven.  I would like it to be led by general practitioners but this requires GP-led primary care.  In fairness, the Ireland east hospital group is looking at a process in Navan under which general practitioners would visit patients' homes as part of the community intervention team, put up the intravenous drips and monitor the patient with pneumonia over a weekend or whatever.  The GP would do the extra visits.  </p> <p>  As a general practitioner, I may see 40 people per day.  Yesterday, for example, I saw 46 people face to face, including two home visits and two visits to nursing homes.  If I receive a call in the middle of the day informing me that Johnny is very sick, I cannot make a home visit, even if his house is just down the street, because I do not have the capacity to be in two places at one time.  However, if a general practitioner led CIT service was available and I was aware that Johnny had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CPOD, and needed IV antibiotics, oxygen and so forth, I could call the CIT service because I would know the colleague in the service would be a doctor rather than a nurse.  While a nurse-led process is sometimes fine, in cases where clinical judgment is required, general practitioners must be involved.  This is where GP led primary care can drive change.</p> <p>  The funding must follow the patient.  The previous Minister often spoke of money following the patient.  The money should follow the patient through the community intervention team process because it makes sense.  General practitioners are trained and are like powerful thoroughbred horses.  However, we do a great deal of plough-sharing when we could do much more if we had more resources.  We want to do more and community intervention teams are an example of shifting care into the community to avoid people ending up in Professor Courtney's hospital or on trolleys in Beaumont or Our Lady of Lourdes hospitals.  We must keep frail elderly people out of hospital using new care pathways.  However, new care pathways cannot be agreed if there is no contact.  I am taken by Deputy Harty's comment that he does not have a pathway for discussing clinical issues with his colleagues in Ennis, Limerick or Clare.  It is for this reason that we need this type of process for engagement. </p> <p>  Deputy Naughten asked what evidence is available on our pathway in respect of admissions.  We opened an acute surgical assessment unit, ASU, two years ago.  The liaison committee discussed this issue in great detail over a number of years and we were pushing for such a unit.  Within one year, the number of admissions for acute surgery declined from 4,500 to 2,500 because a senior decision maker in the community, namely, the general practitioner, now refers directly to a senior decision maker in the hospital, namely, the surgeon, and the patient is seen within one hour.  If, for example, a patient has a problem with his or her appendix, he or she is seen by the surgeon and either admitted, operated and sent home or, where the case is not acute, he or she will be seen and sent home on the day.  This process reduced the number of admissions by 2,000 in one year.  It creates the efficiencies that would generate funding to drive the process of extending other services into primary care.  If we make funding savings through this process, they should be reinvested in primary care to drive another project or to scale a project.  If, for example, we have a successful community intervention team project, it should scale to Deputy Harty's patients as well.</p></speech>

When we meet, we leave our weapons outside, as it were, and talk about absolutely everything.  We totally respect and value our general practitioner colleagues who are completely disrespected and ignored in many parts of the country.  I see medical students who will present a case to me in the outpatients department without referring to the general practitioner by name or even to the letter the GP has written.  I pull them up on that.  There is a culture in place whereby medics do not know what the GP does and do not view it as important in any case.</p></speech>

The acute hospital system is completely outdated.  It was designed perfectly for a very small number of hospital consultants.  When I went to Kilkenny Hospital, there were two physicians, no paediatricians and one radiologist.  These are ridiculously low numbers and a system had to be built around the consultants because there were so few of them.  The hospital now has 11 physicians, four radiologists and six paediatricians.  There has been a major investment in the hospital system and taxpayers have stumped up for many improvements.  Once a patient is inside the front door and before he or she reaches discharge, the Irish hospital system is extremely good.  It does some things terribly badly, however, for example, management of chronic diseases, which should be dealt with by general practitioners in the community.  People with chronic diseases should not even get into hospital and instead should be dealt with and paid for by GPs.</p> <p>  We were asked a specific question.  The Health Service Executive has funded diabetes nurse specialists who work between the hospital and community.  It also funded chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, nurse specialists, heart failure nurse specialists and physiotherapists to run pulmonary rehabilitation clinics.  General practitioners have access to this service and we have opened the hospital to GP referral for echocardiography, certain extensive tests known as BNPs or B natriuretic peptide tests and all of them have full access to ultrasound.</p> <p>  Cultural change is needed and it must involve transferring a substantial amount of work to general practice.  This must also be paid for.  What hospitals should do in future is the high-tech work such as kidney transplants, an area in which this country is world-beating, technological medicine and the 5% of chronic disease that general practitioners cannot manage on their own.  I would love to get to that position in two years.  In that respect, God bless the Deputy's optimism but it took us a long time.</p></speech>

To respond to the question on how we will manage change, we must involve everybody and everybody must be at the table.  This means creating the table and resourcing it.  We have done this <i>pro bono</i>for years but if it is to scale nationally, the State must invest in integrated care and integrated care committees.  The amount of money required is very small but it would deliver significant change.  This is a strategic issue which the committee could recognise.<br/><br/>As regards rolling out local integrated care committees, LICCs, nationally, this could be done very quickly.  It should be recalled that LICCs have the support of the Irish College of General Practitioners, the primary care division and one of the hospital groups and there is no reason they could not expand further.  What is needed is a decisive political push and a small amount of resources.  I believe the LICC process could be fully engaged within 18 months and two years at the outside.  There is no reason we could not achieve that.  I speak to general practitioners the length and breadth of the country and they want to engage almost to a man or woman.  <br/><br/>As Deputy Harty correctly stated, people want a forum to engage with their consultant colleagues.  They do not regard their colleagues or management as enemies.  However, they do not have any mechanism for engaging, which leads to frustration and arguments.  We no longer fight, although we disagree and have robust disagreements, including last night when we disagreed on communication.  However, we left the meeting as colleagues and friends, having thought about how we will fix the matter.  The issue is one of culture but one also needs a structure.  The 25 people in the room last night were disenfranchised medics from across counties Carlow and Kilkenny who are not getting anything done and are becoming peed off with everybody.  The State must invest in this process.</p></speech>

I was at a talk by Mr. Paul Grundy at the weekend on the issue.  The key is resources and to move the food.  How does one handle stray cats?  The answer is one moves the food.  One has to incentivise consultations that are complex in primary care and general practice.  One must incentivise activity, outcomes and quality.  One must move the food.  The Oireachtas health committee could lay down a marker new thinking and ascertaining how to change.</p> <p>  How do we get a group of people together?  There is nothing like sitting down at a committee meeting and listening to people.  That is what we do and what an LICC process would do.  One brings ideas, enthusiasm and passion to the table, thus effecting change.  It is called peer pressure and seeing the "light of day".  It is also driven by data.  When we attend these meetings, the hospital manager may have figures and the consultants are present to state the length of the waiting list.  That is how it happens.  It is a very powerful process and as simple as soap.  There is no magic to it.</p></speech>

In the past three years there has been an increase of approximately 30% in emergency department attendances.  The famous day on which we had 27 beds in the corridor was in 1999.  I actually felt we were losing control of the hospital.  We went to the Lord Bagenal Inn in Leighlinbridge and met many general practitioners and agreed with them that they should give up their direct admission rights to beds in the corridor and that we should set up the acute medical assessment unit.  For the following six or seven years, we abolished all beds in the corridor.  That was wonderful, but then the recession hit and we closed 40 beds in the hospital.  There was a reduction in the number of beds from 300 to 260.  We closed 80 beds in the community.  Therefore, we took 120 beds out of the system at the same time as we were ramping up services for care of the elderly, chronic disease care services, etc.  An acute ward floor has been opened and it has exposed a little of what one might call health tourism.  In Nenagh hospital, in the Deputy's area, we are seeing patients from Borrisoleigh, Templemore and Templetuohy, which is unusual.  We are seeing patients from Ballylinan, Abbeyleix and Durrow and also from places down towards Clonmel and up towards Portlaoise.  We are exposing a capacity problem, but the way to deal with it is to ensure one cannot say "capacity problem" without having data to back it up.  I do not like to hear people saying we need 200 beds.  Rather, I want them to give evidence that we need beds for stroke or stroke rehabilitation patients, but they will be provided in the community.  I want them to give evidence that we really are short of intensive care unit beds and probably need some, or that we need beds in the acute medical assessment unit.  However, to make a blanket statement that we need beds is not sufficient.  It costs &euro;500,000 to provide a bed and the necessary staff.  I believe between 500 and 1,000 beds have been provided with the necessary staff in acute hospitals with patients that general practitioners should be looking after in the community.  It would take ten years to provide 1,000 beds and we do not have the money to provide them in any case.  If we did, we would not have the necessary staff.  Why not discharge between 500 and 1,000 patients to general practitioners who are very willing and able to look after them?  We should fill the freed-up beds with patients who are being treated in the corridor on trolleys.</p></speech>

In America the health budget has gone crazy.  For the past 100 years the health authorities have been focusing on hospitals and very little on primary care services.  They are, however, beginning to move back because they see the value of primary care services.  In Ireland we have a trusted cohort of health practitioners called general practitioners who are the most trusted group.  We literally provide care from the womb to the tomb.  We mind the front and back doors of every acute hospital in the country and could do so even better if we had a little more help.  There are 22 million face-to-face consultations each year on 3% of the budget.  If we had more of the budget and if it were delivered in a meaningful way and directed towards projects that made sense such as the community intervention team project and having an enhanced primary care team, there would be a real benefit.  Primary care teams are not working and primary care centres are largely empty.  It is a pity, but there has been no engagement between clinicians, primary care teams and others for a number of years, as the Deputy knows.  In a heartbeat that could change.  We need to focus on primary care teams and primary care centres, but the model needs clinical leadership.  There has been an absence of clinical leadership in the primary care model as constructed.  Leadership requires some resources, support and assistance.  Having GP-led primary care services is the future of the health service.  A health service that does not have general practitioners at its heart will not succeed.</p></speech>

We really do need a GP contract as a matter of urgency to ensure clarity.  What I am talking about is a GP-led team of fellow professionals who share the task of providing care in a meaningful way over time.  If I wanted to open a new stroke unit in St. Luke's hospital in the morning - we have one and it is probably one of the best in the country - I would go to one of the senior clinicians to ask how I should proceed.  I would then bring in the manager and, using the evidence and funds available, ask what we could do.  I would then do what I could.  There has been no such enthusiasm in the area of primary care.  We are the experts on what the clinical pathways should be.  Where there are not enough clinical pathways, we can discuss the approach to take with our colleagues as part of a bigger team.</p> <p>  Having GP-led primary care services is not just about the clinical pathways but also about the care pathways.  It is about joined-up thinking.  If we were to develop a health service in the morning, would we pick an airline model?  I would because everybody would be equal.  If one piece of the puzzle were to fall, the whole thing would fall down.  The pilot is not the most important person in the airline; the passenger is.  We really need to focus on the patient's journey.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of being welcomed by them in Carlow&ndash;Kilkenny a few months ago and was very impressed.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to a few issues, including the structure of the HSE, the regional health organisations and the separate social and mental health care services.  In Carlow&ndash;Kilkenny has this issue been addressed in the model?  Do the delegates have a mechanism by which those involved on the social care side, in psychiatry and mental health services feed into their system?  Has their model addressed what I would regard as the lack of integration within the structural part of the HSE?</p> <p>  My next point follows on from the discussion with the previous delegation.  In the experience of the delegates, do they compete with the acute services in the hospital in terms of access to diagnostics in Carlow&ndash;Kilkenny?  Are they fighting for space and, if so, how does it work out for them?  Have they suggestions as to how to improve the position in this regard?</p> <p>  In the previous session we spoke about the deprivation index.  When the delegates are following the care pathway for a patient through this system, are there loss leaders, a term used in retail?  Are there patients with very complex conditions who follow the same pathway as others but whose care is not being funded adequately?  Is this at the expense of somebody else?  How are the cases of patients who require particularly complex care managed?  Does it work out in Carlow-Kilkenny?</p> <p>  On the social and mental health care aspect of the health service, do the delegates have very good relationships with public health nurses?  Is there a maternity service in Carlow-Kilkenny?</p><p>I presume that is the case.  How do maternity services work there when it comes to public health nurses dealing with a woman once she has had her child?  Does it have a domino scheme similar to the one at Holles Street where maternity care is midwife-led?</p><p> Reference was made to GP-led primary care.  Why would it only be GPs?  Do the witnesses mean GPs being at the head of it and somewhere below that community pharmacists and others being involved?  How do they envisage community pharmacists, public health nurses and people working in the community fitting into the structure?  I know that the approach is completely fragmented and that a great deal of time is spent on the telephone to people.  There is also the issue of the errors that can occur during a telephone call and the number of fax messages that are sent.  People in other organisations do not use fax machines as much as doctors, pharmacists and agency personnel.  They laugh when one mentions a fax.  How do we get around the cultural issues that were referenced?  How do we make everybody in the system feel important, loved and appreciated?</p></speech>

I know the eye cannot behold itself but, from a reflective perspective, do they envisage any particular difficulties in an urban environment that they would not see, for example, in Carlow-Kilkenny and, if so, how could we address those?

Reference was made to the 5% of patients who require chronic disease management that GPs cannot offer and who would ideally be managed in a hospital with high-tech equipment where complex work is performed.  Do the witnesses know or are data available on the level of chronic disease management taking place inappropriately, as they might say but possibly because there is no other choice, in the acute hospital setting that could be taking place in the community?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the use of diagnostics in the community.  A group appeared before the committee just prior to our guests and its members informed us that they had diagnostics - specifically radiography - in the community and that the machines were not used.  There was not sufficient critical mass to facilitate them being brought into use.  I am not referring to the massive machines but to what extent could some diagnostics be carried out in the community, thereby avoiding the need for people to go to hospital?  I would like to hear about the witnesses' experience.  I was disappointed to learn that the machine that in the community setting was not being used.  The delay in accessing diagnostics results is a particular problem and it is one that has been raised with us.  I would have assumed the easy solution would be to locate diagnostics equipment in a community setting thereby removing it from the over-involved systems in hospitals.  The latter could then focus on carrying out the more high-tech work.  I would just be interested to hear our guests' views on that.</p></speech>

On the diagnostics issue, if we centralise diagnostics in a primary care centre and very few GPs have access to it, the pathway will shut down and it will not get traction.  We have proposed that existing primary care centres and the new 80 or so that are being built should become primary care resource centres.  Such a centre might not necessarily have a GP in the room or in the building but all GPs in the relevant area would refer their ultrasounds, echoes, etc., through that centre, thereby creating traction.  Believe me, the machine at the centre in question would then be used.  Why would I send my patients to Professor Courtney for an ultrasound when I can get it done quicker at a primary care resource centre down the road?  Probably the same radiologist would read it because we will have to enter into contracted arrangements for high-quality radiology services with the relevant professionals.  This is what is known as joined-up thinking.  Having primary care resources centres is a way of maximising usage of primary care centres.</p> <p>  There will always be that 5% of patients requiring chronic disease management.  I do not generally look after insulin-dependent diabetics because they need something more than me.  In Carlow-Kilkenny we fit more pumps for children than anywhere else nationally.  We have no waiting list for new diabetics in Carlow-Kilkenny because the service is run by clinical nurse specialists in co-operation with the GPs.  If I need a person who has been newly diagnosed with diabetes to see a consultant, that will happen.  If we put the care and resources in the right place, we will free up the hospitals.</p></speech>

I do not have an estimate for that.  We have a  very forward-looking endocrinologist in our hospital who looks outside the hospital and almost all diabetic care is delivered in the community, so that is close to the 5% figure that was mentioned.  He only sees new diabetics, GPs follow up on them and we have diabetic nurses that work across the hospital and the community.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, is the next biggest disaster for the health service and we are managing patients with that condition with nurses employed by the hospital who work in the community.  I would love to provide pulmonary rehabilitation in the community but because we do not have the space, we do that in the hospital.  Hospital doctors do not see those patients, they are seen by a physiotherapist and a nurse.  We treat patients with heart failure through virtual care in a linkage between GPs and Professor Ken McDonald at St. Vincent's Hospital.  Kilkenny is a bad example to use in this respect because we push the care of all those chronic disease cases out into the community.  If I had to guess - and it is a guess - we probably treat 75% of cases in the community, which is fantastic.  The figure for the remainder of the country might be 50% or less.</p> <p>  I will tell the committee something that I find maddening.  GPs in our hospital are allowed total access to blood tests, BNP tests, and ultrasound results.  At our meeting last night we discussed the inclusion of echoes.  The HSE is catching on and it will now allow GPs to purchase ultrasounds and they will pay for them.  However, our hospital has been bearing that cost.  We are delighted about this.  We have done a study and it shows that a GP who has been qualified for 20 years knows more about ordering an ultrasound than a junior doctor who has only been qualified for 20 months.  There is a perverse incentive there.  The hospitals that do not allow GPs ultrasound access will be paid for that and my hospital, which has been allowing GPs such access for years, does not get paid.  That is annoying.</p></speech>

What unifies them is the Irish College of General Practitioners and it has faculties.  If we aligned the faculties with the hospitals, there would be a link.  It is about connections.  There is a solution but each area would be different.  Our model might not translate fully to Wexford, Mullingar or Clare but parts of it will.  It is the principle of the contact.  Every area is different and they will come up with different solutions but this is the way forward.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Connell for her  questions.  She asked about mental health, social care and psychiatry and we have that group at the table.  They come to our liaison meeting.  They attended the meeting last night.  We have big issues with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  That group has also come to the table.  It is more difficult to get those involved in providing those services to continue with the process.  They have not continued with the process as fully as the other groups.  Our strength is that everybody is at the table and if we need to bring somebody else in they will oblige.  It is like this  committee.  If the Chairman invites somebody to attend, he or she will probably come because he or she will want to know what is happening.</p><p>Everybody is at the table.  We are competing as regards access to diagnostics.  We had a discussion about echoes last night.  We want more echoes to be done at St. Luke's.  Professor Courtney is running an excellent and huge oncology service at a new centre in St. Luke's.  Cancer patients who are on certain treatments need seven echoes.  Elderly and frail patients will die if they do not get the right medicine.  They need echoes if they are to get the right medicine.  We have had a number of robust discussions.  It is not that there is not a willingness - it is that the resources are not available in the hospital system to give us what we need in the community.  That is why we need to shift to more GP-led primary care.  My colleague., Professor Courtney, might answer the question about complex patients.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell was talking about magnet hospitals.  I love that phrase, which is used in the US.  Many hospitals in the US are closing because of chronic care.  Dr. Fawsitt has mentioned the disaster in terms of funding.  Some hospitals in the US have said "We are not in the diabetes business any more" and used that as a means of getting rid of diabetes patients, many of whom are black and poor, are losing their legs and are in need of dialysis or surgery.  Patients can become costly when they are badly managed at the beginning.  We need to stop those patients becoming complex in the first instance.  This must involve GPs treating them correctly.</p> <p>  Junior doctors love working and training with the very small number of complex patients who present at our hospital.  We have a three-year waiting list for specialist registrars to come to our hospital.  We have low number of locums.  By taking on complex patients and moving chronic care to the community, we attract many junior doctors and we spend less on locums.  Complex care is quite expensive, but a hospital that does not offer complex care is not an acute hospital.  We have to do it.  We think we have achieved good outcomes.  We need to go to outcome-based management and activity-based funding.  We are saving a great deal of money.</p> <p>  I am very interested in the concept of magnet hospitals.  A study in America examined why hospitals were closing.  It was found that people were not coming to work in certain hospitals even though they were being offered 20 types of flavoured ice cream, running tracks on the roof and free access to health gyms.  The simplest outcome of the study was that doctors and nurses want to work in hospitals where they feel valued and are allowed to do their jobs.  People do not feel valued in our hospital system at present.  We cannot get at the patients to do our jobs because of the chaos at the front door of emergency departments, as Dr. Fawsitt has put it.  At Beaumont Hospital, there might be five trolleys bounced up against each other and a guy against the wall who is not being seen.  Nobody wants to work in such a system.  Nurses and doctors are fleeing the country.</p> <p>  The acute floor would work in an urban environment as well.  The deprivation index, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, is much higher in Limerick and north Dublin than in Carlow-Kilkenny.  There is no denying that there is a relatively affluent population in Carlow-Kilkenny.  Two thirds of the people in Carlow-Kilkenny live in rural areas.  Kilkenny is quite a small urban area.  The way we get around the urban-rural split is that all the GPs come to the local integration committee.  I would say we have a disproportionate representation of rural GPs because they want to get into Kilkenny to talk to the hospitals.  That answers the question about the attractiveness of complex care.</p> <p>  We do not have a domino service.  We would like a domino service.  I think that is the future.  Women who are delivering should be allowed to deliver in line with the Holles Street domino model, which is very good.  We do not have that model.  I would like to have it.  Not having it is a big gap in our system.</p></speech>

We are changing the culture slowly.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell also asked about community pharmacists.  Community pharmacists keep me out of the High Court day and night.  I get many phone calls, but I will always take calls from community pharmacists because I value them.  We need to improve our links with community pharmacists and work with them.  We need to stop treating them as enemies.  They are our colleagues and they help us.  Last year, we started to involve them in a liaison process.  We have not continued that to the extent that we would like.  From that process, we developed in the hospital a medicines management process involving community pharmacists, hospital pharmacists and GPs, with the aim of improving the quality of discharge prescribing.  We got funding from the Ireland East Hospitals Group.  We evaluated that process after a year.</p> <p>  HIQA now sets standards of care for hospital prescribing, discharge prescribing and complex care.  In a single year, we went from meeting 40% of HIQA's targets to meeting 100% of its targets.  We believe the quality of this expensive and costly process keeps readmissions down.  We cannot prove that yet because we have just started the process.  We are working with community pharmacists, hospitals and GPs to improve the process as we go along.  I would love to see the day when community pharmacists will be involved in the local integrated care committee process.  That day should not be too far off.  It will take time for this to happen, but it should not take too much time because it is sensible.</p></speech>

Many issues have been raised today and questions on them have been answered.  Given that the model being developed and expanded by Dr. Fawsitt and Professor Courtney and their colleagues is successful - I refer to integrated systems, streaming of patients and patient flow, management in the communities and good links between GPs, hospitals and other allied health professionals - it is amazing that it has not caught on across the rest of the health service.  I suppose we should try to see where this successful model can be used.  Most people have referred to it in various committees over the years, before we ever decided to have a ten-year health strategy.  It has been held up as a flagship, but flagships should be beacons and we should all be trying to get where we are.</p> <p>  What is the nature of the institutional resistance at management and professional levels?  I assume there is resistance within the various clinical professions that are there.  What walls were put in front of Dr. Fawsitt and Professor Courtney, or between them, at the embryonic stages of the development of this model?  Are those walls still present in the broader health system?  What can we do to ensure we try to break them down?  Even though we aspire in our primary care strategy and our individual deliberations to everything Dr. Fawsitt and Professor Courtney have said here today, we continually seem to be shovelling money into acute hospital settings as part of a fire brigade-type effort, while at the same time squeezing the life out of primary care to make sure more people end up in the acute hospital setting.  The eternal cycle goes on.  I would like the witnesses to expand on the institutional issues.</p> <p>  The GP contract is coming up for negotiation.  Reference has been made to chronic disease and illness.  It has been suggested that diabetes should be managed in home care and in the community base.  Similarly, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and many other chronic diseases and illnesses could be managed in the community.  I sometimes wonder whether we use our nurses and nurse specialists effectively across the health services.  Do the witnesses think enough emphasis is placed on nurse-led programmes in the community under the guise of the GPs in that area?</p> <p>  We have raised the issue of diagnostics on numerous occasions.  Every GP tells us that access to diagnostics is a problem.  Dr. Fawsitt and Professor Courtney said in their submission that access to diagnostics should be independent of hospitals.  If we did not organise the system in that way, the emergency departments of hospitals would be full of people who come through the front door.  That setting always takes precedence in terms of capacity.  What do the witnesses mean when they say that diagnostics should be independent of hospitals?  Do they mean that they should be physically independent, or that they should be based in regional primary care or urgent care centres?  What do they mean when they use the word "independent" in this context?  Who would be managing them?</p></speech>

I will be interested to hear the witnesses' response to the points raised by Deputy Kelleher.  It is obvious that there had to be a change in culture.  Dr. Fawsitt spoke about moving the food to deal with stray cats.  Smokers can try and try again to give up cigarettes, but that will not happen until something clicks in their heads and they realise it is time to stop.  When that happens, it is easier to quit than people might think.  I hope those present understand the point I am making.  Why has this thinking not spread to other regional hospital areas?  Why are people not thinking about how to adapt something that actually works to their own communities?  I think this could be the biggest issue we face as a committee.  If we are to recommend that this type of model should be used, we will have to look at how we develop it.</p><p>There is a point about reinvestment in that it will not go into a black hole, but how do we put protocols in place to ensure that will happen?  The matter must be discussed with the Health Service Executive and the integrated care committees.</p><p> I live on the north side of Dublin and the father of my GP assisted my mother in giving birth to all of us at home.  That man's son took over the GP practice and knows all of the family inside out.  He knows our history and whether we are sporty or were healthy when we were young.  It makes sense that experience feeds in for people who are chronically ill and need assistance.  When an ill person presents at a hospital, he or she is very much dealt with as is; he or she will be put into an acute bed or face surgery.  As Deputy John Brassil stated, the model we are discussing could be key in addressing the longer term ten or 15-year strategy for hospitals.  I support it and wish to examine it in further detail.</p><p> Dr. Fawsitt has stated 28% of GPs are over the age of 60 years, while 33% are over 55.  Within five or ten years we will lose a significant number of experienced GPs.  That again raises the question we discussed at the last meeting of how we keep the GPs that are being trained in the system.  That will be crucial.  We should recommend that this be done with GPs, nurses and other doctors.</p></speech>

With geriatricians, they are probably the last of the generalists practising medicine in Ireland because as it has developed, it has become overspecialised.  There are nephrologists, neurologists, respiratory physicians, diabeticians and endocrinologists and they all look at what is happening in their own fields.  A person with several diseases will go to this or that clinic, but we are left to decipher what has happened in all clinics.  Quite often we say to patients not to have a prescription filled until they see us first, as the drugs prescribed by a particular consultant may not be compatible with the others being used by them.  Continuity of care and being a generalist are extremely important in general practice which we must preserve and develop.</p> <p>  The service in Kilkenny is an exception, but in the other hospital groups we are losing the connection between the GP and the hospital, which is so vital.  I once asked an endocrinologist at a meeting why he kept bringing back all of the well controlled diabetics every six months as I did not see the point.  He argued that diabetes was a lifelong condition and that the people in question could not be discharged.  That is the mindset we must try to break down.  As a hospital doctor, the easiest thing to do is what everybody else did in the past, with the result that the process becomes self-perpetuating.  We need to get hospital consultants to look up to see what is happening, as what is happening cannot work.  Deputy Billy Kelleher asked the question, but I am very interested in the answer.  Where is the resistance when it is crystal clear that what is happening is not working?</p></speech>

Woodrow Wilson said that if one wished to make enemies, one should try changing something.  I have written down the term "overspecialism".  We have the best doctors in the world.  For example, renal doctors want to provide the best care for their kidney patients, while diabetes doctors want to provide the best care for patients with diabetes.  However, they do not talk to each other such that if a patient gets something, it is off that doctor's plate.  There is incredible competition among overspecialists.</p> <p>  To be fair, I am the lead in the acute medicine programme and there are 33 acute hospitals in the State, 32 of which have acute medical assessment units.  The 33rd in Portlaoise is due to open.  We had a communication the other day about a local hospital that was withdrawing care services.  I will deal with that matter.  Acute medicine and the generalism the committee wants are hard and risky because doctors forget their training.  They can be very busy and work very hard, as do GPs.  Even if a consultant wants to meet and talk to GPs and do what is best for the patient, the nurses must also be involved, with the physiotherapists and the manager.  There are unions everywhere.</p> <p>  Some time ago we were brought to Farmleigh when Mary Harney was Minister for Health and Children.  We met the leaders of the unions, including Mr. David Begg, Mr. Peter McLoone and Mr. Liam Doran, and told them what we wanted to do.  The manager was present, with Dr. Fawsitt and the director of nursing, and everybody listened very carefully.  However, the leaders told us that we were living in a bubble in Carlow-Kilkenny and that they would not disrupt it as it was working grand.  They said there were too many moving pieces to be linked.  This is where I think the GP local integrated care committee works.  It is the only time a nephrologist, a diabetes doctor and a lung, heart and liver doctor might sit down together.  There is the realisation that if we do not work together, we are just fighting with each other.  I have noticed that at a medical board meeting the consultants may be aggressive or even a little rude to each other.  GP meetings can be similar.  However, when everybody is put into a room, the participants are much more polite and try to see things from the other person's point of view.  It is a big deal to roll back specialism which is destroying medicine in the United States.  I agree that geriatricians and GPs are of the pure specialist model.  I am not a gastroenterologist; I am a general physician with a special interest in gastroenterology.  I must engage in gastroenterology for outpatients, but the needs of my inpatients relate more to general medicine and it can be incredibly difficult.</p> <p>  Why would the old funding model change?  The hospitals used to get X amount and X plus 5% the following year, regardless of change.  I want to see activity-based funding, meaning that if there is change, there will be extra beds provided, if required.  If there is no change, there will be no extra beds provided.  To be fair to the HSE, it is introducing an activity-based funding model, although I would rather if it were an outcome-based funding moel.  In any case, activity-based funding model is good.  Chief executive officers are not interested unless we hit them in the pocket.  If they realise that if they change the system and discharge diabetes patients to GPs, for example, they can shorten the time for new patients and be rewarded.  This is related to a new-to-return ratio and if it is greater than two, the hospitals will be penalised.  The Legislature could help as legislation would be needed at some stage to push people to change, which is very difficult.</p></speech>

There is a need to change what is broken.  Deputy Michael Harty is absolutely correct.  He has nailed it in that the health service is broken and in a perilous place.  We need to provide for continuity of care, of which general practice is the only provider.  There are enablers that will allow greater GP participation, particularly in urban areas.  We have discussed them with the primary care directorate.  It will require a small amount of funding, but there is a willingness to do it.  Unless the State supports this, we will stay in the bubble for another ten years when we will be back before the committee.</p> <p>  It is absolutely vital that we get the GP contract right.  It is the future for my kids and grandkids.  We have not had a model for a new health system in 44 years.  Legislators should remember the year 1948, after Britain had been destroyed in two world wars and when it was bankrupt, but it still had the vision and political determination to put money into the National Health Service which no Briton would give up today.</p> <p>  The question was asked whether the GP or the team had priority.</p><p>It is a team, a multidisciplinary team.  The GP is not above that.  It is a team and everybody is equal.  That is the Carlow-Kilkenny model.  We need a more team-based approach in the community, but led by the GP who will be ultimately accountable for that care.</p><p> As regards where the diagnostics should go and whether they should be physically independent, I believe they should be.  Hospitals should be doing specialist, high-tech work.  I do not believe that we should be sending them low acuity stuff in diagnostics.  We should be doing this in primary care resource centres.  The new 80 primary care centres that are to be built in Ireland in the next two years should become resource centres for investigations and service hubs for physiotherapists, OT, IT and so forth.  Counselling, something so simple and vital in mental health, should be provided in a primary care resource centre.  All GPs in County Clare or County Kilkenny should have one or two of those resource centres where that is recognised.  It is not a parallel structure because, in a way, those patients never get to the hospital.  They will be treated and cared for much more cheaply in a primary care resource centre than in a hospital.</p><p> There are 80 sites coming on stream and this is a wonderful opportunity to get this right, but we must consult with our local GPs.  If a local GP has spent &euro;250,000 on a new premises, without tax relief or the like, why would they move to a primary care centre?  It might look wonderful, but it makes no sense.  One must work with the GPs on the ground.  If they are not willing to move into a centre, that is fine.  Let us work with the centres in a different way.  However, they must become service and resource centres.  That is the value and that is what keeps people at home.</p></speech>

When one says NIH to doctors, that means National Institutes of Health Bethesda in the United States, a wonderful research centre.  However, in some parts of this country it means "not invented here", so if one has not invented it in that hospital, people are not interested.  One must be very clever about it and make them think they thought of that idea in the first place, and they will do it.  However, there is some resistance to change.  Institutional rivalries come into this, as do professional rivalries.  However, it is the patient who suffers at the end of the day.</p></speech>

That is a worry and we must address it.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is in a position where, with correct funding, it could take on more training to get us over this bump.  We need our specialist generalist, who is the GP, in the community to mind patients.  It is about care and continuous care.  We must bite the bullet on that.  We must keep our graduates here and if we do not have enough, we must train more for the time being.  We must make Ireland attractive for our graduates.  We must make it connected and join up the dots in health care.  In our process we get 25 people to come into a room every month.  It is no problem.  They want to be there because they want to be involved in how we move forward.</p></speech>

How does one deal with an issue where it makes absolute sense from a patient's and a financial point of view to move a service out?  A key decision must be taken by the hospital whereby it says it is prepared to give somebody X amount of money to do something in the community.  Presumably, it is very hard to get hospitals to do that, because there are turf wars taking place.  You are dealing with the community and St. Luke's.  It is further complicated, obviously, in situations where there is the community, a HSE hospital and a voluntary hospital, which is another kettle of fish.  At present, they appear to be getting the co-operation on a voluntary basis but with regard to rolling out this type of model nationally, presumably there would have to be clear decision making in terms of top slicing funding that currently goes to hospitals and switching that into the community.  How is that addressed?</p></speech>

At present, we have done it all for free.  We met the GPs and said: "You are just admitting patients to hospital corridors.  They are not really being well looked after.  Will you give up that right and send them into an acute medical assessment unit?"  They bought into that.  It is more work for GPs and they did it for free.  All of the diabetic patients are not seen in our hospital.  The GPs see them for free.  However, what did they get for that?  One must give something and take something.  They get a one week waiting list for a new diabetic.  That is unheard of.  As our diabetes doctors and nurses are not looking after all of those patients who are perfectly well managed in the community, totally stable and whom it is ridiculous to see in an acute hospital, we are able to see the acute ones.  Why do we give them BNP, brain natriuretic peptide, tests?  The hospital pays for the BNPs the GPs order, which is very expensive.  Nobody else does that.  However, if the BNP is high, we know that heart failure is developing.  Dr. Fawsitt will write a letter saying he wants an echo.  The echo is done and we do that for free.  However, then he treats the patient.  He does not admit the patient.  Admitting the patients costs the earth.</p></speech>

I believe GPs are able for it and want to do it.  Why should they not order tests and get tests for the patient?  It gives them a greater esteem and respect.  They are senior decision makers.  When they say they want the patient seen in the emergency department, it happens immediately.  We do that.  It is the way hospitals work together.  I run a liver unit.  Not many hospitals outside of the massive Dublin hospitals run liver units, but because I do that and take a great deal of work away from Dublin, when I want Dublin to see a very sick liver patient, it sees them immediately.  There is a respect.</p> <p>  It will not roll out unless there is funding behind it.  That is why I believe legislation is incredibly important.  Deputies are the representatives of the people.  They absolutely should not abrogate health.  I like the idea of not having a situation where health keeps changing when a new Minister takes office.  I love the idea of having an all-party consensus.  Ultimately, the people who stand for election are the Deputies and they must say that they agree on the direction of health and that they agree it is in GP-led primary care.  What is in it for the hospitals?  Hospitals will do acute care, which is highly complex work and gives us great satisfaction, and GPs will do the chronic care, which they should be paid for and from which they should get satisfaction.  However, I do not believe it will happen very quickly - I wish it would - unless there is legislation behind it.</p> <p>  How I see it is that we would run a service level agreement, SLA, for the voluntary hospitals.  The HSE will say that it must get the diabetic waiting list down to two weeks or whatever.  That is how it does it at present.  That is good.  However, it should also say, "By the way, you must have a GP-hospital local integrated care committee functioning.  We want to see the agenda, the minutes and the action points."  The chair of that committee in our hospital is Dr. Fawsitt and if one asked him to see those, he can produce them all.  There is a great deal of codology and pretend stuff, so one should write an SLA which states that there must be X number of scopes, Y number of gall bladder operations and whatever, and there must also be a local integrated committee.  One can legislate for that.</p></speech>

That is the way forward.  There was a question about what is in it for the hospitals and for the GPs.  We opened a new surgical assessment unit two years ago.  I have a two week waiting list now in my public clinics for a lump or bump to be removed or to see a surgeon.  We discussed this last night at our meeting.  What did we do to achieve that?  We said we would deal with the normal stuff in reports.  If a surgeon removes a lump and it is benign, he will send me the report and I will tell the patient or the patient will ring me.  They do not need to go back to the surgeon for a follow-up appointment, which is wasting the surgeon's and the patient's time.  We take it on.  Okay, it is <i>pro bono</i>.  In a new contract that must be valued and costed, because it is the right thing to do.  However, the value of such joined-up thinking, shared responsibility and shared care, where GPs are equal to the consultants, is that patients benefit.  I have a two week waiting list now for a query melanoma or a query cancer on the face.  The patient is seen by a surgeon within two weeks.  That is what is in it for us.</p></speech>

While it is fine to state activity will be switched to the community, unless the other allied health processionals - apart from GPs and practice nurses - are available and unless the primary care teams are adequately staffed, the care cannot happen in that setting.  In working with the HSE, what scope exists to switch budgets like that or to provide additional funding?</p></speech>

When one thinks about it, we had five divisions in the HSE and even the word itself shows one there is not much cross-talk.  Consequently, a cross-cutting concept is needed that makes the social division work with the primary care and acute hospital divisions.  They are all separate at present.  Coincidentally, a new structure has just been announced by the HSE that I do not fully understand.  However, we think it is good where the royal colleges, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE came together and developed the clinical care programmes.  While the Chairman is aware of the diabetes programme, there are 33 of them and no other country in the world has that.  That is the best care and is the plan of care for all patients.  While that has been done here in Ireland and is all written down, I believe we have lost focus on the clinical care programmes.  It is all written down for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, heart failure, diabetes, liver disease or anything.  There should be some cross-cutting ability stating that if the clinical care programme on obstructive lung disease indicates it should be managed in the community, it should be so managed.  Moreover, if one finds out that a hospital never discharges such patients to GPs, who incidentally are well able to look after them, that hospital should then not be funded.  I probably would pull back at the moment from penalising because if one penalises a hospital by withdrawing funding, it also hurts patients.  However, it should not receive additional funding.  The old model of having a problem in the winter, doing nothing about it and getting extra money must stop.</p></speech>

My memory is of having a row with the Government representatives but that is neither here nor there.  I have two brief questions, the first of which is on the unique patient identifier project which is under way.  Will it help, hinder or make much difference?  I hope it will help.  Second, the witnesses who appeared before the committee earlier discussed differences in patient-to-GP ratios.  Is the Carlow-Kilkenny region broadly representative of the country as a whole?  Do the witnesses know whether the ratio in that region is higher, lower or average?</p></speech>

We could follow patients and could see trends.  We have a different number for a patient who comes to us from Dublin for a holiday.  The simple answer is it would save money and would reduce delay and duplication.  It would be a brilliant idea and I hope it happens.</p></speech>

The electronic health record, EHR, is absolutely vital to an integrated, joined-up health system.  We are doing it on a human level, which also is necessary, but an EHR would make everything seamless and accountable and is the way to proceed.  While projects such as the national medical imaging system, NIMIS, Healthlink and so on are delivering, they must be extended.  All I wish to say to the Deputy is this model works.</p> <p>  We are a microcosm of Ireland nationally in terms of population, the percentages and so on.  As approximately 40% of our population - perhaps 50% now on foot of the introduction of the under-six scheme -have medical card entitlements, we are a highly representative group in respect of what can happen in the community.</p></speech>

We actually are on the critical list regarding GP numbers in the future.  While we get on with it, keep busy and are productive, this must be fixed.  We must encourage GPs to stay and perhaps we can get greater training and can encourage them to stay.  I attended an awards ceremony last week at which some junior trainees were being awarded a trainee prize and of those GP trainees at the table, half were planning to emigrate.  Consequently, this is a real issue.</p></speech>

Professor Garry Courtney spoke of value-based funding as opposed to activity-based funding.  We could perform many procedures in general practice but it might be a waste.  My personal view, which is shared by many GPs to whom I have spoken, is a role should be created for the Irish College of General Practitioners in these new contract discussions or negotiations in an advisory, if not an informative way.  While it may be limited by statute to negotiating, I suspect there would be a huge willingness for the college to engage in that process.  Were the invitation to come, I believe it would be warmly received.  Moreover, it would inform both sides.  The college has been around for a long time and it really is about care of patients and about standards and quality.  I believe that would be a game-changer.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Rory Geraghty and Ms Ciara Cahill.  We are especially delighted to be here as it is the first time since my appointment on 16 May that the charities regulator has appeared before a committee of the Oireachtas.  Prior to my current role, I worked as the deputy chief inspector of social services in HIQA, regulating designated centres for people with disabilities and older persons, a number of which receive some section 39 funding.</p> <p>  Over the past number of years, the actions of a small few people in a small few charitable organisations have undermined public trust and confidence in all charitable organisations.  Good people doing good work and who respect the law should be acknowledged and assisted, not tarred by the wrongdoing of others.  This is why I believe that targeted and proportionate regulation of the sector is essential.  By ensuring that charities are well regulated, my office can ensure the accountability of charitable organisations to donors, beneficiaries and the public.</p> <p>  I will speak a little about the public register.  A statutory requirement and strategic objective of the charities regulator is to ensure that the register of charities is complete and accurate as per the requirements set out in the Charities Act 2009.  All charitable organisations must be in compliance with the Charities Act 2009 or face losing their charitable status.  Currently, nearly 8,000 charitable organisations on the register were deemed to be registered for the purposes of the Act because immediately before the commencement of the register they had an entitlement to an exemption under section 207 or section 208 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Revenue Commissioners had issued each organisation with a number, commonly referred to as a CHY number.</p> <p>  The charities regulator is aware of 778 HSE-funded section 39 charitable organisations.  These organisations are deemed registered by virtue of holding a charitable tax exemption or CHY number on 16 October 2014.  At present, 530 are in compliance with the registration and reporting requirements under the Charities Act 2009.  Of those not in compliance, 13% have engaged and are coming into compliance; while 19% have not engaged.  If this remains the case, they will risk losing their charitable status.</p> <p>  I will also speak about working with other State bodies.  I hold the view that the sharing of information by relevant State bodies is key to ensuring charities are well regulated while also ensuring the reduction of regulatory and administrative burden on the charities.  Currently, it is possible that a section 39 organisation providing health services, for example, may be required to provide large amounts of information to the HSE to acquire funding, to the primary regulator of its services and also to the charities regulator.  It may also be a fact that all of these State bodies could hold relevant information, which, if appropriately passed to any of the other bodies, could facilitate better decision making and risk assessment.</p> <p>  The duty of the charity regulator is to ensure compliance with charity law.  If during this process we gain information that indicates non-compliance with the various health Acts, the Charities Act 2009 facilitates the sharing of this information with the relevant regulator.  We also take the view that this information would need to be shared with the primary funder or commissioner of the services on behalf of the State, which in this case is the HSE.</p> <p>  As a regulator, I hold the view that any organisation that procures services on behalf of the State has both a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that these services are delivered to the highest standards.  Public money is sacred and if there is any indication that there has been mismanagement or inappropriate spending, funding bodies must intervene and take the appropriate action.  It is the policy of my office to encourage funders, particularly State organisations like the HSE, to be vigilant and regularly risk assess organisations to which they are providing substantial amounts of money.  This is why staff in my office have met with representatives from the HSE to initiate a formal agreement and engage in ongoing discussions regarding the compliance of sections 38 and 39 bodies with the charities Acts.</p><p>In addition to meetings with the HSE, staff in my office have also met other State bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Companies Registration Office to develop and establish data sharing agreements.  All of these meetings were initiated by my office and organisation because of the principles and approach that we believe are required.  This process is ongoing and, when complete, these agreements should allow for a multi-agency approach to tackle any anomalies with registered charitable organisations, including fraud, poor corporate governance and financial mismanagement.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of raising concerns, a primary function of the regulator is to increase public trust and confidence in the management and administration of charities.  My experience to date points to the fact that while robust auditing, monitoring and governance checks are paramount, unsolicited information from staff and the public is one of the key mechanisms that enables regulators to point their attention to non-compliance and risk.  The public are our eyes and ears.  We rely on them to inform us of potential breaches of the law.  This is why, within two weeks of commencing as CEO on 16 May, I put in place a dedicated concerns e-mail address and phone line, both of which are monitored on a constant basis.  This is a direct line for the public to contact the regulator.  We protect the identity of the person who raises a concern with our office and by processing all of the information given to us in confidence.  Each concern raised goes through a risk assessment procedure that allows our staff to identify what action, if any, is necessary.  On some occasions this may involve handing material over to other law enforcement agencies.  In other cases, it might mean actively engaging with a particular charity to resolve issues around corporate governance.<br/><br/>Part 4 of the Charities Act 2009 commenced on 5 September.  It gives investigative and protective powers to the charities regulator and includes the capability to impose sanctions if a charity breaches certain obligations.  The introduction of Part 4 of the Act is a positive and welcome step for charity regulation in Ireland.  The powers it confers will allow us to take steps to ensure that charitable organisations are protected and well managed.  Where breaches of the Act are suspected, the regulator can now work proactively to prevent and counter mismanagement and protect charitable organisations.  These powers will be applied in a proportionate and fair manner, recognising that the majority of charities require support rather than enforcement.  I know that many of the Deputies and Senators present, and in general, have queries on the registration of certain charities in their constituencies.  We have established a dedicated e-mail address for Members of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I began my five-year term on 16 May 2016.  I see the lifetime of my appointment as a long-term commitment to regulating a challenging and quite congested sector.  I hope that throughout this challenge I will have the support and co-operation of all State bodies, especially those that fund charitable organisations with public moneys.  I thank the committee for listening and look forward to working with everyone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.879" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#B00300"><p>I wish Mr. Farrelly every success in his new role.  He was appointed on 16 May so he is only a short time in office.</p> <p>  As he stated, there is a very significant number of charities in the sector.  I am interested in the number of registered charities that receive HSE funding.  The HSE's annual report of 2015 states that 1,847 different groups receive &euro;100,000 or less and when one adds up all of the groups, over 2,300 organisations get funding.  As I read the details, I noticed that many of them appear to be charities.  The list can be found in the schedule of the HSE's annual report.  </p> <p>  Last year, the total funding provided by the HSE to the various organisations was &euro;3.72 billion, which amounts to 25% of the health budget.  In October 2013, I raised questions on this issue during a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children before the issue was taken over the Committee of Public Accounts.  I got a breakdown from the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the various categories.  The groups were as follows: in receipt of over &euro;100 million; in receipt of between &euro;50 million and &euro;100 million; in receipt of between &euro;10 million and &euro;50 million; in receipt of between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million; and in receipt of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1 million.  In 2013, some 442 groups received between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1 million and 131 groups received between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million.  Those statistics prove that a huge amount of money was paid out.  </p> <p>  Mr. Farrelly has identified that there are over 700 registered charitable organisations.  Does he feel that he has adequate resources and staff numbers to deal with the task?  It will be a slow process to get everyone on the register.  It would be unfair to expect the HSE to have the manpower to manage every aspect of 2,300 organisations.  It would also be incorrect for us to expect the charities regulator to inspect 2,300 organisations.  He has been in office for a few months.  Does he feel that he can deal with the matter and all of the issues that are arising?  Does he feel the Government should provide much more assistance to the authority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.880" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#B00400"><p>I am not convinced that the data is absolutely correct in triangulating across the sector about what is and is not a section 39 charity.  I am fairly confident that 778 of the registered charities are HSE-funded section 39 organisations.  Let us remember that health and social services is quite a diverse area and thousands of not-for-profit entities receive funding.  For example, sports bodies and different entities are excluded and are not charities.  I am fairly sure that there are 778 registered charities at the moment.  Some of the rest of the group that receive HSE funding may be charities but we would have to establish that detail.</p> <p>  When the register moved from Revenue, many entitles were deemed registered and granted a CHY number.  We are working on reconciling that information and any anomalies in the register.  Section 39 funding can help us to triangulate information.  When I arrived in May, I found that the information, on those deemed registered, was not as robust as I would have liked it to be and we carried out a few exercises.  When we profiled 1,000 companies, we found that 60% of them were intact and active but 20% were no longer companies and were dormant.  Even though the latter were on the register, they did not exist in reality.  That stems from the fact that originally charities were looked at through a tax lens and trust was given if one did not breach it, but now we have the Charities Regulatory Authority.  One of my first tasks as CEO is to have a proper intact register that identifies the registered charitable organisations and, thus, people can have confidence in the data and approach.  Critical to having such a register is working with other State bodies, including the HSE. </p> <p>  In terms of resources, when I started on 16 May my authority employed 16 staff but now we have 27 whole-time equivalent staff.  The authority is being totally reviewed in terms of the human and financial resources needed to implement the Charities Act.  I do not believe in big over-sized organisations.  My sense of it is that the authority would probably need to have between 49 and 50 staff.  I also want to recruit the right people with the right competencies.  We are putting in place an IT system.  Of critical importance will be the data that we collect.  We will share data with other regulators and bodies in order that the appropriate law is applied.  I am happy enough how things are going on the resources front and I envisage that we have reached halfway.</p></speech>

As he said in his statement, it is about ensuring that the public trust the charitable sector and that moneys go to where they are meant to go.  In that context, there have been some high profile cases that have done a lot of damage to the charity sector.</p><p>It undermines the confidence of the public in the street donations to charities that are doing exceptional work, because there are questions and doubt in people's minds when they see high profile cases such as that of Console and others.  From that point of view, when the Charities Regulatory Authority is assessing whether an organisation complies with the Charities Act, does it carry out a forensic analysis of its operation or, in the case of section 39 organisations, does it depend on the HSE to carry out that analysis and then report to the authority?  How does the authority do it?</p><p> In that context, governance is very important.  To be honest, many charities involve volunteers coming together for good causes and they might not have the required capacity or skillsets.  Does the authority envisage itself being proactive in informing the charities of their obligations and providing its support to ensure they comply with the best standards of corporate governance?  What measures is the authority taking to ensure they comply, as opposed to just finding out if they do not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.883" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#C00200"><p>That is quite critical, depending on the size of the charity.  There are different types of charities.  In the case of some of the charities that have not yet complied, we believe one of the reasons is that they do not have the capacity to comply in terms of the annual report and other requirements.  They might not have a large amount of money and they might not be engaged in the transaction of money.  They might be engaged in the transaction of services at a local level.  We have engaged Volunteer Ireland, which has 21 centres throughout the country.  All of those small charities can go to Volunteer Ireland centres where they will be facilitated and brought through the process to register, step-by-step, so as to come into compliance.</p> <p>  A large amount of charities are now obsolete and redundant.  With regard to bringing confidence to the sector, we will write to those non-compliant charities for the last time and then we will bring through a process of taking them off the register.  To be honest, that will not affect anybody because they are no longer doing anything.  They are not providing a charitable purpose so there is no risk to the community, and we wish to make sure of that.  It will also give confidence to the community that there is a proper register in place.</p> <p>  The second action we are taking which will give confidence, rather than Part 4, relates to the registration and how we register charities at present.  I was surprised, having come from the nursing home sector, at how many people wish to set up charities.  It is a large number of people, and I have been in the North, Scotland and England.  We anticipate that there could be 800 applications a year for charitable status.  However, those people might not realise what they are applying for and that they might not necessarily have to be a charity to do a great deal of good for specific people.  We want to work with them on that.</p> <p>  In terms of risk, we must get the structure in place to ascertain what the risk is with charities.  One way of doing that is through the Charities Act 2009.  A number of areas in that Act require regulations to be prescribed.  No regulations have been prescribed as yet in the Charities Act, but there is room to put them in place.  My preference is that we consult with the sector and the public before we regulate, because many people are afraid.  They think regulation means enforcement, that we will close them down and so forth.  For the majority of people, that is not the case.  It is for the people who are non-compliant, because there is an issue when they breach regulations.  I can give an example.  We wish to conduct public consultation this quarter on fund-raising.  We wish to issue guidance on fund-raising, because there is public unease around that.  We want to advise the Department on regulations for fund-raising and the manner and conduct of fund-raisers.  We will go to Cork, Galway and Dublin to consult on that, as well as on the web, so we can ensure that we have the pulse of what the public wants.</p> <p>  In that regard, there are also the accounting regulations on how charities account for their money.  Many people tend to misunderstand and do not know the charities law very well.  Even with some of the charities we are dealing with now where we are not satisfied with their compliance levels and we are acting on that, when one meets the people involved they tend to give a look when we tell them that it is our job to ensure that they are accountable to their donors, beneficiaries and the public.  The public tends to be forgotten, even though it is in the law.  There is an amount of work for us to do to provide good guidance on, for example, what a charity is and the responsibility of charity trustees, and then to monitor against that. </p> <p>  There is a job of work to put the structure in place.  I am hoping we will put that structure in place and that we will create a balance and commitment in the sector, while at the same time having the powers, where we identify clear coherent risk and where there is reckless behaviour that is not acceptable, to get straight in and sort it out.  That is why I wish to get the agreements in place.  However, that information will mainly come from the public in terms of concerns and ringing us.  We then examine that information.  That is it.  We get the information, we risk assess it and we seek assurances from the entity.  When it sends us something and we are not assured because it is opaque and not transparent, we will bring it up another level.  We give plenty of chances to reassure us, but the entity must assure us and must be transparent.  That is the approach.  It works.  It worked for the nursing homes, so hopefully it will apply in the charities sector.</p></speech>

We should all recognise the tremendous role undertaken by charities and the tremendous work they have done over the years.  The principle of involving the public in a semi-statutory way has yielded huge results.  It is equally important that the charities are operated above board and that the Charities Act is enforced.  If it is not, as other speakers said, the danger is that public confidence in the system will be undermined, and it will not be possible to recover from a series of situations where questions were raised and left unanswered.</p> <p>  I have raised the number of charities that are registered so far on a number of occasions over the past number of years, particularly on the Order of Business.  I saw a situation developing that I was not happy with.  I cross checked this, and the means to cross check are not very readily available to a public representative or a member of the public.  We all know there is a necessity to ensure that if somebody is raising money ostensibly for a charity, it must go to that charity.  Otherwise, we have problems.  I found that it was quite easy to run some of the charities, but some that I thought were registered were not registered at all.  I worry about that.</p> <p>  Another issue, which Mr. Farrelly mentioned, is dormant charities that have fallen by the wayside.  Do they have money in accounts?  Are they dormant accounts?  Did the funds fall to the Exchequer as dormant accounts or what happened to the money?  Usually, there is a balance left somewhere.  It might or might not be large but it is still money that was raised for a particular purpose.</p> <p>  Might it be preferable to speed up the process of registration and make it quite clear that failure to register is not acceptable and cannot be acceptable in the long or short term?  It has the potential to damage all charities.</p> <p>  On the making of the regulations, I also raised a question about that previously.  It is imperative that the regulations are made as quickly as possible and that they are broadly based, in order to protect legitimate charities, the public purse and the integrity of the charitable sector.  If we delay unnecessarily, and I accept that this is a job for the Minister, it will cause questions and doubts to be raised about what is happening and what should be happening.  We must be extremely careful about that.</p> <p>  My last point relates to the total number of charities.  It is very hard to control all of them to the extent that is desirable.</p><p>We have to control them to the greatest extent possible.  There is a huge number of them and it is very difficult to control their <i>modus operandi </i>because they straddle the voluntary and statutory sectors.  In between those two areas, there is considerable room for manoeuvre and administrative difficulties.  I strongly support the Charities Regulatory Authority and the work it is doing.  The only rider I would apply is that there is a job to be done and it must be done for the benefit of all charities.</p></speech>

Failure to register is an issue.  I want to get an intact register in place and ensure that the information is publicly available.  Carrying on the business of a charity while not being registered is a prosecutable offence.<br/><br/>The Deputy made a very good point about charities that may no longer exist.  There could be good people doing work in communities who have got older and who may not be aware of their obligations.  In fairness, the commissioners for charitable oaths were in place before the regulatory authority came into being and solicitors throughout the country are quite cognisant of the fact that funds are given to us and we allocate them.  <br/><br/>A number of bodies - including shops, for example - are potentially holding themselves up as charities.  We have already been actively working in that area.  Such bodies may have submitted applications for registration but in the interim have been carrying on their business.  We very quickly escalated the process and they had to cease carrying on their business.  We are holding their funds, assets and so forth and if they fail to register, we will distribute those to other charitable organisations.  If they register, they can continue with their business.  The general public does not necessarily understand what a charity is and it is our job to make that information available so that people know what is required.  Unfortunately, within that loop, well-informed people who may not be well-intentioned can move into the voluntary service area and we are watching that.<br/><br/>This year, the focus is on consolidating the register and publicising the information and guidance for people.  If we go to court in pursuit of a prosecution but the body or organisation involved can show that it was not properly informed about the process and system, which can be complex, we could lose the case.  I agree with Deputy that this needs to be done speedily.  Some staff are already <i>in situ</i>but we are awaiting the recruitment of more staff with very specific competencies.</p></speech>

I am chief executive of the Disability Federation of Ireland, which has over 100 organisations and charities affiliated to it.</p> <p>  My first question centres on the issue of balance.  There are ten or 11 statutory functions listed for the authority, of which regulation and compliance constitute one.  The provision of information, advice, support and so forth, is another function.  I am anxious that the authority should achieve the right balance in the work it is doing.  At the start of his presentation, Mr. Farrelly talked about the few and the many.  There was huge attrition in the voluntary sector in the lead up to Christmas 2014 because of the actions of one or two organisations.  How will the authority maintain a balance, on a day-to-day basis, between compliance and its broader functions?  The latter includes issues such as good governance because that means far more than simply being compliant.  </p> <p>  I wish the Charities Regulatory Authority all the best in its work.  Towards the end of his presentation, Mr. Farrelly described the sector as challenging and congested.  What does he mean by that?  He also referred to people with appropriate skill sets.  I ask him to elaborate on the three or four core skill sets he is seeking.  My final question is one of those leaving certificate "discuss" type questions from the honours paper.  Would we all have been better served if we had, instead of the Charities Act 2009, a public benefit Act 2009?  The work is all about public benefit and Mr. Farrelly alluded to the fact that people do not always understand that.  That horse has bolted but when one looks at the purpose of the Act, it is about public benefit.  Should we redefine charity in terms of public benefit?  Would we be better off pushing that concept to the fore?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#D00400"><p>I will answer the questions in reverse order.  The Charities Act is appropriate legislation which has a built-in review mechanism that comes into play after five years.  Having worked HIQA on the regulation of the disability and nursing home sectors, I know that there is always an immense amount of learning when regulation commences - by the people who are regulated, those regulating them and by the law makers - in terms of what is required.  Public benefit is important but there is enough in the Charities Act to regulate the charity sector well.</p> <p>  The issue of balance is really important and I tried to make that clear in my presentation.  As soon as one mentions regulation, people think of enforcement.  The same is true of compliance but people will not be compliant unless they understand clearly what they must do.  That is where the guidance comes in.  In the voluntary sector, for example, there are very good fund-raising principles in place.  We will be looking at adjusting them - because they are built on knowledge within the sector - and formally approving them.  We will be building on what is already there.  The same is true for governance.  There are a lot of good governance codes already in existence but without the regulator's imprimatur, people will not necessarily sign up to them.</p> <p>  On the issue of governance, it would be unfair for people to think that it is only relevant to the charity sector.  In the health area, for example, HIQA issued a number of reports on governance in the statutory sector.  We reported on governance, leadership issues and the lessons that should have been learned in certain circumstances.  In the context of regulation and governance, we must remember that there are so many well-intentioned and well-informed people in the charity sector.  There are more of those people than individuals who are not well-intentioned or well-informed.  Our aim is to create a State structure to regulate the sector which allows the sector to maintain its softness and to continue to fill the gaps not filled by the State.  Having worked in regulation for ten years, I am well aware that one can end up using a certain type of language, much as one tries to soften what one says.  It is important to make people aware of that.  </p> <p>  Under the Charities Act, it is the trustees of charities who are charged with ensuring that the sector is well governed.  The regulatory authority must make sure that those trustees are supported and given enough information to know what is required of them.  The Senator is spot on with his comments on the protective elements in the Act.  The Title to the Act makes reference to both regulation and protection.  We do a huge amount of protective work to which I have not referred today, particularly around section 39 organisations.  We have looked after 282 transactions in the past year or so in areas such as pension schemes, fund allocations, appointment of trustees and so forth.  All of that type of work goes on in the background.</p><p>We need to become an efficient and effective organisation with a good corporate spine.  From regulating disability issues in the health sector, I have learned that people queue up for bad news which sells plenty of newspapers.  We need to strike a balance, however, by publicising all the good work being done.  This will be a major challenge.</p><p> On my description of the sector as challenging and congested, I am not necessarily referring to charities because there are many actors involved, for example, strong legal and accountancy professions.  Ireland has many charities.  I live in Caragh, County Kildare where a charity competes with the GAA and political organisations at the church gate.  It is important that fairness apply in the case of registered charities. </p><p> Generic competencies are not enough.  Specific competencies are required, including data analysis and a knowledge of what one is doing to ensure one does not create a regulatory burden.  If the Charities Regulatory Authority is inefficient, charities will provide us with information we do not need.  The authority's head of compliance worked previously with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  His accountancy skills add another dimension to the work being done by other staff.</p><p> Some of the charities on the register are large and wealthy, which means we need someone who has worked in a large wealth division.  A mixture of specific skills is required and the authority must compete with the private sector to attract these skills.  Ultimately, however, we need dedicated public servants who buy into the authority's mission and will be determined to implement the Charities Act impartially and fairly. </p></speech>

Commencement decisions, however, are not in my gift.</p> <p>  We also wanted to think through certain parts of the Act as their implementation could have unintended outcomes for charities.  One must not forget that charities compete with other not-for-profit entities also engaged in fund-raising.  We wanted to get this right.  The panel is chaired by a member of the authority's board and we expect it to produce a report next year.  We will also move towards issuing and approving guidance on fund-raising to create confidence in this area.  We will work with the Department on the regulations. </p> <p>  In general, we are pleased with what is in place.  We must now ensure we get the prescriptive element underpinning the legislation right because if we get it wrong, we will impose an unnecessary burden.  Our regulations should not deal with issues covered by other State bodies.  Getting this right will, therefore, require us to do some thinking.  While some may consider this to be a risky approach, I would prefer to adopt a step-by-step strategy that has been thought out because we need to get the register right.  The compliance section wants members of the public to become our eyes and ears and to assure them that we will pursue any information they provide. </p> <p>  The Act has many good points.  From speaking to departmental officials, it is clear the Department will respond if we believe further miscellaneous provisions are needed.  For example, those who wish to become charity trustees are not subjected to probity or fitness tests, even on registration.  All we can do is make proposals we believe would be useful and hope they are introduced in a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  We accept, however, that many other issues are being addressed in legislation before the D&aacute;il.  The Act should be sufficient to get us to the starting line.</p></speech>

As the eyes and ears of the authority, members of the public telephone and e-mail us and we risk assess and layer each piece of information we receive.  The process is conducted manually because our computer system is still being installed.  The amount of information we are receiving means the position is tolerable.</p> <p>  It is a matter of trust and verification.  Many people are confused about our role because rather than dealing with complaints, our role is to act on information received by verifying compliance with the Charities Act.  When we receive information, we contact the relevant organisation which must assure us that the matter is within its scope.  If it fails to provide such assurance, the matter is escalated.  If we receive a significant amount of unsolicited information on a particular charity, we will examine patterns.  We must also take a fair and balanced approach because the issue is one of verifying if the information provided is correct and ensuring the charity in question and its trustees have an opportunity to rectify the matter, depending on risk.  We also receive information citing potential risk that may be welfare-related rather than related to the charities legislation.  We ensure any such information is forwarded to the Garda, the Health Service Executive, Tusla, animal welfare organisations and so forth.</p> <p>  We must put robust processes in place.  We are in the middle of procuring an information technology system, which is every public servant's nightmare.  In doing so, we must drive out our processes.</p></speech>

Given his experience and having listened to him, I have no doubt that the system will be efficient and effective.  It may not be within his remit to discuss an issue that has come to my attention.  I refer to charities which are competing with the private sector for State tenders.  Do charities receive preferential treatment in this regard?  If, for example, a private sector company and a charity bid to provide a service for the HSE, there does not appear to be a level playing field as the charitable sector appears to be given preferential treatment.  The evidence is anecdotal and may not necessarily be based on fact.  There is a view that when something is charitable, everybody is working almost for nothing, that one does not have a level playing field and that one may not, therefore, have the best service.  Has Mr. Farrelly seen any evidence of this?  Will the authority examine the issue?</p></speech>

Transparent processes should apply to the commissioning of services.  Charities are entitled to make an income to serve their charitable purposes, provided they are in compliance with charities legislation.  They work in a gap that has been there since the dawn of time and regulators should not prevent them from doing things that help them to serve a charitable purpose.  I presume that commissioning, if and when it is introduced in Ireland, will involve ensuring everything is procured fairly.  My office must procure everything through a Government framework and in a transparent and accountable manner.  The criteria applied to procurement should include the type of entity involved.  Decisions should be based on value for money and capability.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Farrelly and wish him the very best in his important work.  We are involved with charities in one way or another, whether it is shaking a bucket at the weekend or visiting a local charity that we want to try to assist in whatever way we can.  We are all hearing the impact of the wrongdoing of the few.  We hear of charities' budgets and how their take from fund-raising has suffered in recent times.  Mr. Farrelly is in a very key role in terms of building back confidence through good scrutiny and regulation.  I wish Mr. Farrelly all the best with that.</p> <p>  My question may already have been covered during my absence I would not ask the witness to go over old ground so he should disregard it if that is the case.  Mr. Farrelly referred to a prosecutable offence where a charity is not regulated.  What is the Rubicon that is crossed to establish that an organisation which is not registered as a charity is operating as a charity? We know that one can have different levels of activity such as people doing things for others and sometimes raising money on the back of it.  What is the proof point? Is it that they are holding themselves out as a charity and not being registered?  Is that then an offence?  If Mr. Farrelly could assist me with that information, I would be grateful.</p> <p>  With regard to political activity, the position seems to have changed over the years in that organisations with a charity number or registered charities can be involved in political advocacy around changes in legislation or public policy.  Will Mr. Farrelly, very briefly, bring the committee up to speed on where things are on that front?  Should a problem ever arise in that zone, what is Mr. Farrelly's remit to do anything about it or does he have any capacity to respond in that situation?  That is it.  The witness has covered everything else in his answers.  Thank you.</p></speech>

However, we have to have our review clearly formed.  There are well-intentioned but uninformed people out there.  Then there are badly intentioned and well-informed people out there.  We have to be able to zone in at a very human level and be able to assess that type of risk.  We have written to the Garda Commissioner looking to set up an agreement.  Garda&iacute; in general, in their communities, are very watchful and vigilant and understand the law well.  They can collect evidence and can prosecute certain arrestable offences potentially in the Charities Act.  We are very interested in what that line is but, generally, if we write to someone, very often people will come back to us and we can tell straight away that they had no clue at all that they had crossed the line.  There are other people, including those who are going for registration, and there can be issues around private benefit and how the charity is set up.  When we give them what we believe are quite reasonable facts, their response may not make sense even though they can be very well informed.  It is about forming views on this.</p> <p>  One of the differences about charities regulation is that we should not be afraid to contest a certain space in the law, even if we are to lose, and put it out there in terms of transparency.  We are doing a number of things.  We are conducting some reviews at the moment which will put something out, transparently, into that space.  We may lose but that is okay.</p></speech>

We are confined by what the legislation states.  With regard to where the line is crossed, I believe it very much depends on a case-by-case basis.  Certainly, at this time we would not be able to say generally what that situation would be.  It would depend very much on the case at hand.</p></speech>

I would maybe send out an e-mail to the world at large or to anybody who is remotely connected with me and I would let them know of a golf classic on such a date, but if my contacts wanted to send me a few quid, payable to the people in Haiti, I would get it to them.  Of course, invariably one might ask people to send a cheque but sometimes they will send &euro;50 in the post, however much one might discourage it.  Am I engaging in a charitable activity in a way that would conflict with the law by getting involved in soliciting donations which I, in good faith, am going to pass on to what may or may not be a registered charity? It could be something quite informal going out, such as a missionary doing some work or whatever.</p></speech>

For example, is a local cycling club the charity when it is doing a charity run to earn &euro;5,000, or can one define the charity?  The guiding principle is that the charities are the registered charities and people can fund-raise for them.  We need to think about that.  My inclination would be that people can fund-raise for charities but there is an oversight and governance on behalf of the charities to make sure they have streams for that.  We need to effect proper guidance in this regard.  There are other examples such as when people often get involved in collections and fund-raising for others in their community which is not necessarily of public benefit.  It may be of benefit to a young man or woman or child, or it may be a small amount.  We need to get that clarity for people.  There are many good things that go on that are not necessarily for a charity, and that is important.</p> <p>  The point made about political advocacy is interesting.  In the main, political action is precluded but there are a number of organisations that engage in certain activities to further their charitable purpose and objectives.  It is about the balance of that.  We will be forming a view on that, but if someone goes into a contested space, the regulator has to form a view.  It depends on the risk.  We must be careful because charities go into these gaps also and they are not the State sector.  In Ireland we might have a way of running things, but the charities are not the State sector.  They are charities and people are going into that political space.  This is one of the things that must be evolved and a view formed on it.  If it is deliberately and obviously a political activity, we will intervene and we have intervened already since 16 May and asked some trustees how they came to the view a particular activity as correct.</p></speech>

If an organisation is set up, is doing a normal activity and then weighs in heavily in a political way on a very political issue, does the regulator have a role in accepting and looking into complaints from the public and are there-----</p></speech>

There is no provision for complaints in the Charities Act and, believe it or not, that is a good thing.  The sector is well capable of doing that and there are some really good people who have complaints processes.  It is part of the regulations to make sure those processes are in place.  However, we do take on concerns as unsolicited information.  If we believe a registered charity is in non-compliant with the Charities Act, we will start pulling that thread and making sure it comes back into compliance.  It is a contested space and I am happy it is such because that is democracy.</p></speech>

In my life as a regulator, one very rarely has a time when everyone agrees with everything one does.  With regard to the area of "contested space", the world is evolving and we have certain charitable purposes set out in the Act within which there are about ten or 11 quite broad definitions.  I believe that is good because it allows charities to press on and not get hemmed in.  When I say "contested space" I mean that if we believe something is happening which may undermine trust and confidence in the charitable sector as a whole, we will act.</p></speech>

They are all good people and are all in compliance but they weigh in on a debate about fishing rights off the west coast.  This would not be an area which directly concerns that charity's work but for whatever reason it forms an opinion about the matter.  In Mr. Farrelly's opinion, would that put the charity outside of the scope of regulation?</p></speech>

An organisation has a given charitable purpose.  The trustees are accountable to donors, beneficiaries and the public.  They give the trustees money.  The question we ask is whether the trustees are spending that money on the charitable purpose.</p></speech>

We would seek assurances from it first of all.  It comes back to us with information.  If it does not assure us, then we escalate the matter.  The investigative powers are strong and I would not propose to use them lightly.  We can go in forensically to carry out an investigation.  It is a trust-and-verify model.  What can happen is that someone in an organisation can be doing something, but no one knows until someone in the public or the media says something about it.  We have to give the trustees a fair chance.  In fact, many people forget that while the volunteers, the public and the beneficiaries are all stakeholders, the trustees are probably the people putting their necks on the line above all.  We have to be fair to them and practical.  I would certainly be looking at the type of example suggested by Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.916" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#G00400"><p>I am keen to expand on the point.  My question relates to trustees.  In my previous life as a union organiser I had many dealings with people acting as pensions trustees.  It became harder to get anyone interested to put their hands up to become trustees.  As Mr. Farrelly has just described, they took the view that their necks were on the block in the event of questions being asked.  In the charities sector there are vast organisations that have good funding and which are able to support their trustees.  However, there are smaller organisations in which, perhaps, the trustees do not feel as supported.  However, both are equally liable.  Does Mr. Farrelly have any thoughts about the training or supports that are available?  Could more be done?  I know the pensions sector is not the same, but we had terrible trouble trying to encourage people to put their hands up to be trustees.  It is really important that the best trustees are those who feel supported enough to come forward.</p></speech>

At the very least, we can put in place some measures.  I met my Northern Ireland, English and Scottish counterparts.  One of the things we suggested was a board pack specifically to allow people to fill in the dots.  This is part of the idea of leveraging this sector and the private sector to produce ideas which we can then examine and decide whether to endorse or roll out.  Certainly, in the case of trustees, we have no wish to scare people off.  This will only ever be solved by having decent people of integrity who are not afraid to make the right call.  There could be really good people who simply do not get that they have to make a given call.  Supporting them is critical, as is co-ordinating the exercise.  It is a question of balance.  One of the functions we have is supporting trustees in that regard.</p></speech>

In many areas there are good ideas.  In the health sector many services are now being provided that would not be provided only for people putting their necks on the block, pushing the boat out and developing those services.  These are dedicated and committed people.  We seem to have stepped away from that.  How can we encourage people back?  In particular, we are looking for the people Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly referred to, those with the necessary skills, including simple things like people management, accounting or legal skills.  There seems to be a certain reluctance.  How can we work on that?</p> <p>  Another thing I wanted to touch on and go back over is the sharing of information.  All public representatives are coming up against this now.  People quote the Data Protection Act to us.  Is the authority finding this to be a difficulty at the moment?  Does Mr. Farrelly believe there could be far more sharing of information to assist the authority?  I realise Mr. Farrelly has covered the point somewhat but could we tease the point out in a better way?</p></speech>

We do get the line quoted a good deal.  I think there is something there somewhere.  The people involved are usually credible, professional and astute people.  I am unsure whether it is a cultural thing.  Why would someone put something out there?  What is going to happen only for people to have found that they have breached this, that or the other?</p> <p>  I look on it differently.  I believe the sharing of information in the public interest is as important as other things.  In our Act there are obligations on trustees to share.  They are given some protection.  In our Act, if there is a potential criminal act or if something happened along those lines, those responsible have to report it to certain entities.  It comes back to governance.  Sometimes I wonder whether people understand what governance is about.  It is not simply about running a board.  It is about understanding the duties and obligations and ensuring they are carried out.  I do not in any way or at any level buy in to the idea that we cannot share information in a republic with laws all around it.  Perhaps I am a little naive but that is the route I will be going down and sticking to.  We will do it in compliance with the Act.  Let us suppose people are donating to something and I have information that can save that money or allow it to go somewhere else.  I would pass on that information and I would be happy to see what happens afterwards.  We will consider it, but that point is important.  I think there is a fear and there is a culture around that.  In my mind it is a terrible shame that information gets to the media before it gets to the regulator.  That is not appropriate.</p> <p>  The point about trustees is that it is not only about the skills, it is about the competencies as well.  Not everyone goes to college or is an accountant or a solicitor.  However, there are people of the highest integrity involved.  It is about the competencies we are looking for in reaching out for people.  It is also a question of people who can differentiate between certain terms in governance.  We are working with some groups on this.  The questions that arise include the nature of private benefit and conflict and how to go down a safe path.  Let us consider some of the issues that have happened over the years.  They have involved a small number of people.  The questions have been about private benefit versus public interest.  Only a small number of charities have been involved.  There is a great deal going on that is right.  How do we support that transition in order that everyone joins the cause?</p> <p>  Another thing we are trying to do involves chairpersons.  They have specific roles.  It becomes more affordable if we get down to a given pool.  Let us suppose there are 10,000 charities and 3,000 are schools.  Schools are usually well supported in that many people are interested.  Let us suppose we are left with 8,000 charities, including small ones.  If we could reach out to the chairpersons in the first instance and support them, the benefits would be significant.  I am prepared to do anything to leverage the various sectors, including the private sector, the state sector and the not-for-profit sector to support people.</p></speech>

All charities have charitable tax status, I presume.  Does that tax status extend beyond charities?</p></speech>

That is a Revenue issue.  All the relevant entities were registered by Revenue and given charitable tax exemption.  There are several schemes.  One is for gifts but there are different schemes.  This area is not as transparent for the public as I would like it to be.  I am keen for things to be transparent.  People should be able to understand it.  One should not need to be a solicitor or an accountant to understand what is going on in a charity.  These are the things we will be pushing.  Since 16 May we have registered 43 charities through the lens of the Charities Act.</p><p>We have an agreement with Revenue that we are going through certain procedures such that it could trust us that these entities fit its criteria.  I am not totally satisfied with that.  We are renegotiating the memorandum of understanding with Revenue because I want to push charity to the fore.  It is not fair for a small local charity where the 70 year olds are feeding the 90 year olds and which does not want a charitable tax exemption.  We need to work that out.  We would like transparency on the tax law because it looks as if over time that is an important component of being a charity in many ways, bigger than the little gifts.</p></speech>

Does a red light come on when salaries take up almost the entire spend of the charity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.925" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016092100002#H00300"><p>Not necessarily.  It depends on the charitable purpose.  In a service-driven charity one would expect that to be the case.  This is where we need to bring in the reporting regulations.  There is a statement of recommended practice, SORP, for transparency in the UK and in Northern Ireland.  The public should be able to look and form its own view because members of the public might say they do not want to support one type of charity but they do want to support another.  However, they need the data and information.  I do not automatically buy into the idea that because someone is paid there is a problem.  Some charitable purposes need very specialist activity.  That said, we would look at how much a charity earns, how much is spent on particular salaries and if that is value for money.  We also would ask the trustees whether they believe that is a reasonable use of the money given to them as a gift by benefactors.  We will push away and see what people come up with.  Overall a red light would not come on just yet about the ratios that people use, but that may change.</p></speech>

That could be a bit like my first class composition, "I got up.  I washed my face.  I did this ...", but activity reporting where the governors make an honest effort to give a sense of the value for the funding and resources deployed could be a very potent instrument to get people and organisations to focus on the value and give them a different way to look at their work.</p> <p>  It all comes back to public benefit.  In that sense the charity sector in a republic is very closely related to public service.  That needs to be thought about more.  It will be very interesting to think about how they are not involved in the political space in a democracy if they are involved in public benefit.  That is a philosophical comment.  Does Mr. Farrelly think the activity report is necessary? </p></speech>

The public benefit issue comes out of common law because charitable actions have been happening for a long time.  Certain principles in the 2009 Act come out of common law and the earlier Acts.  Another one that may need to go in is independence.  That was one of the key common law principles in forming a view on charities.  It is not in our Act yet.  It is worth considering what a charity is.  Someone might say that it does not make any sense for the HSE, for example, to be registered as such by virtue of the CHY number.  That is why I am talking about the reconciliation of the register, to give people a sense of trust and confidence.</p></speech>

They need to put in a completed application and we need to register it.  We are getting swifter at that.  There is an international issue because charities can be looked after by different organisations within the State.  Some go for a charitable regulator some go within Revenue, while others are within gambling and gaming.  Generally speaking, it takes three to four months for an entity to be registered.  If we get our systems right and if the application process is right and very clear - we have found this in the disability and nursing home sector - we can expedite it through charitable status in days rather than months.  That is down the line.</p></speech>

I was appointed to the board of Ervia and nominated as chairman designate in July.  I have a number of non-executive roles.  I am a former chairman of Tesco Ireland and was its chief executive office from February 2006 until July 2013.  I served as chairman of the board of Repak for three years and have been a board member of Trinity College Dublin and Bord Bia for over a year.  I am on the board of Inner City Enterprise, a charity which supports unemployed persons in starting their own businesses.  For the past three years I have been a member of the Labour Market Council which was set up under the Department of Social Protection to advise on implementation of the strategy Pathways to Work to tackle unemployment.</p><p>I was the chair of Efficient Consumer Response, ECR Ireland, for a number of years.  ECR Ireland encourages long-term co-operation between trading partners to better serve the Irish consumer and remove costs from the supply chain.  I am also chairman of Market Hub, a startup retail technology company and chairman of the Malone Engineering Group Ireland which focuses on the food and pharmaceutical sector.  I run a business consultancy, Keohane Conaty, providing advice on strategic development to businesses.  I am from Cork, live in Dublin and am married with three children.</p><p> Having spent many years in Tesco fulfilling customer requirements I hope to put the wide breadth of business skills and experience I have gained through my career in commercial, finance, decision-making, analysis and team building and my proven track record on delivering value to a business, to effective use, as chairman of Ervia.  Ervia is a 100% State owned commercial and semi-State utility responsible for Ireland&rsquo;s national gas, water and wastewater infrastructure and services.  It delivers these services through two subsidiary companies, Gas Networks Ireland and Irish Water.  Ervia is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous companies with 1,600 direct employees and a further 5,700 directly employed in partner organisations providing services to its 2.4 million gas and water customers.  In 2015, Ervia contributed &euro;1.8 billion to the Irish economy, &euro;1.3 billion of which went directly to Irish suppliers.</p><p> As the parent company, Ervia has overall responsibility for the operation and performance of its subsidiary utility companies.  It ensures that long-term strategies are in place for national gas and water services, that each business has a robust business plan in place and that they deliver against these plans.  Ervia has overall responsibility for the funding of these utilities and ensuring appropriate financial facilities are in place to allow the utilities operate and deliver their capital investment programmes.</p><p> Gas Networks Ireland, GNI,  is a long established infrastructure company that manages the national gas distribution network of 11,300 km and the transmission network of 2,400 km to safely deliver natural gas to homes and businesses in Ireland.  The transmission system is linked to the UK and European gas markets through two undersea interconnector pipelines to Scotland.  Natural gas is now available in over 160 population centres in 19 counties for 673,000 gas users in Ireland.</p><p> In January 2014 Irish Water took over responsibility for delivering and managing water services from 34 - now 31 - local authorities.  This was done under service level agreements with local authorities, ensuring drinking water and wastewater services continued to be delivered to businesses and the public, while the utility was established and Irish Water began to take over full responsibility for the operation of the systems and implementation of the capital investment programmes.  Irish Water is a very new public utility with responsibility for 60,000 km of water pipelines, 25,000 km of sewers, 900 water treatment plants and 1,000 wastewater treatment plants.  It serves 3.3 million people, produces 1.7 billion litres of drinking water and treats 1.4 billion litres of wastewater every day.  Current estimates are that an investment of &euro;13 billion is needed to bring Ireland&rsquo;s public water services to an acceptable standard. This will require a multi-annual multi-billion euro investment programme and is one of the largest national transformation programmes ever undertaken by the State.</p><p> The Ervia board operates under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies which sets out its key responsibilities.  Our role is to ensure the proper governance and oversight of the operations of Ervia and its companies and to hold the CEO and senior executives to account in delivering the objectives set by the shareholder.  The board&rsquo;s responsibilities include guiding the strategic direction of the company, ensuring risks are managed appropriately, approving annual budgets and business plans, approving large capital projects, and major investment decisions and setting and monitoring performance objectives.  As chairman of Ervia I will be responsible for leading the board and ensuring its effectiveness.</p><p> I am aware this is a challenging role and I am committed to bringing my skills and experience and the necessary time to meet that challenge.  I look forward to working with the board, the executive and the staff of Ervia, the shareholders and all stakeholders to continue to build trust and confidence and to ensure the board does its job effectively to deliver on the business objectives that have been set for the company.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the State companies and I have been a director with one for two terms, so I know the challenges, the complexities and the tensions that can arise between a board and delivering for shareholders.  I do not know what the dividend is, and I am amazed and shocked at the number of State companies that do not deliver any dividend to the State.  Every company should be commercial and viable in the long term, whatever about the short term, with regard to their key objectives.  Clearly Mr. Keohane has vast experience and has not been chosen because of the lack of it.  I have gone to the trouble to look at both Ervia and Mr. Keohane's record and I am highly impressed.  I wish him well and I hope we will have, and develop, a good relationship be it with this committee or whatever committee is relevant to aspects of his work.  It is going to be a major task and there will, quite obviously, always be political tensions.  However, that is the great thing about having a stand-alone, focused, strategic body that will, in this case, oversee the corporate governance of the issues.  I wish him well in what will be a very difficult task in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Like Senator Boyhan I also note Mr. Keohane's vast experience in the various non-executive roles and the various boards on which he has served.  It is excellent that he is now willing to bring that experience forward in this new challenge with the semi-State utility, Ervia.  Ervia is an essential semi-State utility with overall responsibility for Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water which are two critical utilities in the Irish economy in their responsibility for the public supply of energy and water.</p> <p>  In Mr. Keohane's view, what is his understanding of the challenges facing both of the utilities with regard to keeping pace with national economic development and consumer demand?  There are two issues.  One is the huge capacity issue facing Irish Water in delivering quality water supply to our capital city Dublin and other major urban centres.  Our rural regions should also not be forgotten in terms of strategic development and investment by Irish Water.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the second issue.  Mr. Keohane made reference to his previous role and his involvement in efficient consumer response.  Being a new utility, Irish Water expended huge amounts of energy and investment just in getting established.  I believe there is still a challenge in trying to enhance public confidence in the utility and I would like to hear Mr. Keohane's views on that.  What can he bring to the role in enhancing the public confidence and making Irish Water more customer-friendly in its engagement with the consumer?</p></speech>

I wish him the best of luck in his role in the future which will be challenging.  I wish to address two issues that are not controversial.  One issue pertains to commercial water.  When does Mr. Keohane see Irish Water taking over the billing process?  There are multiple rates for commercial water throughout the State based on county boundaries and local authority areas.  Does Mr. Keohane see this as becoming one charge throughout the State or county-wide charges remaining as they are? There is a significant difference between water rates in Dublin city with the cheapest water rates in the State and Wicklow, which has the highest water rates in the State.  There will probably need to be a harmonisation process.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns the contributions for the connection of, or provision of, services for new builds.  We talk of rebuilding Ireland and the construction costs per housing unit.  Where does Mr. Keohane see the contributions figure? Will it be a national figure? I believe it is currently based on the county councils' development contribution schemes, inherited by Ervia.  Does the witness see the contributions model staying that way or does he see a national figure emerging?</p> <p>  At council level we received some presentations from Irish Water.</p><p>It used to be said there was a ten-year payback horizon on any capital investment.  Coming from a rural part of Ireland, I have concerns in regard to our small towns and villages where investment with a repayment horizon of ten years will never be repaid.  We need to look at a 20-year or 30-year horizon.  Most small rural towns have no capacity at the moment and are way down the line in regard to capital infrastructure investment.  I wish Mr. Keohane the best of luck.</p></speech>

There is no doubt he is very well qualified and has a long history of dealing with companies.  There are a lot of challenges, particularly with regard to Irish Water.  Mr. Keohane knows of the review that will take place and the challenges that will throw up, whatever way it goes.  He could not have come in at a worse time, given there is going to be a lot of controversy in the coming months.</p> <p>  With regard to the gas network, there is the question of how long the Scotland-Ireland interconnector will last, given we will then have to find new sources of gas.  Although Mr. Keohane may not be fully in position yet, can he tell us how long the current arrangement can last and where it will take us, as this is likely to be an awful challenge in the future?</p> <p>  There are huge challenges in regard to Irish Water.  There is the plan to bring water to Dublin from the midlands, which has been and will be very controversial.  I have been at many presentations on this in the recent past and I found it very difficult, particularly for the areas along the Shannon we have been talking about.  I would like to know how is Ervia going to handle the consultation process.</p> <p>  I have always been opposed to the idea of the local authorities losing control in this area.  Whether we like it or not, this will come back on the agenda at some stage.  Many powers have been transferred to Irish Water and I have always felt this was a step backwards.  Our biggest problem was funding for local authorities.  This will be a big challenge.  I am not asking Mr. Keohane for an opinion as he will not necessarily be able to give a response, but it is my opinion that this was a big mistake.  We have wasted a huge amount of money in the transfer to Irish Water, in particular the money spent on consultancies and paying people.  The whole set-up has been a disaster, and we have seen this in the numbers on the streets, with 60,000 to 80,000 people on the streets the other day.  It is not going to go away and Mr. Keohane will probably be thrown into this in some way.</p></speech>

The other speakers asked on specifics but I would like to ask about Mr. Keohane's vision for the next three to five years and how he sees the whole energy market in Ireland in terms of supply and, in particular, efficiencies.  The other speakers also talked about the challenges.  For me, one of the greatest challenges in the coming years is the whole issue of climate change.  How does Mr. Keohane see Ireland operating with regard to climate targets and challenges?

They will have to accept I am in the door a wet day so I am not really in a position to answer their more detailed questions.  What I can say is that I know what the job is and I know what is needed.  I am working with the board and the executive team.  My plan and, therefore, my vision is to make sure Ervia works under extremely strong governance, is absolutely transparent and develops a customer-led culture, but also a value for money culture.  That combination is where I hope I can, with the support of the board and executive, guide the company over the next number of years.</p> <p>  The committee members are right that there are many challenges but I believe many of those can be overcome with the support of the staff and the team in Ervia, Gas Networks Ireland and Irish Water, and with proper dialogue and transparency with the stakeholders.  Whatever the outcomes of the reviews taking place, the board will have to take them on board and simply do its job, which is to be guardians of the operations of those companies.  That is where I intend to put my focus.  As I said in my earlier remarks, I hope my experience, particularly in the area of customer relations and customer priorities, will be of some value.</p> <p>  The members raised some specifics and, quite frankly, I would be spoofing them if I started to give answers as I simply do not have those answers at the moment.</p></speech>

A speaker mentioned the challenges around the local authorities and the framework agreement in place.  I know there will be challenges as that rolls out and I know consultation needs to improve in terms of any strategic changes that are made by the company as time goes on.  I am aware we will have to work with whatever the guidance is from the shareholder, as well as working with the climate change requirements of the State.  Ervia obviously has a key role to play in all of that.  I will come back to Deputy Ellis with regard to the life-span of the interconnector but I know it is a vital part of the current infrastructure.</p></speech>

I presume that is an opportunity we will have later.  With regard to his professional ambitions, I welcome his customer focus because that is what it is all about, the customer in this case usually being the average consumer.</p> <p>  I will mark one concern for Mr. Keohane, although I do not expect him to answer now.  This is the question of the relationship between Ervia and Irish Water, in particular the services that are supplied by companies within the group to Irish Water, the cost of those services and the transparency of the accounting.  I put down a parliamentary question on one other issue and the Minister was unable to answer, so I am not sure where I will get the answer.  The question concerned the cost of the water metering programme to date and the plan for extension, if there is one.  I will just mark out those issues and I need answers to those questions.  I appreciate Mr. Keohane cannot answer the questions now but they are hugely important in terms of public confidence.  Perhaps we will have the board of Irish Water before the committee at a future date.</p></speech>

It is absolutely clear that a majority of Deputies were elected on the basis of opposing water charges.  Even if that were not the case, it is absolutely clear that the majority of people are not paying water charges.  Tens of thousands of people were on the streets to protest on Saturday even though nothing is happening with water charges.  No bills are being issued yet people still have strong feelings about water charges.  I suggest Mr. Keohane recommends that the water metering programme is stopped, in case the commission on the D&aacute;il in general votes to abolish water charges, because it would be throwing good money after bad.  That is my top suggestion for Mr. Keohane.</p> <p>  My last comment is connected to what Deputy O'Dowd asked.

It is legitimate to make the point that there is no accountability in terms of these organisations.  It seems farcical and pointless that when people are brought in front of the committee we are limited in terms of what we can ask.  The organisations are not accountable to the D&aacute;il and that was the reason they were established in the first place.  It is a similar situation with the HSE and the NTA.  One cannot ask D&aacute;il questions about such organisations and instead go to them directly, which is a dangerous precedent.</p></speech>

The board, that I hope I will be chairing, will have accountability for both of those outlets.  It will operate under the governance or objectives set by the shareholder whatever they are and however they may change.  The job of the board is to run the company under the objectives that have been set by the shareholder.  I am aware there may be feedback to change some of that in the near or medium term, and so be it if there is.  We will have to operate under the objectives set by the shareholder. </p> <p>  In terms of my international experience, I have spent all of my working life in retail.  I started on the ground floor and worked my way up to board level first in Quinnsworth that was then taken over by Tesco.  I moved to the UK for a couple of years as part of the Tesco transition period.  When I came back to Ireland, I set up the distribution and property arms of Tesco Ireland here and then became the CEO.  I have spent all of my career in a retail environment.  I also sat on the operating board of Tesco UK for a period.  My work experience has been steeped in retail.</p></speech>

There is enormous potential for that.  The Minister will know that his predecessors rejected a number of applications for the land aggregation scheme from local authorities.  They were considered huge investments for local authorities and not sustainable in many cases, certainly with regard to debt.  I know of some local authorities that are only paying the interest on these vast amounts of money that were used to incur these expenses.  To return to the plan, I want to say that I believe it is a very brave and courageous plan.  Dare I say it, the Minister's reputation and that of the Government hinges on all of this.  It is about the delivery of it and I am really only interested in that.  What I like about the 84 key action points is that they keep the Minister, the committee and the Oireachtas focused.</p> <p>  To return to the land aggregation scheme, some of the applications were rejected by the Department.  However, there are many that were accepted into the scheme.  There is potential for that in the roll-out of social housing and how it is going to be progressed.  Clearly, it has to be a priority.  It is an acquisition that is available to local authorities.  The Minister might talk about that and about how he is interacting with the local authorities.  Has the Minister, at this stage, completed a schedule of the local authority lands in regard to the scheme?  The Minister's Department should have a comprehensive map and schedule of each of the 31 local authorities.  We need to feed that into the process at some level within the Minister's Department.  I would like to hear about that at some point and see constant monitoring of it because there is a huge potential investment there.</p> <p>  The next item is on page 51.  The Minister mentions in the document that he envisages a partnership with religious congregations.  Can the Minister please set out what he has in mind?  I understand that he has had some contact and I am led to believe that he has had a meeting.  The Minister might confirm whether he has met with a number of representatives of religious organisations personally.  I understand that he has set out his concerns and they have set out some possibilities and ideas.  The Minister might be in a position to share that if that is the case.</p> <p>  Has the Minister looked at the schedule of lands that were entered into as part of the institutional redress scheme in which the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, represented a bloc of religious superiors who signed a very substantial indemnity scheme with the State during the term of the Government before last?  It was questionable in the view of some parties but we have to deal with it.  There was a major indemnity scheme which indemnified a substantial amount of religious orders from the competition claims as a result of the national redress scheme.  That is a horrific story and this is only a contribution.  I believe there is a moral obligation on these religious orders and I call on them to deliver.  I also believe there is a moral obligation on the State to deliver the lands that it promised and the possibility of two aspects, namely, the delivery of social housing and, more importantly, the delivery of accommodation through buildings that they are not using.  The humanitarian response that the Irish Government has made by committing to 4,000 refugees coming into this country will add another dynamic.  The Minister might touch upon his contacts with the religious orders and how he is going to pursue their assets to alleviate this national housing crisis.</p> <p>  My next point is about action 2.12 on page 52, which is the legislation to streamline the Part 8 process.  Clearly, there is another day's work for this committee to look at the Part 8 process.  There is a democratic deficit in the process and it needs to be reviewed anyway outside of this context.  Within this context, there is no appeal process for Part 8.  This part of the process - I am sure it could be called a planning process - is a consultation process with the local authority and the county manager.  I wish to ask the Minister two questions.</p><p>Will the Minister consider reviewing the Part VIII process?<br/><br/>I had an opportunity to engage with the Minister about a particular local authority.  His officials came back to me and said he had no power and function in the matter.  I accept that, but the letter caused me to revisit a number of pieces of legislation related to the Planning and Development Act.  The Act states that under section 179 the Minister cannot interfere with the Part VIII process.  However, if we are to give real effect to this policy document, we have to have local authorities on message to deliver on key Government policy.  We cannot have local government and councillors continuously opposing the message.  They are entitled to their views, but at the end of the day the process is meaningless if the Minister has no function.<br/><br/>Would the Minister consider being a statutory consultee?  He is not currently a statutory consultee for the Part VIII process; this fact has been confirmed by his Department.  Any Part VIII process should be referred to him because it has to be consistent and in line with policy.  This is the rebuilding Ireland policy and I would like to think the Minister's officials would consider that option.<br/><br/>I refer to page 55, action 2.24 - refugee protection programme.  It states the objective of the plan is to provide a range of supports at local level, including housing assistance payments, a scheme with which the Minister is familiar, to ensure the integration of individuals into their new communities.  The timeline is the fourth quarter of 2016.  This matter is covered in <i>The Irish Times</i>today, as it was yesterday, and two of the Minister's ministerial colleagues talked about their disappointment, the lack of progress and their frustration, which I accept and respect.<br/><br/>I welcome Ireland's humanitarian response, which is good.  However, there are sensitivities.  There are communication issues, as well as the priming of local authorities in terms of the provision of resources to deal with the issue.  I am opposed to the system of direct provision.  What co-ordination plans has the Minister put in place to provide homes for those who are due to travel to the country in the next number of weeks and months?  If I understood him correctly at our last meeting, he was referring to the first tranche of 2,000 people who were due to come to Ireland, which is great.  Has an operational subgroup, under the auspices of the Irish refugee protection programme task force, been established?  I know that the Minister is committed to doing this, but what is the timeframe for its establishment?<br/><br/>On modular pillar 2, what role will local authorities play in housing refugees and the associated integration policies?  Where is the relevant funding?  We need to hear about it because, after all, it is a clear objective for the Minister in the last quarter of 2016.  It must be one of the most challenging policies.<br/><br/>I know that things have slowed down a little but not intentionally.  Many objectives were to be delivered on in the third quarter.  I will not read them to the committee, but I marked every objective to be met in the third quarter.  There are genuine reasons things have slipped, but that is the tightness of the ambitions of the Minister's plan.<br/><br/>Pillar 3 involves building more homes.  Action 33.4 in the Minister's plan is that they will identify and prioritise key pathfinder sites, with the capability to deliver new homes, for which the timeframe is the third quarter.  Will the Minister, please, report on progress in meeting that objective, which is important?  Does he have specific sites in mind?  Is he referring to strategic development zone sites?  It is interesting that the document refers to a proven record, but there is no such record in this matter.  What sites does the Minister envisaged being included?<br/><br/>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is mentioned on page 62.  The Minister has wide-ranging powers which, believe it or not, are perhaps the most controversial aspect of the plan.  I have spoken to councillors from all parties and none and this is a challenging issue.  The document states that, under action 3.6, the Minister proposes to legislate to enable planning applications for 100 units or more to be referred directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is failing in meeting the statutory 18-week rule in the case of a number of what are called strategic critical infrastructure projects.  They are projects the previous Government set out as meeting key strategic objectives, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la is continuing to fail.  How will the Minister put in resources and money in place and provide for reform of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deliver on that key objective?  He hopes to minimise the delays in the case of large-scale housing developments, but as I said, the 18-week rule is not being adhered to and in some cases the process is not completed within 32 weeks.<br/><br/>Action 3.9 refers to online planning and the accelerated roll-out of e-planning systems.  That is excellent.  The use of technology is positive and exciting and it is the direction in which we should be moving, but it will require money and, more importantly, training at local level.  Local councils are in great difficulty; they cannot even provide coloured photocopies of plans because they do not know how to use some of the technology available.  Councils in Dublin are not even scanning planning applications in colour because they state they do not have the resources to do so.  They are minimising the size of copies of plans, which means that they cannot be read.  It is ridiculous.  I do not want people from the Minister's constituency to have to take a train or a bus at a cost of &euro;50 to come to Marlborough Street in Dublin to look at planning applications.  Before An Bord Plean&aacute;la can do anything, councils and the public library service must have the technology they need to deliver on that commitment.  <br/><br/>I refer to construction capacity skills.  To his credit, the Minister has identified this as an issue in terms of how we can develop SOLAS.  If it is successful, there will be major growth in the construction industry, which is all very positive as it feeds into the economy and is marvellous.  However, there is a need for resources to build capacity to provide training in the ETBs.  We do not necessarily need everyone to have a university degree in engineering.  Rather, we need practical people to come through apprenticeship programmes.  Many people who left school at the age of 15 or 16 years and are signing on to social welfare payments would love to enter into apprenticeships and receive training or attend night classes to improve their literacy and numeracy skills.  I want to hear about the provision of resources that it will be necessary to provide in that regard.<br/><br/>Again, I have concerns about the Minister's Part VIII proposals to provide student accommodation.  Will he clarify what he means about joint ventures?  Under no circumstances should a private joint venture be allowed to avail of what is a planning consultation process.  If a local authority is fully managing a development on its land and property, that is somewhat acceptable.  However, in section 4.13 of the Minister's document there is a suggestion there be synergy in the development of student accommodation and that private developers could come in under the wire as part of a very loose Part VIII process.  That is questionable and I would like to see the matter revisited.  <br/><br/>I am sorry to hit the Minister with many questions, but I have made reference to the points listed in the document which I hope has been helpful.</p></speech>

From my perspective, that is very good.  I will go through some of the schemes mentioned.</p> <p>  On student accommodation, it is my understanding anything happening on public land which is controlled and managed by a local council is subject to a Part VIII process.  It is up to the council to make sure it does this in a way that is responsible and maximises the opportunity to engage in the sustainable development of a parcel of publicly owned land.  If the best use of that land involves a mix of student accommodation, affordable rental accommodation and private development, as well as social housing, to achieve a mixed tenure, the Part VIII process has to be used to deal with that complexity and ambition.  That is what we mean when we refer to student accommodation being part of a mixed development on publicly owned land. </p> <p>  On construction capacity skills, a major feature of the education policy launched last week by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Taoiseach was the need to increase the number of traineeships and apprenticeships, particularly in construction.  The way in which we construct buildings and housing estates will change.  We may not see the same numbers of bricklayers and so on being used.</p><p>In future, we may have many more pre-cast or ready-for-assembly properties being craned into building sites and assembled in a much different way than is currently the case.  Some conventional building will undoubtedly continue.  If we are to return to building between 25,000 and 30,000 housing units per annum through a combination of social and private housing, we will need more skilled construction workers.</p><p> One of the more controversial and ambitious elements of the plan is the proposal to change the decision making process for planning in respect of larger developments.  This is one of the reasons we will introduce legislation.  I hope to secure Government approval for the heads of a Bill next week.  Under the proposed legislation, developers who wish to build more than 100 housing units will be required to engage in an intensive pre-planning consultation process with local government and, for the first time, this must be completed within a prescribed period.  Rather than having a developer submit a poor planning application which needs to be reshaped and redesigned through an ongoing pre-planning consultation process, some of which last for 18 months or longer, the onus will be on private developers to ensure their planning applications are in order from the outset.  This will result in much higher quality submissions being made for pre-planning consultation with local authorities.</p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la will also be involved at this stage to ensure applications in respect of zoned land are consistent with the relevant local area, county or city development plan.  Where there is a piece of land that is zoned for housing, a developer will be required to submit a quality application that takes account of all the policy considerations in the locality.  A statutory pre-planning consultation period of between eight to ten weeks will ensue, after which the developer will make a formal submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The legislation will impose a statutory requirement on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue a decision on all such applications within approximately 16 weeks.  The Department will gear up and support An Bord Plean&aacute;la from a human resources perspective and in respect of other resources to ensure it has the capacity to meet these requirements.  Timelines and so forth can be discussed when the Bill is introduced in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and select committee.</p><p> Comparisons will be made with the strategic infrastructure Act and people will point out that it sometimes takes nine, ten or 12 months for decisions to be made under that legislation.  This is because the legislation permits requests for further information to be made and public hearings to be held, as a result of which the timeframe will be extended.  Many examples of such cases come to mind.  The legislation I will introduce will be different, however, and will not be type of a strategic infrastructure Bill for housing.  For example, it does not provide for a timeline for further information and if applications are not spot on from the outset, they will be thrown out.  This will probably result in an increase in the number of refusals until such time as developers get the message that the purpose of the legislation is not only to have quicker decisions, but also to impose on them an obligation to get the application right from the outset.  We want developers to produce highly professional planning applications that are consistent with what councillors have determined in local area plans, development plans and so forth.  This consistency will then be confirmed in the pre-planning consultation, after which An Bord Plean&aacute;la will go through a rigorous process of ensuring everything is as it should be before making a decision.</p><p> The most important issue is protecting the integrity of the planning system, while the second priority is to ensure the right decisions are made in a timely manner.  What we are trying to do is ensure the process moves forward and people who are willing to provide quality housing developments in the right places at the right density, taking account of all the other issues surrounding public amenity and so forth, have decisions made on their planning applications quickly to allow construction to proceed.  I hope that gives members a sense of what we are trying to achieve.</p><p> By the end of this month, we should be in a position to name key sites which we want to become pathfinder projects.  I have referred to one or two such sites in commentary and speeches.  I believe we will be on schedule in this regard.  We want to create projects that deliberately draw the spotlight as this will show others what can be achieved on publicly owned land in terms of integrating communities and demonstrating new thinking in the area of design, ambition and so forth.  People in other areas who follow developments on pathfinder sites in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere may then decide to replicate the model on the basis that it clearly works.  I want O'Devaney Gardens to be a pathfinder site because it has been a highly controversial project on which there has been considerable disagreement.  I am not certain it will come through the system but we would like to turn all the negatives associated with the site on their head and create a positive project for Dublin.  </p><p> Pathfinder projects will also be developed on large private strategic sites that can deliver scale quickly, for example, strategic development zones.  This will allow people to see the pace of delivery.  We hope to deliberately attract attention to these sites with a view to having projects that work replicated in other areas. </p><p> Deputy Boyhan spoke about quarter three implementation in a way that almost made excuses for not delivering.  We intend to deliver quarter three objectives on schedule.  We will have a full report on mid-October providing an update on what is being delivered, what is ahead of schedule and what plans are in place to get projects that are behind schedule back on track.  I expect the joint committee will be interested in receiving progress reports that are factual and numbers based rather than slick public relations management jobs, which we are sometimes accused of providing.</p><p> Like many other members of the Government, I want to make progress on the issue of refugees.  Ireland has made a commitment to welcome 2,000 refugees in the next 12 months.  This will mean accommodating approximately 40 refugees per week and my Department's responsibility is to ensure accommodation is available when required.  Refugees arriving here will first go to an orientation centre for a period to learn about and understand the kind of communities they will live in and with in future.  We will then have to put in place sustainable housing solutions which I expect will be predominately done through the housing assistance payment.  Let us be honest rather than politically correct about this issue.  We must approach it in a way that, where possible, does not cause friction between people who are on housing waiting lists and those who are arriving here, many of home will have had horrific experiences and will need wraparound help and support, not only in the area of housing.  The last thing we want is competitive friction for local authority or social housing to develop between the new Irish and people with legitimate needs who are waiting for housing supports.  We are very conscious of this issue.  For this reason, the housing assistance payment is probably a good vehicle for addressing the issue.  Many of the homes available under the HAP scheme are spread around and not located in large numbers in specific areas.  The way people approach a council house that becomes available for reallocation is very public and there is competition for such houses.  While we are open to suggestions, we believe the HAP scheme is probably the best solution, at least initially.</p><p>The Department is represented on the task force for refugee protection, which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  The Department is working closely with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the Department of Justice and Equality and other key stakeholders on the housing of refugees when they come here.  As I stated, they will be housed primarily through the use of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  In vulnerable cases in which there is a specialist need such as disability, mental health concerns, addiction or whatever, local authorities obviously will be asked to and will seek solutions for them.  This hopefully was a comprehensive answer on the refugee side.</p><p> As for streamlining the Part VIII process, my Department is trying to put in place a structure for this process from a timeline perspective to force a decision as opposed to something that gets put off repeatedly.  Some councils are really good at Part VIII proposals and no issues arise.  When speaking to a council, I sometimes am asked why I focus on Part VII because the council in question has no problem with it.  While this is true in some parts of the country, it is not true elsewhere and we intend to consider planning reform more broadly through a root-and-branch review of the broader planning system.  Consequently, the Department intends to consider the efficiency of the existing process, including Part VIII and associated regulations, which will be a separate process.  However, the provisions proposed in the legislation regarding Part VIII include a six-week public consultation instead of the current eight-week period.  In addition, as there is no prescribed timeline at present, the chief executive will have eight weeks in which to prepare a report for councillors.  The intention is that elected members will have six weeks to reform, modify or reject and otherwise, the chief executive officer's proposals will be adopted.  Essentially, there will be a timeline and in the absence of decisions by councillors on that timeline, the chief executive's report will take effect by default.  In other words, this will force people to make a decision on Part VIII proposals and this is the right thing to do.  It keeps the power in the hands of councillors, which is where it should be, but also places an onus on a chief executive to put together proposals that have a good chance of gaining acceptance.  It also forces a discussion and possibly amendments and changes between councillors and management to try to get it right.  However, the most important point is this will force decisions and this is what I am trying to do in the planning system, regardless of whether it is a Part VIII proposal or is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p> As for the religious congregations, I invited them to meet me in Galway.  I have been in Galway a number of times since then but essentially, the idea was to appeal to religious congregations to work with the Department and to consider properties they may have for which they no longer have use.  The idea was rather than essentially trying to force the case, we would work in partnership with religious congregations and from my experience of being in this job thus far, it is a much more progressive way to get things done.  After that meeting, I was approached by a number of religious congregations, which have made offers.  I already have received an offer from my native city of a modern and suitably located house in County Kerry, which now has been linked up with an approved housing body.  The transition is simply taking place and there is no charge for it.  Some of the nuns living there are moving out, Cl&uacute;id is taking over and that is a great outcome.  There is another case of a former convent - also in Cork as it happens - and I hope its facilities will be used by an approved housing body linked with homeless provision for women for that purpose.  I hope to be able to replicate this kind of partnership elsewhere as well.  Last week in Waterford, what I can only describe as a phenomenal social housing project was opened.  Senator Coffey will be highly familiar with the project, which involves a former home for priests.  While I cannot remember its name, it was really impressive.</p></speech>

I encourage anyone seeking an exemplar for a social housing project to view that really impressive project.  We want to have a lot more of that type of stuff and have the budgets to be able to do it.  If there are any religious congregations listening that have properties which no longer are in use or which they seek to vacate in the coming months or years, my Department is interested in talking to them and I ask them to make contact with us directly.</p> <p>  On the land aggregation scheme, the Housing Agency will have a report and recommendations ready for my Department on how best to use the land and sites that have been part of this scheme by the first quarter of next year.  While I acknowledge this has caused issues in the past for many councils with regard to debt management and so on, our job now is to try to make best use of the lands subject to those purchases and to try to squeeze the best value possible out of them in terms of new housing developments, be they social housing or mixed tenure developments or whatever, and we will proceed with that.</p> <p>  I apologise for the lengthy answer but they were all pretty good questions.</p></speech>

However, I wish to come back to the delivery of Part V provisions.  I believe that when the Minister reintroduced the 10% requirement, it has been a big mistake.  I do not believe it will deliver enough and I again ask the Minister to review that decision on Part V provision.  No affordable scheme is in place although there is a requirement under Part V for 10% to be social or leasing or whatever it is.  However, we need more ambitious targets under Part V and it is bad.  I also refer to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, which do not get much mention.  There are many locations all around Dublin city that are boarded up and that have been with banks for a long time.  Many of them must be deemed to be derelict sites by Dublin City Council before a compulsory purchase order can be made on them and this process is not working in any way.  I believe this area must be examined as no compulsory purchase orders have been made in the Dublin City Council area.  While it is starting elsewhere, there has been none there and I wished to raise that issue with the Minister.</p> <p>  On the issue of land supply, which is part of the third pillar, an audit has been carried out with Dublin City Council and other local authorities in many areas.  The Minister also mentioned the churches and lands and I note the churches have vast amounts of lands.  In Finglas I could cite the example of the Church of the Annunciation.  There is land there - we call them the Fergal's lands - with the Church of the Annunciation.  I believe we must up our game in inducing religious authorities to deliver more and perhaps there should be greater engagement with them.  There is major scope in this regard.</p> <p>  On examining the figures in the mid-year review, I am deeply disappointed by some of the targets set and what has been achieved.  Thus far, according to the figures from 2016, we appear to be failing badly in respect of many of the targets.  For example, a target was set in respect of Traveller accommodation to deliver 66 units but only 16 have been delivered to date.  This simply shows the priority that has been given to this issue.  Greater consideration must be given to older people and the issue of financial contributions and to building more for senior citizens.  There is huge demand in this regard and it must be examined.  While the financial contribution is in place, it is not being used much and must be increased.</p></speech>

I will return to you for the next round.  I call Deputy Coppinger.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1034" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1254" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#J00200"><p>I wish to raise three brief matters.  I have no doubt that the Minister personally wishes to resolve the housing crisis.  He has moved by bringing forward the action plan.  My constant theme has been that its focus is wrong.  The focus is on kickstarting the construction industry, but most of those houses will be private houses.  The planning permissions the Minister is talking about accelerating will generally be for private houses which will be unaffordable, certainly in Dublin.  I do not know about the rest of the country but prices are shooting up in Dublin.  They will not be attainable for anybody on the social housing lists and even for people who are struggling with rents.  That is my key problem.</p> <p>  Focusing on this pillar of public housing, last week I said that I do not understand why the plan, the Government and the Civil Service are not focusing on the areas where homelessness and the housing crisis are highest.  That appears to be the obvious thing to do.  A report was published on 17 February, "A Preliminary Analysis of Children and Families in Emergency Homeless Accommodation", which I am sure the Minister has read.  It found that 70% of the homeless families in Dublin were from two areas of Dublin - 118 families or 38% were from Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart in my constituency and the constituency of the Minister's colleague, Deputy Varadkar, and the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, and 89 families or 29% were from the Ballymun-Finglas area, while 13% were from Lucan-Clondalkin, followed by Drumcondra, Donnycarney, Crumlin and Drimnagh.  The bulk of the people were from two areas in Dublin.  My issue, and I am not Dublin focused as I have sympathy with the homeless everywhere, is that we know where the problems are, yet most of the local authority building is not being concentrated and directed to those locations.  The then Minister published a document, "Laying the Foundations", last year in which the targets for Dublin were embarrassingly low, given that it is where most of the problem is.  They would only deal with approximately 10% of those who are waiting for accommodation.  Representatives of local authorities who appeared before the housing committee told us they are meeting their targets, but homelessness is increasing because their targets are ridiculous.</p> <p>  Why has the Minister not met representatives of Fingal County Council, in particular, which covers Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart?  It is my constituency, but I am not being parochial.  We are snowed under with homelessness and there is no plan.  The council has not built or developed anything for years.  There is only one site of council owned land in Blanchardstown that is ready for development, but no plan has been brought forward to the council.</p></speech>

I tabled a parliamentary question and, of the 47,000 social houses referred to in the reply, 18,718 will be local authority new builds.  That is only a little over 3,000 a year.  I am rounding up the figures for the sake of speed.  That is lower than the figure for 2008, before the crash.  The impression is being given that there will be lots of social housing, but the figure is much lower.  In addition, the figures include the 1,500 modular units.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.  Leasing is also included for the first time in local authority figures.  What element will be leased?</p></speech>

With regard to land aggregation, the Minister is concentrating too much on rented accommodation.  Long-term rental will not solve the problem in this country.  Renting over the long term will only cost the State money.  Consider all of the land the local authorities have.  In each budget they are paying pay back a certain amount to the banks because they bought the lands in the boom, as I said last week.  It was addressed then but it is part of this week's discussion.  Now, in fact, many local authorities are paying double the amount to the banks.  It is costing the country a fortune.  The Minister spoke again about the HAP scheme.  It was also mentioned last week, Chairman, so there is a little confusion on your part.  The HAP scheme is fine but, as the Minister will have heard on the radio during the week, rents are increasing all over the country.  We have the new HAP scheme, which I believe will work if it is done right, but there is no cap on rents.  As a result, the local authorities are putting people in the HAP scheme but the rents are increasing.  That means people are caught again because they must pay extra money on the rent, so they are not gaining.  That is why they are finding it hard to find a place to live.  Unless the Minister considers putting a cap on rents, the HAP scheme will be defeated.</p> <p>  I have a question about the elderly.  Part 2 refers to initiatives for the elderly.  We have really failed in this regard.  Each local authority provides housing aid for the elderly.  Originally, one had to be 62 years of age to get it and then that increased to 63 years.  Now, one must be aged 66.  One must be 66 years of age if one is applying for any type of grant from local authorities.  That is not good enough.  People are living longer, which is fair enough, but they do not qualify for the grants.  Like many local authorities, I am dealing with people aged 62 and 63 who require grants for their windows and doors, but they cannot get them because they are not the right age.</p> <p>  With regard to local authorities, the Minister gave a commitment to the committee that he would work with them on housing repairs.  What repairs do local authorities carry out for local authority tenants?  There is no longer such a local authority scheme.  The authority will fix a roof if it is leaking, but it must be an emergency, and it will carry out electrical work, because it is afraid the house will go on fire.</p></speech>

She said the focus on private houses is not a solution.  This is a housing strategy as well as a homelessness strategy.  We are trying to deal with multiple pressures and challenges across the housing sector, whether it involves a first-time buyer trying to buy a house, a chief executive from a multinational who is trying to buy or rent at high rates, dealing with a fundamental deficit in supply versus demand or trying to ensure that vulnerable people get the supports they need from the State.  Many of them are under huge pressure and are very exposed in a way they should not be in a normal, functioning property market in which there are sufficient numbers of social housing and so forth.  We are trying to do everything here.  To look at this plan through the lens of homelessness alone would not be fair.  Of course, that is the priority for me.  That is why it is the first chapter and why we spent a long time discussing it when we met last week.</p><p>This is about trying to ensure those who can afford to buy or rent their own homes have properties in the right places at an affordable price, where possible.  The more people who can access their own homes with their own resources, the less pressure there will be on the State and the more resources we can allocate to people who need our help.  There are many people on the margins who may be just above the threshold and, therefore, do not qualify to be on a social housing list.  We need to respond to their needs to try to keep them off the list.  Many of them do not want to be on the list.  They want to access properties to rent or purchase.  That is why are introducing a new so-called cost rental category, for example.</p><p> I acknowledge there is a big emphasis on the construction industry and building private houses on private land as well as a big emphasis on dramatically increasing the social housing stock, but both are important.  There is a significant imbalance in this sector and I do not want to add to that.  We need to develop a progressive, balanced sector along multiple strands, all at the same time, and that is what makes this so difficult.  If this were simply a social housing strategy, we would focus on building as many social houses as we could in the right places as quickly as we could.  While we are focused on that, we have to focus on many other issues as well.  Otherwise more families will be pushed into this category.  If families are given some assistance by the State or if supply increases, they will be able to access their own sustainable housing solution.</p><p> However, I recognise we face huge pressures in respect of social housing.  We do not have a high enough percentage of our overall stock in social housing.  My understanding is approximately 8% of the national housing stock is social housing or local authority housing through an approved housing body, AHB, or whatever whereas the average in Europe is approximately 17%.  We have a great deal of catching up to do and that is why this plan is about increasing the overall social housing stock by between 30% and 40% over five or six years.  That is a significant ambition which we will deliver.  We propose to deliver an additional 47,000 social housing units over that period, with 26,000 to be built exclusively for social housing, 11,000 to be acquired from the market, a portion of which will be new builds, while the remaining 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and AHBs.  These leases will be long term, for 25 or 30 years in most cases, with an option to review at the end of them.  These are long-term, sustainable housing solutions.  Sometimes leasing allows one to do something off-balance sheet that one might be unable to do on-balance sheet.</p><p> We have discussed the asset residential property service, NARPS, model used by NAMA.  I opened a good social housing scheme linked to that model in recent weeks.  We need to consider the reality of what we are facing and then implement practical solutions to build, acquire housing and put long-term leasing arrangements in place using funding vehicles to allow us to generate the maximum return within the spending rules by which we have to abide.  That is what this plan is all about.</p><p> I take the point that Deputy Coppinger's constituency needs to be a focal point in the context of families and individuals becoming homeless and I am happy to meet officials from Fingal County Council.  My officials at the most senior level met them only last week to discuss this issue and, therefore, this conversation is happening.  I am happy have a political conversation with the councillors from the area and I am committed to meeting representatives of all four Dublin local authorities.  We have only had an opportunity to have a proper political conversation with two of them so far but I will engage with both D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Fingal County Council.</p><p> I will come back to the Deputy on the individual site she mentioned but I would like to have an informed answer on that site, which is ready to go and should be progressing.  I would need to check before I give her an answer.</p></speech>

I ask him to meet the management of these councils.  The councillors are powerless in the sense of bringing forward proposals.  There is not a problem with CEOs acquiring houses.  There is no end of houses for them and it is a little disingenuous to equate the two.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the State sold much of its stock, which, with the benefit of hindsight, was probably a mistake in certain instances.  We are committing a huge sum.  Of the available additional capital that can be allocated in the upcoming budget, 60% will go on social housing.  We will allocate more to social housing than to education, health, transport and everything else combined.  Anybody who thinks we do not have a commitment across government to social housing needs to examine what we are doing in terms of prioritising funding allocations given the competing demands that are there.  This is a big strategy for social housing.  The most significant pressure is how quickly this housing can be built and how the systems and decision-making around the building of those projects can be driven to get them under way faster through Part VIII, other planning processes, using public land, streamlining decision-making processes and so on.</p> <p>  I accept the criticism regarding the over-reliance in the past on the private sector in respect of providing social housing solutions for many people.  That was exposed by the property crash when people stopped building.  However, we are planning for the future now and we are committing huge sums of available capital.  The social housing build programme is dominant in the context of our capital commitments over the next five or six years but I also have to make sure the private housing sector begins functioning again.  Last year, 12,500 houses were built.  Half of them were one-off houses in the countryside.  A significant portion of the other half was generated by finishing off unfinished housing estates and apartment blocks.  The number of new starts last year, therefore, was between 3,000 and 4,000.  That level of supply needs to be dramatically corrected.  It is encouraging that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new starts, planning applications and completions for the seven months of this year in comparison with the same period last year.</p><p>While the level of increase is not as great as is needed, it is nonetheless a significant increase.  I reassure members that things are starting to work.  The number of completions throughout the country in the first eight months of 2016 was 9,167 houses, which is a 19% increase on the first eight months of last year.  The number of house completions in Dublin in the same period was 2,620, which is an increase of 46% on the number of completions in the first eight months of last year.</p></speech>

I accept that the vast majority of houses currently being built and sold in Dublin, where there is a margin for developers, are high-value properties.  We need to change that.  That is the reason we are driving strategic development zones, SDZs, and the reason we need pathfinder projects.  We need projects like O'Devaney Gardens to deliver affordable housing units at affordable rental prices and so on.  In the greater Dublin area, 3,823 units were completed in the first eight months of this year.  That is a 35% increase on last year.  There is movement in the right direction.  The work is not yet complete, not by a long shot.  We need to see up to 300% increases in terms of starts and completions and we need to see a broad spectrum being delivered in terms of different cost levels and different sizes.  We also need specialist units for our elderly population and so on.  The trend, although far from perfect, is moving in the right direction and we need to build on it.  We need to address issues such as first-time buyers not being able to access houses at a price they can afford in the areas where they want to live.  For this reason, consideration is being given to providing an initiative in the budget around first-time buyers in particular.  It is important to recognise that things are starting to move.  We need to accelerate that and we need to manage it to ensure it is a sustainable growth story.</p> <p>  On repairs to local authority housing, local authorities have different approaches to repairs.  There is a budget for maintenance and repair of existing social housing stock.  Some local authorities are under more financial pressure than others.  I accept that and agree that it results in inconsistency within different local authority areas.</p> <p>  On the housing assistance payment, HAP, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, and I made the decision to increase HAP payments and rent supplement payments.  We did not make that decision on the basis of a calculation done on the back of a cigarette box.  This was done on the basis of the figures provided by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in regard to the bottom third of the rental market in terms of cost, with a readjustment of HAP and rent supplement payments to meet the increases in that percentile.</p></speech>

The increase varies throughout the country depending on the extent of the rent increase.  Obviously, it was much higher in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway than it would have been in other rural areas.</p> <p>  Deputy Ellis asked about accommodation for older people.  At the ploughing championships yesterday we launched a new competitive process in respect of which there is a prize fund of &euro;100,000 available.  We are inviting designers, architects, developers and so on to come up with an exemplar design solution for housing for older people, including people who want to trade down but live in a safe community setting.  We are seeking house designs that specifically meet the needs of elderly people.  We should be smart and sophisticated enough to do that.  The purpose of the &euro;100,000 prize fund is to get people competing on an ideas basis to provide solutions that we can factor into our pathfinder projects and social housing schemes.  It is important that an element of our social housing schemes specifically target and cater for elderly people.  This can also be done in private sector schemes because I believe there is a strong private sector demand for this type of housing.  That is a priority for us.</p> <p>  A consistent thread throughout the plan is the competitive process to ensure we get the best ideas.  We have a very sophisticated and streetwise house building and development sector in Ireland.  There are many very good architects in this country.  There are also many people who went abroad to survive commercially, who have learned an awful lot in the places they have been, such as London, Boston and the Middle East, and are now coming back and we want them to be competing for design solutions to some of the problems we are trying to address.</p> <p>  We are reviewing our approach to Traveller accommodation as a whole.  I know this is an issue close to Deputy Ellis's heart because he has raised it with me on a number of occasions.  I am seeking approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a significant increase in funding next year for Traveller accommodation.  In the next day or so we will be publishing the response to what happened almost a year ago, which resulted in the unbelievably tragic deaths of ten people.  We have assessed fire safety at all the halting sites and specific Traveller accommodation throughout the country, and that assessment will be published.  I assure the Deputy that Traveller accommodation is a strong focus of this report.</p> <p>  In terms of spend, I would not judge output by spend at this time of year because often local authorities spend money during the year, be that on upgrade of a halting site or the provision of additional accommodation, which they do not claim until towards the end of the year.  Members will be aware that the vast majority of capital expenditure, the programmes for which we will probably discuss later, gets drawn down in the last three months of a year even though much of the work takes place earlier in the year.  In 2016, the target was to have an additional 66 units at the end of June but only 16 were provided.  This is typical of the annual cycle in that the majority of delivery happens in the last quarter of the year.  I will come back to the Deputy on the detail in that regard if he wishes.</p> <p>  On State-owned lands, compulsory purchase orders and church-owned lands, we are casting the net pretty wide in this regard.  State-owned land is not solely land owned by local authorities.  For example, we sought and have received from CIE a report on what land it could make available at commercial value to local authorities or the Government for housing projects.  CIE has some very strategic sites available.  It is likewise in the case of port companies and so on.  The spectrum of State-owned lands is much broader than one might think.</p> <p>  I encourage local authorities to use compulsory purchase orders in a targeted and progressive way but there are impediments in this regard.  There are pretty strong property rights enshrined in the Constitution such that a property with nobody in it cannot be acquired if it is privately owned.  There needs to be pretty strong criteria around dereliction and so on before that can happen.</p> <p>  The issue of vacant properties was mentioned in previous discussions and again today.  We have given the Housing Agency &euro;70 million to acquire up to 1,600 vacant properties, in respect of which it is making great progress.  The agency has been offered more than 700 properties.  It has already secured 22 and a series of acquisitions in the pipeline are being worked through.</p><p>The &euro;70 million is essentially a start fund for that.  Once they begin acquiring, they get rent from the properties involved and the fund starts to generate moneys that can be used to buy further properties and that is how the figure of 1,600 will be reached.  Local authorities are also acquiring a considerable number of vacant properties.  There is a great deal happening on vacant properties, through the Housing Agency, through local authorities and through new schemes that we are looking at, such as the repair and lease scheme.  I say this in the event that members might think the sector is not being dealt with.</p><p> My final point relates to Part V.  I am aware that some would like me to demand 20% rather than 10%.  In truth, the 10% under Part V is a minimum requirement.  I am of the view that there will be many private housing estates that will contain more than 10% social housing in the future.  Developers will be doing deals with approved housing bodies and local authorities but we must have a red line that reflects the bare minimum in every housing estate.  Commentators are making crude calculations that one would need to build X number of private houses to get Y number of social housing units at 10%.  That misses the point.  Let us consider one of the projects, namely, that at O'Devaney Gardens, where the proposal is for 50% private units, 30% social housing units and 20% affordable rental units.  There will be lots of examples where we go away beyond the 10%.  However, there is a basic requirement that the minimum required in respect of all private developments is 10%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1089" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#M00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee progress to date in 2016 on expenditure and outputs relating to my Department's programmes.  The plan was that I was to be accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Catherine Byrne, but I am sure they are on call if we need them.</p> <p>  The Revised Estimate for 2016 for my Department was initially published in December.  The Estimate was subsequently revised to take account of the transfer of functions from my Department to the newly configured Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and was discussed by the select committee on 30 June.  A further transfer of functions from my Department to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment took place in July.  On foot of this, the gross budget for my Department in 2016 stands at &euro;1.383 billion.  That represents a gross reduction of &euro;109 million on the Estimate published in December.  The Revised Estimate published in June also reflects a reclassification of the water conservation grant as a result of the suspension of water charges.</p> <p>  Following my recent engagements with the committee, members will be aware of the absolute priority I attach to meeting the housing challenge.  In 2016, the overall Exchequer provision for housing has increased by &euro;145 million.  The combined capital and current housing allocation for 2016 will result in an Exchequer investment of some &euro;821 million to support the delivery of housing programmes.  In addition, certain local authorities are funding a range of housing services from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to the value of over &euro;112 million, bringing the total housing provision in 2016 to &euro;933 million.  Some &euro;121 million of Exchequer funding has been spent on capital housing programmes to date in 2016, with a further &euro;65 million being spent by local authorities from LPT receipts, the bulk of which has been used to support the construction and acquisition of social housing units.  Expenditure on capital programmes typically ramps up towards the end of the year and I expect that to be the case this year in the capital housing programmes.  Some &euro;210 million has been spent to date by my Department under the current expenditure housing programmes and this has been supplemented by spending totalling &euro;22 million by local authorities from LPT receipts.</p> <p>  The funding available under the housing programme in 2016 will see the housing needs of 17,140 households being met under a range of social housing initiatives.  The year-to-date position shows that very good progress is being made, with over 10,400 households already supported in 2016.  I am strongly committed to meeting the overall target this year and my Department will continue to monitor progress closely so that any issues affecting progress in certain areas can be compensated for through accelerated progress in other areas.</p> <p>  The publication in July of Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness reflects the priority being afforded to housing.  The plan provides for &euro;5.35 billion funding over the period of the plan to support the delivery of 47,000 units of social housing by the end of 2021, through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing.  In addition, &euro;200 million is being provided for the local infrastructure housing activation fund to boost supply through investment in key enabling infrastructure.  Implementation of the actions set out in Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness will be a key priority for the Department in budget 2017.</p> <p>  Turning to my Department's water programme, the bulk of the spend relates to the rural water programme.  Some &euro;17.5 million is allocated to that programme this year.  The priority under the programme is the need to address water quality problems in group water schemes with funding also provided for group sewage schemes.</p> <p>  An amount of &euro;110 million was originally provided in 2016 for the purposes of meeting demand under the water conservation grant.  With the suspension of water charges and the grant, this funding has instead been paid to the local government fund to be used to meet a portion of the revenue shortfall to Irish Water as a result of the decision to suspend water charges and to cover the costs of readjustment to the financial supports for the group water sector.  Some &euro;300,000 was retained in the water conservation grant subhead to cover some nominal administration costs that will arise in 2016.</p> <p>  The money in the local government fund comes principally from motor taxation and local property tax, which is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  Local property tax continues to provide a sustainable, stable and alternative source of funding for the local government sector.  The 2016 allocations of local property tax to local authorities are based on the same mechanism and principles that were agreed by Government in the previous year, namely, 80% local retention to fund the delivery of public services and the remaining 20% being redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to variances in property values and density across the State.</p> <p>  These measures are necessary to ensure a balanced system of funding for local authorities.  The Government has devolved more powers to local authorities by giving elected members discretion to vary the rates of LPT by up to 15%.  This allows for greater transparency and accountability at a local level.  Some 11 local authorities voted to reduce the LPT rates for 2016, compared to 14 in 2015 and, hopefully, we are moving in the right direction there.</p> <p>  The income sources to the local government fund this year are estimated to be motor tax of &euro;1.075 billion, LPT of &euro;437 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;396 million.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;1.921 billion from the fund in 2016.  Apart from support for water, the main payments from the fund are LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;453 million and payment of &euro;348 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the maintenance of non-national roads and public transport.</p> <p>  The Department's Vote also provides funding for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.</p><p>The programme is managed and overseen through the new local community development committees as the new governance model for local and community programmes in each local authority area.  The 2016 allocation of over &euro;42 million will allow further good progress to be made in this vital area of front-line support provision.  Some &euro;36 million has been spent to date in 2016.  A total of 5,119 of the 15,986 individuals who had received employment support payments by the end of June 2016 had participated in labour market training, 925 had progressed into full-time and part-time employment, while 2,996 had progressed into self-employment.  </p><p> I look forward to hearing members' thoughts and contributions on the mid-year review.  I have made some briefing material available to the committee to assist it in its deliberations.  With my officials who are the experts in this area, I am available to respond to questions or queries members may have.  Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, also plays a part in putting these numbers together.</p></speech>

We share the same constituency.  </p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive report.  I will be brief.  It is clear that the Minister is driving a multi-stranded action approach to housing and providing the appropriate funding in that context, which is to be welcomed.  I would like to ask about the funding of local authorities, the matter with which I am most familiar.  I know that we are dealing with the figures for 2016, but local authorities are preparing their estimates for 2017.  Traditionally, they never seem to receive an indication of what their allocations, or projected allocations, will be to enable them to plan for the future.  That is the complaint we constantly receive from chief executives, councillors and the corporate policy group.  The Minister has provided details of income for local government.  I ask him to take with him the message I am transmitting on behalf of those involved in local government.  It is a message rather than a question.  Local authority chief executives, managers and heads of finance need to be aware of their allocations in order that they can prepare for the future.  They are making preparations, even though very little information is available to them.  I would like to leave that message with the Minister.</p></speech>

The Estimates before us cover a period of just seven days more than the last set of Estimates we discussed.  On 30 June we were able to get the figures up to 23 June.  We are now in September and only looking at the figures up to 30 June.  It really is a waste of time.  We are only comparing the movement of figures for just seven days.  I do not understand why we could not be given the figures up to September.</p></speech>

Local authorities in some counties are being forced to spend additional funds on housing programmes.  That is all very well and good, but they are facing severe challenges in other sectors of their operations.  We might need to look at that issue as we move forward.  It is not possible for all of the funds to be spent on housing because of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Some local authorities have taken on additional staff to ramp up their efforts to deal with the housing crisis.  That comes at a cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1099" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#N01100"><p>In his opening statement the Minister mentioned that the Exchequer provision for housing was increasing by &euro;145 million, bringing the total to &euro;983 million.  It is important to note for the public record that this funding will facilitate various housing initiatives to meet the housing needs of over 17,000 households.  I know that we had a long debate about the Minister's housing action plan, but I would like to know how the Exchequer provision to tackle homelessness compares to that provided in 2014 and 2015.  Will the Minister provide details of his proposals in this regard?  I expect that this year's provision represents a substantial increase.  It is important for the Minister to expand on this matter in the interests of making information available to the public.</p> <p>  Water provision is obviously a very controversial topic.  The public needs to have confidence in public policy.  In his opening statement the Minister said &euro;17.5 million had been provided in the Estimates for rural water programmes.  This funding is essential to support many of the group water schemes around the country that are providing quality water for those who have always been paying for the supply of water in rural areas.  Following the suspension of water charges, how much is it costing the Department and the State to subsidise Irish Water?  It is very important in the public interest to have clarity on this question as part of the debate that is ongoing.  I respect the fact that an independent commission is looking at this area.  There is a lot of populism in the public debate about the issue of water charges.  If the taxpayer is having to fund and subsidise Irish Water, that obviously means that substantial funds are being transferred from other essential services funded from the public purse.  I ask the Minister to expand on this.  I know that &euro;110 million that had been provided for the water conservation grant has now been transferred to the local government fund to assist with this process.  If the Minister could give us more information, it would add to the public debate on the provision of quality water services.  If we are to expect the taxpayer to fund the provision of water services in its entirety, it is important for us to understand how much it affects the Estimates.</p> <p>  I agree with the requirement that 80% of the local government fund, which essentially comes from motor tax and local property tax receipts, be retained for local services in the various local authority areas.  The other 20% is redistributed among local authorities.  This system of funding equalisation helps those local authorities with a relatively low rates base to continue to deliver public services.  Local authorities are allowed to vary the local property tax rate charged by 15%.  I understand 14 local authorities reduced the local property tax rate last year and that 11 have done so this year.  Are the same local authorities reducing their local property tax rates all the time or is there a variance?  I ask the Minister to give us some information.  At a time when local authorities and councillors are, rightly, demanding extra funding for the provision of public services within their remit, it is essential that local councils adopt a responsible approach to the local property tax.  They should not reduce the rate for the sake of it.  Property tax reductions have a direct impact on the provision of public services in local authority areas ad we should discuss the issue.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#N01200"><p>I would like to speak about housing.  The Minister hit the nail on the head when he said each local authority was different.  Rural local authorities are not receiving the same amount as councils such as Dublin City Council.  They do not have the tools to take in high incomes.  I know that the Minister will look at rural counties such as Carlow when he is putting his housing programme in place.  Many local authorities in rural counties are not bringing in enough money to fund housing.  I know that the Minister will consider all of the different aspects I have raised with him.  Rural councils do not have the money they need, which is there is homelessness in rural areas.  The position is different in the capital city.</p> <p>  I would like to return to the issue of the funding of local authorities.  As the Minister has met representatives of the local authority in Carlow, he is aware that it has a &euro;2 million shortfall in capital funding this year.  It just does not have the tools to bring in extra funding.  I do not know whether the local authority will pass a budget this year.  I believe the Department needs to receive extra capital funding on behalf of the taxpayers who have paid their taxes during the years.  The Minister has told me that other local authorities are looking for funding also, but I emphasise that this is a serious case.  I have never before seen budgets like this at local authority level.  The pre-budget meetings are taking place.  The Minister needs to address the capital funding of local authorities that are in need.</p> <p>  We are always talking about the fiscal space.  We are told that &euro;1.1 billion is available for allocation next year.  I know that the Minister will address this issue by providing funding for local authorities.  We hear about funding and the fiscal space, but this is something we will need to address as we head into a new year in January.</p><p> I believe the Minister is examining the best ways to deal with the question of housing, but every area is different and if he does not address every area, he will not solve the homelessness problem.</p><p> As I said, water charges are a problem.  People pay many taxes, but I understand the Minister's ministerial colleague spoke on a radio programme yesterday about abolishing the universal social charge, USC.  Ultimately, we have to be practical and make sure that every local authority passes a budget this year because if they do not, we will have a local authority housing crisis that will need to be addressed.</p><p> As I said, rural local authorities are very different in that we get much less funding and because of that, we are delivering very few services.  Unless the Minister addresses all those issues, we will be in serious trouble.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1303" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#O00200"><p>Local government funding has always been a major issue.  When I was a member of a local authority, we were always fighting over it.  I am aware that most of the local government funding comes from property and motor tax, with the Exchequer topping it up.  With regard to the discretion that was given to local authorities to reduce it by 15%, local authorities should not be penalised as a result of that or lose the Exchequer funding if a shortfall arises.  That is important because issues have arisen in some local authorities with the delivery of services, which are proving very difficult.  The Minister should take that on board.</p> <p>  I have always believed that funding from motor tax should be used for what it was intended, namely, the road network, infrastructure and so on.  There should not be any variation from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#O00300"><p>On the road tax issue, if we use that purely for roads we will have to find other funding streams for the many other areas it funds.  The Department of Finance is very strong on not ring-fencing funding from any given tax for any given purpose unless there is a direct relation between the polluter pays principle or an incentive around conservation.  The provision of water services is an obvious example of that whereby we try to link the cost of capital investment with a charging system that encourages conservation, better management of water and so on.  In terms of broad taxes, much of the money from road tax goes into roads.  That money is collected, goes to the Exchequer and the Exchequer decides on the most pressing needs in terms of the overall revenue streams they have to meet expenditure demands.</p> <p>  On the point made by Deputy Ellis that local authorities should not be penalised for reducing local property tax, if a council makes a decision to reduce its income, that is a local democratic decision.  The point of trying to introduce more local decision making around revenue raising and taxation with the local property tax, LPT, is that if people decide they want to increase a tax, they have more money to spend.  If they decide they want to reduce a tax, they have less money to spend, but they cannot reduce their revenue stream deliberately and then say the Government has to give them the money.  We cannot have that.  Otherwise, we would have local decision making on the basis of being popular, reducing taxation collection and simply relying on the national Exchequer to pick up the tab every time.  We need a mature discussion on balancing streams between local and national Government in terms of the money that should come from the LPT, the central Exchequer or direct levies or charges for certain types of services or whatever.  That happens in every country.</p> <p>  I would like to see more decision making at local level so that councillors, with their management teams, can make decisions on what their areas need, how they will fund that and the tools they have to be able to do that.  Unfortunately, like the issue of water, local property tax became a political issue.  People are making political decisions, and because they did not agree with its introduction they will maximise what they can do in terms of undermining it by reducing it by 15% a year.  That is a decision that has been taken by some, and there is a consequence for that, namely, they have less money to spend.</p> <p>  We are trying to transfer revenue raising decision making powers from the centre to local authorities, where possible.  There are some local authorities that do not have a big percentage of their overall income coming from LPT.  That is the case in Carlow, for example.  Even if they decided to increase the LPT significantly in Carlow, say, by the full 15%, it does not solve the problem-----</p></speech>

I take the Senator's point, but I am making the principal point in that regard.</p> <p>  What is encouraging is that the LPT issue is settling down.  We have gone from having 15 or 16 local authorities reducing it to 11 for this year, and I hope we will have even fewer next year.  I hope we will start to see a small number of local authorities making the decision to increase LPT when it makes sense for them to do so.  I believe there are some local authorities who will do that this year.  I can give a guarantee here today that we will not reduce funding coming from the national Exchequer as a result of that.  If they increase the LPT, they will have extra money to spend.  If they reduce LPT-----</p></speech>

However, there is still an opportunity for local authorities.  Some have made the decision; others will make it in the next few days or weeks.  There is an opportunity, if they want it, to consider increasing funding streams from the LPT.  That is the only point I would make on that.  I do not want to over-emphasise it.</p> <p>  I will address some of the other issues.  Senator Coffey raised the costs arising from the suspension of charges.  Having formerly been in that Department, I am sure there are various things happening that are frustrating for the Senator to watch, given some of the challenges, mainly political, that he had to deal with around water.  I will shortly make a submission to Government on the 2016 costs arising from the suspension of water charges and on the potential cost in 2017 in different scenarios.  The 2017 position will be dependent on the report of the expert commission on funding domestic water services and the consideration of that report by the Oireachtas.  That is only a guesstimate at this stage.</p> <p>  In summary, for 2016, the previously envisaged operating subvention for Irish Water this year was &euro;479 million.  Irish Water has estimated the shortfall in net domestic revenue from the suspension of water charges to be in the order of &euro;181 million for 2016, bringing the total subvention requirement to &euro;660 million.  The cost of the additional &euro;181 million will be met through the savings on the water conservation grant, which now will not be paid - that is &euro;110 million; the conversion of an already provided working capital loan to Irish Water of &euro;58 million, which was already factored into the budget; and savings of &euro;13 million arising elsewhere in the local government fund.</p> <p>  Essentially, because we have matched off the water conservation grant estimate with the reduced revenue stream due to the suspension of water charges, along with the &euro;58 million fund that was effectively a working capital loan to Irish Water from the Department, the shortfall is &euro;13 million after that, which we need to find in savings this year, but we will not have the benefit of that next year.</p><p>We could fall back on it this year.  Let us be honest about this.  If the Oireachtas decides to do away with water charges, we still need to progress and deliver on the significant capital expenditure programme that Irish Water needs, and that will have to come through other revenue raising and, I presume, general taxation.  That would limit our ability to be able to spend in other areas and clearly undermines the water conservation incentive that comes with having some link between what people pay and how much water they use.  That is not to mind the other legal issues around water framework directives and the rest of it.  That is the issue in terms of revenue streams.  We will have a long debate about that once the commission reports.  I know people have strong views on it and I do not want to trigger a debate on water.  We are covered for this year because of the water conservation grant and the &euro;58 million earmarked for a capital support programme.  We will be able to find the &euro;13 million shortfall.</p><p> The potential scenarios for 2017 will be considered as part of the 2017 budget.  We will have an opportunity at a later date to discuss those when the commission reports or, potentially, in the context of the budget.  We must plan for the different scenarios.  The choices we make have big consequences.  Regardless of the way this is cut, we must invest billions of euro over the next five or six years in water infrastructure and it must be paid for.  The only question we must decide is whether it is to be paid for through general taxation, a combination of general taxation and direct charging that tries to incentivise conservation and water management or by reverting to the previous charging system.  These are the choices on which we want the commission to make recommendations.</p></speech>

He has made it very clear how he is covering the shortfall this year and the concerns around next year.  Essentially, the &euro;13 million referred to are savings achieved somewhere within the local government fund.  Correct me if I am wrong but is that not &euro;13 million less being available for local services in local authorities?</p></speech>

He met those representatives.  We must be practical.  Everybody is paying much money on property tax.  I know people have seen what I hope are good changes.  At the end of the day, when we see so much homelessness and so many people on hospital waiting lists, it is important this budget addresses such issues.  People are paying enough.  That is the reality.  They do not have any more.  That is what needs to be addressed in this budget.  I am glad the Minister clarified the issue regarding different local authorities.  It is crucial that every local authority is looked at on its own merit, as they cannot be compared.  If the Minister realises that, he will be half-way to solving the different problems we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#P00400"><p>I wish to clarify a point raised by Senator Coffey.  I do not want to let it go.  We think the &euro;13 million will probably be accommodated through a reduction in the overall amount of money going back to the Exchequer.  It is something that must be negotiated with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would not like to give the impression that local services are being cut as a result of it.  However, I do not want to give the impression either that there is no cost here as there is a big cost.  If we decide not to have a revenue stream coming from water provision to domestic houses, there will be big consequences in terms of the flow of money in and out of government, never mind the other consequences that I am sure we will debate at length when the commission reports.  This year is manageable because of the anticipated spend that is now not going ahead in the way that we thought it would at the start of the year.  Next year it will become a much more difficult issue to manage, depending on the choices we make around water.</p></speech>

Most local authorities are now being asked to make that decision but they are not making the decision on the estimates for another six or eight weeks.  This is the political reality of what local authorities are dealing with on the ground.  They are being asked to maintain the current level of property tax but there is nothing on the allocation of money for spending.  Politicians are being given the option to opt out of the vote.  In Wicklow, last year we tried to tie in where the 15% would be spent.  When we took the vote, we wanted to say clearly where the property tax was to be spent.  We were not allowed to do so because we cannot do it.  The political reality was that people were able to vote against it because it made no difference.  When the estimates came out, what these councillors wanted were contained in them and they were able to vote against the property tax measure again.  Is there any way the property tax decision can be taken when we see the estimates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2016092100002#P00600"><p>That is a very fair question and Senator Boyhan made the point earlier.  We are asking councils to sign off on local property tax decisions now - whether they go up or down - but they are not passing their budgets for another couple of months.  This happens because the Revenue Commissioners insist on getting earlier decisions around the local property tax.  It poses real problems for both the executive teams and the councillors.  They will know 75% or 80% of the budget for next year but there are other variables of which they will not be fully sure.  These might include the Lansdowne Road agreement, etc.  There are other issues that will be decided upon in the budget and they may change, up or down, the figures being considered.  It is difficult for councils to make decisions around local property tax and how they may be able to use extra money without seeing the full picture.</p> <p>  Ironically, before this meeting we had a conversation lasting 15 or 20 minutes on this issue.  Some of the chief executives are asking me if we can consider trying to match the two processes.  We will speak to the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners about that to see what we can do next year.  It would be difficult to do it this year.  If we are to expect progressive decisions around local property tax, the least we can do is say to councillors they can see the full picture, including what they can gain or the cost of cutting the tax.  Maybe the ideology could be taken from the debate around property tax and whether a person is for or against it.  Perhaps we could have more pragmatic decisions around improving revenue streams for local services, which is ultimately what we want to reach.</p></speech>

They meet almost on a monthly basis and there is a structure for discussion around that.  Nothing should be coming as a surprise here.  Some local authorities have real financial difficulties, although I will not name them publicly.  There are two with real difficulties and they have signed off on a financial plan to get them out of that difficulty over time.  We are helping them do that.  As it is coming close to a time for a decision, others are arguing they are in difficulty because of a shortfall and they must be helped.  One must be clear.  We do not want to get into political decision making around budgets so the councils that shout loudest get bailed out by a ministerial decision.</p><p>This requires proper, professional financial management within local authorities and interaction with the Department so the authorities can be as certain as possible as to what is likely to come down the line.  We need to work out together how we can get everybody through the budgetary process.  That is what we are trying to do.  As I stated, a small number of local authorities have genuine historical difficulties with which we need to try to help them.</p></speech>

When we decided to do away with the water conservation grant, we needed to make a consequential decision to increase funding for the rural water programme in respect of the capital support programmes that were needed.  Effectively, as a result of the decision, the conservation grant was not going to many people in rural areas who would previously have been paying for water anyway.  Even though the conservation grant is not being paid because people on the mains systems are not paying water charges, there were many people who would have been receiving a water conservation grant through a group water scheme.  To compensate for that, we have agreed with the representative body for group water schemes on what is needed.  It is very happy with it.</p></speech>

I understand they are joined in the Visitors Gallery by Ms Lorna Lee, communications officer.  The purpose in this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with Ms Justice Ring on the priorities and challenges for GSOC in the coming years.  The joint committee has identified a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC as one of its priorities in this short 2016 work programme period.  On its behalf, I thank Ms Justice Ring and her colleagues for attending.  The format of the meeting is that she will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Justice Ring to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have the opportunity to talk to them about the priorities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, in its work in the near future and perhaps the next decade.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, I chair a commission of three persons.  As stated, I am joined by the commissioner, Mr. Carmel Foley.  The committee may be aware that our fellow commissioner, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, is indisposed.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission works side by side with other independent agencies, notably the Garda Inspectorate and, in recent months, the Policing Authority.  We all seek to provide for oversight of the policing system.  Within this framework GSOC's main function is to deal as effectively and fairly as possible with matters which involve alleged misconduct on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  GSOC has been operational since May 2007 and we look forward to celebrating its tenth anniversary in May next year.  We believe, therefore, that this is an appropriate time to reflect on the work of the commission in the past decade.</p> <p>  GSOC operates in line with the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and its limited amendments.  Almost a decade of experience of implementing the provisions of this detailed legislation has highlighted the fact that in several areas it does not allow for proportionate, effective and user-friendly handling of complaints and oversight.  In particular, Part 4 of the Act is, essentially, too cumbersome to allow GSOC to function effectively.  I refer to the section in the Act that deals with complaints, investigations and other procedures.  It is in need of review and an overhaul.</p> <p>  The objectives of the commission, as set out in section 67 of the Act, are "to ensure that its functions are performed in an efficient and effective manner and with full fairness to all persons involved" and "to promote public confidence in the process".  The committee clearly have an interest in ensuring tthese objectives are achieved by the commission.  We believe revising the legislation to incorporate the lessons learned in the past decade of operation into future arrangements would enable GSOC to function much more efficiently, effectively and fairly in the next decade and better promote public confidence in the process.  It would increase confidence in the oversight system and, in turn, the policing system.</p> <p>  In our submission to the committee we have highlighted some of the main problems and how we believe the system could be more proportionate and more resolution oriented.  This would be to the benefit of the public in the early disposal of a complaint, but it would also bring matters to an efficient end for the garda&iacute; involved.  We are conscious that for everyone, including garda&iacute;, delay causes distress.</p> <p>  We have included an example of a recent case before the commission as an appendix to our submission, as we believe this is the best way to illustrate the need for the complaint handling system to become more proportionate and more resolution oriented.  I will start by briefly relating the details of the case to the committee.  </p> <p>  A complaint was made to GSOC in September last year about an incident that had occurred at a large public event that month.</p><p>The complaint alleged that a garda was verbally abusive to a woman when she was trying to comply with conflicting instructions from garda&iacute; directing traffic at the event.  I will not repeat the language allegedly used by the garda in this room, but members can read it in the submission.  The complainant went to speak to the garda again after her car was parked and he continued in the same vein.  She then approached a sergeant, whose initial response was that she obviously did not follow the garda's instruction.  The sergeant then said that the garda would be spoken to about the matter.</p><p> The complainant highlighted that she was a 55 year old woman who had never been in trouble previously.  That was information she clearly thought was important to give to GSOC.  The complaint was made immediately after she returned home.  It was admitted and designated for an unsupervised disciplinary investigation, as the Act provides for this type of complaint.  A letter was sent to internal affairs within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 94(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, and a superintendent was appointed to carry out the unsupervised investigation in December.  The final report was received by GSOC in July.  The garda concerned was found to be in breach of discipline on two grounds, misconduct and discourtesy, and fined &euro;100 for each breach.  The sergeant was found not to be in breach of discipline, as it was stated that it was not possible to reprimand the garda due to the pressures of work on the day.</p><p> The entire process took nine months.  It involved five interviews and, in terms of human resources, it involved one superintendent, at least one member of internal affairs, four Garda members, two civilians and three GSOC personnel.  There is clearly quite a cost associated with such a process.  We have become recently aware that there may be an appeal in this matter, which will add further time to the process.  The outcome for the complainant was that she was informed that the garda was formally sanctioned, but she has not received an apology for how she was treated from anyone in the Garda to our knowledge.</p><p> We see this as an example of the type of case which should be dealt with by Garda management.  This member of the public should have been contacted either on the evening of the event or the following morning, and an apology should have been forthcoming.  No person should be spoken to by anyone in the fashion outlined in this complaint.  GSOC's view is that such an incident should be, and can be, properly handled by the Garda.  In this instance, there was a finding of a breach of the discipline regulations and a fine, which is of some comfort to the complainant, yet it is not what she wanted.  It is clear that the regulations are centred on garda&iacute; and do not provide for an appropriate response to the member of the public affected by the misconduct.</p><p> I am sure the committee will agree that this describes an overly bureaucratic, complainant unfriendly process.  Our vision is that, in the next decade, this type of complaint, which represents some 20% of the cases we get, would be considered a "service level" issue and would be dealt with in a more proportionate, resolution-focused way.  The first of our key priorities that we have set out is that minor service-focused issues should be resolved in a more efficient and proportionate manner by leveraging the existing line management systems within the Garda.  This would allow more leeway for resolution of issues, rather than focusing on retribution.  We believe it could be achieved more efficiently through line management than through the formal process dictated by the discipline regulations.</p><p> GSOC could become a second port-of-call for issues that could not be resolved, as is the system operated by our counterparts in the UK.  In other words, if the woman came to us, we would assess it to be a service level complaint and send her back to the appropriate person within the relevant station.  She could then come to us if the management of her complaint was not being dealt with or was not being dealt with to her satisfaction.  We do not envisage us stepping back totally but that is the type of complaint that the Garda should deal with.  If I was rudely treated in a shop, I would expect the management, if I made a complaint, to deal with it; I would not expect to be told to go somewhere else.  </p><p> Under our second priority, informal resolution mediated by the Garda Ombudsman could also be used more widely and effectively in the future by giving the ombudsman the power to decide whether it should be attempted, as is the case for the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland.  That provision has been in place in the North since 1998.  Furthermore, in 2000, the ombudsman there was given the role, where appropriate, to mediate.  Why can we not look at more information resolutions where GSOC is the decider?</p><p> The third area we are concerned about relates to the lack of proper oversight and accountability in formal disciplinary investigations conducted by Garda investigating officers under section 94, in circumstances when it is appropriate for this mechanism to be used.  This should be addressed.  This is necessary to promote public confidence in the process for resolving complaints, which is one of the two objectives laid out for GSOC in the Act.  The co-operation of the Garda would be required to achieve this.  There are several elements to this.  In unsupervised investigations, a complainant&rsquo;s right to a review of the complaint investigation by GSOC under section 94(10) should be rendered meaningful.  At the moment, we can examine the process that has taken place but the outcome stands.  If there has been finding of no breach and there is a complaint to us where section 94 has been invoked, we can examine the process and we may find there was a problem with it but the outcome stands and that leaves complainants often frustrated, if not angry.</p><p> In supervised investigations, eliminating the need for a second senior Garda officer to review an investigation file, when it has been supervised and reviewed by a GSOC officer, could render this process more efficient.  We also believe that the Garda deciding officer should be obliged to provide a rationale to GSOC when disagreeing with the ombudsman's recommendations in supervised investigations.  This is also relevant to those investigations into non-criminal matters undertaken by GSOC itself.  GSOC&rsquo;s powers to secure co-operation from garda&iacute; to complete this type of investigation under section 95 also need to be further clarified and bolstered.  There is no uniformity of response.  When we send recommendations to the Garda, discipline is for them and we are happy to say, "That is your area; you make a decision", but we would like a rationale in order that when we go back to the complainant who has come to us, we can at least say, "This is the discipline outcome and this is the rationale for that outcome".  Complainants may still be unsatisfied but, at least, they would understand a decision was made not to discipline, to discipline and impose a penalty or to provide for severe penalty.  We are sometimes given information as to why a decision was made but, in other cases, we just get an outcome.  The Garda must give us an outcome but the rationale for it is sometimes absent.  We need more clarity on behalf of complainants regarding our co-operation with the Garda.</p><p> My final point is that continuous improvement in the timeliness of conducting disciplinary investigations and the provision of information by the Garda still needs to be encouraged.  While there have been definite improvements since GSOC first highlighted the extent of the problems experienced with timeliness in 2013 and since the legislative amendments of last year, there is still a great deal of room for improvement.  This can only benefit both members of the public and garda&iacute; subject of complaints.  We believe that these changes will result in sufficient improvements in the oversight system and we hope to count on the committee's support to achieve them.</p><p> While we are present to examine the work of GSOC, we recognise that every day there are thousands of interactions between members of the public and garda&iacute;.</p><p>Those members of the public come away having dealt with garda&iacute; who were good, excellent and sometimes courageous.  It is our view that good oversight will encourage more of that kind of interaction, will reduce complaints and, in time, will allow GSOC to deal with matters that are serious and need its attention because it will have the resources and experience to look after those types of cases.</p></speech>

I will get to the core of what GSOC is asking the Oireachtas to do.  Is Ms Justice Ring saying that Part 4 of the Act is too cumbersome because the ombudsman commission is required to investigate what are considered very minor complaints which should preferably be dealt with by the Garda as the employer?</p></speech>

We could supervise the carrying out of service complaints but the actual dealing with complaints should be done by the Garda.  Any effective business has such procedures in place.  At the moment, unfortunately, we get too many people who come to us saying they have gone to the station to complain about something and they are given a form and told to go down to GSOC for it to deal with it when those garda&iacute; have no idea of the level of severity or trivial nature of the complaint.  They do not deal with matters.  We see a role for garda&iacute; to deal consistently and efficiently with matters of a certain level.  If they have to come out from behind the desk and say "I am sorry someone spoke to you in that way," that is for them to decide.  That would allow for greater resources within GSOC to concentrate on other areas where it is not possible for garda&iacute; to deal with them.</p> <p>  When we look at the process of dealing with them, as is evident from our reports and experience, most of our investigations are at a low level and go back to the Garda under section 94(1) for investigation.  That requires the initial appointment of a superintendent who then has to find time within his or her perhaps busy district to commence an investigation.  We have no comeback.  We can write reminding them that agreed procedure times have passed but we have no way to get them to deliver a report back to us.  There is no penalty in Part 4.  It was a good idea in 2005 or the Oireachtas would not have passed it.  Let us look at it again and ask whether it is still efficient in 2016 and 2017.  Can we move matters more appropriately in a business-like way through our organisation and the Garda?</p></speech>

It also raises the question, which is perhaps the bigger one, of how, as a force, the members learn management if every complaint goes outside their organisation.  How is a garda, who might become a sergeant, inspector, superintendent or maybe more, learning management, discipline, and good practice?  It is very well for the Commissioner to say "We want to do this" but if on a simple complaint of bad language the station responsible for the member who used the bad language is not dealing with that simple management issue, how can it deal with the bigger issues?  Where is the experience being learned?  Where within the force is discipline being applied except in very formal ways?</p></speech>

The profile of GSOC is much higher as a result of many of the Garda controversies over recent years.  That is a good and a bad thing.  The figures show that out of 2,000 complaints in 2015, which represented more than 5,000 allegations, roughly half were not pursued.  That means that half the people who took their time and felt they had a genuine grievance did not get any comeback.  I do not think they had a vendetta against the Garda but they were left unsatisfied by the process.  One of the things Ms Justice Ring is highlighting and which we need to tease out is where that problem is.  People are going to GSOC and are not getting what they feel is the accountability of the Garda.  Much of it is to do with the system being set up in such a way that the Garda still investigates itself.  That cannot be divorced from the bigger culture.  The witnesses have proposed some legislative changes.  Do they think there is a need for more?</p> <p>  Related to the change in attitude has been the role of whistleblowers.  This is a function that has been devolved to GSOC under the new protected disclosures policy.  What is Ms Justice Ring's opinion on it?  From what I can see, there are enormous problems with its operation.  I would like information on the number of Garda whistleblower cases GSOC is currently dealing with.  We are aware of some of them.  There are cases that were brought to the attention of GSOC more than two years ago which involve garda&iacute; with young families and who are off payroll, have no income, have been emotionally stressed and have made allegations of bullying against Garda management.  Despite this, after two years GSOC has not interviewed any garda&iacute;.  Is the problem a lack of resources, a lack of ability to hold the Garda to account or is GSOC not getting co-operation from Garda sources?  How could something as serious as that go on for two years with nobody against whom allegations have been made being called in?</p> <p>  If Ms Justice Ring looks at GSOC's annual report, the sanctions applied to garda&iacute; who misbehave are relatively minor.  Out of the thousands of complaints, 19 were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, only two of which were pursued.  That just cannot be.  There is something wrong there somewhere.  Those figures do not add up.  When one looks at the sanctions, they are pretty minor.  In the disciplinary cases, most people leave if they are in trouble.  Fifteen people retired before something happened.  It is not good enough.</p><p>Is GSOC aware of situations where people against whom complaints have been made are being promoted and moved up the ranks while the complaints are being investigated?  Does Ms Justice Ring not think that this constitutes a huge cultural problem relating to people who want to speak out when they see those against whom complaints have been made being elevated?  Does this not contribute to the difficulties involved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016092100002#D00200"><p>That is a straightforward question.  I will start with the first part of the Deputy's question.  We have said that Part 4 of the Act, which is the area dealing with investigations, complaints and process, needs to be examined.  While we have highlighted certain things, we would say that this area needs to be considered.  How we do use everyone's time efficiently?  How do we bring the garda&iacute; into the process of managing their own force but still provide oversight?  This is why we say Part 4 of the Act needs to be considered.</p> <p>  Perhaps the biggest problem into which we have made inroads is the provision of information.  We open a complaint.  Perhaps there has already been another type of investigation and we need to see the information about that matter.  We look for documentation where relevant - exhibits or matters of that nature.  We have put in place a procedure which has certainly reduced the time but we are aware that in major matters, a longer period is being taken.  We know there might be unnecessary perusal of documentation before it ever comes to us.  We should see it.  It should not be read three times before we get to see it.  Again, we have no penalty.  We ask for the documentation, evidence and any relevant information and we get it when we get it.  While we have a process, it is not a statutory process and there is no penalty for not following that process.  We are working with the co-operation of the garda&iacute;, which is good, but in some instances it takes longer.  This is why on page 19 of our submission, we look for a solution to that problem, namely, a straightforward statutory provision that can be put in anywhere.  It would replicate the model of our sister organisation in Northern Ireland which talks about the chief constable and the board.  We would say that the Garda Commissioner shall supply the ombudsman with such information and documents as the ombudsman may require for the purposes of, or in connection with, the exercise of any of its functions.  It is not a complicated provision.  In terms of failure to comply with that, it means that the ombudsman in Northern Ireland can seek legal redress.  They can seek an order directing the chief constable - it would be the Garda Commissioner in our jurisdiction - to provide the relevant documentation.  In this jurisdiction, we cannot make such an application.</p> <p>  Having been present when the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland was in the company of Dr. Michael Maguire, who is the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, I heard the former say that he accepts that the ombudsman exists, they have a role and if they look for documentation, there is a purpose and it is given to them.  We would like to see the same sentiment and process here.  We will then feel that where there has been a failure to respond which hampers the commencement of an investigation, for example, where we cannot start until we get the relevant documentation or cannot interview people because we do not know who to interview because that information is within the purview of the Commissioner, such a failure to respond will result in an application to the courts.  At least, it would give us teeth.  In respect of getting information - and getting it in a timely fashion - we credit the process that has been put in place and we have certainly improved the ability with the co-operation of the Garda to get information.  The key element is relates to the co-operation of the Garda.  Where we do not have co-operation or it is slow in coming, we have no teeth in the context of moving that along.</p> <p>  In respect of protected disclosures, that is clearly an issue.  As with any complaint, getting all the relevant information can take time, particularly if there have been prior interactions between a discloser and the police.  In the operation of the Act, and this issue applies to any organisation covered by it, there are teething problems.  There are teething problems because of learning what it applies to.  One of the issues that has arisen concerns where people approach us with what are HR problems.  When they are teased out, they are not matters that come within the tight definition of a protected disclosure.  At the moment, there are four investigations and they clearly come within the definition.  It may be the case that over time, people will know when they should come to us and will be aware of the complaints that are relevant under the Act.  </p> <p>  In the context of the sanctions mentioned by the Deputy, discipline and sanctions are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  We may make a recommendation and she may take it on board or ignore it.  In respect of files sent to the DPP, it is for the DPP to decide whether to prosecute.  We have no prosecutorial role.  We investigate and provide a file and it is up to the DPP to decide whether or not to take it forward for full prosecution.  It is important to see where our role stops and those of the Garda Commissioner and the DPP begin.  We sometimes get very limited information as to why somebody has been disciplined or why a prosecution has not been directed.  Again, those decisions are outside our control.  It is something we are not anxious to get involved in unless things are totally changed and we are given discipline.  One would then be looking at quite a different organisation in terms of resources and personnel.</p></speech>

This compares to 105 in 2007.  GSOC said that it was going to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of increased resources and staffing levels.  Has Ms Justice Ring met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in recent months and, if so, what was the outcome of those discussions or negotiations?</p> <p>  Section 67(1)(b) of the Act concerns promoting public confidence in the process for resolving complaints.  On one hand, we are trying to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the ombudsman and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in resolving complaints.  On the other hand, up to 40% to 50% of allegations are discontinued or withdrawn or garda&iacute; have retired.  Many of these people have hit a brick wall and have nowhere to go with their allegations and no conclusion.  If we need greater intensification of recruitment, we need to be careful that we do that to ensure we have effective oversight and that we investigate those allegations rather than flipping the majority of them back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when many of these people have entered a cul-de-sac and hit a brick wall.</p> <p>  In its annual report, GSOC mentioned that it had given feedback to the Garda around systemic or management issues and complaints.</p><p>In many circumstances, the response has simply been an acknowledgement.  Alternatively, no complaint whatsoever has been received or it has simply been forwarded to the relevant section or department of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is that good enough?  Is that an effective follow-through or system of oversight?  Are those concerned simply nodding at what the commission has identified as a systemic issue without giving any real information, response or offer of mutual engagement on the follow-through?  When one examines the threads of the 36 complaints, one sees very little by way of a conclusive response from the Garda on the matters of systemic importance raised by the commission.</p></speech>

We deal with the Department of Justice and Equality directly on these matters, although we believe we will also be able to deal directly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Like all Civil Service bodies, ours was hit, understandably, by the cutbacks and austerity measures, but at the same time we believe our case for further staff in particular areas is valid.  The procedure in this regard has been started and I hope to see progress this year.</p> <p>  As the Deputy pointed out, with further recruitment to the Garda force, it is statistically likely that there will be further complaints and the oversight body should also see its resources increase proportionately.  I certainly agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p> <p>  We have been very careful to examine how we can maximise our resources and determine how, with better training of our own people, we can make better use of the public funds we have available.  We do not necessarily always look outside for extra help.  Of course, we are accountable for making the best use we can of our resources.  That ties in with having more effective legislation that would not require our investigators to take the long way around in some cases, involving procedures and delays that could be avoided through a change to the Act.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring on the other issues.</p></speech>

However, the force is an independent body and it is up to it to decide how it operates.  Linking with our sister organisations, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority, will give us more comfort and us all more consistent reporting on issues.  However, we know from the Garda Inspectorate's experience that many considered recommendations made in many reports have not been acknowledged or followed through.  I am not here to speak on behalf of the Garda Inspectorate, but that is an issue that applies not only to us but also the inspectorate and, perhaps, the Policing Authority, even in terms of its own recommendations.  That may be a matter to take up with the people responsible for dealing with these recommendations, be they from us or others.</p> <p>  On the question of not following through and meeting brick walls, we deal on many occasions with very frustrated people.  That is why we say we have to ascertain how the Act has been operating and how to deal with it.  For instance, there is no review of a decision made, yet people write back time and again asking us to reopen consideration of a complaint.  I refer to determining, on examining the Act, whether there should be some review to ensure a complaint is handled properly by us and the Garda, where it is involved.  Once a complaint is dealt with, we notify the complainant, but under the Act, there is no review of that decision.  Part of the issue is that if someone has been told he or she is not going to be disciplined, his or her rights arise in the reopening of consideration of a complaint.  He or she will have been told the outcome of the complaint.  For him or her, is it fair to reopen consideration of the complaint?  Therefore, it is important that we get it right the first time.  It is important that we have an outcome over which we can stand and with which we are all happy in order that we do not have to come back to re-examine it in our work or the work of the Garda.</p></speech>

If we send a minor complaint, albeit major to the complainant, to a superintendent in a busy area, as opposed to a case involving a crisis in policing or a serious crime in the area, it will be down the list of priorities, perhaps not surprisingly.  The process can, therefore, be uneven for good reasons.  It can be difficult if someone is sick or unavailable for interview and one cannot force people to come in.  Therefore, there may be real but sometimes questionable delays in that regard.  As noted by Deputy Clare Daly, if somebody retires during the handling of a complaint and is no longer amenable to discipline, the investigation will come to an abrupt end.  We would like to see more consistency and certainty in how an investigation progresses.  Our role is simply to send reminders.  However, as I said, if these reminders have no teeth, they are just added to the pile of correspondence on a superintendent's desk.</p></speech>

I asked specifically whether she had numbers for me in the 20% category which she has highlighted and the 80% category, in respect of which the commission identifies a timeline issue associated with how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding?  I appreciate the information on all of the reasons this issue arises, but I am trying to gauge from the submission whether it arises 20%, 50% or 90% of the time.  Is it happening 90% of the time in the 20% category which Ms Justice Ring rightly points out is very important?  Does the issue arise primarily where there are more serious complaints?  What numbers is GSOC experiencing?</p></speech>

I would like to go back to another aspect of the general tone of Ms Justice Ring's contribution.  She spoke about the complaint procedure that applies when somebody is dealing with a shop manager about a person who has been rude to him or her.  I appreciate and fully accept that it was an analogy.  The problem with that analogy is that members of the Garda are in a very different position in terms of how they interact with the public.  The vast majority of serving garda&iacute; are there to do their level best every day to protect the communities they come from and serve.  That is absolutely critical.  A problem can arise because of the structured nature of the force.  I would prefer it if a body such as GSOC were dealing with such basic complaints.  I say that on the basis of many of the factors advocated by Ms Justice Ring, such as people's need for openness and transparency and the feeling they are going somewhere.  While I appreciate what she said about finding internal Garda solutions in such cases, I would be wary about going that way for a number of reasons.  Ms Justice Ring indicated that the level of involvement of a superintendent, a member of internal affairs, four Garda members, two civilians and three GSOC personnel might be a reason for taking the approach she is advocating.  I imagine that the number of people involved in an internal Garda disciplinary structure would not be much smaller, given the need to be fair to the public and the serving member of the force involved.  I would be cautious about what Ms Justice Ring is advocating.  I think the public likes the current approach.  Even though a complaint like that mentioned by Ms Justice Ring is minor in the great scheme of things, it would be a very serious matter for the member of the public involved.  We are talking about someone who has been abused not by another member of the public, but by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I would be wary of trying to internalise that back in the Garda again, as Ms Justice Ring is advocating.</p></speech>

We are asking whether everything should be about discipline.  If somebody is rude, should we invoke a disciplinary process?  I suggest it would suffice for the person involved to say "I am sorry, I was under pressure.  I should not have said it, I will not do it again".  I would be in favour of that kind of response.  Does it have to become a disciplinary issue?  When there is a bad interaction that is simply due to the pressure of work, does it have to become a formal process?  We all accept that traffic policing is difficult for garda&iacute; and for those being dealt with.  We are looking at resolution of matters.  Does everything have to be an issue of discipline?  Informal means of disposing of matters are being considered throughout the justice area in total.  Restorative justice is seen as having a place, although obviously not in every case.  We are not saying this should be done across the board.  Other forms of resolution are now accepted as meeting the needs of the community and the needs of the people involved generally.  There has to be a formal process of discipline.  That is ultimately a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Does everything have to be about discipline?  Can we resolve matters in another way?  As I have said, there is a provision for mediation in the legislation in the North, which is not that different from the Southern jurisdiction.  In the majority of cases, people interact with the police in the North in a good way.  The same thing applies in the South.  If informal resolution and mediation is possible, in addition to discipline, what is wrong with exploring it?</p></speech>

She said that GSOC deals with very frustrated people.  I get the impression that it is fairly frustrated by the challenges it is facing.  Ms Justice Ring made the point that it would be good if minor complaints could be dealt with within the Garda.  She argued that resolutions should be found before disciplinary measures are required.  I see merit in the idea of the Garda dealing with minor complaints, but I wonder whether Ms Justice Ring would agree that a change of culture is required in the force before the public can be happy with such an approach.  Various whistleblowers have made us aware that there seems to be a serious reluctance on the part of the Garda hierarchy to co-operate with GSOC and give it the information and documentation it requires, especially when it comes to dealing with some senior members of the force.  Ms Justice Ring said she would probably like the idea of legal redress, which happens to be available in the North.  If she would like the same system to be in place here, has she discussed that with the Government?</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the protected disclosures system.  GSOC is now looking after the whistleblower facility, but it has not really been given significant additional resources.  We think the &euro;1 million it was given is a pitiful allocation.  It would appear that GSOC does not have the wherewithal to manage the whistleblower system as well.  It is not being resourced as well as it should be to hold the Garda to account.  Would Ms Justice Ring agree that being given responsibility for protected disclosures is an additional layer too many for GSOC to carry?  She spoke about the possibility of the system being changed so that real disciplinary proceedings are in place for serious offences.  At the moment, disciplinary actions and sanctions are in the hands of the Garda Commissioner.  Would she be in favour of taking them away from the Garda Commissioner?  Does she think that would be a good idea, in terms of giving GSOC a better chance to be the organisation it would like to be?  I will conclude by referring to an issue that goes back many years.  Many garda&iacute; have escaped any form of sanction or redress because they have retired.  Does Ms Justice Ring agree that a garda who chooses to retire while he is under scrutiny for one thing or another should remain subject to scrutiny by GSOC after he has retired?</p></speech>

It is a case of the chicken and the egg, in many ways.  I accept that some of our changes may require a contemporaneous change of culture.  Somebody has got to start.  Ultimately, we respond and answer to the public and the Members of the Oireachtas.  The Garda should also be responding to the public.  We welcome the talk of a change of culture in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Like everyone else, we want to see how that talk translates into action.  It will not happen overnight.  We welcome the commitments that have been made.  I hope changes in the training of people coming into the force will deal with matters from the start.  We now go to Templemore.  We started with the superintendents and we are now addressing the sergeants.  I envisage that in time we will meet people as they come into the force so that they recognise who we are, what we do and the importance of what we do.  Change takes time.  We certainly think we should be clear in what we do.</p><p>If we meet resistance from anyone to that, we have to deal with it as it comes along.  In terms of co-operation with the hierarchy, we recognise that there have been significant measures, in meeting with us and hearing what we have to say.  The difficulty is that when something does not come about, we do not know why because it is a force that operates to its own tune so to speak.  We want more information provided to us.  It may make decisions but we should get the rationale behind the making of those decisions.  When we put in systemic recommendations, we should get a response as to what they are going to do, if anything, with those recommendations.  The co-operation we have been getting to date can be expanded and we look forward to that.</p><p> We have raised with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality the section 66 provision as being perhaps a way to meet some of our needs in getting information from the Garda.  I am sure the Minister is aware of it and that is a matter for her and her colleagues to take it further if they are inclined to do so.  </p><p> In respect of adding responsibilities to GSOC under the terms of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, we would like to be able to give more time to those.  There is no doubt about it.  They are complex investigations.  They have certain practical difficulties.  If someone comes to us under the protected disclosure legislation even to get records information from the Garda, there have to be channels which we have put in place for getting information from the force.  It took some time to work out how best to deal with that.  In time, we will understand how many of these complaints are coming in and it would be of benefit to have a team who are skilled, knowledgeable and work in this area only.  At the moment the resources are such that they do protected disclosure work with other investigations.  My ideal is that we would have a protected disclosure section so that they would know the people within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na they would have to deal with and there would be no mixed messages because they would deal with them consistently.  They would be skilled, aware of perhaps the complexities of the force in terms of such complaints, but we do not have those resources yet.  That is why considering what areas we can give back to the Garda to free it up would be helpful.</p></speech>

I am not sure if there is something in the budget.  Our entire budget is less than &euro;10 million and as the judge has just said, we do not have a ring-fenced separate protected disclosures financial allocation.  It is possibly a very good idea but we do not yet have a separate allocation.</p></speech>

How we deal with that is not a matter for us but for the garda&iacute;.  They would have a very valid argument to say what can be done to them.  They are no longer garda&iacute; and no longer subject to disciplinary investigation.  A criminal investigation is separate.  Being retired does not protect one from a criminal investigation.  In so far as it is a disciplinary issue, that is a practical problem and any suggestions are welcome.</p></speech>

Obviously, the &euro;1 million is for GSOC&rsquo;s general operation but I brought it up because it was used in the Chamber as an excuse for how it was going to be handled which did not seem great as a separate area.

On section 94(3) with regard to public interest investigations that GSOC is now permitted to commence without a complaint, is the commission aware of, or does it participate in the oversight of the secondary element of that process where it is reviewed by another Garda inspector which is mentioned in the GSOC report?  Is there a Chinese wall within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to that process?  Does GSOC have any oversight of that?  Is it a truly independent process when it gets to that secondary stage?</p><p>In respect of the operational experience of section 102 subsections (4) (<i>a</i>), (5) and (7), which are also referred to in the report, that section is quite an interesting one.  I would be interested in the witnesses&rsquo; view of how it operates.</p><p>Deputy Chambers touched on the resource issue.  Every agency that comes before an Oireachtas committee wants more resources.  That is only right and proper, given the circumstances we are emerging from.  All members of the committee would be happy to fight the witnesses&rsquo; corner on that.  I take on board Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s point about operational funding and on specific allocations.  Do the witnesses feel that GSOC is adequately resourced to deal with section 106 of the examination of practices and policies of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and the garda&iacute;?  To what extent does GSOC&rsquo;s role influence that, if at all?  </p><p>I would appreciate if the commissioners could identify what section of the Act covers fines or if it is simply an internal management function because I agree entirely with the points made by my constituency colleague, Deputy Daly, that the fines the witnesses highlighted appear ridiculous.  With regard to Ms Justice Ring&rsquo;s point about all processes stopping when a person retires, I would be interested in her views on how the structure of the Act, or the amended Act, could be changed to cater for that, or if it would be a matter for Garda management or the Department of Justice and Equality to come up with some practical way to say the matter needs to be investigated because GSOC as an independent oversight authority believes it is of sufficient merit to continue the investigation, even if the party has retired or gone on to other things, or even passed away.  Sometimes there are practices and procedures which could be improved to ensure that the allegations contained within the original complaint are not carried out in the future or not at all, if it turns out that this person was innocent, from the point of view of a practical learning experience for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not think it is appropriate for all investigations to simply stop and I know the witnesses would agree with me on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-09-21a.1176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2016092100002#G00600"><p>The concept of Chinese walls in any situation has always been a curious one.</p><p>I cannot speak about the walls within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; somebody else will have to deal with that.  There should be confidence not only among the public but among the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that our investigations are proper, proportionate and fair.  If, in a supervised investigation we have reached a decision, that should be good enough.  Therefore, in terms of looking at it again, why would the Garda have to do that?  We are conscious that when talking about building up public confidence we need to confirm with the Garda our expertise, independence and fairness.  If we do an investigation, particularly in co-operation with the Garda, we would like to see that investigation reaching its conclusions having gone through the proper procedures and there would be no need for a review at that stage.</p><p> With respect to section 102, in terms of cases coming before us, particularly by way of referrals, part of the problem is that, for instance, as we speak, there may be an incident that would be referred to us and would be of such importance in terms of the criminal allegation involved, that suddenly all the work of the commission would have to adjust to take that into consideration, and that would be proper.  Clearly, serious complaints coming to us should be able to be absorbed and dealt with at the time.  In terms of the functioning generally of section 102, we should not be afraid to examine it in terms of how better it can work for the garda&iacute; and the public involved and for our own personnel.  On the issue of resources and when we are talking about looking at what the Garda should be handling, that also involves examining how best to use resources.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Brophy, is concerned about matters getting out and public confidence.  If we can come up with a mutually agreeable form for dealing with certain matters, it would allow for resources to be used to best effect, in the event of them not being increased.  That is not to say we would not welcome an increase, but irrespective of our resources, using our resources to best effect should always be our objective.</p><p> Under section 106, when we look into practices and procedures within the force, and we are conscious the inspectorate may have also looked at areas and we do not want to duplicate work, we will look at it from a different point of view.  We have been slow in the past to do that but we have started to do it and with better adjustment of the work we are doing in the complaints department, so to speak, we would have more time to give to that kind of investigation.  </p><p> For example, in the case of public order arrests, garda&iacute; are often put in a very difficult position when it comes to dealing with a person who may be under the influence of an intoxicant and who may be a child, being a person under the age of 18, or with a person who has health difficulties and none of the appropriate agencies is available.  At 3 a.m. Tusla is not available to do deal with the child; there is nobody in the community available to deal with the person with mental health difficulties; and, we do have drunk tanks where people can literally dry out.  Often the Garda is the only agency available at that time in the morning.  Public order provisions do not give garda&iacute; the right to detain people yet they are damned if they do and damned if they do not.  If they let a child, the person who is in the throes of a mental health crisis or the person who is intoxicated back onto the streets and they cause violent injury to somebody, fall into a river, or something happens to them, it will be the garda's fault.  However, under the current legislation, if a garda detains the person until an agency's office opens at 8 a.m., 9 a.m. or 10 a.m., they will be in trouble because, legally, they have no right to detain them.  That is an area where, in common with the Garda, we recognise the problem.  We are investigating it so we can deal with some of the problems that arise but also we would see it as being something the Garda will join us on because that is legislation that is clearly defective.  At 3 a.m. none of us wants to pick up that telephone, so the Garda is, often unfairly, left to deal with deficiencies in services.</p><p> With respect to fines, this detail is to be found under the 2007 discipline regulations, it is not in the Act.  That is all part of the discipline process.  If the Chairman and members of the committee are looking at, for instance the 2005 Act and our role under it, the discipline regulations will also be ten years old next year.  Therefore, if the committee is going to look at our work, and the extension of our work often leads into the discipline area, perhaps it is time to look at the 2007 regulations.  That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I am sure she and her members will have much to say on that area.  </p><p> The retirement issue is a difficult one.  We are looking at how best we can bring an investigation to an end, so that we do not just end it necessarily.  We have limited ability.  If a person retires and says he or she will not co-operate with our investigation, that is a practical problem.  To get around that, we may have to say that we should have more teeth to bring that person in or to make that person amenable in some way, but it is not an easy answer.  In fairness, garda&iacute; who retire have certain rights and they will be anxious to air those rights to the committee in that regard.  We have to look at how we can get around it, how best to send reports to the Commissioner.  We are looking at overhauling our website.  We should get the information out despite the retirement.  They may be no sanction but that does not mean we cannot get information out to the public.</p></speech>

In my previous role as a Belfast city councillor, fortunately or unfortunately, I had quite a number of interactions with the Police Ombudsman in the North.  Ms Justice Ring will probably appreciate why this engagement has been so informative and why I am somewhat astonished at the lack of legislative teeth, as she put it, and protections that exist for her, given her work.</p> <p>  I have a few observations and, if Ms Justice Ring will indulge me, a few logistical questions around her office.  A concern about the retirement issues seems to be emerging among the members in addition to the timebound nature of some of her work.  Certainly in the North, many of the cases that have been examined by the Ombudsman have been legacy issues, some of those primarily conflict-related legacy issues.  Is there a timebound nature to the complaints that come to her office that she can examine?  Not all complaints relate to a garda being rude or using foul language, some of those coming forward are quite severe and serious.  Is part of her role to recommend a prosecution or court action, or does she have to immediately absent herself from that if that becomes the case?  </p> <p>  I know the Chairman has agreed a work plan for this committee to the end of year but beyond that we might have the opportunity to hear from representatives from the police ombudsman's office to examine some of its best practice; that is not to say that office is perfect either, but it would help inform members and be of benefit to this committee.  </p> <p>  Ms Justice Ring mentioned speaking to the garda&iacute; at various leadership levels around the cultural change Deputy Wallace raised.  One element we have seen in terms of transforming a very embedded culture within policing in the North has been to facilitate engagement with citizens and with community organisations at a grassroots level.</p><p>Is it a resource issue?  Does Ms Justice Ring have the capacity to initiate that direct interface or does it rest elsewhere?  It has not resolved all our ills but it has been very beneficial in the North.</p></speech>

Obviously, it would be great to have more time in terms of education.  We brought in people, for example, who are dealing with new communities because we are anxious to be able to make sure that people in new communities who may be having difficulties in their interactions with the Garda come to us.</p> <p>  I mentioned our website.  One of the reasons we have to update our website is because there is no information on it in any other language and there should be.  We have translation facilities available but we tell people that in English.  Clearly, there are members of the public in communities that we may not be reaching.  That is added time and effort being put on us in terms of our statutory mandate.  I have no difficulty in engaging with the public but I have to do the other functions we have as part of our mandate.  The Senator may rest assured that members of the public respond to us in terms of how they feel about what we are doing and what the Garda is doing.  We get a great deal of interaction in that regard.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned recommending court action.  We put forward a case to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  We may recommend that the matter go forward for prosecution.  We may make no recommendation.  In some cases we recommended no prosecution but we send those to the DPP because, ultimately, the decision rests with that office.  It is a separate function.  We send forward what we see as a good case, just as garda&iacute; send forward cases they see as good cases and there is no prosecution.  In other cases where we are not expecting a prosecution, there is one.  Those are matters for an official in another office.</p> <p>  In the North they have had the benefit of starting from ground zero in many ways.  There was perhaps an old attitude and old issues but there was a new force and the Ombudsman was brought in at the same time.  I am aware, from looking at the D&aacute;il debates on the setting up of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, that a good deal of reference was made to the experience in the North and, for whatever reason, different procedures were adopted here.  That is a matter of history at this stage.</p> <p>  The North has its problems.  It has very old, ongoing, troubling investigations.  We have those problems.  There are practical issues north and south of the Border as to how we deal with a case where time has passed and people have died or moved on but, often, the complainant, the victim of a crime, never moves on.  His or her memory is very clear, but around them time has meant that experiences or evidence has been lost.  That is a challenge.  The Garda often cannot deal with that satisfactorily when it receives an oral complaint in respect of a crime that was committed many years ago.  That is a challenge that perhaps will have-----</p></speech>

That recommendation is an important one that would bolster the remit of Ms Justice Ring's office.  That issue is key in terms of us looking at how we may discuss and make recommendations that would be of advantage to her.</p> <p>  On the issue of the time-bound nature of complaints, could someone with a complaint from 2011 bring that to GSOC next week and expect the same processes?</p></speech>

That has been extended to 12 months.  We have the capacity, in a given case, to decide to extend the limit.  For smaller cases, that makes sense.  We should have some parameters.  We need to make sure that people know in that 12 month period that GSOC exists and that they can come to us.  On the larger issues, if it is a criminal matter, there should not be any time limit.  There is no time limit with regard to criminal offences so why should we have any time limit in that regard?  We would certainly look at a complaint and if it was of a criminal nature, we would have to have regard to the fact that a man or woman could go into a Garda station in the morning and make a complaint of an alleged offence which occurred some ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  In some cases we have seen them go as far back as 40 or 50 years ago.  The problem can be in the actual effective investigation.  We may open an investigation but whether we can effectively investigate it can be dependent on who is available, what the information is and whether we get people willing to come forward.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Justice Ring for coming before the committee today and for her presentation.  I have two brief questions.  First, on the 20% of complaints about which we spoke, has that percentage increased in recent years or has it been a consistent percentage during the ten years of GSOC?</p> <p>  Second, on the extra resources Ms Justice Ring would require, if extra resources were allocated, would they be directed towards hiring more staff to deal with the complaints or would they be directed towards staff to increase the accessibility of GSOC, for example, the public engagement my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, spoke about, taking into account the 12-month timeframe within which members of the public may make complaints?</p></speech>

Generally, the level of complaints have been consistent.</p> <p>  In terms of our planning, it is an area where we have a history to show that our complaint level is at a certain stage and our division of that into service level-type complaints is accurate.</p> <p>  With regard to extra resources, I might look at it differently.  We need to look at our effective functioning.  We need to look at Part 4.  Can we make it better for the public, the people at work, and the Garda?  Having done that, we then look at the implications for resources.  In that regard, if we are to get back more investigations, we need to have people properly resourced to do those investigations.  Knowing how much work comes back to GSOC, there is no point saying we will need ten or 15 staff if we will need more or less if there are changes.  While any money is welcome, I believe we should examine the legislation - any changes that arise - and then look at the resources, as part of a package.  That is not to say that any extra money will not be properly used in the interim.</p></speech>

Some serious points have been made.  We have to view them against the backdrop of the legislative change we introduced in 2014 when, in fairness, we raised many of the same points.</p><p>We were told by the Minister - who is now also T&aacute;naiste - at the time that everything was fine and that the changes and improvements to GSOC's operation would make it fit to do the job the public thinks it should do, namely, hold the Garda to account and investigate complaints.  What we have heard now is that this is clearly not the case.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Department are on record on multiple occasions as saying that the protocols have all been improved and are working brilliantly.  We know that was not the case.  The commission is saying that it has improved a bit but not by enough.  That means the job is not being done.  Our task is to decide whether we are going to push for this to be changed.  That is the first thing.  What I am hearing - I would like this to be made clear - is that the protocols are not being adhered to.  GSOC cannot do its job because it is not getting the information.  In fairness, the Commissioner said it, in particular with regard to the situation on whistleblowers. This is key to everything because the input from whistleblowers has actually been instrumental in raising the whole issue of Garda culture and accountability into the public domain in the first instance.  Under the new system, there is no confidential recipient.  GSOC is the confidential recipient and there are four cases at present which are not being dealt with.  We are being told about the records, channels and not getting information.  I make the point again that cases have been there for two years.  Loyal members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been off the payroll for over a year.  They have families and their cases are not being investigated.</p><p> If the problem is a lack of both legislative power and co-operation, it must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If it is not, other people will not come forward.  I would like a confirmation that I am on the right track.  I am sure I am.  We have made these points before.  This really serious and, in fairness to the commissioners, the onus is on us to take it forward.</p></speech>

This is not an engagement in isolation.  This is part of ticking the box in a very focused way in respect of Garda review and GSOC reform.  I call Deputy O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

We are conscious that we only get a partial hearing of the circumstances relating to such complaints.  However, many of them say they have been to GSOC, which is where we tell them they should go, but their complaints have not been completed and no conclusion or report has issued.  What is the reason for delays in important cases that come before GSOC?  Is it a question of resources or a failure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide information?</p> <p>  GSOC will have received a report from Mr. Justice Frank Clarke in June under section 109 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act in respect of the deaths of Sergeant Michael Galvin and Ms Sheena Stewart.  I am not asking the witnesses to get into the substance of it but I will inquire as to whether GSOC has changed its practices as a result of that report.  One of the criticisms made by Mr. Justice Clarke was that the decision to designate the fatal injury to Ms Stewart as a criminal investigation was made too quickly.</p></speech>

We know there are people who are dissatisfied with what has taken place in GSOC.  Some of them may never be able to be satisfied for all sorts of reasons.  In the context of dissatisfaction with us on time issues, if a complaint investigation goes outside under the provisions of section 94(1), the time that passes is outside our control.  We try to keep complainants up to date but it gets to a point where sending another letter saying we still have no word for does not add to their peace of mind.  In so far as serious matters are concerned, we do our best.  We are obliged to keep people up to date.  There may be valid delays.  I am not saying that any delay in an investigation is all the fault of the Garda.  There can be valid delays and some of our investigators are dealing with other matters.  We are looking at our own timeliness and have made improvements in that regard.  That we can control, but other areas we cannot.  I know the frustration because people write directly to me also.  We are all conscious and consider what people have to say very seriously.</p> <p>  On Mr. Justice Clarke's report, it was the first report of its kind under section 109.  It had taken a great deal of time and arose out of the most serious and tragic circumstances.  We are going through the report and we have changed our practices.  The committee will recollect that while the decision was made too quickly, there was no question of the bona fides of the people making the decision being challenged.  We need to work and are to ensure that what we do is done within the terms of the law and in a proportionate and fair manner.  We are looking at practical ways to better deal with that and how we document.  One of the issues that also arose was the element of communication between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are preparing our own set of information leaflets to make available to garda&iacute; in circumstances that arise as to how an investigation will progress.  We will be dependent on Garda co-operation to get that information to the garda&iacute; involved.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the fact that legal redress is available in the North.  I asked if GSOC had discussed this with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and asked for the same.  I also asked about disciplinary proceedings and sanctions.  At the moment, they are within the remit of the Garda Commissioner.  Should they be removed from her and structured in a different way?</p> <p>  I have two new questions.  On promotions, is GSOC aware of people being put forward for promotion who are under some form of investigation?  We are aware of one whistleblower who has complained of serious bullying by some members of the hierarchy in the station where he works.  Despite this, it seems to be continuing.  How can that be dealt with?  It is not being dealt with at present.  Does GSOC have any idea as to how best to deal with that problem?</p></speech>

I assume, therefore, that they have raised it with the T&aacute;naiste.  After that, I cannot say where it has gone.</p> <p>  On taking over the issue of discipline from the Garda Commissioner, that is a big issue.  To be frank, that is not a role we have had or which we have considered because it has been a matter for the Commissioner.  That is a whole new area and I am not going to go into it.  It is not something we have considered.  That is a matter for the Commissioner and the committee to examine.  We have not had a role other than in terms of bringing matters to a certain point and handing them over the Commissioner.  I go back to the core message which is that there must be some experience of management of discipline and controlling behaviour and misbehaviour.  If one farms everything out, where is that experience going to grow within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Those are the other concerns.  If one is going to have a disciplined force, which is an important aspect of any police force, it must, ultimately, discipline itself.</p><p>How to build that in is a real issue.  I do not think it is for us to say.  We have enough to deal with oversight.  The issue of discipline is for the Garda Commissioner unless the Oireachtas changes our role and gives us powers in terms of discipline regulations; we are not asking for them.</p><p> The issue of promotions is an internal matter.  If, for example, somebody is the subject of a complaint or is part of a complaint process, they do not notify us that they have sought promotion.  Again, we do not know how they get promoted and what matters are considered.  People have been promoted, but that is not something in which we are involved.  The information the Commissioner has and the decisions made are internal matters.  We deal with the complaint, the person and the process.  If during the course of that process, people die, people are promoted and people leave, those are matters that just happen.  However, we have no hand, act or part in them.</p><p> On bullying and whistleblowing, I am conscious - with four cases - not to go into particular matters.  In any protected disclosure in any workplace, clearly a person comes forward and puts themselves on the line.  Even while a matter is being investigated, things arise and that can be difficult to supervise and deal with in any workplace.  However, because these are new procedures, all employers, all workplaces and all workers are having to learn how best to deal with them.  We are new to the protected disclosure procedures.  We will learn and make mistakes in the process.  We will have to come back on it and we will make mistakes; the Garda will make mistakes.  That is not good enough, but it is a whole new process.</p></speech>

If, however, GSOC is looking at individuals who are about to be promoted by means of the internal process, does Ms Justice Ring not think that there should be a freeze on such promotions while those officers are under scrutiny by the commission?</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is known they were even under investigation by the people looking at promotions.  We are going back to Chinese walls; we just process it.

Much of what we have been discussing were responses to complaints made, including those relating to discipline, more serious criminal actions or even, in lesser situations, a reprimand within the system.  That is the fire-brigade response.  Is the genesis of all this not the absence within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na training process of the importance of respect and the right of members of the public to courtesy, and to be met fairly and equally across the board?  Although I have had the experience of being courteously received in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na barracks setting, many people say the first point of contact rarely, if ever, commences with "What can I do for you?  May I help you?"  That is not the experience of members of the public presenting at Garda stations.  It is simple courtesy to get off on the right note.</p> <p>  We are coming up to the tenth anniversary of GSOC in May of next year.  It is very appropriate that this is one of the issues we have highlighted for priority address.  This is not just about how GSOC has responded to its complainants' issues.  Does Ms Justice Ring have a view on how it has served the public interest in the wider context?  How is the role of GSOC regarded by individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with whom it has had to address specific issues and, perhaps even more importantly, how is the role of GSOC regarded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as a policing body?</p></speech>

Day in and day out, people have no complaint and we should not lose sight of that.  We have to remind ourselves in our organisation that because we deal with complaints not every experience is a bad experience; we are just seeing the people who are complaining about their experience.</p> <p>  I know the training has improved.  I have been in Templemore and seen what has been done in recent years.  I see great people down there with great intentions.  The downside of increasing numbers puts pressure on training.  There is a temptation to speed up the training.  There is a thought out practice for training new members and I would hate for the increased numbers to reduce that training period because it is thought out.  There are some very good people and they are looking at all aspects.</p> <p>  I heard the then Chief Superintendent McMahon talking about how someone failed an exercise because they showed no empathy.  They got the right answer, but it was a training exercise and they had no empathy in dealing with the member of the public who was part of the exercise.  The training has improved tremendously.  Good practices are being taught.  There are now mentors in stations.  In the past, someone might have arrived at a station and been told "Forget what you learned in Templemore.  This is where you'll really learn how to be a guard."  It has brought in mentors into the station to counter that attitude.  I would hope that in that regard the training is embedded.</p> <p>  In fairness to the Garda, the reduction in resources including numbers has brought greater pressures.  On a human level, we all perform better when we have resources and time and when there are fewer demands on us.  For a garda alone behind the counter in a station with the phone ringing and people outside, and where somebody who has been arrested is brought in, it can take a lot to say, as should be expected, "How may I help you?" because so many people are looking for attention.</p> <p>  Resourcing should allow for that relaxation, so to speak, and should allow for the proper responses.  That again goes back to discipline.  It is not a formal discipline, but a sergeant should pick up on a rude response or a lack of response and say "Look, I noted how you dealt with that member of the public.  You'll have to do better."  It should not be made a formal discipline issue; it is just good practice.  In the wider context of the Garda and GSOC, I would like to see a reduction in their work.</p><p>I would like to see that people do not come to us because they do not have cause, and that means more effort on the part of the Garda.</p><p> That would give us more time to deal with the serious matters.  The less time spent dealing with the service level the more time we have to deal with serious matters.  Whether it is the whistleblowers, incidents that happen out of road traffic incidents or whatever, we could deal with those more effectively and more efficiently.  It would also mean that because we are under less pressure we could engage more appropriately with the public and, hopefully, the members of the public would have greater trust in us to deal with its complaints because in the first instance the public would find its complaints were being dealt with by the appropriate personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a connected process.  Culture within police forces is difficult to change.  Whether it is North-South or across both bodies of water, it is a challenge.  It will not happen either with legislative change or overnight.</p></speech>

I want to update the committee on my Department&rsquo;s budgetary position in 2016 and to hear the committee's views ahead of budget 2017 on funding priorities for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  With an overall budget allocation of &euro;1.74 billion this year and a multi-annual capital commitment of &euro;10 billion over seven years as set out in capital plan, significant resources are being allocated to target investment in our transport network, to support the development of our tourism sector and to promote sport at all levels.  When we last met in June, we had a very useful discussion on the 2016 budget.  There have been quite a number of developments in the intervening period on which I will be happy to update the committee.  In terms of expenditure across the Department, I am pleased to note that we are spending ahead of target.  This is a direct result of excellent progress on major infrastructure investments such as Luas cross-city and good progress in addressing flood damage on our national and local roads.  On flood repairs, I expect to be back here before the end of the year with a formal request to channel the additional &euro;96 million for flood repairs to my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</p> <p>  It is clear that across all five programmes there are various pressure points in terms of funding this year.  It is a natural consequence as the economy emerges from the crisis that demands are growing for improvements to our existing transport system, particularly in terms of public transport provision, which is one sector that has suffered as a result of fiscal constraints.  Our roads programme is still catching up with the care and maintenance requirements that have built up over recent years.  I do not need to tell colleagues that the state of our roads is not what it should be, despite incremental increases in funding over recent years.  The public private partnership, PPP, roads programme represents a significant proportion of our roads investment, and I am pleased at the progress being made there.  The Department&rsquo;s maritime programme is relatively modest, but the investment, especially in the Coast Guard and Commissioners of Irish Lights, are vital to the safety of our seas.  The sports programme grew significantly this year given the additional resources required for the Olympic effort and also reflecting the significant enhancements under way at the national sports campus.  Tourism has continued to deliver increased numbers and revenue this year, and the modest State investment in this vital sector represents an excellent return.</p> <p>  Looking ahead to the budget, we have submitted an initial bid to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I am in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, about this.  Clearly, the overall financial pot or fiscal space available to Government is not adequate to satisfy all the competing demands of my Cabinet colleagues.  However, I am confident that the priorities I have identified and will identify for investment in the transport, tourism and sport sectors are required and that the budget will deliver increased funding for those vital sectors.  As we discuss each of the programmes individually, I will set out some of my priorities, many of which are well rehearsed and well known.  Equally, I am very interested to hear the committee&rsquo;s views on funding priorities for 2017 and beyond.</p> <p>  It is pretty timely that I am here today because yesterday morning I and the Department had our first meeting with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, about this.  It was one of a series of pre-budget meetings that we will be having in the next week or so.  If there is to be a real dialogue, I am very happy to take anything productive from this meeting to the meetings in the weeks ahead and see if we can include them in the Estimates process.</p> <p>  I will address the particular speaking points I have for the land transport issue.  As members know, land transport is by far the largest programme in the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  It represents 80% of the overall budget.  A large proportion of this is capital investment.  The main components of the programme are roads improvement and maintenance funding, with an overall budget of &euro;720 million, the public transport investment programme at &euro;347 million, and public service provision payments at &euro;250 million.  The programme also includes provision of &euro;13 million towards the smarter travel carbon reduction programme and operating costs of the national vehicle driver licensing system at &euro;15 million.  As mentioned at the outset, spend is ahead of target on this programme, mainly owing to the final phases of construction of Luas cross-city, which is very capital intensive, and the activities being undertaken at local authority level to repair flood damage, for which we have secured an additional &euro;96 million over and above the Department&rsquo;s budget allocation.</p> <p>  As the economy recovers, the demand for and associated costs of increased service level and quality grows.  Fiscal constraints over recent years have meant that the funding available for the land transport programme has fallen short of where it needs to be.  Addressing the projected growth in transport demand needs careful planning, analysis and investment.  While transport policy may be shifting towards dealing with growth rather than decline, the prudent fiscal regime in which we must operate dictates that funding for transport, like other capital hungry sectors, is likely to be more constrained than we would wish for some years to come.  The existing capital plan provides for a substantial increase in land transport over the six years of the plan, increasing from &euro;1 billion this year to almost &euro;2 billion in 2021.  This follows a significant period of underinvestment in our network during the financial crisis, which must be addressed.  The additional funding provided for roads, rail infrastructure and public transport investment in the plan will enable us to reach steady State funding levels by 2020 to ensure the existing infrastructure and rolling stock remain safe and fit for purpose.  Only at that point will we be in a position to begin delivering modest but important improvements to passenger transport users, the freight sector and private car users.  Funds are being allocated in 2016 to facilitate the ongoing construction of the new Luas cross-city line.  This major public transport project is being delivered within budget and is on schedule for completion in 2017, with passenger services scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2017.</p> <p>  Given competing demands across the system and the continuing need for restraint, the challenge is to maintain existing levels of funding for key programmes and seek modest increases where they are justified and represent value for money.  A key priority will be to ensure funding for public service obligations, including the rural transport programme, is at a level that the increased demand being placed on our public transport system can be met.  This year&rsquo;s budget provided for a 14% increase, or &euro;28 million, to support increased public transport services.  This increased funding has gone toward improving services and capacity to meet increasing demand as well as alleviating problems associated with congestion in our urban centres.  We are all aware that some service improvements, such as a ten-minute DART service, have not commenced as planned.  However, the additional money available to operators in 2016 has been a welcome boost and one which I hope to build upon for next year.  I expect this funding will be fully spent by year end.</p> <p>  Following a decision of the previous Government, funding for the repair of regional and local roads has been allocated to local authorities in two tranches.  The first tranche of &euro;85 million was allocated in February to help local authorities start repairs as quickly as possible.  The balance was held back and allocated in May to allow some time for the further investigation and evaluation of certain proposed works, for example on bridges.  To date, &euro;40 million has been drawn down in respect of repair works on regional and local roads already.  Separately, &euro;8 million has been allocated to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for repair works on national roads and a further &euro;8 million has been allocated to Irish Rail for repairs to the rail network.  The formal allocation of this funding to the Vote will be done by way of a Supplementary Estimate later in the year once Government is in a position to determine where savings elsewhere can be found to provide for this.</p> <p>  Land transport represents the largest portion of my Department&rsquo;s budget.  Since coming to this office, it is clear to me that despite the best efforts to find additional funding for our roads and public transport system, we are still operating well below international norms in terms of public investment in transport.  The Government's summer economic statement makes it clear that capital investment in infrastructure is a key priority over the coming years.  With a review scheduled next year on the capital plan, I am taking this opportunity to put down a clear marker that we require a step change in the level of investment in transport over the lifetime of this Government.  A strong evidence base has been established to support this investment.  It is also abundantly clear to anyone travelling the roads or rail network of the country and to anyone sitting in their cars on the M50 and other vital arteries into our urban centres that transport requires investment or it soon becomes a major impediment to economic recovery.</p><p>In that context, the key priorities for future funding for land transport are: bridging the steady-state shortfall on road and public transport, in other words, ensuring we maintain and protect the existing transport asset base and investments, particularly the road and rail networks; further improving public service obligation funding to keep pace with economic growth and enhance service provision in line with new capital investment; addressing bottlenecks and key congestion points in urban areas, particularly the greater Dublin area; and addressing the shortfall in capacity to meet emissions reduction targets by 2020 and beyond.</p><p> I will naturally be making a strong bid for additional funding in 2017, but this must be a long-term investment programme which will be sustained.  While I expect some competition from other capital-intensive areas, including housing, education and others, addressing the priorities I have set out will be key to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic recovery.</p></speech>

Is he satisfied that the amount allocated for the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in 2016 is adequate to ensure at least a steady state of repairs will be maintained on our regional and local road network?  The output targets for 2016 are lower than in 2015.  Why was this accepted, given the poor state of the regional and local road network?  The poor state of roads in County Louth, in particular, local roads, is of great concern to citizens.  The local council's policy seems to be that no repairs or maintenance will be carried out on small roads.  As agreed in the programme for Government, will the Minister, please, confirm when he intends to open applications for the CIS and the LIS?</p> <p>  I have raised this issue before.  I remind the Minister of the need for the Ardee bypass to be placed on a priority list of projects for 2016.  The N2 is the main route from Dublin to Derry and Ardee is an extreme bottleneck for travellers.  It is essential that it be bypassed, which would be of enormous benefit to businesses in Ardee and also to the residents.</p> <p>  Will the Minister to indicate what funds have been committed to joint projects with Northern Ireland.  In the light of Brexit, what is the status of committed funds for these projects?</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision to remove the derogation in respect of the 42-tonne weight limit for five-axle articulated vehicles.  The removal of this derogation is placing Irish hauliers at a distinct disadvantage with their European counterparts.</p></speech>

It is an appropriate time to have him before the committee to give an update on the budget for 2016.  I thank him for seeking our opinion on our priorities for the budget for 2017.</p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister spoke about incremental increases in the past couple of years in the maintenance requirements of regional roads.  However, the breakdown of the figures does not back up what he said.  There is a decrease in the Estimate in the allocation for national road improvements compared with the figure for 2015.  There is great concern about the condition of roads, to which the Minister alluded.  He spoke about being in a position in 2020 to meet a steady-state requirement.  For every year he pushes out making this investment it will require greater investment in 2020.  At a time when motor tax receipts are increasing, why is expenditure on roads decreasing?  People believe they pay motor tax to have appropriate and safe roads on which to travel.</p> <p>  The subvention for public transport has decreased significantly in recent years.  In private session, before the Minister came in, we discussed our work programme for the upcoming year.  The priority is our vision for public transport and how the State should support it.  The Minister has been quiet about his vision for public transport.  He is the main stakeholder in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, representatives of which are at the WRC this morning, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We have three State bodies that are all in a precarious financial position, possibly jeopardising their long-term viability, in two of which wage claims have been submitted.  In one instance there is industrial action which is causing widespread disruption to workers, students and others who use Dublin Bus services.  I would have expected the Minister to come here today, given his commitment in terms of how he will fund these bodies by way of subvention.</p> <p>  This is European Day without a Road Death, EDWARD.  Is the Minister happy that the Road Safety Authority is adequately funded to carry out its necessary work?  While it is not a funding issue, why do a number of key positions on the board of the authority remain to be filled?  Surely such an important body needs positions on the board to be filled by persons with the relevant competencies.  Why are we waiting for them to be filled?</p></speech>

There has been no increase in the allocation for this year.  The dire condition of roads throughout the State owing to the lack of funding in recent years is unbelievable.  The longer they are left without maintenance works the more expensive it will become in the long run.  While some local and regional roads might just need to be resurfaced, the longer we leave them without maintenance works the more expensive it will become.  I know that the Minister pointed to budget constraints, but given the neglect during the years, I hope he will prioritise the provision of funding for the maintenance and upkeep of regional and local roads, especially as regional areas suffered the worst effects of the recession.  Local authorities are literally doing patch-up work and will have to come back two months later to do it again.  It would be good for the Minister to focus on the provision of proper funding for the maintenance of local roads.</p><p> With regard to road safety agencies, would there be merit in giving additional funding to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in light of the increase in the number of road deaths?  The traffic corps has experienced a massive reduction in staff, etc.  I am aware that an increase in Garda numbers is planned for next year but given the increase in the number of road deaths, does the Minister believe it would be beneficial to increase funding for the RSA?</p><p> I asked about the sports capital programme and sports capital grants in a parliamentary question to the Minister.</p></speech>

The Minister made a statement recently but he should do everything in his power to encourage all the stakeholders to get around the table.  It is our public transport network.</p> <p>  Previous speakers raised the other issue to which I wanted to refer, namely, the matter of subvention, which has come to the fore since the Dublin bus strike action.  People would argue that Dublin Bus is heavily subsidised.  It is not when compared with other European countries.  The service in Lyon in France receives 79% state funding, while the figure for Barcelona in Spain is 61%.  Dublin receives the least amount at 27%.  If we are to build, expand and deliver a first-class public transport network, that subvention needs to be increased across the board.  The focus is on delivering first-class public transport.  I include in that disability access on our public transport network, which I have raised previously with the Minister.  That is a major bone of contention, not just for me but for every citizen across the State.  People in urban and rural areas are affected in that local buses drive off and leave people at the side of the road.  That is an issue which requires attention.  All of that can come from increased subvention, which will allow us build, enhance and expand our public transport network.  I hope the Minister has given a firm commitment to increase subvention.</p></speech>

I ask that because the feeling on the ground is that he will have to get off the fence, which he has been on for too long in recent weeks, and give the green light for real talks - not sham talks - with the Dublin Bus workers and their trade union representatives.  For real talks to take place, the Minister will need to open the cheque book because the issue of pay justice is firmly on the agenda.  In that context, I want to make some brief points on the issue of State subvention for public transport.</p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that in the context of Dublin Bus alone, the subvention has been slashed in recent years.  The figure for 2008 was &euro;86 million.  The figure for 2015 was &euro;58 million.  That is an incredible reduction.  I will pause because the Minister is having a word with his officials.  I will await his full attention.  In terms of what that has meant, it has resulted in high fares for the people of this city and throughout the country who use bus services, but also low pay for the workforce.  Low pay is subsidising that company.  These workers have not had a pay increase for eight years.  They have gone eight years without a single pay increase, as the Minister is well aware.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster referred to the fact that there is a very low level of subvention from the State for public transport.  Again, in the case of Dublin Bus it is 27%.  A survey was carried out in nine cities in Europe, some of which have been mentioned - London, Barcelona and others - in 2009 and 2010.  Dublin came bottom of the list.  We did not win any Olympic gold, silver or bronze medals in that particular context.  An important point is that those figures come from 2009, and the subvention has been cut further in the meantime.  I suspect it is less than 27% now, and possibly as low as 20%.  In order to bring Dublin up to the average, we would need a spend of &euro;200 million.  To bring the capital up to joint eighth position, level with the next city on ladder - London, which was second from bottom - we would need an investment of &euro;90 million.  We cannot talk here about marginal, incremental increases to the public service obligation and to the State subsidy for Dublin Bus and other public transport in this State.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  To return to my first point, the Minister needs to open his cheque book in regard to this issue and, if necessary, have a fight at Cabinet level with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Michael Noonan, because the State and the Government will be forced to do this.  Dublin Bus workers are determined.  They have a high level of public support and it is time for the Minister to get off the fence.  There is a need for real negotiations - not Mickey Mouse negotiations.  That involves pay justice for the workers, and it will be necessary to open the cheque book and significantly increase the level of public subvention.</p></speech>

He asked me if I was satisfied with the amount of funding going to local and regional roads.  I am not.  It is inadequate.  What we are getting for all roads, local or national, is inadequate.  We need more, particularly in terms of the figure I quoted in my opening remarks.  We will not get up to steady State levels until 2020.  That is unsatisfactory.  It is something which would be intolerable in normal circumstances but we are not in normal circumstances.  It is something we are already striving to overcome.  The bid we made in our negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday would reflect that dissatisfaction.  I do not expect that particular gap to be closed overnight because I understand the stringency that exists in respect of the public the finances.  To answer the Deputy's question, I am not happy.</p> <p>  On the regional and local roads budget, the 2015 regional and local capital Estimate of &euro;250.4 million was supplemented by the Government stimulus package in July 2015.  There has been a record of Supplementary Estimates on this, and on the flooding issue in particular, Supplementary Estimate money is coming for local and national roads - mostly for local roads - which will be reflected in the discussion when I come back looking for the ratification in respect of the approximately &euro;96 million involved.</p><p> A question was asked about A Fresh Start and Northern Ireland.  Neither of the two main projects - the A5 road and the Narrow Water bridge - is in any sense off the agenda.  The Deputy must realise that very little finance is available for them on either side of the Border.  That is the reality.  There is no provision in my Department for the &euro;25 million that has been allocated to one of the projects.  They are on the North-South Ministerial Council's agenda.  The council was due to meet in June, but that was postponed, so it will be on the agenda for the next meeting.  Officials are holding regular meetings and examining ways to progress the projects.  As the Deputy knows, both are jointly funded.  Neither Government has yet made the financial commitment to them that is necessary, but we will push for it.  I am due to meet my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Hazzard, on the fringes of the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting to address this particular problem.  It will probably be on the main agenda as well because the fact that the issue has been ongoing for so long is not satisfactory.</p><p> Regarding axles and weights, I am responsible for the derogation not being given again.  The reason was twofold, the first being infrastructure.  I was advised, and accepted that advice, that we were suffering as a result of the continuous use of these particular vehicles over a long period.  Second, I believe I am right in saying that it was in 2008 that the derogation was first given.  It may have been 2007.  That derogation was repeated every year since.  The drivers and the industry had been told on every occasion that they should prepare for the day, which was only a year away, that this would no longer be the case.  They have been given seven, eight or nine extensions of the derogation.  It was time to call a stop to it, and that is why I did it.</p><p> I hope that I have addressed Deputy Troy's points about local roads.  I agree that they are not adequately funded, but the reasons are self-explanatory.  We hope that there will be an increase next year and that we will have a steady state situation in four years' time.</p><p> Regarding the subvention, it has improved and I hope that it will continue improving in the years to come.  We certainly intend it to do so.  This was not an easy decision.  It was cut because of the overall problems in the public finances.  That has had an adverse effect on the three companies that were mentioned.  We intend to increase the subvention in the coming years.  It increased by 18% overall this year and we have put in for substantial increases next year.  There is no wish to cut it further.  The reasons had to do with the macroeconomy.</p><p> I will address the issue of the RSA before that of the industrial action.  If I may, I will take all of the industrial action questions together because they were fairly similar.  I would have no problem with taking further questions on it.</p><p> I was asked whether the RSA was funded adequately.  I am not aware of a particular demand from the RSA for the funds.  I was asked why there were unfilled places on the RSA's board.  I am considering the issue of departmental boards generally.  Some are too big.  Had I appointed the three members to the RSA - it is still under consideration - the RSA would have had a board of 12 members up to approximately two weeks ago, which is the same size as the boards of the Dublin Airport Authority, daa, and AIB.  It seemed to be getting top heavy.  I was going to examine whether it was necessary to have such a large board for what was a relatively small body.  It is a body with an important role to play, but I am not sure that it needs such a large board.  I am not sure that any of the boards in my Department need to be as big as they are.</p><p> The appointments system under the Public Appointments Service - forgive me, Chairman, but I must answer this question fully, because that is only fair to Deputy Troy - comes up with weird results.  The guidelines for appointing boards were necessarily reformed in November 2014 to avoid charges of politicians appointing people who were too close to them.  What happens now, as happened in the case of the RSA, is that boards are appointed after a process that I regard as inadequate.  Going from memory, I believe that approximately 60 people applied for the RSA positions as advertised.  The result of that application process was the Public Appointments Service, PAS, selecting 21 people to go to the Minister.  Those 21 were selected in a short time and, as far as I know, without any interview being conducted.  In such a situation, it is difficult for me to be expected to appoint three people out of the 21 names when I know little about them and they have not been interviewed or subjected to anything except a cross-checking of CVs.  I am considering other ways of selecting board members that do not put a Minister in the position of being confronted with people about whom he or she knows nothing and who have come through a process that does not include interviews or anything except very superficial checks.  This is the answer to the RSA question.  I am considering the issue in a broad way.  The RSA is one of those bodies that has not devised a solution.  It would be easier were there a further process and it was down to a minimum of two or three people, but the way that it is structured now - I will finish on this, as I do not want to labour the point, but it is important because it applies to other bodies under my Department - sees a large number of names coming to a Minister to be appointed in the dark.  I am considering how to structure the RSA's board.  I am not adverse to letting it have a few more members if expertise is necessary, but the process is flawed.</p><p> I am sorry, but there was a 13% increase in the PSO this year, not an 18% one.  I read that wrong.</p><p> Was it Deputy Barry or Deputy Munster next?</p></speech>

There have been Supplementary Estimates for road improvements every year.  The Deputy stated that they were not enough.  It is regrettable, but there must be Supplementary Estimates, given that the state of our roads is deteriorating.  Some &euro;96 million will be allocated for flooding this year.  Road improvement grants have been given.</p><p> I am not aware of any request for additional funding for the RSA.  It is one of the few bodies which have not been looking for a large amount of money.  In 2016 the authority's operating expenditure has been estimated at a figure of &euro;71.5 million while planning for a figure of &euro;73 million across the suite of public services it provides.  It is looking for very small amounts.  Except for one area, it does not get money from the State.  It is self-financing in performing its various functions, including driver licensing.  It looks after itself.  It washes its face and I am not aware of any request it has made for money.  </p><p> What was the Deputy's question on the number of road deaths?</p></speech>

The Minister might remember it coming into the spotlight.  According to the breakdown, there was an increase in capital funding for the MBRS.  In the light of this, does the Minister see any merit in increasing funding for the RSA, given the increase in the number of deaths?  We do not want to revert to the previous position.  I do not know if the Minister has met the RSA.</p></speech>

The running costs of the bureau in 2016 will be &euro;5 million.  Certainly, we would look favourably on it because of the added burden on the bureau in the coming months once the legislation is passed.

There are several ways to fund transport services.  All new buses that we buy are wheelchair friendly.  However, there are inadequacies in other areas, of which I am very well aware.  We have had exchanges in the D&aacute;il on this issue also.  I am very sympathetic in that regard.  I cannot say too much about the Estimates process, but I note that we have made a particularly strong bid to include a separate item in the Estimates on the accessibility of public transport.  I should not have said so, but I have.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Mick Barry for his contribution.  We are in the middle of a very sensitive time.  It is not just Dublin Bus that is involved in an industrial dispute.  This morning representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann are at the Workplace Relations Commission and the indictions are that the dispute will be intractable and difficult to resolve for both sides, the Government and everybody else.  I note that the Deputy says I should open the cheque book.  I am not going to do so.  It is something I have persistently said I will not do and I say it for several reasons.  I say it as much to management as I do to the trade unions.  Let us be clear that, whereas the emphasis has been on trade unions suggesting the State should open its cheque book, I do not want to see management of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann coming to me or assuming for one moment that the cheque book is going to be opened.  The Government's position has been clear that the issue must be settled between the two parties involved in every case.  The Deputy talked about the subvention being slashed.  He is absolutely right, but I regard it as a completely different issue.  The subvention is to increase next year, I hope, as it has increased this year, but it will be used to improve services as much as possible.  I am looking for a very healthy increase in the subvention, but to me that is a separate issue.  However, I take the Deputy's point on Ireland being very low.  He is right.  It is very low in the subvention league table and we are looking to get it higher.  However, it must be remembered that some of the capital funding also goes to these companies and that is not covered by the subvention.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy about the need to engage in real negotiations.  I have appealed to both sides to get to the table and do not understand why they do not.  I am not going to come and negotiate.  I am not going to ride in on a white horse in shining armour with a cheque book  and say I will solve the problem.  That would be exactly the wrong thing to do.  As everybody knows, this dispute will be resolved, but it is not going to be resolved if I participate in it in a way that will make things far worse.</p></speech>

Thankfully, the economy is in recovery.  If it is going to grow, items such as congestion are significant and should be addressed to have a better recovery.  Better use of transport is required.  To what extent will there be capacity to push out the capital funding envelope?  Transport and housing are two areas where a significant argument could be made for extra funding, particularly where congestion could be reduced.  Portugal and Spain, for example, have broken some European rules at a time when the interest rate is at 0% for capital investment purposes and sanctions do not appear to have been applied.  There is a significant argument to be made in the case of transport, particularly public transport, an area in which we will ultimately save money in the long term.  I note that we have climate change obligations which will cost us in hard cash and which, in turn, will prevent us from being able to invest in the very things that would lead to a reduction in emissions.</p> <p>  On the public service levy, I note that there are only a number of ways by which we can cover the cost of public transport, which include the payment of a subvention and an increase in fares.</p><p>There have been very significant increases in fares to the point where it is a big outlay for people in respect of getting to work.  The other issue is reducing or keeping wage rates low so subvention is important.  The Minister says that substantial increases have been sought.  What are those substantial increases?  Is he optimistic about that?  Where is it on his list of priorities?</p><p> The Minister says there are signs of improved financial performance in respect of the CIE group.  However, that is only the case if one measures the position against that which obtained in 2012.  In some of the documentation provided, he said that there are further medium and long-term challenges ahead.  That was a heavily redacted element of the documents.  I have never seen as much black ink put on a document.  I am trying to figure out what is actually being said in the critical areas.  What are the financial challenges.  I think this committee needs to know what are the substantial challenges ahead.  The Minister might elaborate on that.</p><p> I will not go back over the valid points raised in respect of roads.  It will cost us way more to remediate the roads if the amount of funding provided continues to be inadequate.  There is a point where it actually costs more not to invest.  Has that point been made to the Department of Finance in strong terms, particularly as we are at that point in respect of a certain proportion of roads in some parts of the country?</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned various large projects such as Luas cross-city in Dublin, which is necessary.  There are issues in other cities.  I would be very conscious of Galway city, where there is gridlock.  Companies are questioning whether to come to the city, which has done reasonably well in terms of jobs in recent years, because of gridlock and the lack of infrastructure on the outer urban bypass.</p> <p>  In respect of the policy of urban versus rural, I wish to refer to long-term planning.  The issue of broadband is not covered by this committee but it is one that will be solved in the coming years.  There is a need for infrastructure all over the country.  Where did we get this concept of urban versus rural?  We need a long-term plan regarding infrastructure in rural as well as urban areas.  The major motorway in the west of Ireland in recent would have been the Dublin-Galway road.  The Gort-Tuam road is up and running now but it needs to continue on to Sligo.  We need to reach a situation where rural Ireland is not effectively closed down.  Another issue concerns the regional airports.  I know the benefit of Ireland West Airport Knock at local level.  Rural Ireland is alive and well in some aspects but it is crying out for an expansion in infrastructure.  If we solve every transport issue in Dublin, it will mean that Dublin will expand more and everyone will be living on the east coast.  That is a situation which must not be allowed to develop.</p> <p>  I was interested in the Minister's comments about appointments to boards.  He more or less stated that previous appointments were made because the Ministers knew too much about the people applying.  The Minister seemed to suggest that he cannot appoint certain individuals because he does not know anything about them.  There should be a happy medium.  Every person has some political affiliation.  That fact should not be allowed to affect an individual's chances because, otherwise, no appointments will be made.  People who have been involved in politics in the past have lots of skills that should not be discounted.  Obviously, it should be done in a structured and correct way.</p> <p>  I may not be here when the sports section is discussed.  Will there be an announcement in the coming weeks about another sports capital programme?</p></speech>

It is a case of new horses for new courses.  I am concerned that the Minister is following the previous Government's outline regarding infrastructure development into the future.  Regional roads have been mentioned.  We all know there is a big problem.  I must bring to the Minister's attention the fact that more and more people are travelling long distances from rural areas to work.  This is why it is important that we provide more money for the upgrading and maintenance of these roads.  In saying that, I compliment our local authorities on the work they carry out but they have limited resources.  Perhaps the embargo on the employment of personnel could be reviewed in the case of some local authorities because it is no good having materials if we do not have manpower to do the work.</p> <p>  In respect of major infrastructure, much has been said about Dublin.  The western corridor must be fast-tracked.  It is fine saying that we have the Wild Atlantic Way when the weather is good and tourists visit but we must look after commerce and the economic growth of the western corridor.  This concerns the N20 upgrade from Cork to Dublin, and even to Mayo and Donegal for that matter.  We are not asking for a full roll-out of the motorway.  I am sure it can built like Legoland, that is, some of the major town bypass sections can be constructed.  Public private partnerships, PPPs, are in place.  Major work was done on the development of that motorway in respect of coming to the stage of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  Will all that be lost and will the Exchequer incur an additional cost when we get it up and running again?  We speak as politicians.  We said earlier that when we meet IBEC and the SMEs, we think they are talking about jobs.  The first item on their agenda is the infrastructure relating to our rural towns and major cities outside Dublin.  I include fast-tracking road access to the Jack Lynch Tunnel in this.</p> <p>  Much mention was made of the RSA.  This is about going forward but, in its current format, is the RSA functioning properly and within its statutory remit?  I am led to believe that sometimes a quorum on the board has not been achieved so how can the board perform properly if it is still operating under the terms of its establishment?</p> <p>  A previous speaker mentioned the local improvement schemes.  We know they have not been scrapped as such but the Department more or less told local authorities that it was up to them to provide funding for local improvement schemes.  This is not working because it is pitching one local authority member against another in determining how the funding is divided.  The Department should create a separate funding mechanism for local improvement schemes because many of the roads in question have three or four people living on them who might not have clout in the electoral area but whose well-being we should look after.  Could the Minister release the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, report in respect of the tonne restriction on five-axle vehicles so that we might have a further review of this derogation?</p></speech>

Iomp&oacute;idh m&eacute; ar an mB&eacute;arla anois.  T&aacute; m&eacute; n&iacute;os comporda&iacute; ag labhairt Gaeilge ach labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; B&eacute;arla.</p><p>I thank the Minister for attending the joint committee.  I have a couple of big points as well as one or two smaller ones I would like to ask him about.  The primary purpose of transport is to connect people and communities.  By doing so, one empowers them to create business, work together and socialise.  That is a key part of our primary purpose, but one must also look at urban versus rural areas, as some of our colleagues mentioned earlier.  The challenges facing urban areas are not necessarily the same as those facing rural areas because people may not be as closely knit.  Large industries and businesses want to locate in urban areas, not rural ones.</p><p> The Minister and ourselves have an obligation to have a balanced transport portfolio throughout Ireland.  Will the Minister update us on his thoughts, or the Department's thoughts, concerning rail connectivity to Dublin Airport?  Dublin is the only major capital city in Europe without direct rail access to its airport.  There is not much point in having discussions and spending a lot of money on consultants to look at an extra runway or terminal unless we can get those people out of that terminal.  Does the Minister have a view on the greater macroeconomic transport infrastructure in that regard?</p><p> My second point concerns rural Ireland and the comments by my colleague, Senator O'Mahony.  We are national parliamentarians and are not meant to be local, but I will refer to Galway because it is really important.  I ask the Minister and his departmental officials to examine the Galway bypass and work with Galway City Council and Galway County Council on this critical matter.  It takes me longer to go from Spiddal to the far side of Galway at the racecourse than from there to Dublin, so it is a huge issue.</p><p> There was a delegation here yesterday from Connemara and Galway County Council concerning the N59 connectivity to Clifden.  Earlier speakers referred to employment and unemployment.  There has been over 23% unemployment in Connemara for the past six or seven years.  God knows, many of them would love to keep their jobs at the salary level they had eight years ago if they could, but they have not.  It is a major issue in rural Ireland, so the Minister's Department is key to that transport infrastructure.</p><p> In Causeway in Kerry there is a small company called Dairymaster.  It is the third largest manufacturer of milking machines in the world.  There is a company in Cavan called ATA, whose chief executive officer, CEO, is Mr. Peter Cosgrove.  They are the largest manufacturer of tungsten carbide burs in the world.  That is what we have in Ireland.  Our assets are our people but they must have connectivity.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is critical to jobs, infrastructure and living in urban and rural Ireland.</p><p> In 2011, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, produced a national travel survey.  The summary of its results stated that people spend roughly eight hours per week travelling to and from work.  That is one full day per week spent commuting.  They estimate that the figure has now risen to ten hours per week, with 75% of those journeys by car.  One would need to analyse it to see why that is happening.  My figures, which are subject to correction because I only went through them last night, show that 4% of people travel to and from work by bus.  If that is a fact, we need to examine why that is the case.  We should analyse it scientifically and come up with a result.</p><p> As regards the effectiveness of boards, I have had the privilege of serving on a number of State boards.  There should be a review or audit mechanism every two or three years for State boards to see if they are still fit for purpose.  That is not to impugn the individuals on State boards.  Every individual on the State boards with which I have been involved was 110% committed.  They are not doing it for the money but because of their passion for and commitment to our country of which we are all very proud.</p><p> Many people are reluctant to work on State boards because of the responsibility and accountability involved under the various Companies Acts, particularly the most recent one.  There is also a perception that they could be tarnished if an issue arises concerning a State board, so that is a problem.</p></speech>

Would the departmental officials be willing to involve Oireachtas officials in discussions to the extent that the measures selected include ones that will assist us as parliamentarians in assessing performance?</p> <p>  My second question concerns some of the projects on the capital plan.  The Ballvourney-Macroom N22 road has not been mentioned, but it is an especially important piece of infrastructure for the entire south west.  I see no reason that road cannot go to tender in 2017 if the political will was there to prioritise it.  Will that road be prioritised and, if so, will funding be sought to send it to tender in 2017?</p></speech>

We are basically looking at the longer term.  I cannot say specifically what we are looking for in the subvention.  I will not do that, but we are certainly looking for substantial and meaningful increases in that.  It would be wrong, and foolish as well, for me to give the Deputy a figure but we are looking for substantial increases in the 2017 Estimates for the subvention.  The Deputy can take that as given.  However, the focus of any subvention, as I already told Deputy Barry, will be on services.  Let there be no ambiguity about that.  The focus will be for improved services and it would be wrong to speculate any further than that.</p> <p>  Am I optimistic?  Yes, I am optimistic about that.  There is a realisation in Government that there is a real need for transport.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said how vital transport and road infrastructure is to the economy and for jobs.  It is fortunate we have a Minister there who was in this particular post before, so he is aware of the needs as well as the importance of infrastructure.  That the Government is looking at such a high proportion of public expenditure as against income is a reflection of that.  It will be reflected in the coming years in a much larger proportion of spending coming to the transport portfolio.</p> <p>  As Deputy Murphy knows, there is a mid-term capital review next year.  It will examine a large number of projects and prioritise them, including the ones for Galway which were mentioned.  In answer to Deputy Murphy's question, therefore, it is a high priority for me.  I accept her point about the limited sources of income for transport companies.  We are talking about the public service obligation, PSO, fares.</p><p>I accept that and it has a very high priority for me.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy also asked a question about climate change.  The key priorities in my Department are to agree carbon reduction measures in transport and prepare the sector's contribution to the national mitigation plan for submission to the climate change advisory committee in the fourth quarter of 2016; to prepare, also in the fourth quarter, for public consultation a draft of a national climate change adaptation plan for the transport sector; to develop a national policy framework for an alternative transport fuels infrastructure for Ireland, including the preparation of a strategic environment assessment for public consultation and the transposition into Irish law by 18 November of the directive on the deployment of an alternative fuels infrastructure; to play a key role in the Government task force to agree additional measures to promote low-carbon emitting vehicles, for example, electric, hydrogen and gas-fuelled vehicles; and to represent the Department's position in national negotiations on climate change targets to 2030.  As the committee probably knows, the Department has a newly formed climate change unit which is working with key partners, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It is responsible for the development of a national policy on climate change mitigation and adaptation to ensure the transport sector can contribute to an effective transition to a low-carbon and resilient energy system by 2050. </p><p> On CIE's financial position, the CIE group recorded an improved financial position in 2015 when compared to the position in recent years and, in particular, the financial crisis in the group which occurred in 2012, to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  She also spoke about the challenges faced.  There are really serious challenges ahead.  My Department is working with CIE to devise a model that will allow the group to continue to meet its obligations and develop in a sustainable manner after 2016.  This model requires careful consideration and work is being done on it in close consultation with State agencies, the National Transport Authority and NewERA, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is a difficult financial period for all of the CIE companies, one which we monitor in the Department on a daily, if not an hourly, basis.  The increasing passenger numbers are an encouraging sign of the potential, if we can move people out of their cars and into public transport. </p><p> I sympathise with but not from a personal point of view and I am impressed by the arguments made by Senator John O'Mahony about rural transport services.  I have two colleagues in the group of which I am part who talk to me of little else.  The rural transport programme probably is addressing that issue and we are certainly making great efforts to try to improve the position in the next few years.  The Government is sympathetic.  In the conversations I have had with him, the Minister is certainly sympathetic to the fact that there is a lack of infrastructure in rural Ireland generally.  I do not think the problem is particular to Galway.  However, it certainly is reflected in what we are doing and how we are trying to address it. </p><p> On board appointments, Senator John O'Mahony has said everyone has a political affiliation.  I am not sure that is true, but I see the point he is making and think it has been well made.  There is, of course, a problem.  He says one sees people appointed who very obviously have political colours, which is obviously a big problem, or people whom one does not know at all apply and one also has a problem.  That indicates that both processes are flawed.  The first process which I think was abused by Ministers in the past left it open to them and they came under extreme pressure to appoint people from their own parties or with certain political loyalties.  That problem was not totally remedied, but the position was improved on by the guidelines of November 2014.  We now have a system about which I suspect people know very little.  I knew little about it until I came into the Department and discovered that Ministers had vast choices of people whom they did not know, about whom they did not know anything and who had not been properly screened.  That is the problem.  They are coming through on the basis of their CVs and without an interview.  In the case of the Irish Sports Council, for instance, with which the committee will probably be familiar - if I am wrong by a figure or two, please forgive me - I think there were more than 90 applicants for two places on the council.  The number of names before the Minister was 33.  How is a Minister supposed to decide who should be given the two places on the council?  The people in question have qualifications which match, but they have not been interviewed or selected in a forensic way.  That is my problem.  The position is identical in the case of the RSA and in other areas of my Department also.  I have in front of me 33 names to fill two places on the Irish Sports Council and I am sure they are all good people.  I do not have a clue and have no idea who I should choose.  I know one or two of the names.  I must say one of them was a very strong supporter of mine in the Seanad elections.  That is what happened and it makes it a very difficult choice for me.  I am confronted with deciding if choosing that person would be a good or a bad course of action.  Whatever I do will be be coloured by this.  We have problems, but we now have new one which in some ways are larger.</p><p> Shall I leave the question on the sports capital programme until we come to deal with the sports area?</p></speech>

As the committee probably knows, a review has been carried out.

I want to speak about it because I think a lot of people do not know about it.  It is a comprehensive document on the future of Irish Rail.</p><p>On 15 April, the Government considered the findings and conclusions of the strategic framework for land transport and agreed to my publishing the report.  The framework, which was based on a wide-ranging policy analysis exercise, aims to establish key principles and priorities to guide transport investment over the coming decades.  The steering group highlighted that rail is not financially sustainable and that value for money must be central to future rail policy.  I am not necessarily endorsing this, I am just telling the committee what happened.  One of the actions proposed is the development of a new rail policy to address the future role of rail transport in Ireland.  This policy is to be developed following a wide-ranging public consultation which will address key questions, including how to focus rail investment on where rail has or will have its greatest strength, reflect any social and environmental considerations uniquely addressed by the rail network in addition to securing value for money and affordable scale of network, considering the economic and investment context.</p><p> There is an important paragraph in the document which states that the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann undertook a review and evaluation of possible solutions to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's funding requirements.  This review is referred to as the rail review and looked at existing usage, transport needs, competition from other modes, wider associated benefits and financial constraints.  Analytical work involving reviewing the rail network in terms of the demand and the cost associated with each corridor savings from service-level reductions and costs of alternatives which would support the development of such a policy has been carried out.  That is a very important review.  I intend to release it in due course fairly soon.  I have not even finished it myself because I have only just received it.  I intend to publish it and let people read it shortly.</p><p> The Deputy also referred to local improvement and community schemes.  They were victims of cutbacks at one stage and local authorities were left to do the work themselves.  The programme for Government seeks the restoration of ring-fenced schemes of this sort.  That is also a matter that was under discussion yesterday and will be part of our Estimates process.</p></speech>

That is the advice I have just received.  I will check it for the Deputy.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that the airport connection is a big missing link.  The new metro north is obviously the long-term solution for that.  It is due to start in 2021 and not finish until 2026 or 2027, which is quite far out.  It is in the long-term capital programme out to 2035.  This will connect Dublin Airport and Swords to the city.  The cost will be &euro;2.4 billion, which is why it has been delayed.  It is probably unrealistic to seek an immediate result.  The Senator is right in saying that we have a real infrastructure there.  I spent much of the past 24 hours examining the problems of capacity at Dublin Airport, which he mentioned, and that with huge numbers coming in, it might get clogged up.  If it cannot accommodate the numbers we would like, tourism might be affected.  It may become more urgent to have transport facilities into the city.  There is not much point in passengers landing at the airport if they have difficulty getting out of it.  There is a real consciousness in the Department - and I have it now - that if funds become available, that would be a top priority.  The problem the Senator identified has been realised.  The issue is that it costs &euro;2.5 billion which we simply do not have it at the moment.  If funds become available, however, it would probably move more quickly up the queue.  In the meantime, arrangements are being made for a much more active bus service between the airport and the city.  It is something of which we are conscious but we cannot promise to do it early unless the funds become available.  If they do, it will be high up on the list.</p> <p>  I do not know where the Galway bypass stands in the queue.  I ask Mr. Mullaney to help me.</p></speech>

Some of them refuse to do it because they do not like being under the spotlight and do not like the kinds of controversies that emerge.  I will not be invidious here.  There are boards where people's attendance records are not adequate and that should be addressed.  That is at its most basic because I do not know what goes on behind closed boards when they are meeting or what homework they do.  There are boards where, very obviously, people are not attending properly and that should remedied by either replacing them or getting them to turn up.  I think the suggestion is a good one.</p> <p>  The Chairman talked about the officials to meet.  That should be fine.</p> <p>  There was a question on the Ballyvourney-Macroom road.

The Minister said he does not understand why the sham negotiations have stalled.  Organising public transport is not a doddle, understanding why the negations have stalled is.  These workers have had no pay increase for eight years.  They are being asked to negotiate on the idea of an 8.25% increase over the next three years, plus productivity, when they have already given two major productivity concessions in the past eight years. </p> <p>  Does the Minister not accept that, in those circumstances, no trade union worth its salt could negotiate a deal like that and that it is not and will not be acceptable?  With 13 days of strikes looming, those unions will come under increased pressure from their ranks to escalate if there are not real talks which go beyond an increase of 8.25% plus productivity.  If the Minister accepts that, does he not accept that there will be a need for talks which go beyond that and attempt, in a genuine way, to address the issue of pay justice?</p></speech>

He said he is making a play in the upcoming budget for a significant increase.  He also said it would be foolish for him to tell us what the increase would be.  It is foolish of the Minister and Department not to inform State bodies of what they can expect.  They should be in receipt of multi-annual budgets so they can plan for the future, rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  The Minister has failed to acknowledge that despite the cut in subvention over the past number of years, we have seen an increase in revenue, profits and passenger numbers for Dublin Bus.  Why did the NTA take &euro;2 million from Dublin Bus profits and state it was too profitable while at the same time restricting how Dublin Bus can negotiate in terms of the level of funding it will have in the future?  </p><p>The Minister is no longer a columnist with the <i>Sunday Independent</i>- he is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and has responsibility for Dublin Bus.  He can instruct it to go to the negotiation table again without setting any preconditions.  We heard from that the unions that they are willing to return to the negotiation table.  The Minister has a responsibility to the 400,000 people who rely on Dublin Bus on a daily basis, the bus drivers and the rest of those in Dublin city to whom the industrial dispute is causing significant disruption.</p></speech>

It is okay to blame local authorities and everything else, but our roads are in a bad way.  We need to get something done about local roads as a priority.

He then told us that the management has a role to play in regard to the efficiency of the company.  Can he outline to us where he thinks savings will be made in the context of those challenges in order to free up sufficient resources to meet the kind of demands that will be made in regard to the industrial relations issues that are currently in front of us?</p> <p>  I refer to the strategic framework investment plan, which the Minister mentioned in the context of rail.

I cannot paint more clearly than I have already done the need for increased funding for road maintenance for regional and local roads.  The Minister does not need me to tell him about the condition of many regional and local roads throughout the State.  It is high time that extra funding was provided so that communities across the State could benefit.</p> <p>  I refer to the Dublin Bus strike.  I know the Minister knows all the ins and outs of it and that it has been eight years since Dublin Bus workers had a pay increase.  He also knows that revenue, fares and passenger numbers have increased.  The only people who have not benefited from the upturn are the workers.  It is fair to say that the reason the strike action has escalated is because of the lack of negotiations.  There is a certain responsibility on the Minister to instruct Dublin Bus management.  It seems to be trying to play hardball, but it is responsible for the escalation of the strike action due to the fact that it is playing hardball and refusing to re-enter negotiations.  For the sake of our public network, workers and their rights, and customers who use Dublin Bus day in and day out there is an onus on the Minister to put pressure on Dublin Bus management to sit down around the table with all of the stakeholders and come to some agreement.</p></speech>

It will not help the situation if people try to draw the Minister into a battle with which he will not engage.</p> <p>  For me to comment on some of the issues raised by the Deputies will, I know, be interpreted as being involved in one way or another.  I will not say any more than I have already said in answer to questions about the dispute, except that I urge both parties to get together.

The aviation programme for this year has an allocation of &euro;26 million.  The key priority for investment in the programme over the short to medium term is to support the four regional airports, namely Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford.  The 2016 allocation to the regional airports programme represents an increase of 5%.  As members will know, two weeks ago I announced grant allocations of &euro;2.7 million under the airports programme for Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford.  The spend to date has been lower than profiled but the allocation will be fully spent by the end of the year, as has been the pattern to date in this programme.</p> <p>  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to provide additional support to the regional airports and I will be pursuing this with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  The sports programme is next.  2016 has been a good year for the funding of sport, with a 40% increase in the programme allocation.  The current allocation for Sport Ireland for 2016 is &euro;47 million, representing an increase of &euro;3 million which was allocated to assist the national governing bodies of sport and our high performance athletes.  Almost &euro;25 million is being provided for the development of the national sports campus, including completion of phase one of the national indoor arena.  Other major components of the programme are listed in the documents submitted to the committee.  I do not propose to read through them, given the time constraints.  My officials are confident that the sports programme will spend its full allocation this year.  </p> <p>  Tourism is the next programme.  Exchequer funding is critical to achieving the ambitions set out in the tourism policy document, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025.  2016 has already seen an additional investment of &euro;2 million in key elements of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's and Tourism Ireland's programmes, alongside continued capital investment for next year and beyond.  This additional funding is being used to enhance supports for the new experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air, to provide the funding needed for the Rugby World Cup 2023 bid and to increase overseas marketing activities in key destination markets.  2016 is the first year since 2008 in which funding for overseas tourism marketing activity increased.  This has provided a welcome injection to our overseas marketing campaigns.</p> <p>  Looking forward to 2017, I am confident that the success of the tourism sector in delivering revenue growth and jobs when other sectors were faltering during the crisis will underpin its position as a vital sector in Ireland's continuing recovery.  This means that further investment is required in our overseas marketing efforts which will restore Ireland's share of voice in our key overseas markets, particularly in the context of Brexit.  This also means investing in our tourism product, particularly our festivals, events and business tourism.  It also means continuing our efforts to build the capacity of tourism businesses.  In addition, the programme for Government makes a number of specific commitments on tourism, seeking to set aside &euro;100 million in additional capital funding for a variety of initiatives.  I am very keen to ensure that we target this funding where it will deliver the best bang over the lifetime of the Government.  Experience brands like the Wild Atlantic Way have been very successful.  We need to build on these, get the message and product right and also ensure that we do not overcrowd the market.</p></speech>

The &euro;2.7 million that was recently allocated to the regional airports is very welcome.  However, given that under EU state aid rules, grant aid can only be provided up to a maximum of 75%, is the Minister confident that the regional airports are in a position to generate the remaining 25% themselves in order to be able to draw down that funding?  In his speech, the Minister alluded to the "possible" draw down.  Will the regional airports have the capacity to draw down this much needed money?  In the event that they do not have such capacity, what is the Department's alternative plan to support the regional airports?  Allocating money to an airport which does not have the capacity to draw it down is about as useful as a tit on a bull, if the Minister does not mind me saying so.  I look forward to his reply on that matter.</p> <p>  There is no mention in the section on the aviation programme of the Dublin Airport Authority's proposal for a second runway, which is critically important.  The Minister alluded earlier to the capacity issues at Dublin Airport and I ask him to expand on that matter.  </p> <p>  Is the sports capital programme going ahead?  A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.  If it is going ahead, what is the relevant date?  How are we getting on with our bid for the Rugby World Cup?</p><p>On the tourism programme, recently Tourism Ireland sought tenders for the marketing of the lakelands as a third brand.  To my surprise, some of the counties with the greatest numbers of lakes were excluded from the tender documents.  What are the qualifying criteria to be met by the counties which will be promoted under the three main marketing brands, namely, the lakelands strategy, Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way?  Without a comprehensive marketing plan in each of the respective areas, the tourism sector will be challenged.</p></speech>

Will they be released this year or not until next year?  If no date has been set for their payment this year, will the money be carried forward to next year?  Has the money detailed in the subheads been spent on capital projects, given that the sports grants have not yet been released?</p> <p>  I stated the non-statutory inquiry into the Olympic Council of Ireland would be toothless, primarily because it did not have the power to compel witnesses to attend.  We have seen the dismissive, if not arrogant, approach taken to the Minister when he travelled to Rio de Janeiro.  If this attitude is anything to go by, a non-statutory inquiry will not extract the answers and information we need.  The Minister should have considered establishing a full statutory inquiry.  If we do not get to the bottom of the matter in a non-statutory inquiry and do not put measures in place to ensure it will never happen again, will the Minister commit to considering the establishment of a statutory inquiry?</p> <p>  On tourism, we speak about the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin city as being the most popular tourist sites.  The midlands and areas along the east coast do not receive the same attention to detail in terms of promotion.  Has the Minister met Tourism Ireland to discuss the possible consequences of a Brexit and how they might be pre-empted in promoting tourism on a cross-Border basis?</p></speech>

In this case, is the Minister examining using a different allocation method to fill the gaps that need to be filled rather than wait for applications to be submitted?  In June last year approval was sought for the construction of a national indoor arena, but it has not been forthcoming.  The IRFU will not proceed on a basis of uncertainty.  We received a heavily redacted briefing document.  I am surprised that the Department did this.  It makes it very difficult to figure out the critical issues involved.  Will the Minister outline them?</p> <p>  What is the Minister's attitude to the retention of the 9% VAT rate?  In the event that it is increased, will the Minister seek the income generated by it to be made available to the Department to be invested in tourism-related initiatives?  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is seeking a doubling of its allocation.  Is it intended to put a salary cap in place?  A new chief executive is to be recruited.  I am trying to get an idea of how the money might be spent.</p></speech>

Our athletes did not come back from the Olympic Games with extra medals, but using a weighted system does the Department believe their achievements across all events surpassed those in London in 2012 across, including cycling, track and field, swimming and diving?  Have we upped our standards and the results achieved?  Is there a timeframe for the proposal to establish a national sports policy?  For how long will the consultation process continue?  When does the Minister expect to see the end product?</p> <p>  With regard to the aviation sector, we do not seem to be making progress in the provision of flights from Boston to Cork.</p></speech>

Under the previous Government, I chaired an airport study group to consider what was needed.  Ireland West Airport Knock caters for more passengers than all of the other regional airports combined.  I welcome the recent allocation of funding.  Does the Minister plan to visit Ireland West Airport Knock?  If not, I extend an open invitation to see what is happening there.  It is a crucial link in the promotion of tourism in the west.</p> <p>  I am open to correction, but I understand the Olympic Council of Ireland received funding of &euro;1.2 million in the past two years.  During the recent controversy I heard that the Olympic Council of Ireland had cash reserves of &euro;2 million.  Given all that has happened, will its funding be reviewed?  Is it provided on an ongoing annual basis or in the approach to Olympic Games?  Will it be reviewed in the light of the size of its cash reserves and other events that have taken place?</p></speech>

We have one present who graced the fields for Mayo and helped Galway to win all-Ireland final championships.  We are in a poor position and at a critical juncture.  In 2012 Irish athletes won six medals at the London Olympics Games.  They included one gold, one silver and four bronze medals and resulted in Ireland being ranked 41st in the world.  In Rio de Janeiro Irish athletes won two silver medals.  Fair play to the O'Donovan brothers and Annalise Murphy for winning them.  Frankly, we are sliding very fast down the scale.  Will the Minister consider putting together a special task force, as was done in the United Kingdom, to fund the development of our elite athletes in order that they will have some chance?  I have mentored Olympic athletes and, God knows, to survive they went from foot to mouth.  Athletes from Denmark which is the same size as Munster won 15 medals in Rio de Janeiro, but our athletes won only two.  Athletes from New Zealand which has the same population as Ireland and a lower GNP won 19 metals in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>For the sake of our nation, I ask the Minister to consider putting a special effort into developing our Olympic efforts.</p><p> To follow on from what my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, said, I congratulate the Paralympians who will arrive back in Dublin today on winning 11 medals.  It is an unprecedented haul of medals and they have done fabulous work.  We, as a coiste, should acknowledge their achievement.</p></speech>

Drones are going to be very important but they provide great opportunities and huge risks.  Yesterday, I met the Irish Aviation Authority to discuss drones but in a slightly different context.  Can the Department tell me what strategy has it adopted for drones from a safety and business-opportunity perspective?  We need joined-up thinking on aviation education but I shall leave my comments at that.  I also strongly suggest retaining the 9% VAT rate for tourism.</p></speech>

Congratulations to Dundalk Football Club.  What it has achieved is fantastic.  The League of Ireland has not got the recognition it deserves and we are all very proud of the players.  I did not ignore the Deputy's invitation.  I am sorry that I did not go to Dundalk in the summer but I will do so.</p> <p>  Let me address the Brexit query and I will then deal with the sports capital issue.  There has been no knee-jerk reaction to Brexit but if there has been one, then it has probably been wrong.  I assure everyone that the Department and I are watching matters particularly closely in the context of tourism and the effects Brexit may have on it.  Tourism Ireland is engaging with the tourism industry on the implications of Brexit on overseas tourism to Ireland.  In July, a meeting was held with key industry representatives to assess the situation and a further meeting is due to take place in September.  I do not know of any immediate or dramatic reduction in bookings from the UK but that is to be expected.  I shall issue one warning.  There was a huge fall in the value of sterling as a result of Brexit and that will have some effect on the tourism industry here.  Currency rates are difficult to predict.  Just because the rate has fallen does not mean that sterling will remain permanently in that situation.  We are rather at the mercy of currencies.  Let us remember that all of the other surrounding European countries are in the same position.  Sterling has fallen in value against the euro so they are affected as well.  They will suffer the same loss of British tourists.  The people in Britain who want to go somewhere on holiday will experience difficulties in finding anywhere cheaper unless they travel outside the euro area.  I do not feel as depressed about this matters as some others.</p> <p>  Let me discuss the sports capital grants so that I can answer the questions for everybody.  Yesterday, I met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  Talks have taken place with my Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan.  He wrote to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 13 September seeking approval, during the Estimates campaign, to implement a commitment to sports capital grants by way of an annual round of the sports capital programme, with allocations each year of &euro;40 million beginning in 2017.  As members will know, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to allocate sports capital grants on an annualised basis.</p> <p>  Obviously, all Departments are currently engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of finalising the budget.  Once the Estimates process is completed, an announcement is expected in terms of a new round of the sports capital programme.  With almost &euro;100 million outstanding grants at the start of 2016, the focus this year has been on helping clubs with existing grants to draw down the outstanding ones.  As of mid-September, over &euro;17 million was paid out to clubs across the country.  I am confident we will make a positive announcement on these grants when the process is complete.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked we had done to simplify the process.  One of the big problems has always been the large number of invalid applications, which is intolerable.  There is quite a lot of action going on to prevent that from happening in the future.</p> <p>  In terms of future rounds, the programme of work is at an advanced stage on the design of the next round in order to simplify the online application process in order to make it user friendly for applicants.  Furthermore, the issue of the number of invalid applications was raised by a number of Deputies at the last select committee meeting on this topic.  To address these concerns, the Department is finalising proposals to amend the application process in order to minimise the number of invalid applications.  While some of the possible measures to achieve this objective may require further fine tuning and testing, the sports capital projects unit of my Department is committed to reducing the overall level of invalid applications.  We have responded to the many concerns on this issue.  We will respond in the weeks to come.  Members will see a marked difference in respect of both applications and the difficulties people understandably encounter.</p> <p>  It is no surprise that Deputy Troy asked a question about the midlands.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has just launched a tender to examine the option in this regard.  The objective is to complete a destination development and feasibility study to ascertain the potential for growth and the best mechanism to unlock those areas that lie between the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  It expects to award the tender at the end of the month.  In advance of the selection process, it is not possible to have a definitive timeline for completion but F&aacute;ilte Ireland is provisionally aiming for completion by the end of the year.  For clarity, any new brand territory would have a shared boundary with both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  In this context, areas of those counties that border the Shannon waterway on both sides are captured by the proposed study that is currently out to tender.  Indeed, depending on the recommendations arrived at, those businesses and communities along the Shannon may end up benefiting from the work of both brands.  There is no county excluded and it would be wrong to suggest that was the case.</p></speech>

Let me move on to the next question.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the capacity issues of a second runway.  The whole point of having a second runway is because the airport will need one to cope with an expected increase in the number of passengers over and above that which has already occurred.  There is no doubt that a second runway is essential.  In fact, as the Deputy probably knows, I took through Cabinet yesterday a review of capacity at the airports, particularly Dublin Airport, to look at the obvious pressures that will build in the years to come, even with a second runway.  There are all sorts of options that must be considered.  I brought the review forward from 2018 because of the critical situation at Dublin Airport at present, which is already affecting operations.  We will look at everything, including the option of a third terminal and other matters, that will allow tourists to come here in numbers.</p> <p>  The Rugby World Cup has reached candidate stage and we submitted an application on 30 June.  The candidates will be decided upon at the end of October and the final selection will be made in November 2017.</p><p>Then, the final selection will be made in November 2017.  We have made and we are making a strong bid for it to come to Ireland.  I hope we will all share the consequences and benefits if it does come.  I believe we have a good chance.  Only four nations are left in the bidding.  Let us keep our fingers crossed.</p><p> The next question was from Deputy Imelda Munster.</p></speech>

A question was asked about the Olympic Council of Ireland inquiry.  I do not think it is toothless and I will explain why.  We took a long time to consider whether to make it statutory or non-statutory, and it could have been either.  The reasons we went with the non-statutory option related to cost and time.  These factors were obviously going to be important.  We hope it is going to be cheaper and quicker as a result.  We would have to have gone to the D&aacute;il and we would not be starting until next week if we had gone the statutory route.  On top of that - I suppose this was the absolute deciding point - the three main parties that we expect to give evidence to the inquiry, namely, the OCI, PRO10 Sports Management and the third company, have all volunteered to participate, give evidence and produce any papers we want.  Therefore, we did not see any need at this stage for a statutory inquiry.  However, the judge who is in charge has the option of coming back and indicating that he believes it should be statutory, if he is being frustrated in any way.  We went that way because we do not know how far it will go and we do not know how big it is going to be.  We have the co-operation of the main parties involved and the judge has the option to go statutory.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy asked a question about the 9% VAT rate.  I think it has been a great success.  It has been a fantastic success and I think a change would be very unexpected.  I cannot predict what is going to happen in the budget and I will not do so, but I would be a great supporter of what has happened in the past and the benefits which the provision has given, especially to smaller hospitality units.  The benefits have been absolutely immeasurable.</p> <p>  I take the point that at this stage some bigger players may not need it any longer, in particular, the Dublin hotels.  However, it is difficult to separate one from the other.  What is really important is that the employment and benefits that have been given to the smaller hospitality areas should not be taken away.</p></speech>

The 9% rate also goes to fast food outlets, newspapers, hairdressers and cinemas.  It is actually far wider than restaurants and hotels.  I do not think that is entirely understood.</p></speech>

They are so important.  Deputy O'Keeffe and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh addressed the question of the results of the Olympics.  We heard how there were only two silver medals, but there were some pretty good performances as well.  Elsewhere, team Ireland had 14 top-ten finishes and 14 top-20 finishes.  I cannot remember the statistics but many of the competitors produced the best performances of their lifetimes.  I have no wish to denigrate their performances.  I can see the points made by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh but I do not want to denigrate their performances, because some of them did very well and just missed the medals.</p></speech>
