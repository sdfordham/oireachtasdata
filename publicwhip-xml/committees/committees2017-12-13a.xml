I request silence in the Gallery and within the committee when members are speaking.  I really hope everyone will respect that request; it is important that no matter what people say or how much disagreement there is, we allow them to speak.  We will not be speaking at length on any one matter because we agreed last week that we have had our debate on the substantive issues for the most part.</p><p>Obviously there will be some discussion but everyone must be reasonable about repetition, etc.  </p><p> I shall now deal with the usual matters.  The draft minutes for the meeting of 6 December have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  No. </p><p> We have received two items of correspondence.  Is it agreed that we note them?  Agreed. </p></speech>

She requested that the same privilege be accorded to her correspondence as was accorded to other witnesses that came before the committee.  At our last meeting a letter from the Danish ambassador was read into the record.  He took issue with what I believe was Ms McDermott's testimony.  She has requested that her clarification of certain issues be put on the record of the committee today.</p></speech>

The letter from Ms Liz McDermott of One Day More was about the rate of the terminations of pregnancies in Denmark and, therefore, it is not a matter for this committee.  We can only deal with issues that relate to Ireland.  The issues mentioned in the letter were read aloud by Deputy Mattie McGrath last week.  He read the entire contents of her letter so it is on the record.  I think that we should move on, if that is okay.</p></speech>

I think that the email that the committee received from Ms McDermott should be read aloud for the simple reason that the letter from the Danish ambassador was read into the record.  Ms McDermott's email also contains a clarification for Deputy Jonathan O'Brien who asked her to clarify a few issues.  She clarified everything in her email.  It would take approximately two minutes to read her  email again.</p></speech>

I have ruled on the matter and that is just the way it is.  In fairness, the letter is on the record and the matter related to Denmark.  I remind members that we have a lot of work to do today.  The letter is on the record and is available.  It forms part of our report because it is on the public record.  We need to move on.</p></speech>

Today, we will make decisions on the report of the Citizens' Assembly.  Our decisions will be reflected in a report that is due to be launched next Wednesday.  As agreed in our module report, we will go through the report starting with module 1 that deals with the constitutional issues.  Module 2 deals with the provisions in legislation and is where one can find the 13 reasons given to us by the assembly.  Module 3 deals with the ancillary recommendations.</p> <p>  Since 20 September we have discussed and analysed these issues in great detail.  Last week, members had an opportunity to put their overall views on the record.  I urge that there be little if any repetition and that we are as business-like as possible. </p> <p>  I will now start with the decision required for module 1.  We made a decision on 18 October not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full.  I now propose that we follow the procedure used by the assembly and consider whether to repeal Article 40.3.3&deg;.  In the context of today's list of amendments, and previous discussions that we have had pertain to that, we shall deal with motionNo. 1.  I ask Deputy Jan O'Sullivan to move the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#F02300"><p>I move motion No. 1:</p><blockquote>That, having regard to the decision of the Committee not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg; in full, the Committee recommend its repeal <i>simpliciter</i>. </blockquote> <p>I will not speak at length on my motion as we have a lot of votes to get through.  We have had extensive discussion with our legal adviser, and subsequently in public session, on the different options in terms of the types of wording that should be put before the people by way of referendum.  It is my view, and I think the view of others on this committee, that repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is the most clear way of dealing with the issue.  It is already the responsibility of the Legislature to legislate and, therefore, it is not  necessary to replace the wording.  The Citizens' Assembly has recommended, that the replacement wording be that the Legislature would legislate and to put that into the Constitution.  I think that would be confusing, it is unnecessary and all of the legal advice has suggested the same.  Putting any other kind of wording back into the Constitution would simply brings us back to what I view as an inappropriate dealing with the issue by way of the Constitution.  I feel that it should be dealt with by legislation.  I propose that we recommend repeal <i>simpliciter</i>as the wording to go before the people.</p></speech>

I am the Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and I had to attend a meeting of the committee.</p><p>Having heard and carefully considered the expert evidence before the committee, I shall vote against an inclusion of the words &quot;repeal <i>simpliciter</i>&quot;.  I call for a referendum to be held, as soon as reasonably practicable, to replace the eighth amendment in the Constitution and allow for terminations in the following cases: the real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman; the real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide; the serious risk to the physical health of the woman; the mental health of the woman; the health of the woman; pregnancy as a result of rape; and if the unborn child has a fatal foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.  Also, the referendum or legislation should include the following caveat - if it was passed at a referendum, any such legislation would be passed within six months by the D&aacute;il so that there are no delays.  </p><p>Finally, I believe, irrespective of what happens, that there should be decriminalisation of women who obtain a termination whether it is illegal or not.  </p></speech>

Is it agreed that we discuss them together?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#F02600"><p>I want to clarify that I am in favour of repealing based on legislation published in tandem with the referendum so that citizens clearly know what will replace the eighth amendment in the event of a question being put to the people of whether they wish to repeal or not.  It is for that reason that I do not favour repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  I believe that legislation needs to be published in tandem with any referendum that is put to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#F02700"><p>I only have an issue with the first part of the motion and the words: &quot;having regard to the decision of the Committee not to retain Article 40.3.3&deg;,&quot; which we voted on some weeks ago.  I suggest that we simplify Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's motion and say that the committee recommends the repeal <i>simpliciter</i>as outlined in the legal advice received by the committee and not refer to our previous Vote here.  Perhaps I am being pernickety about the matter.  I suggest that we have a stand-alone clear motion that does not refer to anything else that happened previously.  Maybe we should state that the term &quot;repeal <i>simpliciter</i>&quot; was used in our legal advice, which would tidy up the motion.</p><p>I wish to refer to the point made by my colleague, Deputy Naughton, about having legislation in tandem.</p><p>It is my personal view that we heard evidence that showed the difficulties with publishing legislation in tandem, including that it would be subject to amendment in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is my understanding the recommendations of the committee will go to the Department of Health and that it has the heads of a Bill ready to go, depending on what is included in the report.  That is happening, notwithstanding the fact that we heard, according to our legal advice, that there were slight issues with it in that it could be amended.  I wanted to make that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#G00200"><p>I would like to speak against Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's motion and in support of Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that the committee recommend that Article 40.3.3&deg; be retained in full.  Article 40.3.3&deg;, when passed in 1983, established Ireland as a beacon of human rights in this area.  It took decisions on this life and death issue away from the political and judicial elites and has led to a situation where Ireland consistently has the best medical practice.  Only today, we have news from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which reminds us that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world in which to have a baby.  Our figures are even better than those for Britain.  We have seen how in country after country, when this issue was given over to politicians, there was a steady liberalisation of the law.  Therefore, we are not just talking about a limited abortion regime but about an increasingly liberal one.  In repealing the eighth amendment <i>simpliciter</i>the people would be invited to trust that politicians would not continually liberalise the abortion regime more and more until we had a law similar to that in Britain, where four times as many abortions take place per year, <i>per capita</i>, according to the figures available to us.

It is essential that we make the decision as clear cut as possible.  Many of the difficulties, as advised by the people from whom we heard, arose from the fact that this issue was dealt with in the Constitution in the first place.  We heard evidence from health professionals that the eighth amendment was an impediment in doing their job and offering a full range of health care services to women.  For that reason, while I am not sure if a seconder is required, we will certainly second the amendment in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  We had discussions about the numbers of Irish women who travelled to England and I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to determine the numbers and that neither was it possible, therefore, to determine the actual rate of abortion for this country.  On the basis of the information given to us by health professionals and persons who are very eminent in their field, including legal professionals, the overwhelming evidence is that repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is what we should be recommending as a committee.</p></speech>

The best way we can reflect our support or opposition is by casting a vote.  With reference to Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's proposal that, while she is in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, there be an addendum to it, it would be better to separate it out.  If the committee agrees, in the body of the report there should be a recommendation that legislation or the heads of a Bill be published to reflect the views of the committee in order that, if a referendum is held, the public would have an idea of what the Oireachtas intended to legislate for.  However, attaching it to repeal <i>simpliciter </i>would not make repeal <i>simpliciter </i>very simple.</p></speech>

I will be supporting repeal <i>simpliciter</i>, but I also support Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's suggestion that the heads of a Bill be published in tandem with the referendum Bill in order that citizens would be aware of what they were voting on.  That would be wise and I suggest the report specifically request the Government and the Minister for Health to publish the heads of the Bill before the referendum.</p></speech>

We know from testimony that legislation is being prepared and that, in order for it to be facilitated, Article 40.3.3&deg; has to be removed from the Constitution.  I echo the points made.  We need to make the position clear and give some space for those who are in favour of legislation.</p></speech>

Essentially, the legislation will not be put to the people unless the referendum is carried.  That will be down to the public.  The legislation would just be to give an indication of what might follow.  We should include in the report that if that is what is done, that it be done without delay afterwards.  There is a concern that there would be a time gap.  I will be supporting the amendment in favour of repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Chairman on bringing us to this important day.  For those watching at home, this is an example of the Oireachtas doing its work properly.  I commend all members of the committee for their diligence.</p> <p>  I support the motion tabled by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  Like Deputies Lisa Chambers, Billy Kelleher and Hildegarde Naughton, I believe it is important that the heads of a Bill be published in tandem to indicate the intent of the Government because it is about ensuring there will be information available and a wide and sensible debate, if possible.</p></speech>

However, if we insist on the publication of legislation simultaneously in putting the referendum, we will be in danger of delaying it.  I asked the Taoiseach in the House today if he could give us a guarantee about the holding of an early referendum.  His reply was that he wanted to have a referendum held in May and that he would be asking all Members of the Oireachtas to co-operate in making sure that would happen.  Therefore, as we are up against time, repeal <i>simpliciter</i>is the best way to ensure that will happen.  We know from evidence that the heads of a Bill are being published.</p></speech>

A maternal death rate of 6.5 per 100,000, or one in every 15,301, is extremely low compared with a rate of 8.8 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom and 26.7 per 100,000 in the United States.  Figures published by Maternal Death Enquiry Ireland show that maternal deaths in Ireland are extremely rare and that the rate is marginally ahead of rates in the United Kingdom.  The data also show that 66% of maternal deaths were due to a pre-existing health condition, with heart disease being the leading cause of death.  Dr. Peter Boylan, chairperson of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who came before the committee, stated:</p><blockquote>These figures should offer reassurance about the high level of maternal care and the safety of the Irish maternity services for women and babies.  A maternal death rate of 6.5 per 100,000 or 1 in every 15,301 is extremely low and compares with a rate of 8.8 per 100,000 in the UK and a rate of 26.7 per 100,000 in the US.</blockquote> <p>As I have said all along, Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to have a baby, as confirmed by Dr. Boylan.  I will not support anything that will not retain Article 40.3.3&deg;.  I will be supporting Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that the committee recommend that the article be retained.</p></speech>

We will now move on to motion 3, in the name of Deputy O'Connell.  She has proposed a substitute motion 3, which encompasses the original motions 3, 4 and 5.  As no new issue is being raised in substitute motion 3, I am accepting it for consideration.  It will now be discussed with motions 4, 5, 7 to 9, inclusive and 10 to 17, inclusive, all of which deal with the risk to the life or health of the woman.  I should advise that if substitute motion 3 is accepted, motions 4, 5, 7 to 9, inclusive and 10 to 17, inclusive, cannot be moved.  Part of motion 9 is an exception to this.  I will deal with that later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#H03800"><p>I move motion 3:</p><blockquote>That the Committee recommend that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the life or health of the woman is at risk and that a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman. Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation &ndash; any assessment in relation to the termination of pregnancy where the life or the health of the woman is at risk be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.</blockquote> <p>I would like to explain the genesis of this motion.  As a committee, we were tasked with looking at the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Some 72% of members of the assembly voted to recommend that &quot;a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman&quot;.  That is why this motion mentions physical and mental health.  I understand that termination of pregnancy where the life of the woman is at risk was dealt with in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  This motion seeks to bring everything together.  I realise that members have concerns about health risks.  We heard extensively at this committee about individual cases in which the level of risk can be very low in the morning, but the woman's life can be in danger by the evening.  In order to deal with that, this motion provides that where the life or the health of the woman is at risk, this determination shall be made by no fewer than two specialist physicians.  The 2013 Act provides for a determination to be made by two or three physicians.  This committee has not heard of any case that has happened up to now in which a second or third physician has not been available to sign off on it.</p><p>I promise I will not go on all day.  It is important for members to understand what we mean by risk to the health of the woman.  Severe hypertension - blood pressure - can be difficult to control in the case of a pregnant woman.  It is often the case that when high blood pressure kicks in around the 20th or 22nd week, it gets to a point where the only way to rectify the problem is to deliver the child.  Severe hypertension, which is difficult to control, is often associated with kidney disease in the woman that is likely to deteriorate in pregnancy.  The outcome for the woman in such circumstances is often a stroke.</p><p>I would like members to think of a woman who has one, two or three children at home - I have three at home - and is going to have a fourth child, but who has hypertension at 23 weeks and faces the possibility of being rendered disabled and unable to communicate for the rest of her young life.  Often, diabetes can be more difficult to control during pregnancy.  There are also clotting disorders.  On its own, a clot in a leg is not a major problem, but if it becomes a pulmonary embolism, that is, a clot in the lung, it can pose a serious risk of stroke during the pregnancy if the pregnancy is not terminated.</p><p> Members may have concerns regarding gestational time limits.  The motion reads: "Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation".  I cannot understand how anyone could have any issue with that, given that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists comprises the experts in this field.</p><p> Generally, the issue of gestational age limits only applies to late diagnoses of foetal abnormality, for example, anencephaly, due to scanning being unavailable, which we have addressed in the ancillary recommendations.  If viability is reached, it is not regarded as an abortion, but a pre-term delivery.  Doctors always make every effort to save the baby's life.  Viability now sits at approximately 23 weeks.  Although survival rates are low at that gestational level and disability rates in survivors are high, we have maintained the lives of people born at 23 weeks.</p><p> I wish to reassure members that the health risk to the mother would be defined by two doctors and the gestational limits would be set by the doctors' governing or ethical bodies.</p></speech>

I have a formal proposal to make.  I do not agree that a single motion should deal with both life and health.  The committee has received evidence stating that simply being pregnant creates a risk to one's health, so it is important that we have the correct wording.  I would like to see the phrase "substantial risk to health" used.</p> <p>  My formal proposal is that motion 3 be subdivided into parts A and B, with part A reading: "That the committee recommends that termination of pregnancy be lawful where the life of the mother is at risk."  It takes into account the existence of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 and that this issue is catered for.  It is why a formal proposal on that ground was not submitted on behalf of Deputy Kelleher, Senator O'Sullivan and me.</p> <p>  Part B would read: "That the committee recommends the termination of pregnancy be lawful where the health of the woman is at a substantial risk" or "there is a substantial risk to the health of the woman".  The rest of the motion would remain the same.  I formally make this proposal.</p></speech>

It is not terribly different from the composite motion proposed by Deputy O'Connell.  The only difference is that not just legislation would be required, but also regulation through the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais.</p> <p>  If this composite motion is accepted, we should also recognise that there cannot be a delay in receiving medical opinion where there is a serious risk to health.  That matter could be included.</p></speech>

I respectfully disagree with Deputy Chambers, in that the evidence has been clear - we cannot grade risk.  That has been a consistent message from the medical experts who have presented to us.  For that reason, we should support the substitute motion 3.</p></speech>

That covers us, but I will continue to take comments from members.</p></speech>

From the evidence presented during the hearings and having regard to the rapidity with which a woman's health can deteriorate in a situation such as has been set out, what may well not be a serious risk at a particular time may be a progressive risk, with its progress rapid, so that by the time the risk is determined as being serious and action is taken - if it is presumed that the seriousness of the risk will determine at all times what happens - it may be too late to save either mother or baby.</p> <p>  We have had this debate and I respect the point made by my colleague, but it is important that we remember something.  If we recall the evidence that we heard, cases were referred to in which there was a rapid decline in the health of the mother.  Either that rapid decline was not spotted in time or, if it was, it was impossible to do anything about it because it happened so quickly that no difference could be made.</p> <p>  In the interests of the health and safety of the woman and, for that matter, the child, it is better that action be taken earlier rather than later.  That is the evidence that was adduced in the Citizens' Assembly's hearings and at this committee.  That is the best medical evidence.  In order to ensure that we do not have equivocation, we need to attach to the motion the most serious element that can happen in a particular case.</p> <p>  We should be conscious of the points raised by Deputy O'Connell regarding medical conditions and the degree to which a woman's condition and, consequently, that of the baby yet to be born can deteriorate.</p></speech>

I apologise if I was not clear.  I am trying to separate the life and physical health elements into two separate votes.  Deputy Kelleher, Senator O'Sullivan and I have motion 10, which deals with risk to health, so we have no difficulty in that regard.  In the interests of clarity, however, and given that the first vote that the Citizens' Assembly took was just on the life element and that we have legislation on that point,-----</p></speech>

This is despite the fact that the ground has shifted in this area.  When we heard evidence about mental health, we were reminded that there was no evidence associating abortion with improvements in mental health for women and that there was some evidence of a low to moderate increased risk to women's mental health in certain cases.  That has led to calls for a change to the approach in Britain, even among those who support abortion as a right generally, so as not to link abortion with mental health as a ground.  That was not challenged before this committee.</p><p>Linking mental health with physical health, in effect, seeks to bring in abortion on demand under the pretext of a therapeutic intervention.  </p><p> On the question of physical health, we have heard no evidence at this committee that the health of any woman was compromised by the requirements of the settled law of Ireland.  That is a fact.  We have heard no evidence that any doctor was ever pursued by the criminal law for having made an appropriate therapeutic intervention that resulted in the loss of the life of an unborn child.  The reason for that is as follows.  Under the settled law of Ireland the threat to a woman's life does not have to be imminent.  Several times Deputy Durkan has mentioned cases where people have died.  I would like to hear what he is talking about because the settled law of Ireland has not compromised anybody's life.</p></speech>

First, it is known that the requirement in Britain to have the signatures of two doctors has been widely flouted on occasion.  There is evidence, and needless to say this committee did not seek the evidence, of pre-signed letters of authorisation from doctors.  That is a chilling reminder of how this law can easily be abused.</p> <p>  Second, references to best available medical evidence is a euphemism.  The people, who this committee considers vectors of the best available medical evidence, spoke in terms of requiring abortion on request.  In fact, their evidence always operated to reject distinctions between health grounds and a more general dealing with abortion on the grounds of a request.  In one particularly chilling case we heard doctors speak in a very blas&eacute; fashion about late term abortions and that we should not be distracted by late term abortions of children even for a trivial reason like a cleft palate. </p></speech>

I support Deputy O'Connell's motion.  There may have been a little disagreement over the requirement for two specialist positions but one would not die in a ditch for it.  Her motion brings together several of the grounds which, if accepted, would not allow for us to subsequently vote on the reasons because the reasons would then be accepted.  One of the recommendations is to link physical and mental health.  I support what Senator Gavan said about the gradation of risks.  All of the medical evidence suggests that one cannot grade risk as it is a fluid and moving thing.  I think we should be guided by the doctors and nurses on this matter.</p> <p>  On a point of clarification, An Bord Altranais was abolished and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland was created. </p></speech>

I have an issue with the way the motions are grouped because my two motions are excluded even though they seek to include socio-economic as a health ground.  We have heard lots of evidence about how some countries and jurisdictions, that have access to abortion on health grounds, also include socio-economic but do not name it as a ground.</p> <p>  I fear at this point that people do not understand how class, being in a minority group or being disadvantaged and suffering deprivation can have an impact.  Sometimes these matters only come to light after the 12-week period.  I hope the up to 12-week provision captures most of the women who might find themselves in this situation because of their socio-economic status.  However, it does not mean that their socio-economic status will not affect them in their 14th or 15th week of pregnancy.  They may find themselves on the street at any stage of their pregnancy.  Their parents may have put them out of the family home because of the pregnancy.  Perhaps the pregnant woman is unable to access supports or the father of her unborn child may have abandoned her.  Loads of socio-economic stuff can come up after the 12th week of pregnancy.  I hope that we could incorporate socio-economic under the health ground like other jurisdictions do.  A vote on Deputy O'Connell's motion will totally rule out our consideration of socio-economic as a health ground.  Can we address the matter?</p> <p>  I know that the socio-economic reason is recognised as a ground later on.  I feel people are a little fearful to name socio-economic as a ground.  I thought that people would be more susceptible to encompassing it as a health ground instead.  </p></speech>

I made them having dealt with individual cases and not just sparsely but in recent times.  All of the medical attention was available but it was not enough to help people determine when was the right time to intervene.  It is critical, regardless of whatever intervention taken place, that recognition is given to the fact that both the mother and the baby are at risk at the same time.  I mean an intervention, not necessarily to terminate the life of either.  The time it takes to provide the medical assistance that is required can range between half an hour and two hours.  It is important for me to emphasise that lives can be lost in that period.</p></speech>

It is basically, "That the Committee recommends that a termination of pregnancy be lawful where there is a real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman."  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Now we will move on to reason 2.  There is an amendment in the name of Deputy Mattie McGrath, motion 6.  I will allow Deputy McGrath to move the motion.</p></speech>

The evidence adduced at the 2013 Oireachtas hearings on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 re suicidality and mental health remains relevant.  Abortion is not a viable treatment for suicidality.  We heard that.  That is my amendment.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that there was substantial evidence before the health committee in 2013, including from suicide prevention experts who recommended against suicide as a grounds.  There have been substantial and evidence-based claims that this is not an evidence-based ground for abortion.  Certainly, there was evidence from psychiatric experts before this committee which appears to distance the majority of the psychiatric medical profession from this whole business of providing for abortion on the grounds of a threat of suicide.</p> <p>  While I accept that the committee's apparent will to see abortion legalised as a matter of right on demand will make the issue moot anyway, I support Deputy Mattie McGrath's proposal that we reject this use of suicide as a ground.</p> <p>  I should note in passing as well that a small, but significant, number of children have died as a result of this invocation of a threat to life.  It does not make sense in terms of evidence-based medicine.  It never did.  It certainly is a major injustice to the children involved.</p> <p>  It certainly does not make sense in terms of suicide prevention.  If one thinks of any other situation where a threat of suicide would lead to a particular fulfilment of a demand, it is easy to see why this was bad law to begin with.</p></speech>

In particular, this would also facilitate the issue around rape.  We have heard substantial evidence that suggests it would not be possible to legislate directly for terminations in the context of rape.  There are varying views in the committee but I think the overwhelming evidence and legal advice is that it would be impractical to legislate for that purpose.  A further factor would be the time constraints surrounding the necessary proofs if rape was provided for as a standalone ground in legislation.  Overall, this would facilitate many of the issues surrounding that complexity-----</p></speech>

This would address the complexity involved in defining that particular issue which was identified during the committee hearings.  Further, this would be without restriction, so no reason would be required up to 12 weeks.  We also provide that this would be a GP-led service.  We heard evidence that many women and young girls are taking abortive pills that are purchased online through the Internet.  They are delivered by An Post to this country and consumed to carry out a termination.  This happens without any health or GP oversight.</p><p>Having listened to the evidence of the Irish College of General Practitioners and others I think it is important that there would be some medical oversight that would ensure there was quality control in other words and that where women or girls procure a termination by abortive pills it would be done<b></b>in their best interests.  That is the purpose of the amendment and I hope it gets broad support.</p></speech>

I am fully supportive of the motion tabled by Deputies Kelleher and Lisa Chambers and Senator Ned O'Sullivan but I have a couple of issues with it on a technical level.  The intention is to have a GP-led service.  What about a case where somebody in a rural area does not want the local GP to know and presents at a Dublin maternity hospital?  Could we amend the motion to say a GP or hospital doctor could deal with it?  Perhaps I am wrong but I do not see any mention of termination tablets or oral medication.</p></speech>

The reason I changed my original motion to 12 weeks was to allow for variations in menstrual cycle length but also to encompass a change in the drug licensing laws.  The morning after pill in this country was licensed for 72 hours and now we have a version available for five days.  That changed in recent times.  I just do not want the motion to be in any way restrictive if something developed.  We could include medical doctor rather than GP to cover cases where somebody presents at a hospital.  I accept what Deputy Kelleher said about the doctor making the decision and that is fine, but also that it would be determined by licensing practice.</p></speech>

In relation to the GP-led service, I have no major difficulty with including a reference to a medical doctor but the reason the motion is drafted in this way is in recognition and acceptance of the fact that people are ordering medical abortion pills online.  As Deputy Kelleher stated, they are being delivered by An Post in this jurisdiction.  That is happening and the evidence we have is that this could pose a risk to the life or health of the woman who is taking it and who, because of the current legal status, may be afraid to seek help if it is needed.  By making it a GP-led service there will be medical oversight by qualified persons, which we are not.  I am not a qualified person so I am reluctant to stray too far into the medical aspects of the issue.  It is a matter for the Minister for Health to prepare legislation and for the consultants and doctors working in this area to deal with that in more detail.  The reason we use the phrase "without restriction as to reason" is that we have issues around rape and incest and other such complexities.  Perhaps it is possible to legislate but it would be extremely difficult.  I tend to think it is almost impossible to legislate based on the evidence that has been put before the committee.</p> <p>  The reason we say "up to a limit of 12 weeks" is based on the evidence that was given to the committee and I went on to the Women on Web website where it states that it is available up to 12 weeks.  I assume that what is on the website is put up there by the doctors running it.  I have no difficulty in adding in "medical doctor" but the idea is that it would be a localised service done by a GP.</p></speech>

We could say, "The committee recommends in view of the complexities of legislating for a termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape and incest that it would be more appropriate to deal with this issue by making the termination of pregnancy lawful, with no restriction as to reason up to a gestation limit of up to 12 weeks through a GP-led service or delivered in a clinical context and determined by law and licensing practice in Ireland."  Is that agreeable to members?  I will come back to those who have indicated.</p></speech>

I think it is a very sensitive issue and we need to be careful.  If we put a 12-week limit on a request for an abortion in the case of rape or incest we may well be excluding a whole cohort of women.  We are going through a period now where Women&rsquo;s Aid have 16 days of drawing our attention to the question of domestic violence and we are seeing programmes on the television in the home.  The Rape Crisis Centre gave a presentation recently in Dublin City Council.  There is a whole cohort of women who live in abusive relationships who are scared to come forward to look after their own health while they are caught in that abuse and while they are caught in that trap.  It may take more than 12 weeks for them to get out of that space.  It could be 16 weeks or 18 weeks.  If we limit access to 12 weeks then we are doing some of the most vulnerable, done down, badly treated women in society a huge disservice.  That includes women who are victims of incest who get pregnant as a result.  Again, we are looking at an extremely difficult situation to get out of both mentally, physically and financially and it may be that they are the ones who are in need of the late abortions more than anything else.  We are conflating two things about the use of the abortion pill up to 12 weeks and the very serious nature of rape and incest.</p></speech>

I agree with you, Chair.  I would like to cover rape and incest.  We heard from Tom O'Malley of the difficulties around proving rape and all that entails such as court cases and delays.  It is also important to address the fact that abortion pills are widely available and unregulated with no medical oversight.  The incorporation of the line suggested by Deputy O'Connell into the motion, to the effect that it would be done in a clinical context determined by law and licensing practices, could perhaps cover the medical abortion pill.  I think that would cover it all.  My understanding is that it is safe to take the abortion pill up to ten or 12 weeks.</p></speech>

If the licensing period is ten weeks, we have got to future-proof to some degree, even if there is a doubt about that.</p> <p>  We are conflating issues.  I had a motion, 27, stating termination of pregnancy should be lawful with no restriction as to reason, up to a gestational limit of 12 weeks.  That was to capture quite a lot of factors.  I had another amendment on circumstances where there is a surgical abortion rather than a medical one and on decriminalisation.  Several factors can get rolled in together.</p></speech>

There will be primary care centres that may well have nurses prescribing who are educated to degree level.  We have got to capture that and not overly restrict what can be done.  I take the point that is being made.  The witnesses from Holland were quite useful in this regard.  In their jurisdiction, they have a 12-week limit but they drew attention, in particular, to the fact that those who tend to present later, where there has been rape or incest, for example, tend to be younger.  The delegates from Holland outlined how they dealt with a combination of factors, as in a rape accompanied by distress and mental health issues or, perhaps, a physical health issue where somebody very young is involved.  One can proceed by separating the two factors but I am concerned that we are trying to capture everything in one measure.  I am not opposed to it but I would rather see us dealing with each separately.  The amendment on the clinical aspect is a good additional one.</p></speech>

I do not believe I have ever done it.</p> <p>  To me, this is a very distressing proposal.  Motion 18 does not state "in view of the difficulties with regulating the online purchase of abortion pills".  The substance is "because it is difficult to legislate for termination of pregnancy for reasons of rape or incest".  I get why many good people are conflicted about those cases.  They are very heart-rending and difficult but there is something reminiscent of the judgment of Solomon about proposing that, since they are so complex to deal with, we should therefore propose that a much wider category of unborn children may be legally killed.  If one examines the law in Britain, one notes that the vast majority of Britain's staggering number of abortions per year, which is nearly 200,000, take place in the period up to 12 weeks, as I understand it.</p> <p>  At meetings of this committee, we never examined the size of an unborn child at 12 weeks, or just under.  As far as I know, we never looked at any images of an abortion.  I believe Deputy Mattie McGrath invited people to inform themselves at some level but the committee did not do so.  I do not even know whether the people proposing this could tell us or discuss in detail the size or developmental stage of the little creature whose legal right to exist is proposed to be dismissed here.  There is no difference between a surgical abortion and a medical abortion considering the impact on the unborn baby.  We have what I would regard as a really distressing proposal.  It is harder to imagine a better example of how politicians can lose sight of the humanity of unborn children through this whole process.  As I have said before, if one asks people the situations in which one can take away the right of unborn children, the answer seems to be, "more and more, actually."</p> <p>  This is a very disturbing proposal.  It is for abortion on demand.  Having no restriction as to reason effectively means that if a person asks for an abortion, she gets it.  I am not clear from the wording whether it is intended that the general practitioner would prescribe the pills or whether they would have to be taken in a general practitioner's surgery but I do know there is no child under 12 weeks in the womb who would have the right to the protection of the law if the Irish people were to take this on board.  It is a staggering proposal and I urge people to reconsider it.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of points.  People are confused about why we are here.  We are not drafting legislation; we are issuing guidance to the Oireachtas to draft legislation.  The idea that some people raised, namely, that our vote on this would be misinterpreted as a statement that there should be terminations in cases of rape only up to 12 weeks, does not reflect what anybody is saying.  A way of dealing with this is to take the vote on the Citizens' Assembly recommendation first.  I would imagine that it will be carried on its own.  It does not imply a restriction regarding any limit in cases of rape.  We should then consider the motion on the period of 12 weeks without any restrictions as to reason.  For some, a termination will be because of rape.  For others, there will be other reasons.  So be it; that is the motion.  That will deal with the matter so we will not just be cutting off access to terminations in cases of rape at 12 weeks.</p></speech>

However, there is no heartbeat at three weeks.  Obviously, from the moment the sperm and the egg fuse the genetic material is there for all of us to have existed, but there is no heartbeat.  At seven weeks there is a pulsating tube, from the evidence I have read.  It is unfair to suggest that occurs at three weeks.</p></speech>

Evidence before the committee included a harrowing account of the legal situation that families find themselves in, where an individual spoke about suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because she was not provided with services here in her own country.  For me personally, this is a matter the pregnant woman, in conjunction with her family, doctor, partner and those close to her, to decide for themselves.  It should not be limited in law.</p></speech>

If Deputy Kelleher, Deputy Chambers and Senator O'Sullivan were up for this, we could insert a wording based on the evidence we heard from Dr. Peter Thompson on the issues around the diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality.  He spoke of two doctors acting in good faith.  I wonder if we could put something like that in here.  If a woman's baby is diagnosed with a severe fatal foetal abnormality, she would definitely want a second opinion, I would imagine.  We have already spoken about two doctors in a previous motion.  If we could mention two doctors acting in good faith, I think it covers the issues around fatal foetal abnormality not being a defined medical term.</p><p>Any time there is a medical intervention as such, it is important the phrase "in good faith" is used.  It is a matter for the committee.</p></speech>

However, I think we are becoming overly prescriptive in an area where legislation will be required thereafter.  We are tying the hands of the Legislature.  This is requesting a compassionate way of dealing with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality.  To do anything beyond that would make it difficult for legislators to address.</p></speech>

I think, however, where there might be any conflict or difficulty, the actual reason above is simple and does not tie legislators down.  There may be some dispute over what does and does not constitute a medical diagnosis.</p> <p>  It was unfortunate that many of those who sit around this table and call themselves pro-life did not stay to hear the testimony of Mr. Gerry Edwards and Ms Claire Cullen-Delsol from Terminations for Medical Reasons Ireland.</p> <p>  Reason 10 covers this.  I am not sure we need the motion.  Reason 10 is much clearer and simpler in its language.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy O'Connell as I do not see it tying the hands of the Oireachtas.  I am open to this and will support her amendment.  Any parents would welcome having two specialists giving them expert advice.</p></speech>

This amendment does not preclude that happening.  What we are saying is that we will not be deciding but for the Legislature to decide who will make the recommendation and how it will work in practice.  We are indicating and making recommendations.  It is guidance.  That is why it is left without being too specific because we do not know what the impact of that could be in terms of legislating.  It would be easier to leave this out.</p></speech>

It became increasingly obvious that what people were looking for was not just the permission for the termination of pregnancy where a child's condition could be said to be fatal such that they would not live long after birth.  We also heard medical people saying there should not be a closed list.  This seemed to me to veer quickly into very much a case of severe disability grounds.</p> <p>  Second, this is one of these areas where, almost by definition, one is talking about the termination of the life of an unborn child late in pregnancy.  We heard from different people.</p> <p>  I was here for the group Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to.

For example, in a world where we are supposed to be defending, in terms of human rights, the rights of people with disabilities, it is inappropriate to have a separate category of abortion precisely for people with disabilities simply because they are severe.</p></speech>

There are people, such as Martin and Sin&eacute;ad McBreen, who some of us would have liked the committee to have heard, who received a different story to what the reality turned out to be.  There are also the fears of people that there is a culture in this world where doctors, instead of saying they will help and support people, as well as providing perinatal hospice facilities, abandon people to the cold logic of choice.  In turn, it creates a world where more and more people will feel that such babies are not to be accorded a legal and social welcome.  It is difficult and harrowing.  We can offer people something much better by saying we will accompany them and give them every love and support but that we will also honour the very sick child until their natural end. </p></speech>

These are extreme situations in which people find themselves and are very unexpected.  On most occasions, it is even more distressing because it involves a baby who was wanted and all the positive things that go with that.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly was straightforward.  I do not have an issue with the one as it is presented.  It is covered one way or the other.  It cannot be diagnosed earlier.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

I am disappointed with the use of the term "fatal foetal abnormality" because the HSE has issued guidelines around this.  We had that debate with some of our invited guests here.  I believe it is a crude term.</p><p>I have met many people and families who have had that diagnosis and had full gestation with a baby born that lived for a considerable time.  One girl I know in Cavan is up to 11 years of age.  I have met numbers of them.  It is crude language to put in for that reason.  I am totally opposed to it.</p></speech>

This relates to when the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.  We have two proposals, one of which counters the other.  We will dispose of motion 22 first.  The question is: "That the committee recommends that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful without gestational limits in cases of significant foetal abnormality."  The motion is in the names of Deputy Smith and Senator Ruane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#U01300"><p>I take the point that other Deputies have made to the effect that we are not being prescriptive about legislation.  We are not drafting legislation here.  These are simply recommendations.  I take the point that the Citizens' Assembly recommendation deals with the matter.  However, I have been approached by parents who have asked me to try to get this through without gestational limits.  This is why the recommendation was put forward.  The idea is to show compassion to people who have been through the experience.  They want to know that the gestational limits will not apply to them.</p> <p>  Having listened to the evidence of all witnesses I believe those provisions that put the woman and family at the centre of a case of desperation or a crisis pregnancy are absolutely the way to go.  The choice that a person might make in such a circumstance will be difficult.  It would not be easy and it would not be done without consulting many medical experts.  I assume we all understand that in the context of the motion.</p> <p>  I wish we lived in a society that really cared for those who suffer disadvantage and disability and those who are most vulnerable, but we do not.  We have not even ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities yet.</p> <p>  Recently, we watched the terrible tragedy of carers and the situation that they are left in for years.  Often this abides for their entire lives.  They are neglected by the State and not given proper respite care.  There is extraordinary disadvantage for people in society.  I only wish those who care passionately about the unborn cared even a fraction as much about those who are born.</p></speech>

We have not set gestational periods on any other recommendation relating to health and fatal foetal abnormalities, apart from the limit of up to 12 weeks.</p> <p>  Earlier, Senator Mullen spoke about a category of people.  He said people with disabilities are a category of people and that we are looking to introduce abortion because they are a category of people.  What he says is true: people with disabilities are a category of people.  They also want access to bodily autonomy.  People with disability need access.</p> <p>  We look at all the different situations.  We have heard so many times that there are as many situations as there are pregnancies that end up in a given situation.  Perhaps a woman is in a family where there are already children with disability.  Perhaps she has several children or none.  Perhaps she has no support or resources.  Bringing a child that has a severe anomaly into the world can bring a major pressure on the family and a person's health.  I believe that we need to remove the gestational limits in respect of severe or significant foetal abnormalities, as we have done with all the other health grounds.</p></speech>

I would like to think that my career demonstrates a consistent vision of seeking to protect human dignity and seeking a society that goes the extra mile in terms of dispersal of public funds and so on.  This means reaching out and supporting people with disability in particular.  If Deputy Smith's comments were in any way directed at me, I would like to show her my record sometime.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the business of the recommendation on a child with a significant abnormality.  We spoke a good deal about children with Down's syndrome.  Of course, they are only one category of children with disability or abnormality, but they are children who are particularly well-known and loved in Ireland.  We did not hear evidence on it, but eventually we got evidence about how in Britain over 90% of children who are scanned and found to have Down's syndrome are aborted.  I believe the figure is the same in Netherlands.  The corresponding figure is up to 97% or 98% in Denmark, with only four children being born.  From my perspective, any child with a foetal abnormality deserves extra love, care and protection from society.  The test of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable members.  It is a really tragic development if there is a whole category of human beings who, because they are more vulnerable than the rest of us, are singled out to ensure they have fewer rights at any stage of pregnancy.</p><p>That is the journey that has been taken in the western world.  We heard Dr. Thompson invite us to disregard the fact that in certain cases children with something as minor as a cleft palate might be aborted up to birth, which is the law in Britain.  It was chilling testimony.  However, it does not matter if it is severe or not so severe because what the child needs is protection and what the family needs is support.

There are two motions, which counter one another.  Motion 24 is that the committee would recommend that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful on socio-economic grounds, with a gestational limit determined by the woman in consultation with a doctor.  This is in the name of Senator Ruane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#V01000"><p>I move motion No. 24:</p><blockquote>That the committee would recommend that the termination of pregnancy should be lawful on socio-economic grounds, with a gestational limit determined by the woman in consultation with a doctor</blockquote> <p>Although this is now a standalone ground, it is hard to speak to it without acknowledging how the majority of the committee voted on the woman's health ground.  I struggle to understand how people can separate a woman's health from her socio-economic status or her living conditions, whether poverty, domestic violence, homelessness, prostitution or otherwise.  Her socio-economic circumstances are one of the main reasons a woman will seek to access abortion and 70% of the Citizens' Assembly voted in favour of allowing it.  If termination is not permitted on socio-economic grounds, this would highlight to me that access to abortion remains a class issue.  Although we will cater for many women up to 12 weeks, many women will not be able to access a doctor or perhaps not even know they are pregnant until that time has elapsed.  I worked with hundreds of people in addiction for years.  Some of the women did not have periods for years due to the damage to their body.  However, they became pregnant and nearly six months had elapsed before they realised it.  Given how a woman's social situation impacts on her health, this should be allowed as a ground to access abortion.  Women from more affluent areas who do not not meet the requirements or do not get to the doctor or find out that they are pregnant before the 12 weeks have elapsed will still be able to travel.  If we deny women the right to an abortion on socio-economic grounds, we are saying that we do not care about women who are in less favourable conditions.  </p></speech>

Many people have spoken to me about the socio-economic ground as if it is only a financial issue.  The suggestions is that these women just do not have enough money for an extra child.  People do not really understand the impact of class on a woman's situation.  It is not always about finances.  There is a multitude of factors.  I hoped this would pass as an indicator under the health ground, but it did not.  However, I hope people will reconsider their position on the socio-economic ground when voting on this recommendation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-12-13a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017121300002#V01300"><p>I would first like to note that the Citizens' Assembly spontaneously raised this matter.  It did not arise from the guidance of the chairperson, Ms Justice Laffoy.  It came from the body of the floor at the Citizens' Assembly where 72% were in favour of it.  This recognises and reiterates the consistent evidence we heard over the past three months from various witnesses, the latest being those from the Netherlands.  When I asked what weight they would give to what we call socio-economic grounds - I think they called them social reasons - they kind of looked at me as if I was nuts because, to them, of course it was a big reason.  It was obviously a clear reason to them.  I am not interpreting anything from their looks but the attitude was almost why would one not consider a person's social and economic background.  Senator Ruane touches on something really important here.  If we recognise that abortion is a reality for women already in Ireland, except we export it, we also have to recognise that so many more women did not have access to it because of their class situation.  This is a class issue.  Some 92% of terminations happen in the first 12 weeks.  The pill can deal with it, which is a great step forward.  In future laws, perhaps we can recognise it.  However, it would be great if the committee would take on board the evidence and the recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly and have that as a reason to be put to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

However, we need to be careful about how it is presented.  In reality, these things are, by definition, being recommended by the committee up to 12 weeks in the earlier motion passed, which is in effect abortion on demand up to 12 weeks.  In not voting for these today, the committee is not recommending allowing abortion on socio-economic grounds or for significant foetal abnormality after 12 weeks.  However, even there, the committee is just saying, "not for now" because it has already voted to propose the repeal of the eighth amendment.  The committee is saying that is does not recommend to our legislators to propose this now, but the public needs to know that it is certainly on the agenda for later.  I oppose this.</p></speech>

It voted on the criteria and it then looked at gestational limits.  We have already agreed to provide access to terminations without restriction as to reason up to 12 weeks, and that is going to cater for the overwhelming majority of Irish women who need to access a termination.  In that sense, it is important to make that point.  However, I agree with the speakers putting forward the motion.  We are talking about small numbers here but the issues of class and economics are very important considerations.  I think the gestational limits should be extended to incorporate those people and that we would not restrict it in that way.</p></speech>

I am comfortable with the previous one but I have a difficulty with this one in that I think it is moving from medical to surgical abortion.  I feel more comfortable making the distinction and having a gestational limit.  I will not support it from that point of view.</p></speech>

That does not meant there are no medical guidelines or best practice.  If that needs to be put in at the end, so be it.  Deputy O'Connell's first motion, which we voted on, stated "Provision for gestational time limits for the termination of pregnancies be guided by the best available medical evidence and be provided for in legislation".</p></speech>

I would be far more comfortable if that was decided by somebody.  As somebody who is very much a believer in choice, the choice of the woman, I have a difficulty with this, from a viability point of view.  I understand these are women on the margins of society with whom some of us, through our other jobs, have come into contact with.  Deputy Ruane is correct that people are sometimes six months pregnant before they realise it.  However, I think that if something can go in to include a gestational limit, I could at least not vote against it.</p></speech>

If that was the case then we could go back through the Citizens' Assembly recommendations and start voting on the gestational time limits for each recommendation.  That is not what we have done.  If there is a vote, it should be just on the question that it would be lawful to access a termination of pregnancy with no restriction as to reasons.</p></speech>

Later on, the statement refers to making the termination of pregnancy lawful with no restriction of reason to a gestational period of 12 weeks.  I am slightly concerned that those who are framing the legislation may interpret that as no restriction if one is going to say one was raped or suffered incest.  I want this committee to say whether they mean that or do they mean no restriction up to 12 weeks?</p></speech>

I do not think it is the particular wording.  At every single meeting that we have had here, the issue of decriminalisation came up.  Virtually every speaker, with maybe a few exceptions, so practically everyone who had varying views on abortion, believe that women and their doctors should not be criminalised for it.  Obviously, the Oireachtas when it is legislating is going to define the legal circumstances in which abortion can be carried out.  Outside of that however, the activity should not be criminalised.  I think we can get agreement on that and write it up in the report.  We do not need to vote on any of them.  They are all trying to do the same thing.</p></speech>

There is broad consensus in regard to decriminalisation.  I had some concerns with the decriminalisation in all circumstances because that might encompass that which is outside of the law.  I know that is not the intention.  If we are  looking at motions 34 and 35, I think those kind of crystallise and I do not think that they contradict anything that Deputy Daly is saying.  We could go for those.  They are clearer.  Some of it is implicit but maybe we should be clear on it.</p></speech>

That is the area we were focusing on and it is purposely drafted so as to avoid allowing free rein to pop-up clinics or rogue doctors or abusive partners.  We are not removing them from the full sanction of the law.  However, we are removing the woman who procures an abortion from being criminalised.  It specifically references also the 14 year prison sentence or up to 14 years.  In my view, that motion encompasses all of the concerns that we raised at committee.  It deals with just the woman and it specifically references the evidence that we have heard and the 14 year sentence that we want to get away from.</p></speech>

There is a difference between being prosecuted and being convicted.  There is a difference between being convicted and being punished.  I make all of those points because I do not know if Deputy Kelleher was referring to all in the room when he said we all know what we want.  I want to make it clear that I oppose this agenda to decriminalise abortion.  The reason I do so is not because I ever want to see any woman targeted by the law but because the law exists not just to punish its breaches.  It exists also to deter people from doing something that is harmful to themselves and others.  What people seem to be saying here is, in the context where the committee is proposing to look for abortion effectively on demand - I do not need to say effectively but abortion on demand up to 12 weeks - is that any doctor who does it outside of a licensed clinical setting would be prosecuted.  However, it seems to be the view that there would be no criminal sanction for any woman who would ever try at any stage of pregnancy, or no breach of the criminal law I should say.  Even in Britain, which effectively has abortion on demand and late-term abortion on demand, abortion remains a criminal offence.</p><p>It is not prosecuted where some of the A, B, C, D and E grounds are met.  This would be a charter for rogue doctors.  This turns a blind eye to the fact that those who procure abortions for themselves end the life of an innocent child and, in many cases, cause hurt or potential hurt to themselves.</p><p> People seem to think that this is the only way in which one can prevent women from being fearful about going for medical care - I have heard this view canvassed - if they have procured an abortion pill and taken it.  However, it is possible to have laws in this country which guarantee that a person who seeks medical assistance will not be criminalised by reason of any offence which the person discloses to have committed in the course of seeking that medical care and it would be bad public policy to decriminalise abortion.  What I am saying to some degree makes no sense in the context of a committee that wants abortion but I draw the committee's attention to the British situation where it remains a criminal offence.  If one wants to even maintain the fig leaf of a desire to keep abortions to as few as possible, one certainly does not start by decriminalising it.</p></speech>

I would agree with the motion of Deputies Kelleher and Lisa Chambers and Senator Ned O'Sullivan, motion 37.  My only concern would be to add something in because of the chilling effect the witnesses - the medical experts who appeared before the committee - spoke about.  They are qualified medical professionals who act in good faith.  I strongly believe they need some kind of cover or protection in that.  I completely agree with what was said about the woman, but we should add in that in the context of the chilling effect that exists for the medical professions.  It is important that we include that.</p></speech>

I interject because the clerk and Deputy Clare Daly have come up with a motion that may work.  Sometimes we have discussed matters and come up with motions, which is a helpful way to do it.  It is:</p><blockquote>That the Committee recommend that surgical terminations may only be legally carried out in a hospital or licensed clinic, and that medical terminations should be provided for through the licensing of medications for that purpose and prescribed by a qualified practitioner.

I see it in a way where we are recommending a range of changes.  What are the scenarios where one makes that legal and how does one protect both women and doctors, mainly from somebody, for instance, who has been struck off the medical register, setting up and being in an unregulated environment that becomes a risk to the woman?  It is the kind of thing that the medical profession would rightly frown on.  It is actually turning it around a little bit.  It is saying these are the settings in which terminations can legally occur.</p> <p>  There probably is one other thing, and motion 36 captures it to some degree.  One cannot have somebody guilty either.  I was not trying to capture everything.  I was putting in some motions about my thinking but there would have been other ones I supported as well.</p></speech>

What about where a woman's circumstances do not fall under any of the legislation and she might need to travel?  There will still be women who travel and there will be doctors who need to be able to support and refer those women.  There are other parts of it that need to be decriminalised.  It also has implications for family members.  At present, in many cases, family members are the ones who access abortion pills for their daughters and there are many who will still be criminalised under those three headings.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with aspects of other motions, but they are far too generalised.  The limited discussion we had on them showed no significant degree of consideration of the primary rights of parents.  I do not see a reference to them in any of the motions tabled.  I make it clear that while I have no issue with, for example, the legality of the use of non-abortifacient contraception, I will have no truck with the motions which come as part of an abortion package.</p><p>They are an attempt by the committee to cloak its very damaging recommendations in some kind of respectability associated with showing some kind of public responsibility.  I want to make that clear.  I do thank the Chairman and those on the committee.  I accept that Deputy O'Brien did not wish to be disrespectful in the way that he said that.  To judge from the attitude of the Gallery though, it was taken up in a different way.  I think that is regrettable.  That is all I had to say.  </p></speech>

On sex education, contraception and reproductive health, we heard it over and over again.  There was an underlying factor in all of their presentations, that there was a lack of education and a lack of understanding and a lack of communication from the Departments of Health, Education and Skill and others.  It is amazing that Senator Mullen's colleague, Deputy McGrath, is actually leaving here to go and talk about social media whereas in actual fact it is all to do with communications.  It was one of the main parts that was missing through all of the presentations here.  What has been put here is not underlying our cloaking an abortion regime.  It is actually trying to protect the future education of our children.  It is a protection for society going forward.  It is to enhance the mobility for parents, educators and the Department of Health is what we are looking for here.  As a female and as a committee member who has sat here as the mother of three children, I implore that every one of these recommendations be put in as an auxiliary into the report.  Take them all in one vote if need be.</p></speech>

I really do think he is doing an injustice to his fellow Oireachtas members by the broad sweep with which he casts us all aside as being involved in some kind of a cover-up now for the work we have done.  We have done our work in good faith, every one of us here including Senator Mullen.  How dare he imply that I or any other member here has a less valid point of view to argue and that we should be ashamed of what we have agreed here or voted on, whether we were for or against.  We did our job according to our lights and according to the remit that we were given.  I just have to say that I object to this.  Is Senator Mullen worried about contraception?  If he is against contraception and wants to row back the clock on that one, let him come out and say it.  Let him not attack us.</p></speech>

I had indicated Chairman.  I have no objection to taking all of the ancillary recommendations together.  I do have concern around motion 47 and clarification if can be given.  It says that "the committee recommend that improvement should be made to counselling and support facilities for pregnant woman".  I have no issue with that.  It goes on to say that "in the case where a woman seeks a termination of pregnancy, a seven day consideration and supportive counselling period is advised".  If it is only advice, I do not have an issue.  If it is going to be a mandatory cooling off period, then I do have an issue and I will be looking for a vote on it.</p></speech>
